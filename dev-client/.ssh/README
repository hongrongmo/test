This configuration works with recent versions of OpenSSH that don't require
netcat for jump host tunneling. 

In general, it will open a connection to the
"bastion host" EC2 instance, then open another connection from the client 
system to the target within the VPC (anything that can be accessed by the 
bastion host). Targets can be specified by IP address, amazonaws.com hostname
or alias. 

The ".ssh" directory (hidden from ls without the "-a" option) should be copied
into the user's home directory. Private keys for AWS access (not provided here)
should be copied into "<user home directory>/.ssh". Permissions on the .ssh
directory should be set to 700 (only accessible by the owner; "rwx------") and
the files inside it should be set to 600 (r/w for owner; "rw-------").

From the user's home directory, the commands 
"chmod 700 .ssh" 
and 
"chmod 600 .ssh/*" 
should do that. 

If the file/directory permissions are too open, the client will protect the 
user from him/her/itself by refusing to make connections.
