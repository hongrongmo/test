		1. When is full text available?<a name="q1" id="q1"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Availability of full-text varies depending on which databases you search, the content to which your company or institution subscribes, and what is
		available for free on the web.<br/>
		<br/> Abstract and Index (A&amp;I) databases such as Compendex, Inspec, GeoBase, and others consist of abstract records, not full-text articles.
		Full-text links on Engineering Village bring you from bibliographic information in A&amp;I databases to publishers' sites where, if the article is
		available for free or if you have subscription access to a particular journal through your library, you will automatically get the full-text. If you do
		not have access, the links will take you to the publishers' site where you can purchase that article. Records in Engineering Village may not include a
		full-text link if the article is available only in print, if the publisher has provided inconsistent metadata, or if the publisher does not submit their
		publications to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crossref.org" title="Learn more about CrossRef (opens in a new window)">CrossRef</a> linking system.<br/>
		<br/> In addition, Engineering Village is compatible with all major link resolvers, including SFX, which help customers manage entitlement and
		appropriate copies. This ensures that users are directed to the version of the article they have access to through their libraries or institutions.<br/>
		<br/> Full-text is included for all electronic books in the Referex database, as well as for patent documents in the Ei Patents database.

	<p align="left" class="style5">
		2. How can I obtain a full text document is it is not available to me?<a name="q2" id="q2"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Full-text links in Engineering Village will take you to the publishers' site where you can purchase that article if you do not have access to it through
		a library subscription.<br/>
		<br/> Records in Engineering Village may not include a full-text link if the article is available only in print, if the publisher has provided
		inconsistent metadata, or if the publisher does not submit their publications to the CrossRef linking system. In this case, you can search for the
		full-text in your library's print holdings, purchase full-text through a document delivery service such as the Linda Hall Library, or ask your librarian
		about purchasing the full-text or procuring through an inter-library loan.
	</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		3. What are "facets" and how do they help my search?<a name="q3" id="q3"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Facets appear in the Refine results box on the left side of the search results page.<br/>
		<br/> Facets represent commonly occurring results data grouped by field. Under each facet is a list of the terms which appear most often in that set
		of results, along with a record count showing the number of records containing that term. Each facet displays the first 5 items that are relevant for
		your search, but you can click on "more..." to show additional terms.<br/>
		<br/> To refine or alter your original search: Select one or more search terms and click on "include" or "exclude." Including terms is similar to
		adding an AND term to your original search, so will limit results to only those containing that term. Excluding terms is similar to adding a NOT to your
		search terms, so it will exclude any records containing that term. The "Add a Term" option allows you to enter your own terms for search refinement and
		can be combined with other terms in the faceted list.
	</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		4. Which groups of results data (facets) are available to me?<a name="q4" id="q4"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">You will see the facets (grouped results data from index fields such as author, publication, year, controlled
		vocabulary) common to all databases you're searching. Searching multiple databases at the same time results in only the facets that those databases share
		being displayed. The Year facet and Add a Term option will always appear.</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		5. Why would I export the grouped result data (facets) into a chart and/or spreadsheet?<a name="q5" id="q5"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Bar Graph and Export icons appear next to each facet in the Refine Results section of the search results page. The Bar Chart can be helpful as it shows
		a visual representation of the faceted terms and their distribution. Exporting the faceted data gives you a record of the data for analysis and provides
		an overview of results from which you can build on your search. Having access to the raw data also gives you the freedom to graph it, report on it, or
		reference it in whatever way you need.<br/>
		<br/> Click on the Export icon to save or open the terms and record counts in that facet as a tab file, which allows you to select the software you
		would like to use to open the file (e.g. Excel). All the terms in a facet are exported, even when only the top 5 are displayed on Engineering Village.<br/>
		<br/> Click on the bar graph icon to open a graph of the terms and record counts in a new window. The bar graph will show only the terms being viewed
		in Engineering Village at that time. For example, by default it will graph the top 5 terms but if you click on "more..." to show additional terms, all of
		those terms displayed will be included on the graph as well. You can then save, print, or email this image.

		6. How often is content updated on Engineering Village?<a name="q6" id="q6"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">All of the A&amp;I and patent databases are updated weekly. New eBook titles are added to the Referex database
		annually.</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		7. How can I manage my results and save my searches?<a name="q7" id="q7"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Managing your results is easy. From the search results page, you can select records to view, email, print, download, or save by clicking these options above 
		the search results. You can also save searches to rerun later simply by clicking the "Save Search" link directly above the list of
		results.<br/>
		<br/> In order to save your searches or download specific records to a folder, you must create a personal account. You will be prompted to set up an
		account automatically when you attempt to use one of these features.
	</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		8. What is the benefit of email alerts and RSS?<a name="q8" id="q8"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Weekly alerts of new records that fit your search criteria keep you up to date with recently added content, without having to rerun the same searches
		over and over again. Engineering Village gives you automatic weekly updates of your search queries' results in whichever format you prefer: emailed
		directly to your inbox via email alerts or delivered straight to your RSS reader.<br/>
		<br/> In order to set up email or RSS alerts, you must create a personal account. You will be prompted to set up an account automatically when you
		attempt to use one of these features.

	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		9. Why would I blog a record?<a name="q9" id="q9"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		The "Blog This" feature on the Abstract and Detailed pages allows you to link from your blog to a record of interest on Engineering Village. Anyone can view a record following the Blog
		This link even if they do not subscribe to Engineering Village, so you can share information with an audience outside of your organization. This can help
		you communicate with your blog readers and allows you to create a forum from which to collaborate with colleagues in your area of research.<br/>
		<br/> To use this feature simply click the "Blog This" link in an abstract or detailed record view. Select and copy the code that appears in the
		box and paste it in your blog post. Once you publish your post the title of the record will appear in your blog.
	</p>
	<a class="style1" href="#faq" title="Back">back</a>
	<p align="left" class="style5">
		10. What are tags and how can I use them?<a name="q10" id="q10"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Tags are keywords applied to a record by an Engineering Village user. This allows you to assign meaningful terms either for your own reference and
		organization or to share with a group, your institution, or the entire Engineering Village community. You can also search other users' tags to gain new
		perspectives.<br/>
		<br/>Engineering Village also lets you tag records externally to del.icio.us.

	<p align="left" class="style5">
		11. What does it mean to "Browse Indexes"?<a name="q11" id="q11"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Indexing is the process by which bibliographic information and thesaurus terms, or controlled vocabulary, are selected to describe the content of an
		article. On Engineering Village, indexing determines articles' relevance to a search query and links related articles together. The index comprises
		several fields that vary by database (e.g. author, author affiliation, controlled terms, etc.).<br/>
		<br/> Browse indexes to find the precise term you need, or to ensure all variations of a term (i.e. spelling or abbreviations) are included in the
		search so nothing is missed. <br/>
		<br/> From the Quick and Expert Search pages on Engineering Village you can select the index you wish to search in the "Browse Indexes" box. The
		index will appear in a new window, and you can either browse index terms alphabetically or search for a term by typing the first few letters in the
		SEARCH FOR box and clicking on "Find". Selecting terms from the index will automatically add them to your search.

	<p align="left" class="style5">
		12. How can the thesaurus help me when searching for content?<a name="q12" id="q12"></a>
	</p>
	<p align="left" class="style1">
		Thesauri are guides to the controlled vocabulary used to index articles for Engineering Village. Thesauri are hierarchical in nature, organizing terms by
		broader, narrower, or related concepts. <br/>
		<br/> The "Thesaurus Search" tab on Engineering Village lets you search or browse the thesaurus for additional related terms. From here, you can
		expand or refine your search by selecting broader, narrower, or related terms to include. This offers insight into additional topics or terms that were
		not initially included, ensuring that nothing is missed and that search results provide precisely the information you need.
