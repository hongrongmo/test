<b>eBook Search </b><br>
Enter search terms in the SEARCH FOR textbox. You may search a term in a specific field by selecting the field from the SEARCH IN pull-down menu to the right of the textbox. Keyword, the default search, searches the text of the book and returns sections of the book in the search results set. Searching by author, ISBN, publisher, subject or title, returns books sorted by title and in alphabetical order.</a>
<br><br>

<center>
<img src="/engresources/images/e2.gif" border="0">
</center>
<br><br>

<a CLASS="MedBlackText"><b>Autostemming</b><br>
Search terms are automatically stemmed except terms searched in the author field or terms that are truncated or entered in quotation marks or braces.
<br><br>
Stemming allows you to retrieve variants of a word using the word root as the stemming basis.
<br><br>
management returns managing, managed, manager, manage, managers, etc.
<br><br>

<b>Truncation</b><br>
The asterisk (*) is the right-hand truncation symbol.
<br><br>
The truncation command retrieves all the words that start with the same letters as the truncated term, up to the point that the truncation symbol is used.
<br><br>
comput* returns computer, computerized, computation, computational, computability, etc.
<br><br>
To avoid unexpected results, truncation should be used with care. E.g. color* will retrieve color and colored and colors and Colorado.
<br><br>
Truncation cannot be used within quotation marks or braces.
<br><br>

<b>Exact Phrase Searching</b><br>
Phrases entered without braces or quotation marks will return good results because of the relevance sort, but to guarantee that the phrase is an exact match, braces or quotation marks should be used.
<br><br>
"ultraviolet light"<br>
{solar energy}
<br><br>
Truncation and stemming cannot be used with exact phrase searching.
<br><br>

<b>Stop Words</b><br>
If you need to search for a phrase that contains stop words (and, or, not, near) place the phrase within braces or quotation marks.
<br><br>
{block and tackle}<br>
"rack and pinion"<br>
Special characters: (anything other then a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ?, *, #, ( ) or { }) <br>
Most special characters are ignored by the search engine.
<br><br>
To include special characters within the search phrase, place the term within braces or quotation marks, they will be ignored but the spacing will be maintained.
<br><br>
{PAL-B/G}
<br><br>

Operators (?, *, #, ( ) or { }) have meaning in eBook searching on Engineering Village 2 and should not be entered as part of a search. For example to search for AU(III) enter the search as AU III.
<br><br>

<b>Case sensitivity</b><br>
eBook searching on the Engineering Village 2 interface is not case sensitive. Text can be entered in upper or lower case.
<br><br>

<b>Reset/New Search</b><br>
When starting a new search within a search session, click the reset button to clear the previous search. Clicking on reset ensures that no traces of the old search remain to affect the results of the new search and resets all the options to the default settings.
<br><br>

<b>Advanced Search</b><br>
Enter search terms in one or more of the three SEARCH FOR textboxes. You may search a term in a specific field by selecting the field from the SEARCH IN pull-down menu to the right of the textbox.  Note: keyword searches can only be joined with other keyword searches.  If one or more of the SEARCH IN boxes has keyword selected, author, ISBN, publisher, subject or title, cannot be searched.  Non-keyword search terms can be combined.</a>
<br><br>

<center>
<img src="/engresources/images/e3.gif" border="0">
</center>
<br><br>

<a CLASS="MedBlackText"><b>Boolean operators</b><br>
The three textboxes allow you to combine terms using the Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT.
<br><br>
To broaden a search, or to allow for variant spellings, combine terms using OR (results contain any specified term).
<br><br>
rapid transit OR light rail OR subways<br>
seatbelts OR seat belts
<br><br>
To narrow the scope of a search, combine terms using AND (results contain all specified terms).
<br><br>
laser AND diode
<br><br>
To eliminate terms from a search, use the NOT operator. A search for mining might be done as:
mines or mining NOT "data mining"
<br><br>
If terms are entered into the three textboxes, Advanced Search will always combine terms from the first two textboxes first, and then the term in the third textbox.
<br><br>
a AND b OR c will be searched as (a AND b) OR c<br>
a OR b AND c will be searched as (a OR b) AND c<br>
a OR b NOT c will be searched as (a OR b) NOT c
<br><br>


<a NAME="browse" CLASS="MedBlackText"><b>Browse</b><br>
Browse allows the user to navigate to specific collections (Materials &amp; Mechanical, Electronics &amp; Electrical, and Chemical, Petrochemical &amp; Process) or subjects by clicking on controlled vocabulary used in indexing eBooks for Referex. Browse is hierarchical in nature. Terms are organized by broader terms (collections) and narrower terms (subjects).
<br><br>
To browse a particular collection or subject, simply click on the hyperlink of the term. The search results will contain a complete list of titles by collection or subject, sorted by alphabetical order.</a>

<br><br>

<a NAME="searchfields" CLASS="MedBlackText"><b>Search fields</b><br>
The following fields are searchable in Referex: <br><br>

<b>Keyword</b><br>
Searching "keyword" finds terms in the text of the eBook.  Keyword searching includes section or chaper names and more importantly, the words on the pages of the eBook.  Results are returned by relevance.  The relevance sort is based on an algorithm that takes into account the following:
<br><br>
Whether the words are found as an exact phrase or separately <br>
When words are found separately, closer proximity ranks higher <br>
The number of times that the word/phrase appears in the section of an eBook<br>
The word's location within the section (words found at the beginning of the section rank higher than words found towards the end) <br>
How often the word appears in the database as a whole (words used often are less relevant than words that are less common) <br><br>
To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within braces or quotation marks. For example:<br>
"solar energy"<br>
{avalanche diodes}<br>
"Keyword" is the default for Referex. <br><br>

<b>Author</b><br>
Referex cites author, editor or contributors' names as they appear in the eBook. Surnames appear first, followed by a comma and the remainder of the name as it appears in the publication.
<br><br>
Editors and contributors are also listed in the author field.
<br><br>
Author names can be truncated by using an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol
<br><br>
When records are displayed, author names are hyperlinked. Click on an author hyperlink to retrieve eBooks by that author from the entire Referex database.
<br><br>
<b>International Standard Book Number (ISBN)</b><br>

<b>Publisher</b><br>
Search on the "Publisher" field to identify publishers, or find the eBooks published by a particular publisher.
