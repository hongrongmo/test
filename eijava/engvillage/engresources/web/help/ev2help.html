    <br><br>
    Use the NOT operator to eliminate terms from a search.

    <i>(gold or au) in AB</i>

	<b>Accession number</b><br>

	<i>93081058927 wn AN </i>
	<br><br>
    <b>Author</b><br>
    Since author names may be cited in a variety of formats, use of the Author Browse Index is highly recommended, e.g. <i>Berryman, Alan A.</i> or <i>Berryman, A.A.</i> Ei cites authors' names as they appear in the original document. Surnames appear first, usually followed by a comma and the remainder of the name as it appears in the original document.
    <br><br>
    If the document is cited by initials and a surname, but a full name is indicated somewhere in the original publication, such as in the table of contents, then all the known information is provided. Titles such as Sir and Mister and educational degrees are not included in the current Compendex database. They may appear in the Salutation field in the Engineering Index Backfile.
    <br><br>
    Since 1976, if no personal author name appears on the document then the institutional author is added to the author affiliation field and Anon will then appear in the author field.
    <br><br>
    Author names can be truncated by using an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol:
    <br><br>
    <i>Smith, A*</i> will retrieve <br>
    <i>Smith, A.,</i><br>
    <i>Smith A.A.</i><br>
    <i>Smith A.B.</i><br>
    <i>Smith, A. Brandon</i><br>
    <i>Smith, Aaron, </i><br>
    <i>Smith Aaron C.,</i> etc.
    <br><br>
    Be aware that this strategy may lead to false hits because there are many authors with the same last name and first initial.
    <br><br>
    Note that only authors whose names are presented in the format given will be retrieved.
    <br><br>
    Searching on <i>Smith, A. B.</i> will not retrieve articles with the author cited as <i>Smith, A</i>.
    <br><br>

    If a single word surname is entered as the author's last name, all of the forms of that name will be retrieved.
    <br><br>
    <i>Bers</i> will retrieve:<br>
    <i>Bers, A. </i><br>
    <i>Bers, D. M.</i><br>
    <i>Bers, Donald M.</i> etc.
    <br><br>
    To further refine this search, add the truncation symbol after the first initial.
    <br><br>
    <i>Bers, D*</i> will retrieve: <br>
    <i>Bers, D. M. </i><br>
    <i>Bers, D.M. </i><br>
    <i>Bers, Donald M.</i> etc. <br><br>

    Editors and compilers are also listed in the author field. They are distinguished from authors by the notations <i>(ed.)</i> or <i>(compiler)</i> in parentheses following the names.
    <br><br>
    To search on the name of a person who could be an author, an editor or a compiler of a document, truncate after the known part of the name. This will allow for retrieval of the notations <i>(ed.)</i> or <i>(compiler)</i>.
    <br><br>
    When records are displayed, author names are hyperlinked. Click on an author hyperlink to retrieve additional records by that author from the entire date range of the database (1969-present or 1884 to present if you have the Engineering Index Backfile).
    <br><br>

    <b>Author Affiliation</b><br>
    Prior to 2001, the official Compendex policy was to provide the institutional affiliation of the first author or editor, if it could be determined from the source document.  Since 2001,  the affiliation of the corresponding author has been given instead.
    <br><br>
    In addition to this policy change, in some given affiliations (if it can be determined from the source document) more than one level of the organization is now cited.
    <br><br>
    The formats and abbreviations used in author affiliations have varied over the years. For example in the 1970's, an affiliation might be cited as follows:
    <br><br>
    <i>Nippon Telegr &amp; Teleph Public Corp, </i><br>
    <i>Ibaraki Electr Electr Commun Lab </i>
    <br><br>
    In the 1980's:
    <br><br>
    <i>Inst of Electrical Engineers of Japan, </i><br>
    <i>Committee on Electrical Insulating Materials, </i><br>
    <i>Jpn, Insulating Materials, (Jpn)</i>
    <br><br>
    1990's to present:
    <br><br>
    <i>Sch. of Electrical and Computer Eng., Purdue University, </i><br>
    <i>1285 Electrical Engineering Building, </i><br>
    <i>West Lafayette, IN 47907, United States</i>

    Corresponding non-English terms (e.g., <i>Akademy</i>) may also be abbreviated.
    <br><br>
    Other variations in affiliation names may occur for some of the following reasons:
    <br><br>
    An organization's name may be given in different forms in different source documents. Variations may be due to language, for example:
    <br><br>
    <i>Goteborg Univ. </i><br>
    <i>Gothenburg Univ.</i><br><br>

    An organization's name may change over the course of time, e.g.:
    <br><br>
    <i>Mobil</i> is now named <i>Exxon Mobil </i>
    <br><br>
	
    <b>Classification Code</b><br>
    The Compendex classification scheme, available in print form in the <i>Ei Thesaurus</i>, is a numerical hierarchy of general subject categories. These subject categories are used to place a term into context when the meaning can vary depending on its usage. As an example, windows can refer to building materials or software. The classification codes for building materials (42*) and computer and data processing (72*) will limit the search to the proper area. Classification codes can be found in the detailed record and also in thesaurus records.
    <br><br>
    Searching by classification code is an excellent way to retrieve a large, relevant set of results without using synonyms.  Classification Code field is not searchable in Engineering Index Backfile.
    <br><br>
    <i>72 wn CL</i><br>
    <i>"804.2" wn CL</i>
	<br><br>
	The </a><a CLASS="LgBlueLink" href="javascript: window.open('cpxclassification.html','NewWindow','status=yes,resizable,scrollbars=1,menubar=yes,addressbar=1,width=700,height=500');void('');">table below</a><a CLASS="MedBlackText">contains the complete Compendex classification scheme. The first column contains the classification codes, the second column contains the related description.
    <br><br>
	
    <b>CODEN </b><br>
    CODENs are six character representations of serial titles. They can be used to limit results to a specific journal. CODEN can be found in <i>PIE: Publications in Engineering, Ulrich's Periodicals Directory and CASSI: Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index.</i> You can also find a journal's CODEN at the abstract and detailed level of a record.
    <br><br>
    <i>MMPRE8 wn CN</i>
    <br><br>
	
    <b>Conference Code </b><br>
    A Conference Code is a number assigned to a conference proceedings record and every paper from that conference covered by Compendex. This allows you to locate every paper from a conference once you have found one paper. The conference code can be found in the detailed record format.
    <br><br>
    The conference code was first used in 1982. Conferences covered in Compendex prior to 1982 do not contain conference codes.
    <br><br>
    <i>13969 wn CC</i>
    <br><br>
    <b>Conference Information</b><br>
    Conference information includes the name, date, location and sponsor of a conference as well as the conference code number.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Salt Lake City wn CF"</i>
    <br><br>
	
    <b>Controlled Term</b><br>
    The controlled vocabulary used to index records in Compendex can be found in the Ei Thesaurus. The 4th edition of the Ei Thesaurus contains 18,000 terms, 9,000 of those preferred terms and 9,000 entry terms. 220 new preferred terms were added for the 4th edition as well as 200 new entry terms. The terms can now be identified by using the thesaurus function from the navigation bar.
    <br><br>
    Ei's controlled vocabulary is a list of subject terms used to describe the content of a document in the most specific and consistent way possible. These terms can be browsed in the Ei controlled term Browse Index in Engineering Village 2 as well.
    <br><br>
    These terms also appear hyperlinked in the abstract and detailed record format. Clicking on any of these will retrieve records spanning the date range of the original search. In 1993, Ei updated the format of its controlled vocabulary. Pre-1993 records retained their former format.
    <br><br>
    The former heading-subheading organization was abandoned. Each index term now stands alone. Old heading-subheading controlled terms have been updated in several different ways:
    <br><br>

    <i>Electromagnetic waves - Absorption</i><br>
    is now indexed as: <br>
    <i>Electromagnetic wave absorption </i><br>
    The aspect of Electromagnetic waves called Absorption is now part of the main heading.
    <br><br>

    <i>Electronic circuits, Frequency dividing</i>
    Is now<br>
    <i>Frequency dividing circuits</i>
    The main heading subheading structure is converted to natural language.
    <br><br>

    <i>Electron tube - Reliability</i><br>
    Is now: <br>
    <i>Electron tubes and Reliability</i><br>
    The two aspects represented in this main heading, subheading are separated as individual terms.
    <br><br>

    <i>Light - Coherent</i><br>
    is now<br>
    <i>Coherent Light</i><br>
    When a subheading modifies, or adds additional explanation to the main heading, the order is now reversed presented as a single term.
    <br><br>

    In <b>Expert Search</b>, use CV to search for controlled terms:
    <br><br>
    <i>Geochemistry wn CV</i><br>
    <i>"environmental impact" wn CV</i><br>
    <i>{gold ore treatment} wn CV</i>
    <br><br>

    Users searching on controlled terms for material published before 1993 will find it helpful to use both the Ei controlled term look-up indexes and the online thesaurus as an aid in determining all the appropriate terms.
    <br><br>
    Most Compendex records are assigned a heading that serves to represent the major subject aspect of the document (Main Heading). The subject terms that follow describe additional concepts dealt with in the article.
    <br><br>

    <b>ISBN (International Standard Book Number) </b><br>
    ISBNs are 13 character representations of monograph titles. They can be used to find chapters from the same monograph or papers from the same conference. The ISBN appears at the abstract or detailed level of a record.  An ISBN is searchable in All Fields for <b>Easy</b>, <b>Quick</b> or <b>Expert Search</b> or individually according to the specific search code in <b>Expert Search.</b>
    <br><br>
    <i>0-87339-255-8 wn BN </i>
    <br><br>

    <b>ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)</b><br>
    ISSNs are nine character alphanumeric representations of serial titles formatted as two sets of four numbers separated by a hyphen. The last digit can be an X. They can be used to limit results to a specific journal. You can find a journal's ISSN at the abstract and detailed level of a record as well as in the Serial Title Browse Index.
    <br><br>
    <i>0747-9812 wn SN</i>
    <br><br>

    <b>Main Heading</b><br>
    Most Compendex records are assigned a heading that serves to represent the major subject aspect of the document (Main Heading). The subject terms that follow describe additional concepts discussed in the article. All Main Headings are controlled vocabulary terms.
    <br><br>
    "ammonium compounds" in MH
    <br><br>

    <b>Publisher</b><br>
    Search on the Publisher field to identify publishers, or find the journals published by a particular publisher. Be sure to look for all versions of a publisher's name. To do so, it is helpful to refer to the Publisher Browse Index. For example,  <i>American Institute of Physics</i> is also referred to as:
    <br><br>
    <i>AIP</i><br>
    <i>AIP Press</i><br>
    <i>Am Inst Phys</i><br>
    <i>American Inst Phys </i>
    <br><br>

    In <b>Expert Search</b>, use PN to search this field:
    <br><br>
    <i>Elsevier wn PN</i><br>
    <i>"American institute of physics" wn PN</i><br>
    <i>{AIP Press} wn PN</i>
    <br><br>

    <b>Serial Title</b><br>
    Search on the <i>Serial Title</i> field if you want to identify serial titles, e.g., journals, monographs or conference proceedings, from your area of study.
    <br><br>
    Searching for <i>polymer*</i> in the "Serial title" field will retrieve citations whose sources will include:
    <br><br>

    <i>Polymers for Advanced Technologies </i><br>
    <i>Journal of Applied Polymer Science,</i> etc.
    <br><br>
    To search for a specific serial title, enclose the title in braces or quotation marks.
    <br><br>
    <i>{X-Ray Spectrometry} wn ST</i><br>
    <i>"Journal of X-Ray Science and Technology" wn ST</i>
    <br><br>
    As variations of serial title names sometimes appear, it is a good idea to use the Serial Title Browse Index. The look-up index also includes serial monograph and conference titles. The Serial Title Browse Index also allows you to limit the search to an exact title match, e.g. <i>Science</i> by incorporating the ISSN.
    <br><br>

    <b>Subject/Title/Abstract</b><br>
    Searching <i>Subject/Title/Abstract</i> retrieves results from any of the following fields: Abstract, Title, Translated title, Ei controlled terms, Ei main heading, and Uncontrolled terms.
    <br><br>
    This is an effective way to maximize the relevance of your search results.
    <br><br>
    To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within braces or quotation marks. For example:
    <br><br>
    <i>{international space station}</i><br>
    <i>"linear induction motors" </i>
    <br><br>
    <b>Title</b><br>
    If you want to search for specific terms within an article's title, search on the <i>Title</i> field. Words in a title are often an indication of the importance of those terms in the article.
    <br><br>
    <i>"Radio frequency"</i> in the title will likely find articles where <i>radio frequency</i> is an important aspect of the article.
    <br><br>
    <i>Diffusion in TI</i><br>
    <i>"radio frequency" in TI</i><br>
    <i>{radio frequency} in TI</i>
    <br><br>
    For English language documents, the original title is reproduced word for word. However, specific rules exist for foreign language titles:
    <ul>
    <li>If the document is written in a language other than English, but uses the western alphabet, an English language translation is provided, as well as the title in the original language. </li>
    <li>For languages not using the Roman alphabet, the title is translated into English, and a transliterated title may appear. </li>
    <li>If the original language of the title is English, and the text of the articles is published in a non-English language, only the English language title is used; a non-English language title is not created. </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Uncontrolled Term</b><br>
    Uncontrolled terms, also known as free language terms, are additional subject terms assigned by indexers. These terms are not selected from the Ei Thesaurus. New terms and terminology are used in this field. These terms allow for further specificity in indexing that is not available using controlled vocabulary. Uncontrolled terms may subsequently become part of Ei's Controlled Vocabulary.
    <br><br>
    These are searchable in <i>All Fields</i> for <b>Easy</b>, <b>Quick</b> or <b>Expert Search</b> or individually according to the specific search code in <b>Expert Search</b>.

    <br><br>
    <b>Treatment Type</b><br>
    The treatment type is used to specify the slant or approach taken in the document.
    <br><br>
    In <b>Quick Search</b>, Treatment Type can be applied as a limit in the Treatment Type pull-down box.
    <br><br>
    In <b>Expert Search</b>, the treatment type can be selected from the Treatment Type Browse Index or searched directly:
    <br><br>
    <i>HIS wn tr </i>
    <br><br>
    Treatments types were added to Compendex records in 1985. Therefore, a search with a treatment limit is restricted to post-1985 records only.
    <br><br>
    A record may have one or more Treatment Type. However, not all records have been assigned Treatment Types.
    <br><br>
    The following treatments are used in Compendex:
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Applications</i></b> - Used for documents describing the actual or potential use of a material, device, concept, computer program, instrument, system, technique, or other innovation. This code is also used for product reviews/technical disclosures.

    <br><br>
    <i>All Fields</i> is the default for Inspec.
    <br><br>
    <b>Abstract</b><br>
    Searching <i>Abstract</i> finds terms in the abstract field.  To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within braces or quotation marks.

    <b>Astronomical Object Indexing </b><br>
    Astronomical Object designations have been indexed in the Astronomical Object field back to 1995. It allows named or numbered objects to be retrieved more efficiently. Three types of designations exist:
    <br><br>
    Name-based acronyms:<br>
    <i>LMC wn AI</i> (Large Magellanic Cloud)<br>
    <i>R Sct</i> (object in constellation, e.g., HDW)
    <br><br>
    Catalog-based acronyms including their catalog entry name. This number may be sequential (NGC 204) or represent a position in the sky, (PRS 1913+16). <br>
    <i>"HR 3237" wn AI </i>
    <br><br>
    Positional information only:<br>
    <i>"4U 0115+63" wn AI </i>
    <br><br>
    Detailed information about Astronomical Object indexing can be found at the IEE Web site at: </a><a CLASS="LgBlueLink" href="http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/astron/">http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/astron/</a>
    <br><br>

    <a CLASS="MedBlackText">
    <b>Author </b><br>
    Inspec does not use authors' first names, but only their initials. The database also includes any suffixes appended to the name. To search on an author name, enter last name, comma, then a space, initial(s) and suffix (if any).
    <br><br>
    <i>White, A. A.</i><br>
    <i>Brown, A.C., Jr.</i>
    <br><br>
    Author names can be truncated by using an asterisk (*) as a truncation symbol.
    <br><br>
    <i>Jones, A* retrieves</i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. A</i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. B.</i><br>
    <i>ones, A. C</i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. D. III</i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. D. R. </i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. D. W.,</i><br>
    <i>Jones, A. D.</i><br>
    <i>Jones A. E, etc.</i>
    <br><br>
    Be aware that this strategy may lead to false hits because there are many authors with the same last name and first initial.  Use of the Author Browse Index is strongly recommended in order to make selections from all the possible variations on an author's name.
    <br><br>
    Note that only authors whose names are presented in the format given will be retrieved.  For instance,  searching on <i>Templeton, D.D.</i> will not retrieve articles with the author cited as <i>Templeton, D.</i>
    <br><br>
    If a single term is entered as an author name, all forms of that name will be retrieved, e.g., entering <i>Fisch</i> will retrieve articles by all of the following:
    <br><br>
    <i>Fisch, A. </i><br>

    <b>Author Affiliation</b><br>
    The institutional affiliation at the time of publication is given for the first author of each record as given in the journal if it can be determined from the source document. The affiliation includes the name, city, state, and country of the organization where applicable. In some cases, more than one level of the organization is cited as well.
    <br><br>
    As variations and abbreviations may have been used, it is a good idea to use the Author Affiliation Browse Index.
    <br><br>

    <b>Chemical Indexing </b><br>
    The Chemical Indexing field is a system of controlled indexing for inorganic substances and material systems.
    <br><br>
    Every significant substance in a record is given one of three basic role indicators: <br>
    element (el), e.g., {Si/el} wn CI<br>
    binary (bin), e.g., {Al/bin} wn CI <br>
    system (ss), e.g., {Ga/ss} wn CI
    <br><br>
    Some substances may be assigned special rolls. These are:<br>
    interface system (int) <br>
    surface or substrate (sur) <br>
    adsorbate (ads) <br>
    dopant (dop)
    <br><br>

    Detailed information about Chemical Indexing can be found at the IEE Web site at: </a><a CLASS="LgBlueLink" href="http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/ChemNum/">http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/ChemNum/</a>
    <br><br>

    <a CLASS="MedBlackText">
    <b>Classification Code</b><br>
    The Inspec Classification is divided into five areas.<br>
    A (Physics) <br>
    B (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) <br>
    C (Computers and Control) <br>
    D (Information Technology) <br>
    E (Manufacturing and Production Engineering)
    <br><br>
    The single letter and following four digits indicate the levels of classification. The letter (A B C D or E) represents the discipline area. The most general level is represented by the first digit. The second level is represented by the second digit, etc.
    <br><br>
    A4000    Fundamental areas of phenomenology<br>
    A4200    Optics<br>

    <b>CODEN</b><br>
    CODEN are six character representations of serial titles. They can be used to limit results to a specific journal. CODEN can be found in Inspec's List of Journals 2004, Ulrich's Periodicals Directory and CASSI: Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index. You can also find a journal's CODEN at the abstract and detailed level of a record.
    <br><br>

    <b>Conference Information</b><br>
    Conference information includes the name, date, location and sponsor of a conference.
    <br><br>
    <b>Controlled Term</b><br>
    The controlled vocabulary used to index records in Inspec can be found in the Inspec Thesaurus available online. These terms can also be browsed in the Inspec Controlled Term Browse Index.
    <br><br>
    These terms also appear hyperlinked in the abstract and detailed record format. Clicking on any of these will retrieve additional records on that subject spanning the date range of the original search.
    <br><br>
    <b>ISBN</b> (International Standard Book Number) <br>
    ISBNs are 13 character representations of monograph titles. They can be used to find chapters from the same monograph or papers from the same conference. The ISBN will be given at the abstract and detailed level of a record.  An ISBN is searchable in All Fields for <b>Easy</b>, <b>Quick</b> or <b>Expert Search</b> or individually according to the specific search code in <b>Expert Search</b>.
    <br><br>
    <i>0-13-489089-2 wn BN </i>
    <br><br>

    <b>ISSN</b> (International Standard Serial Number)<br>
    ISSN are nine character alphanumeric representations of serial titles formatted as two sets of four numbers separated by a hyphen. The last digit can be an X. They can be used to limit results to a specific journal. You can find a journal's ISSN at the abstract and detailed level of a record as well as in the Serial Title look-up index.
    <br><br>
    <b>Material Identity Number</b> (1996 - present)<br>
    This field contains an internal Inspec code uniquely identifying the publication issue for serials or the entire publication for non-serials. It can be used to find papers from a specific issue of a journal once at least one paper from that issue is located. It can also be used to find all the papers from a conference proceedings or chapters from a book.
    <br><br>
    <i>"O646-2002-002" wn MI </i>
    <br><br>

    <b>Numerical Data Indexing </b><br>
    Numerical data indexing standardizes the way values are expressed by the authors within their papers.
    <br><br>
    For example, 32 megawatts may be cited as: <br>
    <i>32 M W</i><br>
    <i>32000 kW</i><br>
    <i>32 MWatts,</i> etc.
    <br><br>
    Numeric data indexing is composed of three elements:
    <br><br>

    Quantity, e.g. temperature, wavelength, frequency,<br>
    <i>{power 3.5E+07 W} wn NI </i>
    <br><br>
    Unit, e.g. meter, hertz, Kelvin<br>
    <i>"7.151E-10 M" wn NI </i>
    <br><br>
    Value, range expressed in floating point format <br>
    <i>"Temperature 9.5E+01" wn NI </i>
    <br><br>

    Detailed information about Numerical Data Indexing can be found at the IEE Web site at: </a><a CLASS="LgBlueLink" href="http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/ChemNum/">http://www.iee.org/publish/support/inspec/document/ChemNum/</a>
    <br><br>

    <a CLASS="MedBlackText">
    <b>Publisher </b><br>
    Search on the <i>Publisher</i> field to identify publishers, or find the journals published by a particular publisher. Be sure to look for all versions of a publisher's name. To do so, it is helpful to refer to the Publisher Browse Index.  For example, <i>American Institute of Physics</i> can appear as:
    <br><br>
    <i>AIP</i><br>
    <i>AIP Press</i><br>
    <i>American Inst. Phys </i>
    <br><br>

    <b>Serial Title </b><br>
    Search on the <i>Serial Title</i> field if you want to identify serial titles, e.g., journals, monographs or conference proceedings, from your area of study.
    <br><br>
    Searching for <i>polymer*</i> will retrieve citations whose sources will include:
    <br><br>
    <i>Polymers for Advanced Technologies</i><br>
    <i>Journal of Applied Polymer Science, etc.</i>
    <br><br>
    To search for a specific serial title, enclose the title in braces or quotation marks.
    <br><br>
    <i>{X-Ray Spectrometry}</i><br>
    <i>"Journal of X-Ray Science and Technology"</i>
    <br><br>
    As variations of serial title names sometimes appear, it is a good idea to use the Serial Title Browse Index. The look-up index also includes serial monographs and conference titles. The Serial Title Browse Index also allows you to search on an exact title match, e.g. <i>Science,</i> by including the ISSN.
    <br><br>

    <b>Subject/Title/Abstract</b><br>
    Searching for Subject/Title/Abstract retrieves results from any of the following fields: <i>Abstract, Title, Controlled Terms or Uncontrolled terms.</i>  It is helpful for maximizing the relevance of your search results.
    <br><br>
	
    <b>Title</b><br>
    If you want to search for specific terms within a document's title, search on the <i>Title</i> field. Words in a title are often an indication of the importance of those terms in the article. For example, "radio frequency" in the title will likely find articles where <i>radio frequency</i> is an important aspect of the article.
    <br><br>
    All titles in Inspec are in English.
    <br><br>

    <b>Uncontrolled Term</b><br>
    Uncontrolled terms, also known as free language terms, are additional subject terms assigned by indexers. These terms are not selected from the Inspec Thesaurus, but can reflect new expressions and terminology used in a particular discipline. These terms allow for further specificity in indexing that is not available using controlled vocabulary. Uncontrolled terms may subsequently become part of Inspec's controlled vocabulary.
    <br><br>

    Combined searches allow you to search multiple databases simultaneously and remove duplicate records. The databases available are determined by the subscriptions held by your institution. The combinations available are:
    <br><br>
    <b><i>Combined Compendex &amp; Inspec</i></b><br>
    <b><i>Combined Compendex &amp; NTIS</i></b><br>
    <b><i>Combined Inspec &amp; NTIS </i></b><br>
    <b><i>Combined Compendex, Inspec &amp; NTIS</i></b>
    <br><br>
    The fields available depend on the databases selected. Only fields that are common to all available databases will be searchable in <b>Quick Search</b>. For example, CODEN is not available in NTIS so will not appear in the <b>Search In</b> drop-down menu for any combination of databases containing NTIS.
    <br><br>
    In <b>Expert Search</b>, the Search Codes box contains an amalgamated list of all search codes from all databases, with a letter identifying the source database:  C for Compendex, I for Inspec and N for NTIS.  These help identify which fields are available in each database; e.g. <i>Accession number (C,I,N)</i> for a field common to all three, or <i>Monitoring agency (N)</i> to designate a field unique to NTIS, which would return zero hits in Compendex and Inspec.

    <br>br>
    The system quickly removes duplicates from the first 500 search results.
    <br><br>
    Once the duplicates are removed, you can easily recall them by clicking on the <b>Recall Duplicates</b> button above the de-duplicated search results.
    <br><br>
	In <b>Quick Search</b> and <b>Expert Search</b>, the search results for combined searches give the total number of records, plus a breakdown of the number of records from each database.  By clicking on the hyperlink of the individual databases, the results from that database will be displayed.  Once you view the results from a single database, you can select one of the other databases or return to the combined search results.
	<br><br>
	In <b>Easy Search</b>, the results for combined searches give the total number of records.  The number of records from the individual databases is given in one of the Refine Search clusters on the right of the screen.

    <i>Month-Day-Year</i><br>
    Month can be the number of the month, the full name of the month, or an abbreviation (i.e. 6, June or Jun).   Day must be a number between 1 and 31.  Year must be a four-digit year (2002).
    <br><br>
    Use 6-4-2002, Jun-4-2002 or June-4-2002 to retrieve documents from June 4, 2002.

    <b>Search Form</b><br>
    You can refine your search from the <b>Search Results</b> page.  <b>Easy Search</b> provides a search box above the results set that allows searching within results, or allows you to start a new search by selecting all content from the drop down menu.

    <b>Refine by the Refine Results Clusters</b><br>
    You can easily refine or narrow your results set by clicking on any of the supplied clusters of terms and other data elements (publication years, languages, publishers, etc.) derived from the records in your result set. These terms appear on the right of the <b>Search Results</b> screen.  Numbers in parentheses adjacent to each term indicate the number of records found for each within the search already created..  Click "More" to expand each list during the Beta period up to 60 terms will be displayed for each cluster.
    <br><br>
    Clicking on a term or other data element in <b>Refine Results</b> creates a search path, or "breadcrumb" above the search results list, and further limits your original search set, resulting in a smaller, more focused answer set. Terms that are added in this way are "AND"-ed together.
    <br><br>
    New "breadcrumb" terms will appear at the top of each new <b>Search Results</b> screen with a red "X" icon.  To eliminate a breadcrumb term from a query, simply click its red X.
    <br><br>
    For example, a large answer set on diodes, with thousands of citations, can easily be reduced to a more manageable size by clicking on additional terms from the <b>Refine Results</b> list at right; click to add a publication year (2004), an additional controlled term (<i>semiconductor lasers</i>), etc.
    <br><br>
	If you click on a hyperlinked term in the "breadcrumb," all terms after it will be deleted from the "breadcrumb."  
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b>  Not every field has been used consistently over the years.  For example, publisher name was not always given for journal articles, so a publisher may be under-represented in the clusters.  Also, items in clusters may be represented in more than one format, for example, a publisher may be clustered as IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Publ by IEEE, Publ by  Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Publ by Inst of Electr and Electron Eng, etc.

Indexers choose terms from the controlled vocabulary to describe the content of the articles they index. The controlled vocabulary is used to standardize the way the articles are indexed, and ensures consistency and accuracy in search retrieval.
    <br><br>
    The Compendex and Inspec thesauri are hierarchical in nature. Terms are organized by broader, narrower or related concepts. Articles are indexed using the most specific controlled vocabulary terms available. For example, an article about metal testing in general is indexed in Compendex under <i>metal testing</i> rather than <i>materials testing</i>. Articles specifically about steel testing are indexed under steel testing instead of  <i>metal testing</i>.

If you have access to both Compendex and Inspec, you need to choose the thesaurus you wish to search by clicking on the radio button beneath <b>Select Database</b>. This is because the controlled vocabulary for each database is different, and a subject term that is useful for for one database may yield unexpected results (or none at all) in the other. If you do not have access to Inspec, only Compendex will appear.
    <br><br>
    Terms selected from the Compendex thesaurus will be searched in the Compendex database, terms selected from the Inspec thesaurus will be searched in the Inspec database.
    <br><br>
    Terms chosen from the thesaurus automatically appear in a <b>Search Box</b> so that they can be included in a query.
    <br><br>
    If you switch from one thesaurus to another, the selections in the Search Box will be deleted. Some terms are common to both databases, but many controlled terms are unique to Compendex or Inspec. Because of this, each thesaurus must be searched separately.
