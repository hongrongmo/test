<h1 class="whs2">PaperChem 
 Search Fields and Limits</h1>

<p class="whs3">The following 
 fields are searchable in PaperChem:</p>

<p class="whs3"><a href="Expert_Search_Fields_and_Fields__Codes.htm">Click 
 here for a full list of all available search fields on Expert search</a></p>

<p class="whs4">All fields</p>

<p class="whs5"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Searching 
 &quot;All Fields&quot; retrieves results from any of the following fields: 
 Abstract, Title, Translated Title, Author, Author affiliation, Serial 
 title, Monograph title, CODEN, ISSN, ISBN, Publisher, Accession number, 
 Conference name, Conference date, Conference location, Sponsor, Index 
 terms, Language, Document type.</span> </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;All 
 Fields&quot; is the default for PaperChem. </p>

<p class="whs5">Abstract</p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 &quot;Abstract&quot; finds terms in the abstract field. </p>

<p class="whs3">To search 
 for an exact phrase, enclose term within braces or quotation marks. For 
 example: </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;Dutch 
 elm disease&quot; wn AB</p>

<p class="whs3">{quality 
 control} wn AB </p>

<p class="whs5">Accession number</p>

<p class="whs3">The accession 
 number is a unique number assigned to each record in PaperChem. It is 
 only displayed in the detailed record format. </p>

<p class="whs3">7601917 wn 
 AN </p>

<p class="whs5">Author</p>

<p class="whs3">Since author 
 names may be cited in a variety of formats, use of the Author Browse Index 
 is highly recommended. PaperChem cites authors' names as they appear in 
 the original document. Surnames appear first, usually followed by a comma 
 and the remainder of the name as it appears in the original document. 
 Initials may appear with or without periods. </p>

<p class="whs3">If the document 
 is cited by initials and a surname, but a full name is indicated somewhere 
 in the original publication, such as in the table of contents, then all 
 the known information is provided. Titles such as Sir and Mister and educational 
 degrees are not included. </p>

<p class="whs3">Author names 
 can be truncated by using an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol: </p>

<p class="whs3">Smith, A* 
 wn AU will retrieve Smith, A., Smith A. D., Smith Alan, Smith, Ann, etc. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Be aware 
 that this strategy may lead to false hits because there are many authors 
 with the same last name and first initial. </p>

<p class="whs3">Note that 
 only authors whose names are presented in the format given will be retrieved. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 on Smith, A. B. wn AU will not retrieve articles with the author cited 
 as Smith, A. </p>

<p class="whs3">If a single 
 word surname is entered as the author's last name, all of the forms of 
 that name will be retrieved. </p>

<p class="whs3">Brown wn 
 au will retrieve:</p>

<p class="whs3">Brown, C., 
 Brown, James T., Brown, Sheila, etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">To further 
 refine this search, add the truncation symbol after the first initial. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Brown, A* 
 wn au will retrieve: </p>

<p class="whs3">Brown, A, 
 Brown, A.F., Brown, A.L., Brown, Alan J., Brown, Alex, etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">When records 
 are displayed, author names are hyperlinked. Click on an author hyperlink 
 to retrieve records by that author from the entire date range of the database. 
 </p>

<p class="whs5">Author affiliation</p>

<p class="whs3">The formats 
 and abbreviations used in author affiliations have changed over the years. 
 Use of the author affiliation Browse Index is highly recommended. Author 
 affiliations are displayed in the detailed record. </p>

<p class="whs3"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>CODEN</B></span> 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">CODEN are 
 six character representations of serial titles. They can be used to limit 
 results to a specific journal. You can find a journal's CODEN at the abstract 
 and detailed level of a record. </p>

<p class="whs5">Conference information</p>

<p class="whs3">Conference 
 information includes the name, date, location and sponsor of a conference. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Index 
 Term</B></span> </p>

<p class="whs3">The controlled 
 vocabulary used to index records in PaperChem can be found in the Thesaurus 
 of Pulp and Paper. The 3rd edition contains 22,000 terms. Approximately 
 50% of the entries are preferred key terms; the rest are cross-reference 
 terms. For each preferred term there are, on average, 12 analytical entries, 
 including, homonym resolutions, scope notes, definitions, warning notes, 
 broader terms, narrower terms, cluster terms, other related terms, cross-references 
 and inverse-reference or USED FOR entries. Nearly 25% of the entries are 
 Latin and common names of trees and other biological species. </p>

<p class="whs3">These terms 
 appear hyperlinked in the abstract and detailed record format. Clicking 
 on any of these will retrieve records spanning the date range of the original 
 search. </p>

<p class="whs5">Document type</p>

<p class="whs3">Document 
 types are used to describe the type of source publications from which 
 indexed papers are taken. In Expert Search, the document type can be searched 
 directly or selected from the Document Type Browse Index, e.g. JA wn DT 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">The document 
 types used in PaperChem are: </p>

<p class="whs3">All document 
 types (default)</p>

<p class="whs3">Conference 
 article</p>

<p class="whs3">Conference 
 proceeding </p>

<p class="whs3">Dissertation 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Journal article</p>

<p class="whs3">Monograph 
 chapter</p>

<p class="whs3">Monograph 
 review</p>

<p class="whs3">Patent</p>

<p class="whs5">International Standard Book Number (ISBN) 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">ISBNs are 
 10 or 13 character representations of monograph titles. They can be used 
 to find chapters from the same monograph or papers from the same conference. 
 The ISBN will be given at the abstract or detailed level of a record. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">8985203494 
 wn BN </p>

<p class="whs5">International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">ISSNs are 
 nine character alphanumeric representations of serial titles formatted 
 as two sets of four numbers separated by a hyphen. The last digit can 
 be an X. They can be used to limit results to a specific journal. You 
 can find a journal's ISSN at the abstract and detailed level of a record 
 as well as in the Serial Title Browse Index. </p>

<p class="whs5">Language</p>

<p class="whs3">In Expert 
 Search, language can be searched directly or selected from the Language 
 Browse Index, e.g. Turkish wn la. </p>

<p class="whs3">A complete 
 list of available languages within the PaperChem database is in the Language 
 Browse Index in Expert Search. </p>

<p class="whs3">The language 
 of the document is given at the end of the citation if it is other than 
 English </p>

<p class="whs3">If more than 
 one language is given, they are separated by a comma, for example: </p>

<p class="whs3">French, German 
 </p>

<p class="whs5">Patent Information</p>

<p class="whs3">The patent 
 information field contains the patent number, application number, priority 
 number, assignee and patent classification code </p>

<p class="whs5">Publisher</p>

<p class="whs3">Search on 
 the &quot;Publisher&quot; field to identify publishers, or find the journals 
 published by a particular publisher. Be sure to look for all versions 
 of a publisher's name. To do so, it is helpful to refer to the Publisher 
 Browse Index. </p>

<p class="whs3">TAPPI is 
 referred to as: </p>

<p class="whs3">TAPPI, TAPPI 
 Press, TAPPI/CPPA, Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry 
 (TAPPI). </p>

<p class="whs5">Serial title</p>

<p class="whs3">Search on 
 the &quot;Serial Title&quot; field if you want to identify serial titles, 
 e.g., journals, monographs or conference proceedings, from your area of 
 study. </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 for pulp wn st will retrieve citations whose sources will include: </p>

<p class="whs3">Walden's 
 North American Pulp Paper Report </p>

<p class="whs3">PPI Pulp 
 and Paper International</p>

<p class="whs3">Process Control 
 News (for the Pulp and Paper Industries)</p>

<p class="whs3">As variations 
 of serial title names sometimes appear, it is a good idea to use the Serial 
 Title Browse Index. The look-up index also includes serial monograph and 
 conference titles. The Serial Title Browse Index also allows you to limit 
 the search to an exact title match, e.g. &quot;Science.&quot; </p>

<p class="whs5">Subject/Title/Abstract</p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 &quot;Subject/Title/Abstract&quot; retrieves results from any of the following 
 fields: Abstract, Title, Translated title, Index terms. </p>

<p class="whs5">Title</p>

<p class="whs3">If you want 
 to search for specific terms within the title, search on the &quot;Title&quot; 
 field. Words in a title are often an indication of the importance of those 
 terms in the article. </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;Conservation&quot; 
 in the title will likely find articles where &quot;conservation&quot; 
 is an important aspect of the article. </p>

<p class="whs5">Limit by Date</p>

<p class="whs5">Year Limits</p>

<p class="whs3">If you do 
 not find what you need, broaden your search by selecting the date range 
 limit and expanding the range of your search to the last year, the last 
 five years, etc. </p>

<p class="whs5">Updates</p>

<p class="whs3">Selecting 
 this option allows you to limit your search by the 1, 2, 3, or 4 most 
 recent weekly database updates.</p>

<p class="whs5">Browse Indexes</p>

<p class="whs3">The Browse 
 Indexes help you select appropriate terms for your search. PaperChem Expert 
 Search has indexes for author, author affiliation, serial title, publisher, 
 index term, treatment type, document type and language. </p>

<p class="whs3">From the 
 Browse Indexes box (located on the right hand side of the page), select 
 the index you wish to use by clicking on the radio button next to it and 
 then clicking on &quot;Browse.&quot; </p>

<p class="whs3">Once the 
 index is loaded, you can navigate by either selecting the first letter(s) 
 of the term you wish to search for or by typing in the first few letters 
 of the term in the SEARCH FOR box and clicking on &quot;Find.&quot; </p>

<p class="whs3">In Expert 
 Search, when you select a term from the index, it is automatically pasted 
 into the textbox with the wn (within) command and the field code. You 
 can select as many terms as needed, e.g. (({SMITH, JOHN}) WN AU) OR (({SMITH, 
 JOHN A}) WN AU) OR (({SMITH, JOHN L}) </p>

<p class="whs3">The Author 
 Browse Index is useful for searching on author names, especially for searching 
 for authors with very common surnames. For example: </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 on author Alan Smith, as Smith, A* will retrieve records by other authors 
 such as Smith, Ann or Smith, Anthony.</p>
