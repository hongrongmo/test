<p class="whs6">Accession number</p>

<p class="whs3">The accession 
 number is a unique number assigned to each record in Compendex. It is 
 only displayed in the detailed record format. Accession number can be 
 searched in All Fields in Easy, Quick or Expert Searches or by itself 
 in Expert Search.</p>

<p class="whs3">20101812909933 
 wn AN </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Author</p>

<p class="whs3">Since author 
 names may be cited in a variety of formats, use of the Author Browse Index 
 is highly recommended, e.g., Rigby, Alan A. or Rigby, A.A. 
 Author names are cited as they appear in the original document. Surnames 
 appear first, usually followed by a comma and the remainder of the name 
 as it appears in the original document. </p>

<p class="whs3">If the author 
 is cited by initials and a surname, but a full name is indicated somewhere 
 in the original publication, such as in the table of contents, then all 
 the known information is provided. Titles such as Sir and Mister and educational 
 degrees are not included in the current Compendex database. They may appear 
 in the Salutation field in the Engineering Index Backfile. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Since 1976, 
 if no personal author name appears on the document then the institutional 
 author is added to the author affiliation field and Anon will then appear 
 in the author field. </p>

<p class="whs3">Author names 
 can be truncated by using an asterisk (*) as the truncation symbol: </p>

<p class="whs3">Smith, A* 
 will retrieve </p>

<p class="whs3">Smith, A.</p>

<p class="whs3">Smith A.A.</p>

<p class="whs3">Smith A.B.</p>

<p class="whs3">Smith, A. 
 Brandon</p>

<p class="whs3">Smith, Aaron 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Smith Aaron 
 C., etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Be aware 
 that this strategy may lead to false hits because there are many authors 
 with the same last name and first initial. </p>

<p class="whs3">Note that 
 only authors whose names are presented in the format given will be retrieved. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 on Smith, A. B. will not retrieve articles with the author cited as Smith, 
 A. </p>

<p class="whs3">If a single 
 word surname is entered as the author's last name, all of the forms of 
 that name will be retrieved. </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers 
 will retrieve:</p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 A. </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 D. M.</p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 Donald M., 
 etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">To further 
 refine this search, add the truncation symbol after the first initial. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 D* will retrieve: 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 D. M. </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 D.M. </p>

<p class="whs3">Bers, 
 Donald M., 
 etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Editors and 
 compilers are also listed in the author field. They are distinguished 
 from authors by the notations (ed.) 
 or (compiler) in parentheses following the names. </p>

<p class="whs3">To search 
 on the name of a person who could be an author, an editor or a compiler 
 of a document, truncate after the known part of the name. This will allow 
 for retrieval of the notations (ed.) 
 or (compiler). </p>

<p class="whs3">When records 
 are displayed, author names are hyperlinked. 
 Click on an author hyperlink to retrieve additional records by that author 
 from the entire date range of the database (1970-present, or 1884 to present 
 if you have the Engineering Index Backfile). 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Author Affiliation</p>

<p class="whs3">In the past, 
 the official Compendex policy was to provide the institutional affiliation 
 of the first author or editor, if it could be determined from the source 
 document. Later, the affiliation of the corresponding author, who is often 
 the first author, was displayed. Now affiliations are displayed for all 
 authors. Email addresses are also provided, when available, for the corresponding 
 author. </p>

<p class="whs3">In addition 
 to this policy change, in some given affiliations (if it can be determined 
 from the source document) more than one level of the organization is cited. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">The formats 
 and abbreviations used in author affiliations have varied over the years. 
 For example, in the 1970s, an affiliation might be cited as follows: </p>

<p class="whs3">Nippon 
 Telegr &amp; 
 Teleph Public 
 Corp, </p>

<p class="whs3">Ibaraki 
 Electr Electr 
 Commun Lab 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">In the 1980s: 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Inst 
 of Electrical Engineers of Japan, </p>

<p class="whs3">Committee 
 on Electrical Insulating Materials, </p>

<p class="whs3">Jpn, 
 Insulating Materials, (Jpn)</p>

<p class="whs3">1990s to

<p class="whs3">Corresponding 
 non-English terms (e.g., Akademy) 
 may also be abbreviated. </p>

<p class="whs3">Other variations 
 in affiliation names may occur for some of the following reasons: </p>

<p class="whs3">An organization's 
 name may be given in different forms in different source documents. Variations 
 may be due to language, for example: </p>

<p class="whs3">Goteborg 
 Univ. </p>

<p class="whs3">Gothenburg 
 Univ.</p>

<p class="whs3">An organization's 
 name may change over the course of time, e.g.: </p>

<p class="whs3">Mobil is 
 now named Exxon Mobil </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Classification Code</p>

<p class="whs3">The Compendex 
 classification scheme, available in print form in the Ei 
 Thesaurus, is a numerical hierarchy of general subject categories. These 
 subject categories are used to place a term into context when the meaning 
 can vary depending on its usage. As an example, windows can refer to building 
 materials or software. The classification codes for building materials 
 (42*) and computer and data processing (72*) will limit the search to 
 the proper area. Classification codes can be found in the Abstract and 
 Detailed views and also in the Thesaurus view. </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 by classification code can retrieve a large, relevant set of results without 
 using synonyms. The Classification Code field is not searchable in the 
 Engineering Index Backfile. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">72* wn 
 CL</p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;804.2&quot; 
 wn CL</p>

<p class="whs7">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs8">CODEN 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">CODEN 
 are six-character representations of source titles. They can be used to 
 limit results to a specific journal. CODEN 
 can be found in Ulrich's 
 Periodicals Directory and CASSI: 
 Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index. You can also find a journal's 
 CODEN at the 
 abstract and detailed level of a record. </p>

<p class="whs3">MMPRE8 wn 
 CN</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs9"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Conference 
 Code</B></span> </p>

<p class="whs3">A Conference 
 Code is a number assigned to a conference proceedings record and every 
 paper from that conference covered by Compendex. This allows you to locate 
 every paper from a conference once you have found one paper. The conference 
 code can be found in the detailed record format. </p>

<p class="whs3">The conference 
 code was first used in 1982. Conferences covered in Compendex prior to 
 1982 do not contain conference codes. </p>

<p class="whs3">13969 wn 
 CC</p>

<p class="whs3">Conference 
 Information</p>

<p class="whs3">Conference 
 information includes the name, date, location and sponsor of a conference 
 as well as the conference code number. </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;Salt 
 Lake City&quot; wn 
 CF</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Controlled Term</p>

<p class="whs3">The controlled 
 vocabulary used to index records in Compendex can be found in the Ei 
 Thesaurus. The 64th edition of the Ei 
 Thesaurus contains 19,676 terms; 10,256 are descriptors (preferred terms) 
 and 9,420 are entry terms (non-preferred). In the 6th edition, 371 new 
 descriptors were added, as well as 50 new entry terms. The terms can now 
 be identified by using the thesaurus function from the navigation bar. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Ei's 
 controlled vocabulary is a list of subject terms used to describe the 
 content of a document in the most specific and consistent way possible. 
 These terms can also be browsed in the Ei 
 Controlled term Browse Index in Engineering Village. </p>

<p class="whs3">These terms 
 also appear hyperlinked 
 in the abstract and detailed record formats. Clicking on any of these 
 will retrieve records spanning the default time period of the database. 
 In 1993, Ei 
 updated the format of its controlled vocabulary. Pre-1993 records retained 
 their former format. </p>

<p class="whs3">The former 
 heading-subheading organization was abandoned. Each index term now stands 
 alone. Old heading-subheading controlled terms have been updated in several 
 different ways: </p>

<p class="whs3">Electromagnetic 
 waves - Absorption</p>

<p class="whs3">is now indexed 
 as: </p>

<p class="whs3">Electromagnetic 
 wave absorption </p>

<p class="whs3">The aspect 
 of Electromagnetic waves called Absorption is now part of the main heading. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">Electronic 
 circuits, Frequency dividing</p>

<p class="whs3">is now</p>

<p class="whs3">Frequency 
 dividing circuits</p>

<p class="whs3">The main 
 heading subheading structure is converted to natural language. </p>

<p class="whs3">Electron 
 tube - Reliability</p>

<p class="whs3">is now: </p>

<p class="whs3">Electron 
 tubes and Reliability</p>

<p class="whs3">The two aspects 
 represented in this main heading, subheading are separated as individual 
 terms. </p>

<p class="whs3">Light - Coherent</p>

<p class="whs3">is now</p>

<p class="whs3">Coherent 
 Light</p>

<p class="whs3">When a subheading 
 modifies, or adds additional explanation to the main heading, the order 
 is now reversed presented as a single term. </p>

<p class="whs3">In Expert 
 Search, use CV 
 to search for controlled terms: </p>

<p class="whs3">Geochemistry 
 wn CV</p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;environmental 
 impact&quot; wn 
 CV</p>

<p class="whs3">{gold ore 
 treatment} 
 wn CV</p>

<p class="whs3">Users searching 
 on controlled terms for material published before 1993 will find it helpful 
 to use both the Ei 
 controlled term look-up indexes and the online thesaurus as aids in determining 
 all the appropriate terms. </p>

<p class="whs3">Most Compendex 
 records are assigned a heading that serves to represent the major subject 
 aspect of the document (Main Heading). The subject terms that follow describe 
 additional concepts dealt with in the article. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs9"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>ISBN 
 (International Standard Book Number)</B></span> </p>

<p class="whs3">The International 
 Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a formerly 10-, now 13-digit number &nbsp;that 
 uniquely identifies a specific title and edition of a monograph or monographic 
 series. The number can be used to find chapters from the same monograph 
 or papers from the same conference. The ISBN appears at the abstract or 
 detailed level of a record. An ISBN is searchable in All Fields for Easy, 
 Quick or Expert Search or individually according to the specific search 
 code in Expert Search.</p>

<p class="whs3">978-0-87339-255-8 
 wn BN 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)</p>

<p class="whs3">The ISSN 
 is a standardized international alphanumeric code that is a unique and 
 precise identifier for a serial publication. The format of the ISSN is 
 an eight-digit number, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers. 
 The last digit, which may be 0-9 or an X, is a check digit. It can be 
 used to limit search results to a specific journal or serial conference 
 proceeding. It can be searched with or without the hyphen. The ISSN is 
 displayed in abstract and detailed formats. There may be an E-ISSN displayed, 
 which is assigned to the electronic version of a serial.</p>

<p class="whs3">0747-9812 
 wn SN</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Issue and Volume</p>

<p class="whs10"><span><font size=2 style="font-size:10pt;">Searching on Issue and Volume is 
 most useful and effective when you have a specific ISSN to search on. 
 The search would be on the ISSN (which is a unique identifier of a source) 
 and then on the volume or volume/issue. It is less effective (i.e., returning 
 too many results) if you only search on volume or issue, as many different 
 sources may have the same volume or issue numbers, e.g., vol. 5/issue 
 6. &nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p class="whs10">So, if the ISSN is, for example, 10895639, 
 and the volume you want to find is v. 113, and the issue is 52, then the 
 search would be this:</p>

<p class="whs10">10895639 and 113 wn VO and 52 wn SU</p>

<p class="whs10">Using the above example, you could also 
 just search on the ISSN and volume, or ISSN and issue, but the latter 
 would be less useful because issue 52 could be from volume 110, 112, or 
 113, etc.</p>

<p class="whs10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Main Heading</p>

<p class="whs3">Most Compendex 
 records are assigned a main descriptor, which is a subject classification 
 that serves to represent the main topic of the document, i.e., the Main 
 Heading. Descriptors are referred to as controlled vocabulary terms, and 
 all Main Headings are also controlled vocabulary terms. The controlled 
 vocabulary terms that follow the Main Heading represent additional concepts 
 found in the article. </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;ammonium 
 compounds&quot; wn MH 
 </p>

<p class="whs8">Publisher</p>

<p class="whs3">Search on 
 the Publisher field to identify publishers, or find the journals published 
 by a particular publisher. Be sure to look for all versions of a publisher's 
 name. To do so, it is helpful to refer to the Publisher Browse Index. 
 For example, American Institute of Physics is also referred to as: </p>

<p class="whs3">AIP</p>

<p class="whs3">AIP 
 Press</p>

<p class="whs3">Am Inst 
 Phys</p>

<p class="whs3">American 
 Inst Phys 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">In Expert 
 Search, use PN 
 to search this field: </p>

<p class="whs3">Elsevier 
 wn PN</p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;American 
 institute of physics&quot; wn 
 PN</p>

<p class="whs3">{AIP 
 Press} wn 
 PN</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Source Title</p>

<p class="whs3">Search on 
 the Source Title field if you want to identify source titles, e.g., journals, 
 monographs or conference proceedings, from your area of study. </p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 for polymer* 
 in the &quot;Source title&quot; field will retrieve citations whose sources 
 will include: </p>

<p class="whs3">Polymers 
 for Advanced Technologies </p>

<p class="whs3">Journal of 
 Applied Polymer Science, etc. </p>

<p class="whs3">To conduct 
 an exact source title search, enclose the full title in braces or quotation 
 marks. </p>

<p class="whs3">{X-Ray Spectrometry} 
 wn ST</p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;Journal 
 of X-Ray Science and Technology&quot; wn 
 ST</p>

<p class="whs3">As variations 
 of source title names sometimes occur, it is a good idea to use the Source 
 Title Browse Index. The look-up index also includes monographs and conference 
 titles. </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Subject/Title/Abstract</p>

<p class="whs3">Searching 
 Subject/Title/Abstract retrieves results from any of the following fields: 
 Abstract, Title, Translated title, Ei 
 controlled terms, Ei 
 main heading and Uncontrolled terms. </p>

<p class="whs3">This is an 
 effective way to maximize the relevance of your search results. </p>

<p class="whs3">To search 
 for an exact phrase, enclose terms within braces or quotation marks. For 
 example: </p>

<p class="whs3">{international 
 space station}</p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;linear 
 induction motors&quot; </p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Title</p>

<p class="whs3">If you want 
 to search for specific terms within the title, search on the Title field. 
 Words in a title are often indicators of the main focus of the article. 
 </p>

<p class="whs3">&quot;Radio 
 frequency&quot; in the title will likely find articles where radio frequency 
 is an important aspect of the article. </p>

 language documents, the original title is displayed word for word. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">If the document 
 is written in a language other than English, but uses the western alphabet, 
 an English language translation is often provided, as well as the title 
 in the original language. Our current policy is to provide title translations 
 only for the following languages: Dutch, French, Germany, Italian, Portuguese, 
 and Spanish.</p>

<p class="whs3">For languages 
 not using the Roman alphabet, a translated or transliterated title may 
 appear. </p>

<p class="whs4">Uncontrolled Term</p>

<p class="whs3">Uncontrolled 
 terms, also known as free language terms, are additional entry, or non-preferred, 
 subject terms. These terms are not assigned from the Ei 
 Thesaurus, rather are derived from the abstract and author keywords. New 
 terminology is displayed in this field. The uncontrolled terms allow for 
 further specificity in indexing that is not available using controlled 
 vocabulary. Uncontrolled terms are reviewed periodically as candidate 
 terms that my eventually be incorporated into the Ei Thesaurus. </p>

<p class="whs3">Uncontrolled 
 terms are searchable in All Fields for Easy, Quick, or Expert Search or 
 individually according to the specific search code in Expert Search. These 
 terms are also searchable in the Subject/Title/Abstract search in Quick 
 Search.</p>
