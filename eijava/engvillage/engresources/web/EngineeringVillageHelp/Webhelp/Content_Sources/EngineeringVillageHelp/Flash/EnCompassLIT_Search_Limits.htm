 Search Fields and Limits</h1>

<p class="whs3">All fields</p>

<p class="whs4">Searching 
 retrieves results from any of the following fields: Subject/Title/Abstract, 
 Abstract, Author, Author affiliation, Title, Conference information, Publisher, 
 Serial Title, Controlled Term and CAS Registry Number.</p>

<p class="whs3">Subject/Title/Abstract</p>

<p class="whs4">Searching 
 retrieves results from any of the following fields: Subject, Abstract, 
 &nbsp;and Title, 
 as well as Controlled term, and Uncontrolled terms. To search for an exact 
 phrase, enclose term within braces or quotation marks: </p>

<p class="whs4">{EMISSION 
 CONTROL}</p>

<p class="whs4">&quot;DIESEL 
 FUEL&quot;</p>

<p class="whs4">Search for 
 chemical compounds with subscript or superscript (in fields other than 
 controlled terms). Perform an exact match search using { }, as follows:</p>

<p class="whs4">{AL sub 3} 
 to search for Al3</p>

<p class="whs4">{AL sup 3} 
 to search for Al3</p>

<p class="whs4">Do not use 
 special characters such as &lt;&gt; ( ) in this syntax. Note, the application 
 does not support concatenation of sub and sup. </p>

<p class="whs3">Abstract </p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 single terms and/or phrases. To search for an exact phrase, enclose term 
 within braces or quotation marks. </p>

<p class="whs4">{FLUID CATALYTIC 
 CRACKING}</p>

<p class="whs4">&quot;PETROLEUM 
 DISTILLATION&quot; </p>

<p class="whs3">Author </p>

<p class="whs4">Search in 
 the format: LAST NAME - SPACE - FIRST INITIAL - SPACE - MIDDLE INITIAL. 
 This field contains company names as well. Note that the number of initials 
 may vary; also, on some names in older records, a suffix may be included, 
 e.g., JR or III. TONG Y</p>

<p class="whs4">When the 
 initials are not known, use truncation (*):</p>

<p class="whs4">MULLENIX*</p>

<p class="whs4">When searching 
 for authors, or an author, it is recommended that you use the Author Browse 
 Index since author names may be cited in a variety of formats.</p>

<p class="whs4">&nbsp;<img src="EnCompassLIT_Search_Fields_and_Limits_-_1.GIF" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="485px" height="498px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></p>

<p class="whs3">Author affiliation</p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 single words or phrases. To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within 
 braces or quotation marks. </p>

<p class="whs4">TOTALFINAELF</p>

<p class="whs4">&quot;LUBRIZOL 
 CORP&quot; </p>

<p class="whs4">Prior to 
 2001, the official EnCompass policy was to provide the institutional affiliation 
 of the first author or editor, if it could be determined from the source 
 document. (Note: some author affiliation may appear in the author field.) 
 </p>

<p class="whs4">In 2001, 
 this policy changed. The affiliation of the corresponding author is now 
 given instead. </p>

<p class="whs4">When searching 
 for author affiliation it is recommended that you use the Author Affiliation 
 Browse Index since author affiliation names may be cited in a variety 
 of formats.</p>

<p class="whs4"><img src="EnCompassLIT_Search_Fields_and_Limits_-_2.GIF" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="485px" height="498px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></p>

<p class="whs3">Title</p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 single words or phrases. To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within 
 braces or quotation marks. </p>

<p class="whs4">&quot;EMISSON 
 CONTROL&quot; </p>

<p class="whs4">CATALYST 
 AND HYDROCONVERSION</p>

<p class="whs4">Conference 
 Information</p>

<p class="whs4">Conference 
 information includes the name, date, location and sponsor of a conference 
 as well as the conference code number. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs4">Conference 
 date is not searchable the way it is displayed. &nbsp;For 
 example, if the conference dates are May 6, 2007 through May 10, 2007, 
 the search should be run for 20070506 AND 20070510.</p>

<p class="whs3">Publisher</p>

<p class="whs4">Search on 
 the Publisher field to identify publishers, or find the journals published 
 by a particular publisher. Be sure to look for all versions of a publisher's 
 name. To do so, it is helpful to refer to the Publisher Browse Index.</p>

<p class="whs4"><img src="EnCompassLIT_Search_Fields_and_Limits_-_3.GIF" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="485px" height="498px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></p>

<p class="whs3">Serial title</p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 single words or phrases. To search for an exact phrase, enclose term within 
 braces or quotation marks. When searching for serial title it is recommended 
 that you use the Serial Title Browse Index. Search by ISSN (International 
 Standard Serial Number) for a specific journal. These terms also appear 
 hyperlinked in the abstract and detailed record format. Clicking on any 
 of these will retrieve records spanning the date range of the original 
 search.</p>

<p class="whs4"><img src="EnCompassLIT_Search_Fields_and_Limits_-_4.GIF" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="485px" height="498px" border="0" class="img_whs5"></p>

<p class="whs3">Controlled Term</p>

<p class="whs4">Free-language 
 retrieval is available with the EnCompassLIT but the most direct access 
 to relevant items is through use of a controlled vocabulary. The controlled 
 vocabulary used to index records in EnCompassLIT can be found in the EnCompass 
 Thesaurus (The Authoritative Guide To Searching The EnCompass Technical 
 Literature And Patent Databases). The latest edition of the EnCompass 
 Thesaurus contains over 6,500 valid controlled terms. New controlled terms 
 are added each year and are selected based on their usage in technical 
 publications and recommendations of industry experts.</p>

<p class="whs4">&quot;THREE 
 WAY CATALYST&quot;</p>

<p class="whs4">{ETHYLENE 
 HOMOPOLYMER}</p>

<p class="whs4">ANILINE</p>

<p class="whs4">EnCompass 
 controlled vocabulary is a list of subject terms used to describe the 
 content of a document in the most specific and consistent way possible. 
 These terms can be browsed in the Controlled term Browse Index.</p>

<p class="whs4"><img src="EnCompassLIT_Search_Fields_and_Limits_-_5.GIF" x-maintain-ratio="TRUE" width="481px" height="492px" border="0" class="img_whs6"></p>

<p class="whs4">For a more 
 detailed explanation on how to search the EnCompassLIT, please refer to 
 the EnCompassLIT/EnCompassPAT User Manual (A comprehensive manual for 
 searches using the EnCompass technical literature (LIT) and patents (PAT 
 and WPAM) databases). </p>

<p class="whs4">These terms 
 also appear hyperlinked in the abstract and detailed record format. Clicking 
 on any of these will retrieve records spanning the date range of the original 
 search. </p>

<p class="whs3">CAS registry number</p>

<p class="whs4">Search using 
 registry numbers assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service to chemical 
 compounds. All valid Registry Numbers for EnCompassLIT are listed in Appendix 
 C of the EnCompass Thesaurus.</p>

<p class="whs4">Displayed 
 CAS registry numbers (with the chemical name) are hyperlinked in the abstract 
 and detailed record format. Clicking on any of these will retrieve records 
 spanning the date range of the original search. </p>

 Browse Indexes box (located on the right hand side of the page); select 
 the index you wish to use by clicking on the radio button next to it and 
 then clicking on Browse. </p>

<p class="whs4">Valid Browse 
 Indexes for Quick Search in EnCompassLIT are:</p>

<p class="whs4">Author</p>

<p class="whs4">Author affiliation</p>

<p class="whs4">Controlled 
 term </p>

<p class="whs4">Serial title</p>

<p class="whs4">Publisher</p>

<p class="whs4">Once the 
 index is loaded, you can navigate by either selecting the first letter(s) 
 of the term you wish to search for or by typing in the first few letters 
 of the term in the SEARCH FOR box and clicking on <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Find</B></span>. 
 </p>

<p class="whs4">In Quick 
 Search, when you select a term from the index, it is automatically pasted 
 into the first available textbox. The SEARCH FOR box will also be changed 
 to the appropriate field. Un-selecting the term from the index will remove 
 it from the textbox. If you select more than three terms, the fourth term 
 will overwrite the term in the third textbox. </p>

<p class="whs4">You can also 
 choose to have the second and third index terms pasted from the indexes 
 with either a Boolean AND or OR 
 connecting them. See the <a href="Boolean_Operators.htm">Boolean Operators</a> 
 section of the Engineering Village Help File for more information on Boolean 
 operators.</p>
