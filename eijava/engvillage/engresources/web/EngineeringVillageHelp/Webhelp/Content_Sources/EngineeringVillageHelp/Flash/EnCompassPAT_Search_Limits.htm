 Search Fields and Limits</h1>

<p class="whs3">All fields</p>

<p class="whs4">Searching 
 retrieves results from any of the following fields: Accession number, 
 Patent title, Inventor, Patent assignee, Patent country, Publication date, 
 Publication year, Language, Application information, Priority information, 
 International patent classification, Derwent accession number, Abstract, 
 Designated states , Classification code, Controlled terms (displayed also 
 as Major terms and/or Link terms), CAS registry numbers and Uncontrolled 
 terms. </p>

<p class="whs3">Subject/Title/Abstract</p>

<p class="whs4">Searching 
 retrieves results from any of the following fields: Abstract, Patent title,

 chemical compounds with subscript or superscript (in fields other than 
 controlled terms). Perform an exact match search using { }, as follows:</p>

<p class="whs4">{AL sub 3} 
 to search for Al3</p>

<p class="whs4">{AL sup 3} 
 to search for Al3</p>

<p class="whs4">Do not use 
 special characters such as &lt;&gt; ( ) in this syntax. Note, the application 
 does not support concatenation of sub and sup. </p>

<p class="whs3">Abstract </p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 single terms and/or phrases. To search for an exact phrase, enclose term

 A</p>

<p class="whs4">When the 
 initials are not known, use truncation (*):</p>

<p class="whs4">BOYLE* </p>

<p class="whs4">When searching 
 for inventor, it is recommended that you use the Inventor Browse Index 
 since inventor names may be cited in a variety of formats.</p>

 CORP&quot;</p>

<p class="whs4">When the 
 full name of patent assignee is not known, use truncation (*):</p>

<p class="whs4">EXXON* </p>

<p class="whs4">When searching 
 for Patent assignee it is recommended that you use the Patent assignee 
 Browse Index since patent assignee names may be cited in a variety of 
 formats.</p>

<p class="whs4">Patent number</p>

<p class="whs4">Search in 
 the format:</p>

<p class="whs4">NNNNNNN</p>

<p class="whs4">YYNNNNN </p>

<p class="whs4">YYYYNNNNN</p>

<p class="whs4">Combine the 
 patent number search with the Patent country:</p>

<p class="whs4">0010012 and 
 EP</p>

<p class="whs4">9859116 and 
 WO</p>

<p class="whs4">2004000138 
 and US </p>

<p class="whs3">Controlled Term</p>

<p class="whs4">Free-language 
 retrieval is available with the EnCompassPAT but the most direct access 
 to relevant items is through use of a controlled vocabulary. The controlled 
 vocabulary used to index records in EnCompassPAT can be found in the <span 
 style="font-weight: bold;"><B>EnCompass Thesaurus</B></span> (The Authoritative 
 Guide To Searching The EnCompass Technical Literature And Patent Databases). 
 The latest edition of the EnCompass Thesaurus contains over 6,500 valid 
 controlled terms. New controlled terms are added each year and are selected 
 based on their usage in technical publications and recommendations of 
 industry experts. </p>

<p class="whs4">EnCompass 
 controlled vocabulary is a list of subject terms used to describe the 
 content of a document in the most specific and consistent way possible. 
 These terms can be browsed in the Controlled term Browse Index. </p>

<p class="whs4">For a more 
 detailed explanation on how to search the EnCompassPAT, please refer to 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>EnCompassLIT/EnCompassPAT User Manual</B></span> 
 (A comprehensive manual for searches using the EnCompass technical literature 
 (LIT) and patents (PAT) databases). </p>

 HOMOPOLYMER}</p>

<p class="whs4">ANILINE</p>

<p class="whs4">Controlled 
 terms are displayed in control term and/or major term and/or link term 
 fields.</p>

<p class="whs4">Displayed 
 Controlled terms (including Major terms) are hyperlinked in the abstract 
 and detailed record format. Clicking on any of these will retrieve records 
 spanning the date range of the original search. </p>

<p class="whs3">International patent classification</p>

<p class="whs4">Search in 
 the format:</p>

<p class="whs4">ANNA-NNNNN 
 (from 1970)</p>

<p class="whs4">ANNA-NNN/nnnn 
 (since 1992)</p>

<p class="whs3">CAS registry number</p>

<p class="whs4">Search using 
 registry numbers assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service to chemical 
 compounds. All valid Registry Numbers in EnCompassPAT are listed in Appendix 
 C of the EnCompass Thesaurus. </p>

<p class="whs4">Displayed 
 CAS registry numbers (with the chemical name) are hyperlinked in the abstract 
 and detailed record format. Clicking on any of these will retrieve records 
 spanning the default time period of the database. </p>

<p class="whs3">Patent Country</p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 country using the country codes for patent classifications.</p>

<p class="whs4">Ex: US = 
 United States of America</p>

<p class="whs4">EP = European 
 Patent Office</p>

<p class="whs3">Limit by:</p>

<p class="whs3">Language</p>

<p class="whs4">All the abstracts 
 are written in English. Language is provided for EP, and WO patents, and 
 in other cases only where the language is not the normal one for the patent 
 country. </p>

<p class="whs4">You can limit 
 your search to any language listed in the drop-down menu: All languages, 
 English, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian or Spanish. </p>

<p class="whs4">To search 
 for more than one language, or to search for a language not listed in 
 the Quick Search pull-down menu, use Expert Search. </p>

<p class="whs3">Patent (publication) year </p>

<p class="whs4">Search by 
 Patent (publication) year. Select the Patent year in drop-down boxes, 
 for example, 2000 to 2003</p>

<p class="whs4">Select the 
 same year in both date range drop-down boxes, for example, 2002 to 2002 
 </p>

<p class="whs4">Last four 
 updates</p>

<p class="whs4">Selecting 
 this option allow you to limit your search to the four most recent weekly 
 database updates. </p>

<p class="whs3">Browse indexes</p>

<p class="whs4">From the 
 Browse Indexes box (located on the right hand side of the page); select 
 the index you wish to use by clicking on the radio button next to it and 
 then clicking on Browse. </p>

<p class="whs4">Valid Browse 
 Indexes for Quick Search in EnCompassPAT are:</p>

<p class="whs4">Inventor 
 (Author)</p>

<p class="whs4">Assignee</p>

<p class="whs4">Controlled 
 Term</p>

<p class="whs4">Country</p>

<p class="whs4">Once the 
 index is loaded, you can navigate by either selecting the first letter(s) 
 of the term you wish to search for or by typing in the first few letters 
 of the term in the SEARCH FOR box and clicking on Find. </p>

<p class="whs4">In Quick 
 Search, when you select a term from the index, it is automatically pasted 
 into the first available textbox. The SEARCH FOR box will also be changed 
 to the appropriate field. Un-selecting the term from the index will remove 
 it from the textbox. If you select more than three terms, the fourth term 
 will overwrite the term in the third textbox. </p>

<p class="whs4">You can also 
 choose to have the second and third index terms pasted from the indexes 
 with either a Boolean AND or OR 
 connecting them. See the <a href="Boolean_Operators.htm">Boolean Operators</a> 
 section of the Engineering Village Help File for more information on Boolean 
 operators. </p>
