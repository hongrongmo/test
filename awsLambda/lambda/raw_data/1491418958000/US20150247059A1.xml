      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The above-described method is known (e.g., German patent application DE 199 48 004 A1, page 17, line 37, to page 19, line 22, or German patent DE 100 43 405 C1, column 3, paragraph [0018], and column 8, paragraph [0052], to column 9, paragraph [0057], in conjunction with column 6, paragraph [0039], to column 8, paragraph [0050]) and is widely used, for example, not only for the OEM finishing but also for the refinishing of automobile bodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">With the so-called basecoat/clearcoat method in question, using a wet-on-wet process, multicoat color and/or effect paint systems are obtained. In the course in particular of automotive OEM finishing, defects may occur in the resultant finish. Where defects are found in this finishâknown as the original finishâthe original finish is repaired. Where the original finish, for example, has defects extensively, the entire body or at least a corresponding portion is repaired, in other words painted a second time. Where only small defects require repair, it is only the so-called âspotâ that is repaired, not the entire body. This operation is called âspot repairâ. It is of essential significance that the finish applied at the defects for repair purposes adheres outstandingly. The corresponding finish must for example be stable toward steam jet exposure. That is, steam jet exposure must not cause any loss of adhesion at all.</p>

      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0032">Provided is a method of the type described above, by which multicoat color and/or effect paint systems are obtainable which, relative to the paint systems of the prior art, exhibit improved suitability of the coating material for refinishing. Provided also is a method by which defects on the above-identified multicoat color and/or effect paint systems can be repaired. An improved suitability of the coating material for refinishing means that the finish applied at the repaired locations adheres outstandingly there. In particular, the intention is for it to be stable toward steam jet exposure.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0033">In one or more embodiments, in stage (1) of the above-described method for producing a multicoat color and/or effect paint system a pigmented aqueous basecoat material is used, which comprises at least one phosphine oxide of the following structural formula (I):</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0034">wherein the radicals R<sup>1 </sup>to R<sup>3 </sup>are selected from the group of the aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons and, furthermore, the sum total of the weight percentage fractions of all of the phosphine oxides of structural formula (I) is 0.1% to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous basecoat material applied in stage (1).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0035">The invention also relates to the above-described pigmented aqueous material which can be used in stage (1) of the basecoat/clearcoat method.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0036">In stage (1) of the method, it is possible, in principle, to use all known aqueous basecoat materials, provided that they contain at least one of the above-defined phosphine oxides and that the sum total of the weight percentage fractions of all the phosphine oxides of structural formula (I) is 0.1% to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the aqueous basecoat material applied in stage (1). Basecoat materials are identified as âaqueousâ when they contain 30% to 70% by weight of water, based on the total weight of the basecoat material. The terms âaqueous basecoat materialâ and âwaterborne basecoat materialâ are used as synonymous terms in this specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0037">The basecoat materials of one or more embodiments comprise color and/or effect pigments. Color pigments and effect pigments of these kinds are known to the skilled person and are described for example in RÃ¶mpp-Lexikon Lacke and Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, pages 176 and 451. The fraction of the pigments may be situated for example in the range from 1 to 40% by weight, specifically 2% to 20% by weight, more specifically 5% to 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigmented aqueous basecoat material.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0038">In the method of the invention specificbasecoat materials may be used, which, as binders, comprise binders that are curable physically, thermally, or both thermally and with actinic radiation may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0039">As used herein, the term â(meth)acrylateâ refers both to acrylate and to methacrylate. In other words, therefore, a corresponding polymer is constructed both of acrylates and of methacrylates. It may, however, equally well be constructed exclusively of acrylates or exclusively of methacrylates.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0040">In one or more embodiments, at least one saturated or unsaturated polyurethane resin is present as binder. Coating materials of this kind comprising polyurethane resin may likewise typically be cured physically, thermally, or both thermally and with actinic radiation.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0041">As used herein, the term âphysical curingâ denotes the formation of a film by loss of solvent from polymer solutions or polymer dispersions. Normally no crosslinking agents are necessary for such curing.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0042">As used herein, the term âthermal curingâ denotes the heat-initiated crosslinking of a coating film, for which either a separate crosslinking agent or else self-crosslinking binders is or are employed in the parent coating material. The crosslinking agent comprises reactive functional groups, which are complementary to the reactive functional groups present in the binders. This is normally referred to by those in the art as external crosslinking. Where the complementary reactive functional groups or autoreactive functional groupsâthat is, groups which react with groups of the same kindâare already present in the binder molecules, the binders are self-crosslinking. Examples of suitable complementary reactive functional groups and autoreactive functional groups are known from German patent application DE 199 30 665 A1, page 7, line 28 to page 9, line 24.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0043">As used herein, actinic radiation means electromagnetic radiation such as near infrared (NIR), UV radiation, more particularly UV radiation, and particulate radiation such as electron beams. Curing by UV radiation is typically initiated by radical or cationic photoinitiators.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0044">Where thermal curing and curing with actinic light are employed jointly, the term âdual cureâ is also used.</p>

Low molecular mass polyols used are more particularly diols and, in minor amounts, triols, for the purpose of introducing branches. Examples of suitable polyols of relatively high molecular mass are saturated or olefinically unsaturated polyester polyols and/or polyether polyols. Used in particular as polyols of relatively high molecular mass are polyester polyols, more particularly those having a number-average molecular weight of 400 to 5000 g/mol (measured by gel permeation chromatography against a polystyrene standard).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0055">For the purpose of hydrophilic stabilization and/or for raising the dispersibility in an aqueous medium, the polyurethane resin may comprise certain ionic groups and/or groups which can be converted into ionic groups (potentially ionic groups). Such polyurethane resins are referred to in the context of the present invention as ionically hydrophilically stabilized polyurethane resins. Likewise present may be nonionic hydrophilically modifying groups. Preferred, however, are the ionically hydrophilically stabilized polyurethanes. More specifically the modifying groups are alternatively <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>functional groups which can be converted by neutralizing agents and/or quaternizing agents in the cations, and/or cationic groups (cationic modification) <br /> or </li><li>functional groups which can be converted by neutralizing agents into anions, and/or anionic groups (anionic modification) <br /> and/or </li><li>nonionic hydrophilic groups (nonionic modification).</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0059">As the skilled person is aware, the functional groups for cationic modification are, for example, primary, secondary and/or tertiary amino groups, secondary sulfide groups and/or tertiary phosphine groups, more particularly tertiary amino groups and secondary sulfide groups (functional groups which can be converted by neutralizing agents and/or quaternizing agents into cationic groups). Further deserving of mention are the cationic groups prepared from the aforementioned functional groups using neutralizing agents and/or quaternizing agents that are known to the skilled person, said cationic groups being such as primary, secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary ammonium groups, tertiary sulfonium groups and/or quaternary phosphonium groups, more particularly quaternary ammonium groups and tertiary sulfonium groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0060">The functional groups for anionic modification are, as is known, for example, carboxylic, sulfonic and/or phosphonic acid groups, especially carboxylic acid groups (functional groups which can be converted by neutralizing agents into anionic groups), and also anionic groups prepared from the aforementioned functional groups using neutralizing agents that are known to the skilled person, said anionic groups being such as carboxylate, sulfonate and/or phosphonate groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0061">The functional groups for nonionic hydrophilic modification are specifically poly(oxyalkylene) groups, more particularly poly(oxyethylene) groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0062">The ionically hydrophilic modifications may be introduced into the polyurethane resin by means of monomers which contain the (potentially) ionic groups. The nonionic modifications are introduced for example through the incorporation of poly(ethylene) oxide polymers as pendant or terminal groups of the polyurethane molecules. The hydrophilic modifications are introduced, for example, via compounds which comprise at least one group that is reactive toward isocyanate groups, specifically at least one hydroxyl group. For introducing the ionic modification, it is possible to use monomers which, as well as the modifying groups, contain at least one hydroxyl group. For introducing the nonionic modifications, polyetherdiols and/or alkoxypoly(oxyalkylene) alcohols that are known to the skilled person may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0063">The polyurethane resin may be a graft polymer. More particularly, the polyurethane resin is a polyurethane resin grafted by means of olefinically unsaturated compounds, specifically olefinically unsaturated monomers. In this case, therefore, the polyurethane is grafted, for example, with side groups and/or side chains which are based on olefinically unsaturated monomers. More particularly, these are side chains based on poly(meth)acrylates. Poly(meth)acrylates in the context of the present invention are polymers or polymeric radicals which comprise acrylate- and/or methacrylate-group-containing monomers, consisting specifically of acrylate- and/or methacrylate-group-containing monomers. Side chains based on poly(meth)acrylates are side chains which are constructed in the course of graft polymerization using monomers containing (meth)acrylate groups. In the graft polymerization in this case, more than 50 mol %, more particularly more than 75 mol %, and more particularly 100 mol %, of monomers containing (meth)acrylate groups, based on the total amount of the monomers used in the graft polymerization may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0064">The side chains described are introduced into the polymer specifically after the preparation of a primary polyurethane resin dispersion. In this case the polyurethane resin present in the primary dispersion may contain pendant and/or terminal olefinically unsaturated groups, via which the graft polymerization then proceeds with the olefinically unsaturated compounds. The polyurethane resin for grafting may thus be an unsaturated polyurethane resin (A). The graft polymerization is then a radical polymerization of olefinically unsaturated reactants. Also possible, for example, is for the olefinically unsaturated compounds used for the graft polymerization to comprise at least one hydroxyl group. In that case there may also first be an attachment of the olefinically unsaturated compounds via these hydroxyl groups, by reaction with free isocyanate groups of the polyurethane resin. This attachment takes place instead of or in addition to the radical reaction of the olefinically unsaturated compounds with the optionally present pendant and/or terminal olefinically unsaturated groups of the polyurethane resin. Afterward there is again the graft polymerization via radical polymerization as described earlier on above. What are obtained are, at any rate, polyurethane resins grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds, specifically olefinically unsaturated monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0065">As olefinically unsaturated compounds with which the polyurethane resin (A) is grafted, it is possible to use virtually all radically polymerizable, olefinically unsaturated and organic monomers which are available to the skilled person for these purposes. The following may be mentioned as examples of certain specific classes of monomer: <ul id="ul-00011-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00012-en" list-style="none"><li>hydroxyalkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid or of other alpha,beta-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids,</li><li>(meth)acrylic alkyl esters and/or cycloalkyl esters having up to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical,</li><li>ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising at least one acid group, more particularly precisely one carboxyl group, such as (meth)acrylic acid, for example,</li><li>vinyl esters of alpha-branched monocarboxylic acids having 5 to 18 carbon atoms,</li><li>reaction products of (meth)acrylic acid with the glycidyl ester of an alpha-branched monocarboxylic acid having 5 to 18 carbon atoms,</li><li>further ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as olefins (ethylene for example), (meth)acrylamides, vinylaromatic hydrocarbons (styrene for example), vinyl compounds such as vinyl chloride and/or vinyl ethers such as ethyl vinyl ether.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0072">In one or more embodiments, monomers containing (meth)acrylate groups may be used, and, hence, the grafted-on side chains are poly(meth)acrylate-based side chains.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0073">The pendant and/or terminal olefinically unsaturated groups in the polyurethane resin, via which the graft polymerization with the olefinically unsaturated compounds is able to proceed, are introduced into the polyurethane resin specifically via particular monomers. These particular monomers, in addition to an olefinically unsaturated group, further comprise, for example, at least one group which is reactive toward isocyanate groups. Hydroxyl groups and also primary and secondary amino groups are preferred. Hydroxyl groups are especially preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0074">It is of course also possible to employ the monomers described via which the pendant and/or terminal olefinically unsaturated groups can be introduced into the polyurethane resin without the polyurethane resin being subsequently and additionally grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds. In one or more specific embodiments, the polyurethane resin may be grafted with olefinically unsaturated compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0075">The polyurethane resin may be a self-crosslinking and/or externally crosslinking binder. In one or more embodiments, the polyurethane resin comprises reactive functional groups, through which external crosslinking is possible. In this case, the pigmented aqueous basecoat material specifically comprises at least one crosslinking agent. More particularly, the reactive functional groups which enable external crosslinking are hydroxyl groups. With particular advantage it is possible in the context of the method of the invention to use polyhydroxy-functional polyurethane resins. This means that the polyurethane resin contains on average more than one hydroxyl group per molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0076">The polyurethane resin is prepared by the customary techniques of polymer chemistry. By these are meant, for example, the polymerization of polyisocyanates and polyols to polyurethanes, and the graft polymerization that then follows with olefinically unsaturated compounds. These techniques are known to the skilled person and can be adapted individually. Illustrative preparation processes and reaction conditions are found in European patent specification EP 0521 928 B1, page 2, line 57 to page 8, line 16.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0077">If the basecoat materials used are present in the form of self-crosslinking systems, the polyurethane resin content is 50% to 100% by weight, specifically 50% to 90% by weight and more specifically 50% to 80% by weight, based on the film-forming solids of the basecoat material.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0078">By film-forming solids is meant the nonvolatile weight fraction of the basecoat material, without pigments and any fillers. The film-forming solids can be determined as follows: a sample of the pigmented aqueous basecoat material (approximately 1 g) is admixed with 50 to 100 times the amount of tetrahydrofuran and then stirred for around 10 minutes. The insoluble pigments and any fillers are then removed by filtration, the residue is rinsed with a little THF, and the THF is removed from the resulting filtrate on a rotary evaporator. The residue of the filtrate is dried at 120Â° C. for two hours, and the resulting film-forming solids is weighed.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0079">In the case of externally crosslinking systems, the polyurethane resin content is between 10% and 80% by weight, specifically between 15% and 75% by weight and more specifically between 20% and 70% by weight, based in each case on the film-forming solids of the basecoat material.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0080">In one or more embodiments, the polyurethane resin possesses a number-average molecular weight of 200 to 30 000 g/mol, specifically of 2000 to 20 000 g/mol (measured by gel permeation chromatography against a polystyrene standard, using tetrahydrofuran as eluent). It further possesses, for example, a hydroxyl number of 0 to 250 mg KOH/g, but more particularly of 20 to 150 mg KOH/g. The acid number of the polyurethane resin is specifically 5 to 200 mg KOH/g, more particularly 10 to 40 mg KOH/g.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0096">In one or more embodiments, there is also a thickener present. Suitable thickeners are inorganic thickeners from the group of the phyllosilicates. Besides the inorganic thickeners, however, it is also possible to use one or more organic thickeners. These are specifically selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners, such as, for example, the commercial product Viscalex HV30 (Ciba, BASF), and polyurethane thickeners, such as, for example, the commercial product DSXÂ® 1550 from Cognis. (Meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners are those which in addition to acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid also comprise in copolymerized form one or more acrylic esters (i.e. acrylates) and/or one or more methacrylic esters (i.e. methacrylates). A feature common to the (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners is that in alkaline medium, in other words at pH levels &gt;7, more particularly &gt;7.5, they exhibit a sharp rise in viscosity, owing to salt formation by the acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid, in other words the formation of carboxylate groups. Where (meth)acrylic esters are used that are formed from (meth)acrylic acid and a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkanol, the resulting (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners are substantially nonassociative in their effect, such as the aforementioned Viscalex HV30, for example. Substantially nonassociative (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners are also referred to in the literature as ASE thickeners (alkali-soluble/swellable emulsion or dispersion). As (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners it is also possible, however, to use those referred to as HASE thickeners (hydrophobically modified anionic soluble emulsions or dispersions). These are obtained if the alkanol used, instead of or in addition to the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkanols, comprises alkanols having a greater number of carbon atoms, for example 7 to 30, or 8 to 20 carbon atoms. HASE thickeners have a substantially associative thickening effect. On the basis of their thickening properties, the (meth)acrylic acid-(meth)acrylate copolymer thickeners that can be used are not suitable as binder resins, and hence are not included among the physically, thermally or both thermally and actinically curable binders that are identified as binders, and they are therefore explicitly different from the poly(meth)acrylate-based binders which can be used in the basecoat compositions of the invention. Polyurethane thickeners are the associative thickeners referred to in the literature as HEUR (hydrophobically modified ethylene oxide urethane rheology modifiers). In chemical terms these are nonionic branched or nonbranched block copolymers of polyethylene oxide chains (sometimes also polypropylene oxide chains) which are linked to one another via urethane bonds and which carry terminal long-chain alkyl or alkylene groups having 8 to 30 carbon atoms. Examples of typical alkyl groups are dodecyl or stearyl groups; an example of a typical alkenyl group is an oleyl group; a typical aryl group is the phenyl group; and an example of a typical alkylated aryl group is a nonylphenyl group. On account of their thickening properties and structure, the polyurethane thickeners are not suitable as physically, thermally or both thermally and physically curable binder resins. They are therefore explicitly different from the polyurethanes which can be used as binders in the basecoat compositions of the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0110">The pigmented aqueous basecoat material used in accordance with the invention may be applied to a substrate in the film thicknesses that are customary in the context of the automobile industry in the range, for example, of 5 to 100 micrometers, specifically 5 to 60 micrometers. This is done by employing, for example, spray application methods, such as, for example, compressed air spraying, airless spraying, high speed rotation, or electrostatic spray application (ESTA), optionally combined with hot spray application such as hot air spraying, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0111">After the pigmented aqueous basecoat material has been applied, it can be dried by known techniques. For example, 1K basecoat materials can be flashed off at room temperature for 1 to 60 minutes and subsequently dried at optionally slightly elevated temperatures of 30 to 80Â° C. Flashing off and drying in the context of the present invention means the evaporation of organic solvents and/or water whereby the coating material becomes dryer but is not yet cured. Or as yet no fully crosslinked coating film is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0112">A commercially customary clearcoat material is then applied likewise by commonplace techniques, the film thicknesses again lying in the commonplace ranges, such as 5 to 100 micrometers, for example. Clearcoat materials of this kind are known to the skilled person.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0113">After the clearcoat has been applied it can be flashed off at room temperature for 1 to 60 minutes, for example, and optionally dried. The clearcoat material is then cured together with the applied pigmented basecoat material. Here, for example, crosslinking reactions take place, producing a multicoat color and/or effect paint system of the invention on a substrate. In one or more embodiments, curing takes place thermally, or both thermally and with actinic radiation, at temperatures from 80 to 200Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0114">The method of the invention can be used to coat metallic and nonmetallic substrates, more particularly plastics substrates, specifically automobile bodies or parts thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0115">The invention further provides a multicoat color and/or effect paint system which is producible by the method of the invention. Therefore, the observations above with regard to the aqueous basecoat material which is used for example in stage (1) of the method of the invention for producing a multicoat color and/or effect paint system, and also concerning the phosphine oxide that is present therein, apply equally to the multicoat color and/or effect paint system in question. This is true more particularly also for all of the stated preferred, more preferred and very preferred features.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0116">The present invention further relates to the above-described method for repairing defects on the multicoat color and/or effect paint systems of the invention, where in stage (1) a pigmented aqueous basecoat material is used which comprises at least one phosphine oxide of the following structural formula (I):</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0118">In one or more embodiments, the aqueous basecoat material used in stage (1) of the method of the invention for repairing defects maybe the same as that which is used in the method of the invention for producing a multicoat color and/or effect paint system. The above observations concerning the aqueous basecoat material therefore also apply to the method in question for repairing defects on a multicoat color and/or effect paint system. This is especially true also for all stated preferred, more preferred and very preferred features.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0119">As is known, the multicoat color and/or effect paint systems produced using the method of the invention may exhibit defects. Defects, or film defects, are generally disruptions to and in the coating, and are usually named according to their shape or their appearance. The skilled person knows of a multiplicity of possible kinds of such film defects. They are described for example in Rompp-Lexikon Lacke and Druckfarben, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, N.Y., 1998, page 235, âFilm defectsâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0120">Said defects may be repaired by the above-described method of the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0122">In one or more embodiments, application of the pigmented aqueous basecoat material to the defect in the original finish is accomplished by pneumatic atomization. Following the application of the pigmented aqueous basecoat material, it can be dried by known techniques. For example, the basecoat material can be dried at room temperature for 1 to 60 minutes and subsequently dried at optionally slightly elevated temperatures of 30 to 80Â° C. Flashing off and drying in the context of the present invention means the evaporation of organic solvents and/or water, as a result of which the paint becomes dryer, but is not yet cured, or as yet no fully crosslinked coating film is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0123">A commercially customary clearcoat material is then applied, by techniques that are likewise commonplace, to the site of the intended repair. As is generally customary in refinishing, and therefore known to the skilled person, it is preferred to use clearcoat materials which can be cured even at relatively low temperatures of 30 to 80Â° C. Two-component clearcoat materials in particular are suitable for this purpose.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0124">After the clearcoat has been applied, it can be flashed off at room temperature for 1 to 60 minutes, for example, and optionally dried.

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0141">For determining the stability against steam jet exposure, the multicoat paint systems were produced in accordance with the following general instructions:</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0142">A steel panel coated with a standard cathodic electrocoat (CathoguardÂ® 800 from BASF Coatings GmbH) and with dimensions of 10Ã20 cm was coated with a standard primer-surfacer (ALG 670173 mid-gray primer-surfacer from Hemmelrath). Following interim drying of the aqueous primer-surfacer over a period of 10 at 80Â° C., it was baked at a temperature of 190Â° C. over a period of 30 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0143">The waterborne basecoat material was then applied pneumatically. The resulting waterborne basecoat material film was flashed off at room temperature for 2 minutes and subsequently dried in a forced-air oven at 70Â° C. for 10 minutes. Applied over the dried waterborne basecoat film was a customary two-component clearcoat material (ProglossÂ® 345 from BASF Coatings GmbH). The resulting clearcoat film was flashed off at room temperature for 20 minutes. The waterborne basecoat film and the clearcoat film were subsequently cured in a forced-air oven at 160Â° C. for 30 minutes. The present system represents an overbaked original system and is referred to hereinafter as original finish.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0144">This original finish is abraded with an abrasive paper and then the waterborne basecoat material is applied pneumatically to this abraded original finish. The resulting waterborne basecoat film was flashed off at room temperature for 2 minutes and then dried in a forced-air oven at 70Â° C. for 10 minutes. Applied to the dried waterborne basecoat film was an 80Â° C. two-component clearcoat material (FF230500 2K refinish clearcoat, scratch-resistant, from BASF Coatings GmbH). The resulting clearcoat film was flashed off at room temperature for 20 minutes. Subsequently the waterborne basecoat film and the clearcoat film were cured in a forced-air oven at 80Â° C. for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0145">The steel panels thus treated were then subjected to steam jet testing in accordance with DIN 55662:2009-12 (method A) and subsequently assessed in accordance with the abovementioned DIN.</p>
