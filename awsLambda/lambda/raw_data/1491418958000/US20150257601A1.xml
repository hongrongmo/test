      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">For purposes of description herein, the terms âupper,â âlower,â âright,â âleft,â ârear,â âfront,â âvertical,â âhorizontal,â and derivatives thereof shall relate to the concept as oriented in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. However, it is to be understood that the concept may assume various alternative orientations, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the reference numeral <b>10</b> generally designates a blender jar having a side wall <b>12</b> which generally defines a blending cavity <b>14</b> accessible through an open upper end <b>16</b>. The open upper end <b>16</b> includes a spout portion <b>18</b> and further has a generally teardrop shaped configuration T. Moving from the open upper end <b>16</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> towards a lower portion <b>20</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>, the configuration of the side wall <b>12</b> gradually changes and tapers from the generally teardrop shaped configuration T to a generally rectangular configuration R at the lower portion <b>20</b>. Thus, the blending cavity <b>14</b> has a changing dual configuration from the open upper end <b>16</b> to the lower portion <b>20</b>. The side wall <b>12</b> further includes a plurality of ribs <b>22</b> which inwardly extend into the blending cavity <b>14</b> and taper from an upper portion <b>22</b>A to a lower portion <b>22</b>B. The inwardly extending ribs <b>22</b>, in conjunction with the varied configuration of the blending cavity <b>14</b>, are adapted to reduce a bridging effect of blender contents during a blending procedure. The inwardly extending ribs <b>22</b> along with the configuration of the blending cavity <b>14</b> help to fold blender contents into a blending path for subsequent blending by a blade assembly. A handle member <b>24</b> extends outwardly from the side wall <b>12</b> for engagement by a user. As further shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> includes a jar base <b>26</b> which, in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, is a generally circular dome shaped base having an engagement tab <b>30</b> extending outwardly therefrom. The engagement tab <b>30</b> is generally defined by a ramped surface <b>32</b> which culminates in a laterally extending abutment surface <b>34</b>. In use, the engagement tab <b>30</b> is adapted to couple to a latch mechanism of a blending appliance as further described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> is shown being received within a blending appliance <b>100</b>. The blending appliance <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> which comprises an upper housing member <b>104</b>, a motor compartment <b>106</b>, and a base portion <b>108</b>. The upper housing member <b>104</b> and base portion <b>108</b> generally extend outwardly from the housing <b>102</b> above and below the motor compartment <b>106</b>. The base portion <b>108</b> includes a support pad <b>110</b> such that a jar receiving portion <b>112</b> is defined between the upper housing member <b>104</b> and the base portion <b>108</b> for receiving the blender jar <b>10</b> in a lateral or horizontal manner along a path as indicated by arrow A. Thus, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> is laterally received within the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> which is adjacent to the motor compartment <b>106</b>. In this way, the blender jar <b>10</b> of the present disclosure is a low profile side drive blender appliance <b>100</b> which does not include a conventional stacked configuration of a blender jar over a motor housing and drive motor. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a lid <b>114</b> is disposed over the open upper end <b>16</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> and includes an aperture <b>116</b> which is aligned with a feed chute assembly <b>118</b> that is generally disposed through the upper housing member <b>104</b>. Thus, when the blender jar <b>10</b> is horizontally received within the blender jar receiving portion <b>112</b>, the feed chute assembly <b>118</b> is aligned with the aperture <b>116</b> of the lid <b>114</b> for introducing ingredients into the blender cavity <b>14</b>. The upper housing member <b>104</b> further includes a user interface <b>120</b> in the form of a rotary dial which is adapted to control various blending operations of the blending appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As further shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the blending appliance <b>100</b> includes a motor <b>122</b> having a drive shaft <b>124</b> which is coupled to a belt drive system <b>130</b> at a lower end and a ducted fan <b>132</b> at an upper end. The ducted fan <b>132</b> may also be disposed below the motor <b>122</b> and is generally adapted to draw air into and exhaust air out of the housing <b>102</b> through vents <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> disposed about the housing <b>102</b>. The motor <b>122</b> is adapted to drive a blade assembly <b>140</b> disposed within the blending cavity <b>14</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> when the blender jar <b>10</b> is fully received within the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b>. The motor <b>122</b> drives the blade assembly <b>140</b> through the belt drive system <b>130</b> and a magnetic coupling system <b>150</b> as further described below. As noted above, a magnetic coupler system <b>150</b> is used to drive the blade assembly <b>140</b> within the blender cavity <b>114</b> as powered by the motor <b>122</b>. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a belt drive system <b>130</b> which is used to translate torque from the motor <b>122</b> to the magnetic coupler system <b>150</b>. It is contemplated that any number of torque translating features may be used in place of the belt drive system <b>130</b>, so long as rotational power from the motor <b>122</b> is translated to the blade assembly <b>140</b>. The magnetic coupler system <b>150</b> includes an upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b> and a lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b>. The lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b> is engaged with a belt <b>131</b> of the belt drive system <b>130</b> for rotation therewith, as driven by the motor <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b> is coupled to a shaft <b>152</b> and is disposed within the base portion <b>108</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b>. The lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b> is disposed adjacent to the support pad <b>110</b> of the jar receiving portion <b>112</b>. The support pad <b>110</b> generally encapsulates the lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b> within the base portion <b>108</b>. The upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b> is disposed within the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>. The upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b>, as coupled to the blender jar <b>10</b>, is removable from the blending appliance <b>100</b> when the blender jar <b>10</b> is removed from the jar receiving portion <b>112</b>. The upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b> is coupled to a shaft <b>154</b> which is further coupled to the blade assembly <b>140</b> which is fully disposed within a receptacle portion or blender cavity <b>14</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>. The magnetic coupling system <b>150</b> magnetically couples the blender jar <b>10</b> to the base portion <b>108</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b> through magnetic attraction generated between upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>. As shown in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, have a generally circular or disc-shaped configuration at a prescribed diameter, such that the blender jar <b>10</b> will properly seat on the support pad <b>110</b> due to the magnetic forces generated between the upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>. In assembly and in use, the motor <b>122</b> drives the drive belt drive system <b>130</b>, as described above, thereby driving the shaft <b>152</b> in a direction as indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>. Due to the magnetic attraction and magnetic coupling of the lower magnetic coupler M<b>2</b> to the upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b>, the upper magnetic coupler M<b>1</b> also rotates along the rotational direction as indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>. In this way, the upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> drive the blade assembly <b>140</b> disposed within the blender cavity <b>14</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> through a magnetic torque coupling, rather than a conventional mechanical coupling.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> may be comprised of a magnetic material or may be in the form of a polymeric housing which includes a plurality of magnetic elements or solid magnetic rings <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> disposed along interfacing surfaces of the upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As described above, the magnetic coupling system <b>150</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b> serves to translate torque to the blade assembly <b>140</b> without a conventional mechanical coupling between the blade assembly <b>140</b> and a gear mechanism operably coupled to the motor <b>122</b>. Without this mechanical coupling, the blender jar <b>10</b> can be horizontally received within the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> along a path as indicated by arrow A, as the generally planar lower portion of the base <b>26</b> of the jar <b>10</b> is adapted to slide unimpeded along the support pad <b>110</b> disposed on an upper portion of the base portion <b>108</b>. The magnetic coupling between the upper and lower coupling mechanisms M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> of the magnetic coupling system <b>150</b> may cause the blender jar <b>10</b> to move on the planar support pad <b>110</b>, such that the upper and lower magnetic couplers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> can become misaligned, thereby disrupting the translation of torque to the blade assembly <b>140</b>. To counter this effect and resist rotational movement of the blender jar <b>10</b>, the blending appliance <b>100</b> of the present disclosure includes jar retaining mechanisms as further described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, the base portion <b>108</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b> is shown having a rear portion <b>108</b><i>b </i>and a front portion <b>108</b><i>a. </i>The rear portion <b>108</b><i>b </i>includes an aperture <b>170</b> through which the drive shaft <b>124</b> of the motor <b>122</b> downwardly extends to the belt drive system <b>130</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The base portion <b>108</b> further includes mounting features <b>172</b> disposed about the aperture <b>170</b> for coupling the base portion <b>108</b> to the motor housing <b>106</b>, also shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The support pad <b>110</b> is disposed on an upper portion of the front portion <b>108</b><i>a </i>of the base portion <b>108</b>. The support pad <b>110</b> includes a lip <b>174</b> which surrounds a rear portion of the support pad <b>110</b>. The lip <b>174</b> further includes raised abutment features <b>176</b> which together with the lip <b>174</b> serve to properly locate the blender jar <b>10</b> as received within the jar receiving portion <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, a jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> includes an articulating arm <b>182</b> which is coupled to the base portion <b>108</b> at an aperture <b>184</b> via a fastener <b>186</b>. In this way, the articulating arm <b>182</b> is adapted to pivot about a latch axis LA between a disengaged position D and an engaged position E along a path as indicated by arrow B. A biasing mechanism <b>188</b>, shown in the form of a coil spring in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, includes first and second arms <b>190</b>, <b>192</b> which are adapted to engage an abutment portion <b>194</b> on the articulating arm <b>182</b> and a mounting feature <b>172</b> disposed adjacent to aperture <b>184</b>. In this way, the biasing mechanism <b>188</b> biases the articulating arm <b>182</b> towards the engaged position E. The articulating arm <b>182</b> includes a latch member <b>200</b> at a first end having a ramped outer surface <b>202</b> and a generally planar abutment surface <b>204</b>. The latch member <b>200</b> is supported on the articulating arm <b>182</b> by a latch support portion <b>206</b>. A locating feature <b>208</b> is further disposed on the latch support portion <b>206</b> and generally engages a cradle feature <b>210</b> disposed on the base member <b>108</b> adjacent the lip <b>174</b>. On an opposite second end of the articulating arm <b>182</b> relative to the latch member <b>200</b>, a push member <b>212</b> is disposed which is adapted to push or displace the blender jar <b>10</b> outwardly as the latch member <b>200</b> and articulating arm <b>182</b> are moved to the disengaged position D. Thus, the latch member <b>200</b> and the push member <b>212</b> are disposed on opposite sides of the latch axis LA, and therefore move in an inverse manner relative to one another away from and towards the blender jar <b>10</b> as received on the support pad <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> is shown having the articulating arm <b>182</b> pivotally coupled to the base portion <b>108</b> via fastener <b>186</b>, such that the articulating arm <b>182</b> pivots at the latch axis or pivot point LA. As noted above, with reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> includes a jar base <b>26</b>. As the blender jar <b>10</b> is laterally received on the support pad <b>110</b>, the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> will engage the ramped portion <b>202</b> of latch member <b>200</b>, thereby urging the articulating arm <b>182</b> towards the disengaged position D. The movement of the articulating arm <b>182</b> to the disengaged position D is further advanced by the ramped portion <b>32</b> of the engagement tab <b>30</b> disposed on the base portion <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As the jar assembly <b>10</b> moves further along the path as indicated by arrow A into full engagement with the housing <b>102</b> in the jar receiving portion <b>112</b>, the engagement tab <b>30</b> will slide past an innermost portion <b>205</b> of the latch member <b>200</b>, such that the articulating arm <b>182</b>, as biased by the biasing mechanism <b>188</b>, will snap-fit into the engaged position E, wherein abutment surface <b>34</b> of the engagement tab <b>30</b> is positioned to engage abutment portion <b>204</b> of the latch member <b>200</b> in an abutting relationship. As noted above, the magnetic coupling system <b>150</b>, shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, is adapted to rotate the blade assembly <b>140</b> in a direction as indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>. Thus, as the contents of the blender jar <b>10</b> impart a resistance force on the blade assembly <b>140</b> along the rotational path indicated by arrow R<b>1</b>, the blender jar <b>10</b> will have a tendency to rotate in the direction as indicated by arrow R<b>1</b> in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>. When this type of rotation of the blender jar <b>10</b> occurs, abutment surface <b>34</b> of engagement tab <b>30</b> will abut generally planar abutment portion <b>204</b> of the latch member <b>200</b>, such that the latch member <b>200</b> will retain the blender jar <b>10</b> in place for proper torque translation from the magnetic coupling system <b>150</b> to the blade assembly <b>140</b>. As further shown in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, the push member <b>212</b> moves along a path as indicated by arrow C as the articulating arm <b>182</b> moves to the disengaged position D. In this way, the push member <b>212</b> pushes the blender jar <b>10</b> outwardly from its fully received position on the support pad <b>110</b>. In this way, and with reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> is vertically retained in the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> by the support pad <b>110</b> of the base portion <b>108</b> of the housing <b>102</b> at a lower end, and further retained by the upper housing member <b>104</b> as disposed over the open end <b>16</b> and lid <b>114</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>. This vertical retainment of the blender jar <b>10</b> in the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> is further aided by the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b>, which resists against rotational and lateral movement of the blender jar <b>10</b> during a blending procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the blender jar <b>10</b> is shown fully received within the blender jar receiving portion <b>112</b> of the housing <b>102</b> of the blending appliance <b>100</b>. As properly located for use in a blending procedure on the support pad <b>110</b>, the blender jar <b>10</b> has the engagement tab <b>30</b>, disposed outwardly from the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> in engagement with the latch member <b>200</b>. Specifically, abutment surface <b>34</b> of the engagement tab <b>30</b> is abuttingly engaged with abutment portion <b>204</b> of the latch member <b>200</b> when the articulating arm <b>182</b> is in the engaged position E. In this way, the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> retains the jar <b>10</b> against rotational forces imparted on the blender jar <b>10</b> in a direction as indicated by arrow R<b>1</b> during a blending procedure. As specifically shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, push member <b>212</b>, disposed on an opposite end of the articulating arm <b>182</b> relative to the latch member <b>200</b>, is in abutting engagement with the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> when the articulating arm <b>182</b> is in the engaged position E and the blender jar <b>10</b> is fully received within the housing <b>102</b>. As the articulating arm <b>182</b> moves to the disengaged position D along the path as indicated by arrow B, the push member <b>212</b> will inversely move to impart an outward lateral force in the direction as indicated by arrow C on the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b> to aid in the ejection of the blender jar <b>10</b> from the jar receiving portion <b>112</b>. Further, as biased by the biasing member <b>188</b> to the engaged position E, the articulating arm <b>182</b> imparts a constant force on the base portion <b>26</b> and engagement tab <b>30</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>. Again, the ramped surface <b>32</b> of the engagement tab <b>30</b> allows the blender jar <b>10</b> to slide around the rounded innermost portion <b>205</b> of the latch <b>200</b>, for a snap-fit engagement of the latch member <b>200</b> with the engagement tab <b>30</b> without the need for the user to separately move the articulating arm <b>182</b> to the disengaged position D. Further, this snap-fit engagement provides the user with tactile feedback that the blender jar <b>10</b> is properly received within the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> and is properly seated on the support pad <b>110</b> for consistent and efficient translation of torque through the magnetic coupling system <b>150</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> is shown with the articulating arm <b>182</b> in the engaged position E, such that the latch member <b>200</b> is engaged with the engagement tab <b>30</b> in a manner as described above. When a user wishes to release the blender jar <b>10</b> from the retainer mechanism <b>180</b>, the user will generally engage the ramped surface <b>202</b> of the latch member <b>200</b> to pivot the articulating arm <b>182</b> towards the disengaged position D along a path as indicated by arrow B. In this way, the latch member <b>200</b> moves laterally from the engaged position E to release the blender jar <b>10</b>. With reference to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> is shown with the articulating arm <b>182</b> pivoted to the disengaged position D along the path as indicated by arrow B. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the latch member <b>200</b> of the articulating arm <b>182</b> is laterally spaced apart from the engagement tab <b>30</b> disposed on the jar base <b>26</b> of the blender jar <b>10</b>. Further, as noted above, when moved to the disengaged position D, the push member <b>212</b>, shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, will urge the blender jar <b>10</b> at the jar base <b>26</b> outwardly in a direction as indicated by arrow C. In this way, the jar retainer mechanism <b>180</b> serves to retain the blender jar <b>10</b> in an in-use position when the articulating arm <b>182</b> is in the engaged position E, and further aids in the release of the blender jar <b>10</b> from the jar receiving portion <b>112</b> via the push member <b>212</b> when the articulating arm <b>182</b> is moved to the disengaged position D.</p>
