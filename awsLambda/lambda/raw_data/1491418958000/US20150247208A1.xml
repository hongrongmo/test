      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to a molecular classification of disease and particularly to molecular markers for cancer prognosis and methods of use thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cancer is a major public health problem, accounting for roughly 25% of all deaths in the United States. Though many treatments have been devised for various cancers, these treatments often vary in severity of side effects. It is useful for clinicians to know how aggressive a patient's cancer is in order to determine how aggressively to treat the cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For example, most patients with early-stage asymptomatic prostate cancer are treated with radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy and optionally adjuvant therapy (e.g., hormone or chemotherapy), all of which have severe side effects. For many of these patients, however, these treatments and their associated side effects and costs are unnecessary because the cancer in these patients is not aggressive (i.e., grows slowly and is unlikely to cause mortality or significant morbidity during the patient's lifetime). In other patients the cancer is virulent (i.e., more likely to recur) and aggressive treatment is necessary to save the patient's life.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Some tools have been devised to help physicians in deciding which patients need aggressive treatment and which do not. In fact, several clinical parameters are currently in use for this purpose in various different cancers. In prostate cancer, for example, such clinical parameters include serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason grade, pathologic stage, and surgical margins. In recent years clinical parameters have been made more helpful through their incorporation into continuous multivariable postoperative nomograms that calculate a patient's probability of having cancer progression/recurrence. See, e.g., Kattan et al., J. C<smallcaps>LIN</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL</smallcaps>. (1999) 17:1499-1507; Stephenson et al., J. C<smallcaps>LIN</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL</smallcaps>. (2005) 23:7005-7012. Despite these advances, however, many patients are given improper cancer treatments and there is still a serious need for novel and improved tools for predicting cancer recurrence.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present disclosure is based in part on the surprising discovery that the expression of those genes whose expression closely tracks the cell cycle (“cell-cycle genes” or “CCGs” as further defined below) is particularly useful in classifying selected types of cancer and determining the prognosis of these cancers.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, in a first aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for determining gene expression in a tumor sample from a patient (e.g., one identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer). Generally, the method includes at least the following steps: (1) obtaining a tumor sample from a patient (e.g., one identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer); (2) determining the expression of a panel of genes in said tumor sample including at least 4 cell-cycle genes; and (3) providing a test value by (a) weighting the determined expression of each of a plurality of test genes selected from said panel of genes with a predefined coefficient, and (b) combining the weighted expression to provide said test value, wherein at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 90% of said plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In some embodiments, the plurality of test genes includes at least 8 cell-cycle genes, or at least 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 cell-cycle genes. In some embodiments, at least some proportion of the test genes (e.g., at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%) are cell-cycle genes. In some embodiments, all of the test genes are cell-cycle genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Also in some embodiments, the step of determining the expression of the panel of genes in the tumor sample comprises measuring the amount of mRNA in the tumor sample transcribed from each of from 4 to about 200 cell-cycle genes; and measuring the amount of mRNA of one or more housekeeping genes in the tumor sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for determining the prognosis of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, which comprises determining in a tumor sample from a patient diagnosed of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, the expression of at least 6, 8 or 10 cell-cycle genes, wherein overexpression of said at least 6, 8 or 10 cell-cycle genes indicates a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one embodiment, the prognosis method comprises (1) determining in a tumor sample from a patient diagnosed of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, the expression of a panel of genes in said tumor sample including at least 4 or at least 8 cell-cycle genes; and (2) providing a test value by (a) weighting the determined expression of each of a plurality of test genes selected from the panel of genes with a predefined coefficient, and (b) combining the weighted expression to provide the test value, wherein at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 85% of the plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes, and wherein an increased level of overall expression of the plurality of test genes indicates a poor prognosis, whereas if there is no increase in the overall expression of the test genes, it would indicate a good prognosis or a low likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In preferred embodiments, the prognosis method further includes a step of comparing the test value provided in step (2) above to one or more reference values, and correlating the test value to a risk of cancer progression or risk of cancer recurrence. In preferred embodiments, the prognosis method further includes a step of comparing the test value provided in step (2) above to one or more reference values, and correlating the test value to a likelihood (e.g., increased, decreased, specific percentage probability, etc.) of cancer progression, likelihood of cancer recurrence, likelihood of cancer-specific death, or likelihood of response to the particular treatment regimen. Optionally a test value greater than the reference value is correlated to an increased likelihood of response to treatment comprising chemotherapy. In some embodiments the test value is correlated to an increased likelihood of response to treatment (e.g., treatment comprising chemotherapy) if the test value exceeds the reference value by at least some amount (e.g., at least 0.5, 0.75, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more fold or standard deviations). Optionally an increased likelihood of poor prognosis is indicated if the test value is greater than the reference value.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure also provide a method of treating cancer in a patient identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, comprising: (1) determining in a tumor sample from a patient diagnosed of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, the expression of a panel of genes in the tumor sample including at least 4 or at least 8 cell-cycle genes; (2) providing a test value by (a) weighting the determined expression of each of a plurality of test genes selected from said panel of genes with a predefined coefficient, and (b) combining the weighted expression to provide said test value, wherein at least 50% or 75% or 85% of the plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes, wherein an increased level of expression of the plurality of test genes indicates a poor prognosis, and an un-increased level of expression of the plurality of test genes indicates a good prognosis; and recommending, prescribing or administering a treatment regimen or watchful waiting based on the prognosis provided in step (2).</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present disclosure further provides a diagnostic kit for prognosing cancer in a patient diagnosed of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, comprising, in a compartmentalized container, a plurality of oligonucleotides hybridizing to at least 8 test genes, wherein less than 10%, 30% or less than 40% of all of the at least 8 test genes are non-cell-cycle genes; and one or more oligonucleotides hybridizing to at least one housekeeping gene. The oligonucleotides can be hybridizing probes for hybridization with the test genes under stringent conditions or primers suitable for PCR amplification of the test genes. In one embodiment, the kit consists essentially of, in a compartmentalized container, a first plurality of PCR reaction mixtures for PCR amplification of from 5 or 10 to about 300 test genes, wherein at least 50%, at least 60% or at least 80% of such test genes are cell-cycle genes, and wherein each reaction mixture comprises a PCR primer pair for PCR amplifying one of the test genes; and a second plurality of PCR reaction mixtures for PCR amplification of at least one housekeeping gene. In some embodiments the kit comprises one or more computer software programs for calculating a test value derived from the expression of the test genes (either the overall expression of all test genes or of some subset) and for comparing this test value to some reference value (and optionally for assigning a risk level based on this comparison). In some embodiments such computer software is programmed to weight the test genes such that cell-cycle genes are weighted to contribute at least 50%, at least 75% or at least 85% of the test value. In some embodiments such computer software is programmed to communicate (e.g., display) that the patient has an increased likelihood of progression, recurrence, cancer-specific death, or response to a particular treatment regimen (e.g., comprising adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy) if the test value is greater than the reference value (e.g., by more than some predetermined amount). In some embodiments the computer software is programmed to communicate (e.g., display) the risk level of progression, recurrence, cancer-specific death, or response to a particular treatment regimen assignable to the patient based on the test value (e.g., based on comparison of the test value to a reference value).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The present disclosure also provides the use of (1) a plurality of oligonucleotides hybridizing to at least 4 or at least 8 cell-cycle genes; and (2) one or more oligonucleotides hybridizing to at least one housekeeping gene, for the manufacture of a diagnostic product for determining the expression of the test genes in a tumor sample from a patient (e.g., one diagnosed with prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer) to predict the prognosis of cancer, wherein an increased level of the overall expression of the test genes indicates a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient, whereas if there is no increase in the overall expression of the test genes, it would indicate a good prognosis or a low likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides are PCR primers suitable for PCR amplification of the test genes. In other embodiments, the oligonucleotides are probes hybridizing to the test genes under stringent conditions. In some embodiments, the plurality of oligonucleotides are probes for hybridization under stringent conditions to, or are suitable for PCR amplification of, from 4 to about 300 test genes, at least 50%, 70% or 80% or 90% of the test genes being cell-cycle genes. In some other embodiments, the plurality of oligonucleotides are hybridization probes for, or are suitable for PCR amplification of, from 20 to about 300 test genes, at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 70% or 80% or 90% of the test genes being cell-cycle genes.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">I. Determining Cell-Cycle Gene Expression</heading>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">The present disclosure is based in part on the discovery that genes whose expression closely tracks the cell cycle (“cell-cycle genes” or “CCGs”) are particularly powerful genes for classifying selected cancers including prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer, brain cancer and breast cancer, but not other types of cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">“Cell-cycle gene” and “CCG” herein refer to a gene whose expression level closely tracks the progression of the cell through the cell-cycle. See, e.g., Whitfield et al., M<smallcaps>OL. </smallcaps>B<smallcaps>IOL</smallcaps>. C<smallcaps>ELL </smallcaps>(2002) 13:1977-2000. The term “cell-cycle progression” or “CCP” will also be used in this application and will generally be interchangeable with CCG (i.e., a CCP gene is a CCG; a CCP score is a CCG score). More specifically, CCGs show periodic increases and decreases in expression that coincide with certain phases of the cell cycle—e.g., STK15 and PLK show peak expression at G2/M. Id. Often CCGs have clear, recognized cell-cycle related function—e.g., in DNA synthesis or repair, in chromosome condensation, in cell-division, etc. However, some CCGs have expression levels that track the cell-cycle without having an obvious, direct role in the cell-cycle—e.g., UBE2S encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, yet its expression closely tracks the cell-cycle. Thus a CCG according to the present disclosure need not have a recognized role in the cell-cycle. Exemplary CCGs are listed in Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13, 14 &amp; A. A fuller discussion of CCGs can be found in International Application No. PCT/US2010/020397 (pub. no. WO/2010/080933) (see, e.g., Table 1 in WO/2010/080933), U.S. utility application Ser. No. 13/177,887 (pub. no. US20120041274), International Application No. PCT/US2011/043228 (pub. no. WO/2012/006447), and U.S. utility application Ser. No. 13/178,380 (pub. no. US20120053253), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">Whether a particular gene is a CCG may be determined by any technique known in the art, including those taught in Whitfield et al., M<smallcaps>OL</smallcaps>. B<smallcaps>IOL</smallcaps>. C<smallcaps>ELL </smallcaps>(2002) 13:1977-2000; Whitfield et al., M<smallcaps>OL</smallcaps>. C<smallcaps>ELL</smallcaps>. B<smallcaps>IOL</smallcaps>. (2000) 20:4188-4198; WO/2010/080933 (¶ [0039]). All of the CCGs in Table 2 below form a panel of CCGs (“Panel A”) useful in the disclosure. As will be shown detail throughout this document, individual CCGs (e.g., CCGs in Table 2) and subsets of these genes can also be used in the disclosure.</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0048">Accordingly, in a first aspect of the present disclosure, a method is provided for determining gene expression in a tumor sample from a patient (e.g., one identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer). Generally, the method includes at least the following steps: (1) obtaining a tumor sample from a patient (e.g., one identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer); (2) determining the expression of a panel of genes in the tumor sample including at least 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 cell-cycle genes; and (3) providing a test value by (a) weighting the determined expression of each of a plurality of test genes selected from said panel of genes with a predefined coefficient, and (b) combining the weighted expression to provide said test value, wherein at least 20%, 50%, at least 75% or at least 90% of said plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes. In some embodiments the test genes are weighted such that the cell-cycle genes are weighted to contribute at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or 100% of the test value. In some embodiments 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or at least 99% or 100% of the plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0049">Gene expression can be determined either at the RNA level (i.e., mRNA or noncoding RNA (ncRNA)) (e.g., miRNA, tRNA, rRNA, snoRNA, siRNA and piRNA) or at the protein level. Measuring gene expression at the mRNA level includes measuring levels of cDNA corresponding to mRNA. Levels of proteins in a tumor sample can be determined by any known techniques in the art, e.g., HPLC, mass spectrometry, or using antibodies specific to selected proteins (e.g., IHC, ELISA, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0050">In preferred embodiment, the amount of RNA transcribed from the panel of genes including test genes is measured in the tumor sample. In addition, the amount of RNA of one or more housekeeping genes in the tumor sample is also measured, and used to normalize or calibrate the expression of the test genes. The terms “normalizing genes” and “housekeeping genes” are defined herein below.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0051">In any embodiment of the disclosure involving a “plurality of test genes,” the plurality of test genes may include at least 2, 3 or 4 cell-cycle genes, which constitute at least 50%, 75% or 80% of the plurality of test genes, and preferably 100% of the plurality of test genes. In some embodiments, the plurality of test genes includes at least 5, 6, 7, or at least 8 cell-cycle genes, which constitute at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80% or 90% of the plurality of test genes, and preferably 100% of the plurality of test genes. As will be clear from the context of this document, a panel of genes is a plurality of genes. Typically these genes are assayed together in one or more samples from a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0052">In some other embodiments, the plurality of test genes includes at least 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25 or 30 cell-cycle genes, which constitute at least 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80% or 90% of the plurality of test genes, and preferably 100% of the plurality of test genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0053">As will be apparent to a skilled artisan apprised of the present disclosure and the disclosure herein, “tumor sample” means any biological sample containing one or more tumor cells, or one or more tumor derived RNA or protein, and obtained from a cancer patient. For example, a tissue sample obtained from a tumor tissue of a cancer patient is a useful tumor sample in the present disclosure. The tissue sample can be an FFPE sample, or fresh frozen sample, and preferably contain largely tumor cells. A single malignant cell from a cancer patient's tumor is also a useful tumor sample. Such a malignant cell can be obtained directly from the patient's tumor, or purified from the patient's bodily fluid (e.g., blood, urine). Thus, a bodily fluid such as blood, urine, sputum and saliva containing one or tumor cells, or tumor-derived RNA or proteins, can also be useful as a tumor sample for purposes of practicing the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0054">Those skilled in the art are familiar with various techniques for determining the status of a gene or protein in a tissue or cell sample including, but not limited to, microarray analysis (e.g., for assaying mRNA or microRNA expression, copy number, etc.), quantitative real-time PCR™ (“qRT-PCR™”, e.g., TaqMan™), immunoanalysis (e.g., ELISA, immunohistochemistry), etc. The activity level of a polypeptide encoded by a gene may be used in much the same way as the expression level of the gene or polypeptide. Often higher activity levels indicate higher expression levels and while lower activity levels indicate lower expression levels. Thus, in some embodiments, the disclosure provides any of the methods discussed above, wherein the activity level of a polypeptide encoded by the CCG is determined rather than or in addition to the expression level of the CCG. Those skilled in the art are familiar with techniques for measuring the activity of various such proteins, including those encoded by the genes listed in Tables 1 &amp; 2. The methods of the disclosure may be practiced independent of the particular technique used.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0055">In preferred embodiments, the expression of one or more normalizing (often called “housekeeping”) genes is also obtained for use in normalizing the expression of test genes. As used herein, “normalizing genes” referred to the genes whose expression is used to calibrate or normalize the measured expression of the gene of interest (e.g., test genes). Importantly, the expression of normalizing genes should be independent of cancer outcome/prognosis, and the expression of the normalizing genes is very similar among all the tumor samples. The normalization ensures accurate comparison of expression of a test gene between different samples. For this purpose, housekeeping genes known in the art can be used. Housekeeping genes are well known in the art, with examples including, but are not limited to, GUSB (glucuronidase, beta), HMBS (hydroxymethylbilane synthase), SDHA (succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoprotein), UBC (ubiquitin C) and YWHAZ (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide). One or more housekeeping genes can be used. Preferably, at least 2, 5, 10 or 15 housekeeping genes are used to provide a combined normalizing gene set. The amount of gene expression of such normalizing genes can be averaged, combined together by straight additions or by a defined algorithm. Some examples of particularly useful housekeeper genes for use in the methods and compositions of the disclosure include those listed in Table 3 below.</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0056">In the case of measuring RNA levels for the genes, one convenient and sensitive approach is real-time quantitative PCR™ (qPCR) assay, following a reverse transcription reaction. Typically, a cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) is determined for each test gene and each normalizing gene, i.e., the number of cycles at which the fluorescence from a qPCR reaction above background is detectable.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0057">The overall expression of the one or more normalizing genes can be represented by a “normalizing value” which can be generated by combining the expression of all normalizing genes, either weighted equally (straight addition or averaging) or by different predefined coefficients. For example, in a simplest manner, the normalizing value C<sub>tH </sub>can be the cycle threshold (C<sub>t</sub>) of one single normalizing gene, or an average of the C<sub>t </sub>values of 2 or more, preferably 10 or more, or 15 or more normalizing genes, in which case, the predefined coefficient is 1/N, where N is the total number of normalizing genes used. Thus, C<sub>tH</sub>=(C<sub>tH1</sub>+C<sub>tH2</sub>+ . . . C<sub>tHn</sub>)/N. As will be apparent to skilled artisans, depending on the normalizing genes used, and the weight desired to be given to each normalizing gene, any coefficients (from 0/N to N/N) can be given to the normalizing genes in weighting the expression of such normalizing genes. That is, C<sub>tH</sub>=xC<sub>tH1</sub>+yC<sub>tH2</sub>+ . . . zC<sub>tHn</sub>, wherein x+y+ . . . +z=1.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0058">As discussed above, the methods of the disclosure generally involve determining the level of expression of a panel of CCGs. With modern high-throughput techniques, it is often possible to determine the expression level of tens, hundreds or thousands of genes. Indeed, it is possible to determine the level of expression of the entire transcriptome (i.e., each transcribed sequence in the genome). Once such a global assay has been performed, one may then informatically analyze one or more subsets of transcripts (i.e., panels or, as often used herein, pluralities of test genes). After measuring the expression of hundreds or thousands of transcripts in a sample, for example, one may analyze (e.g., informatically) the expression of a panel or plurality of test genes comprising primarily CCGs according to the present disclosure by combining the expression level values of the individual test genes to obtain a test value.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0059">As will be apparent to a skilled artisan, the test value provided in the present disclosure represents the overall expression level of the plurality of test genes composed substantially of cell-cycle genes. In one embodiment, to provide a test value in the methods of the disclosure, the normalized expression for a test gene can be obtained by normalizing the measured C<sub>t </sub>for the test gene against the C<sub>tH</sub>, i.e., ΔC<sub>t1</sub>=(C<sub>t1</sub>−C<sub>tH</sub>). Thus, the test value representing the overall expression of the plurality of test genes can be provided by combining the normalized expression of all test genes, either by straight addition or averaging (i.e., weighted equally) or by a different predefined coefficient. For example, the simplest approach is averaging the normalized expression of all test genes: test value=(ΔC<sub>t1</sub>+ΔC<sub>t2</sub>+ . . . +ΔC<sub>tn</sub>)/n. As will be apparent to skilled artisans, depending on the test genes used, different weight can also be given to different test genes in the present disclosure. In each case where this document discloses using the expression of a plurality of genes (e.g., “determining [in a tumor sample from the patient] the expression of a plurality of test genes” or “correlating increased expression of said plurality of test genes to an increased likelihood of recurrence”), this includes in some embodiments using a test value representing, corresponding to or derived or calculated from the overall expression of this plurality of genes (e.g., “determining [in a tumor sample from the patient] a test value representing the expression of a plurality of test genes” or “correlating an increased test value [or a test value above some reference value] (optionally representing the expression of said plurality of test genes) to an increased likelihood of response”).</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0060">It has been determined that, once the CCP phenomenon reported herein is appreciated, the choice of individual CCGs for a test panel can often be somewhat arbitrary. In other words, many CCGs have been found to be very good surrogates for each other. Thus any CCG (or panel of CCGs) can be used in the various embodiments of the disclosure. In other embodiments of the disclosure, optimized CCGs are used. One way of assessing whether particular CCGs will serve well in the methods and compositions of the disclosure is by assessing their correlation with the mean expression of CCGs (e.g., all known CCGs, a specific set of CCGs, etc.). Those CCGs that correlate particularly well with the mean are expected to perform well in assays of the disclosure, e.g., because these will reduce noise in the assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0061">126 CCGs and 47 housekeeping genes had their expression compared to the CCG and housekeeping mean in order to determine preferred genes for use in some embodiments of the disclosure. Rankings of select CCGs according to their correlation with the mean CCG expression as well as their ranking according to predictive value are given in Tables 9-11, &amp; 13-14.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">II. Cancer Prognosis</heading>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0063">It has been surprisingly discovered that in selected cancers such as prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer and brain cancer, but not other cancers including certain colon cancer, the expression of cell-cycle genes in tumor cells can accurately predict the degree of aggression of the cancer and risk of recurrence after treatment (e.g., surgical removal of cancer tissue, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, etc.). Thus, the above-described method of determining cell-cycle gene expression can be applied in the prognosis and treatment of such cancers.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0064">Generally, a method is provided for prognosing cancer selected from prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, which comprises determining in a tumor sample from a patient diagnosed of prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer, the expression of at least 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 or at least 8, 9, 10 or 12 cell-cycle genes, wherein high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the at least 4 cell-cycle genes indicates a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient. The expression can be determined in accordance with the method described above. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the cell-cycle genes to a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient; (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the cell-cycle genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the cell-cycle genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0065">In each embodiment described in this document involving correlating a particular assay or analysis output (e.g., high CCP expression, test value incorporating CCP expression greater than some reference value, etc.) to some likelihood (e.g., increased, not increased, decreased, etc.) of some clinical event or outcome (e.g., recurrence, progression, cancer-specific death, etc.), such correlating may comprise assigning a risk or likelihood of the clinical event or outcome occurring based at least in part on the particular assay or analysis output. In some embodiments, such risk is a percentage probability of the event or outcome occurring. In some embodiments, the patient is assigned to a risk group (e.g., low risk, intermediate risk, high risk, etc.). In some embodiments “low risk” is any percentage probability below 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50%. In some embodiments “intermediate risk” is any percentage probability above 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% and below 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, or 75%. In some embodiments “high risk” is any percentage probability above 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99%.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0066">As used herein, “communicating” a particular piece of information means to make such information known to another person or transfer such information to a thing (e.g., a computer). In some methods of the disclosure, a patient's prognosis or risk of recurrence is communicated. In some embodiments, the information used to arrive at such a prognosis or risk prediction (e.g., expression levels of a panel of biomarkers comprising a plurality of CCGs, clinical or pathologic factors, etc.) is communicated. This communication may be auditory (e.g., verbal), visual (e.g., written), electronic (e.g., data transferred from one computer system to another), etc. In some embodiments, communicating a cancer classification comprises generating a report that communicates the cancer classification. In some embodiments the report is a paper report, an auditory report, or an electronic record. In some embodiments the report is displayed and/or stored on a computing device (e.g., handheld device, desktop computer, smart device, website, etc.). In some embodiments the cancer classification is communicated to a physician (e.g., a report communicating the classification is provided to the physician). In some embodiments the cancer classification is communicated to a patient (e.g., a report communicating the classification is provided to the patient). Communicating a cancer classification can also be accomplished by transferring information (e.g., data) embodying the classification to a server computer and allowing an intermediary or end-user to access such information (e.g., by viewing the information as displayed from the server, by downloading the information in the form of one or more files transferred from the server to the intermediary or end-user's device, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0067">Wherever an embodiment of the disclosure comprises concluding some fact (e.g., a patient's prognosis or a patient's likelihood of recurrence), this may include a computer program concluding such fact, typically after performing an algorithm that applies information on CCG status, PTEN status, KLK3 status, and/or clinical variables in a patient sample (e.g., as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, the prognosis method includes (1) obtaining a tumor sample from a patient identified as having prostate cancer, lung cancer, bladder cancer or brain cancer; (2) determining the expression of a panel of genes in the tumor sample including at least 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 cell-cycle genes; and (3) providing a test value by (a) weighting the determined expression of each of a plurality of test genes selected from the panel of genes with a predefined coefficient, and (b) combining the weighted expression to provide said test value, wherein at least 20%, 50%, at least 75% or at least 90% of said plurality of test genes are cell-cycle genes, and wherein high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the plurality of test genes indicates a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the plurality of test genes to a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer in the patient; (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the plurality of test genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis or an increased likelihood of recurrence of cancer based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the plurality of test genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0069">In some embodiments, the expression levels measured in a sample are used to derive or calculate a value or score. This value may be derived solely from these expression levels (e.g., a CCG score) or optionally derived from a combination of the expression value/score with other components (e.g., year of RP, surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, primary Gleason score, secondary Gleason score, or preoperative PSA level, etc.) to give a more comprehensive value/score. Thus, in every case where an embodiment of the disclosure described herein involves determining the status of a biomarker (e.g., RNA expression levels of a CCG, PTEN, or KLK3), related embodiments involve deriving or calculating a value or score from the measured status (e.g., expression score).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0070">In some such embodiments, multiple scores (e.g., CCG, Gleason, PSA, PTEN, KLK3) can be combined into a more comprehensive score. Single component (e.g., CCG) or combined test scores for a particular patient can be compared to single component or combined scores for reference populations as described below, with differences between test and reference scores being correlated to or indicative of some clinical feature. Thus, in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of determining a cancer patient's prognosis comprising (1) obtaining the measured expression levels of a plurality of genes comprising a plurality of CCGs in a sample from the patient, (2) calculating a test value from these measured expression levels, (3) comparing said test value to a reference value calculated from measured expression levels of the plurality of genes in a reference population of patients, and (4)(a) correlating a test value greater than the reference value to a poor prognosis or (4)(b) correlating a test value equal to or less than the reference value to a good prognosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0071">In some such embodiments the test value is calculated by averaging the measured expression of the plurality of genes (as discussed below). In some embodiments the test value is calculated by weighting each of the plurality of genes in a particular way.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0072">In some embodiments the plurality of CCGs are weighted such that they contribute at least some proportion of the test value (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%). In some embodiments each of the plurality of genes is weighted such that not all are given equal weight (e.g., KLK3 weighted to contribute more to the test value than one, some or all CCGs).</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0073">In some embodiments CCP expression is weighted and combined with other factors into a combined score (similar to the test value discussed above). In some embodiments such a combined score is calculated by adding the CCP score and the other factor(s) linearly according to the following formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Combined score=<i>A</i>*(CCP score)+<i>B</i>*(One or more other factors)  (1)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0000">It will be appreciated that this disclosure encompasses other means of combination (e.g., multiplication, logarithms, exponents, etc.). In some embodiments the other factors are expression of other genes, physical characteristics of the patient (e.g., height, weight, etc.), clinical characteristics of the patient (e.g., clinical variables as discussed below), etc. In some embodiments one or more clinical variables can be combined into a clinical score, which can then be combined with the CCP score to yield a Combined Score of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0074">Thus, in some embodiments the disclosure provides an method of determining a cancer patient's prognosis comprising: (1) obtaining the measured expression levels of a plurality of genes comprising a plurality of CCGs in a sample from the patient; (2) obtaining a score for the patient comprising one or more of year of RP, surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, primary Gleason score, secondary Gleason score, or preoperative PSA level; (3) deriving a combined test value from the measured levels obtained in (1) and the score obtained in (2); (4) comparing the combined test value to a combined reference value derived from measured expression levels of the plurality of genes and a score comprising one or more of year of RP, surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, primary Gleason score, secondary Gleason score, or preoperative PSA level in a reference population of patients; and (5)(a) correlating a combined test value greater than the combined reference value to a poor prognosis or (5)(b) correlating a combined test value equal to or less than the combined reference value to a good prognosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0075">In some embodiments the combined score includes CCP score, PSA, and Gleason score. CCP can be a continuous numeric variable. PSA concentrations (e.g., ng/dL), adding 1 to avoid zero values, can be transformed by the natural logarithm. Gleason scores can be a continuous numeric variable or can be categorized, e.g., as &lt;7 (reference level), 7, and &gt;7. In some embodiments Gleason scores can be input as their numerical value (rather than being grouped). In some embodiments a Gleason score of 7 can be further delineated by (3+4) versus (4+3).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0076">In some embodiments the combined score is calculated according to the following formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Combined score=<i>A</i>*(CCP score)+<i>B</i>*(ln(1+[PSA]))+{<i>C </i>(if Gleason=7) or <i>D </i>(if Gleason&gt;7)}  (2)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0000">In some embodiments clinical variables (e.g., PSA, Gleason, etc.) can be combined into a clinical score (e.g., nomogram score), which can then be combined with the CCP score to yield a Combined Score according to the following formula:</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Combined Score=<i>A</i>*(CCP score)+<i>B</i>*(clinical score)  (3)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0000">In some embodiments the clinical score is the CAPRA score or the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram score. CAPRA score may be calculated as discussed herein (see especially Example 8 below). In some embodiments the clinical score is not a combination of clinical variables but instead a score representing one variable (e.g., Gleason score).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0077">The Combined Score with CCP and other components weighted as discussed herein encompasses, mutatis mutandis, any modified or scaled version thereof.

In some embodiments, any of the formulae discussed herein is used in the methods, systems, etc. of the disclosure to determine prognosis based on a patient's prostate biopsy sample. In some embodiments CCP score is the unweighted mean of C<sub>T </sub>values for expression of the CCP genes being analyzed, optionally normalized by the unweighted mean of the HK genes so that higher values indicate higher expression (in some embodiments one unit is equivalent to a two-fold change in expression). In some embodiments the CCP score ranges from −8 to 8 or from −1.6 to 3.7.</p>

or between 13 and 14, 15, or 20; or between 14 and 15, or 20; or between 15 and 20. In some embodiments, A, B, and/or C is within rounding of any of these values (e.g., A is between 0.45 and 0.54, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0081">In some embodiments the patient's percentage risk (absolute or relative) of a particular clinical event or outcome (e.g., cancer-specific death, recurrence after surgery, etc.) is estimated (e.g., calculated) according to the disclosure (e.g., according to one or more of the formulae above). Such risk may be estimated by applying the hazard ratio for a particular parameter (e.g., CCP score, Combined Score) to that parameter to yield a patient's relative risk of a particular clinical outcome (e.g., cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death). In some cases, the hazard ratio represents the relative risk increase per unit of the parameter. In some of the examples below, for instance, a single unit increase in CCP score (which represents a doubling of expression) represents a relative risk increased by the multiple of the hazard ration. Where the hazard ratio is equal to 2, for example, a single unit increase in CCP score corresponds to a doubling of relative risk (i.e., a first patient with a CCP score that is one unit higher than a second patient has twice the risk of cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death). This relative risk can be used with the average risk in a particular population to determine how a specific patient's risk compares to such population. One way to do this is to set the average value of the parameter in the population as zero and then compare specific patient's values for the parameter, meaning a patient with, e.g., a CCP score of 1 would have double the average risk of cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0082">Some embodiments of the disclosure, therefore, provide a method of calculating a patient's risk of cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death comprising (1) obtaining the measured expression levels of a plurality of genes comprising at least 3 genes chosen from any of Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y or Panels A through I in a sample from the patient, (2) calculating a test value from these measured expression levels as discussed herein (e.g., CCP genes contributing at least some weight, at least some number of CCP genes, etc.), and (3) calculating said patient's risk of cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death by multiplying the number of increased units of the test value over some reference value (e.g., average values in a particular population) by the hazard ratio for the value. In some embodiments, the test value comprises the CCP score or a Combined Score as described herein and the hazard ration is any of the hazard ratios reported herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0083">A more absolute (rather than relative) risk of recurrence may also be estimated by gathering data from a study patient cohort and correlating test values and scores for such patients with their eventual clinical events or outcomes. Such data may be used in a graphical form (<figref>FIGS. 23 &amp; 24</figref>), tabular form, or as embodied in a formula (e.g., formula (4) below) to, based on a test patient's score, determine such test patient's risk of the particular clinical event or outcome. For example, one may measure a patient's CCP Score as 1.7, calculate a patient's CAPRA score as 5, and then calculate the patient's (e.g., biopsy) Combined Score using formula (2), with A=0.57 &amp; B=0.39, as 2.92. One may then use this Combined Score to calculate such patient's risk of cancer-specific death within 10 years by, e.g., using a pre-specified formula (e.g., formula (4)), using a curve (e.g., <figref>FIG. 23</figref> or <b>24</b>), or a risk table. In some embodiments, the risk is anything within the 95% confidence interval, e.g., the intervals shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref> or <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0084">Using these empirical data (e.g., those embodied in <figref>FIGS. 23 &amp; 24</figref>), one may derive formulae of the following general form to estimate risk:</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Estimated Risk of <i>A=B*e</i><sup>C*D</sup>  (4)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0000">Often, these formulae will be derived by plotting risk versus CCP Score or Combined Score for a set of study patient samples and fitting a curve to the resultant line (e.g., one of the lines shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>). In some embodiments, A is cancer-specific death or biochemical recurrence. In some embodiments, D is CCP score or a Combined Score (each as described in the various aspects and embodiments herein). In some embodiments B=0.0155 &amp; C=0.0054 (as derived from, e.g., a line as shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>). In such a case, formula (4) would be modified as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Estimated Risk of Cancer-Specific Death=0.0155<i>*e</i><sup>0.0054*(Combined Score)</sup>  (5)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0000">where the Combined Score is calculated according to any of the formulae discussed herein. In some such specific embodiments, the Combined Score is calculated according to formula (2) with A=0.57 &amp; B=0.39 and the clinical score being the CAPRA score.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0085">Thus, in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of calculating a patient's risk of prostate cancer-specific death comprising: (1) obtaining the measured expression levels of a plurality of genes comprising at least 4 genes from any of Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y or Panels A through I; (2) optionally obtaining a score for the patient calculated from at least one clinical variable (e.g., one or more of year of RP, surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, primary Gleason score, secondary Gleason score, or preoperative PSA level); (3) optionally deriving a combined test value from the measured levels obtained in (1) and the score obtained in (2); (4) and calculating the patient's risk of prostate cancer-specific death according to the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0086">In some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of calculating a patient's risk of prostate cancer-specific death comprising: (1) obtaining the measured expression levels of a plurality of genes comprising at least 4 genes from any of Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y or Panels A through I; (2) optionally obtaining a CAPRA score for the patient sample as discussed herein; (3) optionally deriving a combined test value from the measured levels obtained in (1) and the score obtained in (2) according to the formula: Combined Score=(0.57*(Score in (2))+(0.39*Score in (1)); (4) and calculating the patient's risk of prostate cancer-specific death according to the table in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0087">In some embodiments, the test value derived or calculated from a particular gene (e.g., KLK3) or from the overall expression of the plurality of test genes (e.g., CCGs) is compared to one or more reference values (or index values), and the test value is optionally correlated to prognosis, risk of cancer progression, risk of cancer recurrence, or risk of cancer-specific death if it differs from the index value.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0088">For example, the index value may be derived or calculated from the gene expression levels found in a normal sample obtained from the patient of interest, in which case a test value (derived or calculated from an expression level in the tumor sample) significantly higher than this index value would indicate, e.g., a poor prognosis or increased likelihood of cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death or a need for aggressive treatment. In some embodiments the test value is deemed “greater than” the reference value (e.g., the threshold index value), and thus correlated to an increased likelihood of response to treatment comprising chemotherapy, if the test value exceeds the reference value by at least some amount (e.g., at least 0.5, 0.75, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more fold or standard deviations).</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0089">Alternatively, the index value may be derived or calculated from the average expression level of for a set of individuals from a diverse cancer population or a subset of the population. For example, one may determine the average expression level of a gene or gene panel in a random sampling of patients with cancer (e.g., prostate, bladder, brain, breast, or lung cancer). This average expression level may be termed the “threshold index value,” with patients having CCG expression higher than this value expected to have a poorer prognosis than those having expression lower than this value.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0090">Alternatively the index value may represent the average expression level of a particular gene marker or plurality of markers in a plurality of training patients (e.g., prostate cancer patients) with similar outcomes whose clinical and follow-up data are available and sufficient to define and categorize the patients by disease outcome, e.g., recurrence or prognosis. See, e.g., Examples, infra. For example, a “good prognosis index value” can be generated from a plurality of training cancer patients characterized as having “good outcome”, e.g., those who have not had cancer recurrence five years (or ten years or more) after initial treatment, or who have not had progression in their cancer five years (or ten years or more) after initial diagnosis. A “poor prognosis index value” can be generated from a plurality of training cancer patients defined as having “poor outcome”, e.g., those who have had cancer recurrence within five years (or ten years, etc.) after initial treatment, or who have had progression in their cancer within five years (or ten years, etc.) after initial diagnosis. Thus, a good prognosis index value of a particular gene may represent the average level of expression of the particular gene in patients having a “good outcome,” whereas a poor prognosis index value of a particular gene represents the average level of expression of the particular gene in patients having a “poor outcome.”</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0091">Thus one aspect of the disclosure provides a method of classifying cancer comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs, in tissue or cell sample, particularly a tumor sample, from a patient, wherein an abnormal status indicates a negative cancer classification. As used herein, “determining the status” of a gene refers to determining the presence, absence, or extent/level of some physical, chemical, or genetic characteristic of the gene or its expression product(s). Such characteristics include, but are not limited to, expression levels, activity levels, mutations, copy number, methylation status, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0092">In the context of CCGs as used to determine risk of cancer recurrence or progression or need for aggressive treatment, particularly useful characteristics include expression levels (e.g., mRNA or protein levels) and activity levels. Characteristics may be assayed directly (e.g., by assaying a CCG's expression level) or determined indirectly (e.g., assaying the level of a gene or genes whose expression level is correlated to the expression level of the CCG). Thus some embodiments of the disclosure provide a method of classifying cancer comprising determining the expression level, particularly mRNA level of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs, in a tumor sample, wherein high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) indicates a negative cancer classification, or an increased risk of cancer recurrence or progression, or a need for aggressive treatment. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes to a negative cancer classification, an increased risk of cancer recurrence or progression, or a need for aggressive treatment; (b) concluding that the patient has a negative cancer classification, an increased risk of cancer recurrence or progression, or a need for aggressive treatment based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a negative cancer classification, an increased risk of cancer recurrence or progression, or a need for aggressive treatment based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0093">“Abnormal status” means a marker's status in a particular sample differs from the status generally found in average samples (e.g., healthy samples or average diseased samples). Examples include mutated, elevated, decreased, present, absent, etc. An “elevated status” means that one or more of the above characteristics (e.g., expression or mRNA level) is higher than normal levels. Generally this means an increase in the characteristic (e.g., expression or mRNA level) as compared to an index value. Conversely a “low status” means that one or more of the above characteristics (e.g., gene expression or mRNA level) is lower than normal levels. Generally this means a decrease in the characteristic (e.g., expression) as compared to an index value. In this context, a “negative status” generally means the characteristic is absent or undetectable. For example, PTEN status is negative if PTEN nucleic acid and/or PTEN protein is absent or undetectable in a sample. However, negative PTEN status also includes a mutation or copy number reduction in PTEN.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0094">In some embodiments of the disclosure the methods comprise determining the expression of one or more CCGs and, if this expression is “increased,” the patient has a poor prognosis. In the context of the disclosure, “increased” expression of a CCG means the patient's expression level is either elevated over a normal index value or a threshold index (e.g., by at least some threshold amount) or closer to the “poor prognosis index value” than to the “good prognosis index value.”</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0095">Thus, when the determined level of expression of a relevant gene marker is closer to the good prognosis index value of the gene than to the poor prognosis index value of the gene, then it can be concluded that the patient is more likely to have a good prognosis, i.e., a low (or no increased) likelihood of cancer recurrence. On the other hand, if the determined level of expression of a relevant gene marker is closer to the poor prognosis index value of the gene than to the good prognosis index value of the gene, then it can be concluded that the patient is more likely to have a poor prognosis, i.e., an increased likelihood of cancer recurrence.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0096">Alternatively index values may be determined thusly: In order to assign patients to risk groups, a threshold value will be set for the cell cycle mean. The optimal threshold value is selected based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots sensitivity vs (1−specificity). For each increment of the cell cycle mean, the sensitivity and specificity of the test is calculated using that value as a threshold. The actual threshold will be the value that optimizes these metrics according to the artisans requirements (e.g., what degree of sensitivity or specificity is desired, etc.). Example 5 demonstrates determination of a threshold value determined and validated experimentally.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0097">Panels of CCGs (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more CCGs) can accurately predict prognosis, as shown in Example 3. Those skilled in the art are familiar with various ways of determining the expression of a panel of genes (i.e., a plurality of genes). One may determine the expression of a panel of genes by determining the average expression level (normalized or absolute) of all panel genes in a sample obtained from a particular patient (either throughout the sample or in a subset of cells from the sample or in a single cell). Increased expression in this context will mean the average expression is higher than the average expression level of these genes in normal patients (or higher than some index value that has been determined to represent the average expression level in a reference population such as patients with the same cancer). Alternatively, one may determine the expression of a panel of genes by determining the average expression level (normalized or absolute) of at least a certain number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or more) or at least a certain proportion (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%) of the genes in the panel. Alternatively, one may determine the expression of a panel of genes by determining the absolute copy number of the mRNA (or protein) of all the genes in the panel and either total or average these across the genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0098">As used herein, “classifying a cancer” and “cancer classification” refer to determining one or more clinically-relevant features of a cancer and/or determining a particular prognosis of a patient having said cancer. Thus “classifying a cancer” includes, but is not limited to: (i) evaluating metastatic potential, potential to metastasize to specific organs, risk of recurrence, and/or course of the tumor; (ii) evaluating tumor stage; (iii) determining patient prognosis in the absence of treatment of the cancer; (iv) determining prognosis of patient response (e.g., tumor shrinkage or progression-free survival) to treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery to excise tumor, etc.); (v) diagnosis of actual patient response to current and/or past treatment; (vi) determining a preferred course of treatment for the patient; (vii) prognosis for patient relapse after treatment (either treatment in general or some particular treatment); (viii) prognosis of patient life expectancy (e.g., prognosis for overall survival), etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0099">Thus, a “negative classification” means an unfavorable clinical feature of the cancer (e.g., a poor prognosis). Examples include (i) an increased metastatic potential, potential to metastasize to specific organs, and/or risk of recurrence; (ii) an advanced tumor stage; (iii) a poor patient prognosis in the absence of treatment of the cancer; (iv) a poor prognosis of patient response (e.g., tumor shrinkage or progression-free survival) to a particular treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery to excise tumor, etc.); (v) a poor prognosis for patient relapse after treatment (either treatment in general or some particular treatment); (vi) a poor prognosis of patient life expectancy (e.g., prognosis for overall survival), etc. In some embodiments a recurrence-associated clinical parameter (or a high nomogram score) and increased expression of a CCG indicate a negative classification in cancer (e.g., increased likelihood of recurrence or progression).</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0100">A patient with a sample showing a high CCP score or value (or increased CCP expression) has an increased likelihood of recurrence after treatment (e.g., the cancer cells not killed or removed by the treatment will quickly grow back). Such a patient also has an increased likelihood of cancer progression for more rapid progression (e.g., the rapidly proliferating cells will cause any tumor to grow quickly, gain in virulence, and/or metastasize). Such a patient may also require a relatively more aggressive treatment. Thus, in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of classifying cancer comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs, wherein an abnormal status indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating abnormal status of the panel of genes to an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on abnormal status of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on abnormal status of the panel of genes. As discussed above, in some embodiments the status to be determined is gene expression levels. Thus in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of determining the prognosis of a patient's cancer comprising determining the expression level of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs, wherein high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression of the cancer. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes to an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0101">“Recurrence” and “progression” are terms well-known in the art and are used herein according to their known meanings Because the methods of the disclosure can predict or determine a patient's likelihood of each, “recurrence,” “progression,” “cancer-specific death,” and “response to a particular treatment” are used interchangeably, unless specified otherwise, in the sense that a reference to one applies equally to the others. As an example, the meaning of “progression” may be cancer-type dependent, with progression in lung cancer meaning something different from progression in prostate cancer. However, within each cancer-type and subtype “progression” is clearly understood to those skilled in the art. Because predicting recurrence and predicting progression are prognostic endeavors, “predicting prognosis” will often be used herein to refer to either or both. In these cases, a “poor prognosis” will generally refer to an increased likelihood of recurrence, progression, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0102">“Response” (e.g., response to a particular treatment regimen) is a well-known term in the art and is used herein according to its known meaning. As an example, the meaning of “response” may be cancer-type dependent, with response in lung cancer meaning something different from response in prostate cancer. However, within each cancer-type and subtype “response” is clearly understood to those skilled in the art. For example, some objective criteria of response include Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), a set of published rules (e.g., changes in tumor size, etc.) that define when cancer patients improve (“respond”), stay the same (“stabilize”), or worsen (“progression”) during treatments. See, e.g., Eisenhauer et al., E<smallcaps>UR</smallcaps>. J. C<smallcaps>ANCER </smallcaps>(2009) 45:228-247. “Response” can also include survival metrics (e.g., “disease-free survival” (DFS), “overall survival” (OS), etc). In some cases RECIST criteria can include: (a) Complete response (CR): disappearance of all metastases; (b) Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the largest diameter (LD) of the metastatic lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; (c) Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started; (d) Progression (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the target metastatic lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0103">As used herein, a patient has an “increased likelihood” of some clinical feature or outcome (e.g., recurrence or progression) if the probability of the patient having the feature or outcome exceeds some reference probability or value. The reference probability may be the probability of the feature or outcome across the general relevant patient population. For example, if the probability of recurrence in the general prostate cancer population is X % and a particular patient has been determined by the methods of the present disclosure to have a probability of recurrence of Y %, and if Y&gt;X, then the patient has an “increased likelihood” of recurrence. Alternatively, as discussed above, a threshold or reference value may be determined and a particular patient's probability of recurrence may be compared to that threshold or reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0104">In some embodiments the method correlates the patient's specific score (e.g., CCP score, combined score of CCP with clinical variables) to a specific probability (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%) of recurrence, progression, or cancer-specific death (each optionally within a specific timeframe, e.g., 5 years, 10 years), or response to a particular treatment. In some embodiments the disclosure provides a method for determining a prostate cancer patient's prognosis comprising: (1) determining from a patient sample the expression levels of a plurality of test genes, wherein the plurality of test genes comprises at least 5 of the genes in any one of Panels A to G; (2) deriving a test value from the expression levels determined in (1), wherein the at least 5 genes in any one of Panels A to G contribute at least 25% to the test value; (3) comparing the test value to a reference value; and (4) assigning a likelihood of recurrence, progression, cancer-specific death, or response to a particular treatment based at least in part on the comparison in (3).</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0105">In some embodiments, the patient sample is from a prostate biopsy, the test value is the mean C<sub>T </sub>for the genes in Panel F normalized against the genes in Table 3, and the likelihood of prostate cancer-specific death within 10 years of diagnosis is calculated as follows:</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0109">Example 3 also shows that panels of CCGs (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 CCGs) can accurately predict prognosis. Thus in some aspects the disclosure provides a method of classifying a cancer comprising determining the status of a panel of genes (e.g., a plurality of test genes) comprising a plurality of CCGs. For example, increased expression in a panel of genes (or plurality of test genes) may refer to the average expression level of all panel or test genes in a particular patient being higher than the average expression level of these genes in normal patients (or higher than some index value that has been determined to represent the normal average expression level). Alternatively, increased expression in a panel of genes may refer to increased expression in at least a certain number (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 or more) or at least a certain proportion (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%) of the genes in the panel as compared to the average normal expression level.</p>

In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 10, 15, 20, or more CCGs. In some embodiments the panel comprises between 5 and 100 CCGs, between 7 and 40 CCGs, between 5 and 25 CCGs, between 10 and 20 CCGs, or between 10 and 15 CCGs. In some embodiments CCGs comprise at least a certain proportion of the panel.

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0111">In some of these embodiments elevated expression indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression. Thus in a preferred embodiment the disclosure provides a method of predicting risk of cancer recurrence or progression in a patient comprising determining the status of a panel of genes, wherein the panel comprises between about 10 and about 15 CCGs, the CCGs constitute at least 90% of the panel, and an elevated status for the CCGs indicates an increased likelihood or recurrence or progression. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes to a poor prognosis; (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0112">Several panels of CCGs (Table 2, supra, and Tables 7 &amp; 8, infra) have been evaluated for their ability to predict prognosis in several different cancers. The results of these studies are described in Examples 1 through 6 below.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0113">It has been determined that the choice of individual CCGs for a panel can often be relatively arbitrary. In other words, most CCGs have been found to be very good surrogates for each other. One way of assessing whether particular CCGs will serve well in the methods and compositions of the disclosure is by assessing their correlation with the mean expression of CCGs (e.g., all known CCGs, a specific set of CCGs, etc.). Those CCGs that correlate particularly well with the mean are expected to perform well in assays of the disclosure, e.g., because these will reduce noise in the assay. A ranking of select CCGs according to their correlation with the mean CCG expression is given in Tables 9-11.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0114">In CCG signatures the particular CCGs assayed is often not as important as the total number of CCGs. The number of CCGs assayed can vary depending on many factors, e.g., technical constraints, cost considerations, the classification being made, the cancer being tested, the desired level of predictive power, etc. Increasing the number of CCGs assayed in a panel according to the disclosure is, as a general matter, advantageous because, e.g., a larger pool of mRNAs to be assayed means less “noise” caused by outliers and less chance of an assay error throwing off the overall predictive power of the test. However, cost and other considerations will generally limit this number and finding the optimal number of CCGs for a signature is desirable.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0115">It has been discovered that the predictive power of a CCG signature often ceases to increase significantly beyond a certain number of CCGs (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>; Example 1). More specifically, the optimal number of CCGs in a signature (n<sub>O</sub>) can be found wherever the following is true</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae](<i>P</i><sub>n+1</sub><i>−P</i><sub>n</sub>)&lt;<i>C</i><sub>O</sub>,[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0000">wherein P is the predictive power (i.e., P<sub>n </sub>is the predictive power of a signature with n genes and P<sub>n+1 </sub>is the predictive power of a signature with n genes plus one) and C<sub>O </sub>is some optimization constant. Predictive power can be defined in many ways known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, the signature's p-value. C<sub>O </sub>can be chosen by the artisan based on his or her specific constraints. For example, if cost is not a critical factor and extremely high levels of sensitivity and specificity are desired, C<sub>O </sub>can be set very low such that only trivial increases in predictive power are disregarded. On the other hand, if cost is decisive and moderate levels of sensitivity and specificity are acceptable, C<sub>O </sub>can be set higher such that only significant increases in predictive power warrant increasing the number of genes in the signature.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0116">Alternatively, a graph of predictive power as a function of gene number may be plotted (as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) and the second derivative of this plot taken. The point at which the second derivative decreases to some predetermined value (C<sub>O</sub>′) may be the optimal number of genes in the signature.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0117">Examples 1 &amp; 3 and <figref>FIGS. 1 &amp; 17</figref> illustrate the empirical determination of optimal numbers of CCGs in CCG panels of the disclosure. Randomly selected subsets of the 31 CCGs listed in Table 7 were tested as distinct CCG signatures and predictive power (i.e., p-value) was determined for each. As <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows, p-values ceased to improve significantly between about 10 and about 15 CCGs, thus indicating that an optimal number of CCGs in a prognostic panel is from about 10 to about 15. Thus some embodiments of the disclosure provide a method of predicting prognosis in a patient having prostate cancer comprising determining the status of a panel of genes, wherein the panel comprises between about 10 and about 15 CCGs and an elevated status for the CCGs indicates a poor prognosis. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes to a poor prognosis; (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes. In some embodiments the panel comprises between about 10 and about 15 CCGs and the CCGs constitute at least 90% of the panel. In other embodiments the panel comprises CCGs plus one or more additional markers that significantly increase the predictive power of the panel (i.e., make the predictive power significantly better than if the panel consisted of only the CCGs). Any other combination of CCGs (including any of those listed in Table 1 or Panels A through G) can be used to practice the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0118">It has been discovered that CCGs are particularly predictive in certain cancers. For example, panels of CCGs have been determined to be accurate in predicting recurrence in prostate cancer (Examples 1 through 5). Further, CCGs can determine prognosis in bladder, brain, breast and lung cancers, as summarized in Example 6 below.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0119">Thus the disclosure provides a method comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs, wherein an abnormal status indicates a poor prognosis. In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 2 genes chosen from the group of genes in at least one of Panels A through G. In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 10 genes chosen from the group of genes in at least one of Panels A through G. In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 15 genes chosen from the group of genes in at least one of Panels A through G. In some embodiments the panel comprises all of the genes in at least one of Panels A through G. The disclosure also provides a method of determining the prognosis of bladder cancer, comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs (e.g., at least two of the genes in any of Panels B, C, &amp; F), wherein an abnormal status indicates a poor prognosis. The disclosure also provides a method of determining the prognosis of brain cancer, comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs (e.g., at least two of the genes in any of Panels B, C, &amp; F), wherein an abnormal status indicates a poor prognosis. The disclosure further provides a method of determining the prognosis of breast cancer, comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs (e.g., at least two of the genes in any of Panels B, C, &amp; F), wherein an abnormal status indicates a poor prognosis. The disclosure also provides a method of determining the prognosis of lung cancer, comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least two CCGs (e.g., at least two of the genes in any of Panels B, C, &amp; F), wherein an abnormal status indicates a poor prognosis. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating abnormal status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes to a poor prognosis; (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on abnormal status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis based at least in part on high expression (or increased expression or overexpression) of the panel of genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0120">In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more CCGs. In some embodiments the panel comprises between 5 and 100 CCGs, between 7 and 40 CCGs, between 5 and 25 CCGs, between 10 and 20 CCGs, or between 10 and 15 CCGs. In some embodiments CCGs comprise at least a certain proportion of the panel. Thus in some embodiments the panel comprises at least 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% CCGs. In some embodiments the CCGs are chosen from the group consisting of the genes listed in Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y and Panels A through I. In some embodiments the panel comprises at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or more genes chosen from the group of genes in any of Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y or Panels A through I. In some embodiments the panel comprises all of the genes in any of Tables 1, 2, 7-11, 13-14 and/or Y or Panels A through I.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0121">As mentioned above, many of the CCGs of the disclosure have been analyzed to determine their correlation to the CCG mean and also to determine their relative predictive value within a panel (see Tables 9-11, &amp; 13-14). The following tables rank CCGs according to these criteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0122">Tables 9-11 below provide rankings of select CCGs according to their correlation with the mean CCG expression. Table 9 provides a ranking of select control genes according to their correlation to the control mean expression.</p>

      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0126">It has further been discovered that CCG status synergistically adds to clinical parameters in prognosing cancer. In the case of prostate cancer, for example, it has been discovered that a high level of gene expression of any one of the genes in Panels C through F is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer recurrence or progression in patients whose clinical nomogram score indicates a relatively low risk of recurrence or progression. Because evaluating CCG expression levels can thus detect increased risk not detected using clinical parameters alone, the disclosure generally provides methods combining evaluating at least one clinical parameter with evaluating the status of at least one CCG.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0127">As Example 3 shows, even individual CCGs add to clinical parameters in predicting cancer recurrence. Thus one aspect of the disclosure provides an in vitro diagnostic method comprising determining at least one clinical parameter for a cancer patient and determining the status of at least one CCG in a sample obtained from the patient. However, assessing the status of multiple CCGs improves predictive power even more (also shown in Example 1). Thus in some embodiments the status of a plurality of CCGs (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 or more) is determined. In some embodiments abnormal status indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression. In some embodiments the patient has prostate cancer. In some embodiments the patient has lung cancer. Often the clinical parameter is at least somewhat independently predictive of recurrence or progression and the addition of CCG status improves the predictive power. As used herein, “clinical parameter” and “clinical measure” refer to disease or patient characteristics that are typically applied to assess disease course and/or predict outcome. Examples in cancer generally include tumor stage, tumor grade, lymph node status, histology, performance status, type of surgery, surgical margins, type of treatment, and age of onset. In prostate cancer clinicians often use pre-surgery blood PSA levels, stage (defined by size of tumor and evidence of metastasis), and Gleason score (similar to concept of grade). After surgical intervention, important clinical parameters in prostate cancer include margin and lymph node status. In breast cancer clinicians often use size of index lesion in cm, invasion, number of nodes involved, and grade.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0128">Often certain clinical parameters are correlated with a particular disease character. For example, in cancer generally as well as in specific cancers, certain clinical parameters are correlated with, e.g., likelihood of recurrence or metastasis, prognosis for survival for a certain amount of time, likelihood of response to treatment generally or to a specific treatment, etc. In prostate cancer some clinical parameters are such that their status (presence, absence, level, etc.) is associated with increased likelihood of recurrence. Examples of such recurrence-associated parameters (some but not all of which are specific to prostate cancer) include high PSA levels (e.g., greater than 4 ng/ml), high Gleason score, large tumor size, evidence of metastasis, advanced tumor stage, nuclear grade, lymph node involvement, early age of onset. Other types of cancer may have different parameters correlated to likelihood of recurrence or progression, and CCG status, as a measure of proliferative activity, adds to these parameters in predicting prognosis in these cancers. As used herein, “recurrence-associated clinical parameter” has its conventional meaning for each specific cancer, with which those skilled in the art are quite familiar. In fact, those skilled in the art are familiar with various recurrence-associated clinical parameters beyond those listed here.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0129">Often a physician will assess more than one clinical parameter in a patient and make a more comprehensive evaluation for the disease characters of interest. Example 5 shows how CCG status can add to one particular grouping of clinical parameters used to determine risk of recurrence in prostate cancer. Clinical parameters in Example 5 include binary variables for organ-confined disease and Gleason score less than or equal to 6, and a continuous variable for logarithmic PSA (Table I). This model includes all of the clinical parameters incorporated in the post-RP nomogram (i.e., Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) except for Year of RP and the two components of the Gleason score. Thus in some embodiments at least two clinical parameters (e.g., two of the above listed parameters) are assessed along with the expression level of at least one CCG.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0130">One way in which single, but more often multiple, clinical parameters are utilized by physicians is with the help of nomograms. In the clinical setting, nomograms are representations (often visual) of a correlation between one or more parameters and one or more patient or disease characters. An example of a prevalent clinical nomogram used in determining a prostate cancer patient's likelihood of recurrence is described in Kattan et al., J. C<smallcaps>LIN</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL. </smallcaps>(1999) 17:1499-1507, and updated in Stephenson et al., J. C<smallcaps>LIN</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL</smallcaps>. (2005) 23:7005-7012 (“Kattan-Stephenson nomogram”). This nomogram evaluates a patient by assigning a point value to each of several clinical parameters (year of RP, surgical margins, extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node involvement, primary Gleason score, secondary Gleason score, and preoperative PSA level), totaling the points for a patient into a nomogram score, and then predicting the patient's likelihood of being recurrence-free at varying time intervals (up to 10 years) based on this nomogram score. An example of a prevalent clinical nomogram used in determining a breast cancer patient's prognosis for survival is the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI). See, e.g., Galea et al., B<smallcaps>REAST </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ANCER </smallcaps>R<smallcaps>ES</smallcaps>. &amp; T<smallcaps>REAT</smallcaps>. (1992) 22:207-19.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0131">It has been discovered that determining the status of a CCG in a sample obtained from a prostate cancer patient, along with the patient's Kattan-Stephenson nomogram score, is a better predictor of 10-year recurrence-free survival than the nomogram score alone. See, e.g., Examples 2 &amp; 5, infra. Specifically, adding CCG status to the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram detects patients at significantly increased risk of recurrence that the nomogram alone does not. Table 7 above provides an exemplary panel of 31 CCGs (Panel C) and a subset panel of 26 CCGs (Panel D, shown with *) determined in Example 2 to show predictive synergy with the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram in prostate cancer prognosis. It has also been discovered that determining the status of a CCG in a sample obtained from a breast cancer patient, along with the patient's NPI score, is a better prognostic predictor than NPI score alone. See, e.g., Example 6, infra. Specifically, adding CCG status to the NPI nomogram detects patients at significantly increased risk of recurrence that the nomogram alone does not. Panels B, C and D were determined in Example 2 to show predictive synergy with the NPI nomogram in breast cancer prognosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0132">Thus another aspect of the disclosure provides an in vitro method comprising determining a clinical nomogram score (e.g., Kattan-Stephenson or NPI nomogram score) for a cancer patient and determining the status of at least one CCG in a sample obtained from the patient. Example 3 illustrates the empirical determination of the predictive power of individual CCGs and of several CCG panels of varying size over the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram. Randomly selected subsets of the 31 CCGs listed in Table 7 were tested as distinct CCG signatures and predictive power (i.e., p-value) was determined for each. As <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows, CCG signatures of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 26 genes each add predictive power to the nomogram. Thus the disclosure provides a method of determining whether a prostate cancer patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 or more CCGs, wherein an elevated status (e.g., increased expression) for the CCGs indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments the method further comprises determining a clinical nomogram score of the patient. The disclosure further provides a method of determining whether a breast cancer patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence comprising determining the status of a panel of genes comprising at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 or more CCGs, wherein an elevated status (e.g., increased expression) for the CCGs indicates an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments the method further comprises determining a clinical nomogram score of the patient. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes to an increased likelihood of recurrence; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes; or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on elevated status (e.g., high or increased expression) of the panel of genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0133">Often clinical nomograms for cancer are designed such that a particular value (e.g., high score) correlates with an increased risk of recurrence. Elevated CCG status (e.g., increased expression or activity) is also correlated with increased risk. Thus, in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of determining whether a cancer patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression comprising determining a clinical nomogram score for the patient and determining the status of at least one CCG in a sample obtained from the patient, wherein a high nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status indicate the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression. In some embodiments the cancer is prostate cancer. In some embodiments the cancer is lung cancer. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating a high nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression) to an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on a high nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression); or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence or progression based at least in part on a high nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression).</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0134">In some embodiments this assessment is made before radical prostatectomy (e.g., using a prostate biopsy sample) while in some embodiments it is made after (e.g., using the resected prostate sample). In some embodiments, a sample of one or more cells are obtained from a prostate cancer patient before or after treatment for analysis according to the present disclosure. Prostate cancer treatment currently applied in the art includes, e.g., prostatectomy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy (e.g., using GnRH antagonists, GnRH agonists, antiandrogens), chemotherapy, and high intensity focused ultrasound. In some embodiments, one or more prostate tumor cells from prostate cancer tissue are obtained from a prostate cancer patient during biopsy or prostatectomy and are used for analysis in the method of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0135">The present disclosure is also based on the discovery that PTEN status predicts aggressive prostate cancer. PTEN status adds to both clinical parameters (e.g., Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) and CCGs (e.g., the genes in Table 1 or Panels A through G). As described in more detail in Example 4 below, PTEN status was determined in 191 prostate cancer patient samples with accompanying clinical history data and CCG signature data. Negative PTEN status was found to be a significant predictor for risk of recurrence (p-value 0.031). PTEN remained a significant predictor of recurrence after adjusting for post-surgery clinical parameters and the CCG signature shown in Table 7 (p-value 0.026). In addition, and importantly, the combination of PTEN and the CCG signature seems to be a better predictor of recurrence than post-surgery clinical parameters (p-value 0.0002).</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0136">Because PTEN is an independent predictor of prostate cancer recurrence, one aspect of the disclosure provides a method of predicting a patient's likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence comprising determining PTEN status in a sample from the patient, wherein a low or negative PTEN status indicates the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) to an increased likelihood of recurrence; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression); or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression). PTEN status can be determined by any technique known in the art, including but not limited to those discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0137">Because PTEN adds to CCG status in predicting prostate cancer recurrence, another aspect of the disclosure provides an in vitro method comprising determining PTEN status and determining the status of a plurality of CCGs in a sample obtained from a patient. Different combinations of techniques can be used to determine the status the various markers. For example, in one embodiment PTEN status is determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) while the status of the plurality of CCGs is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR™), e.g., TaqMan™. Some embodiments of the disclosure provide a method of determining a prostate cancer patient's likelihood of recurrence comprising determining PTEN status in a sample obtained from the patient, determining the status of a plurality of CCGs in a sample obtained from the patient, wherein low or negative PTEN status and/or elevated CCG status indicate the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression) to an increased likelihood of recurrence; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression); or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression).</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0138">Because PTEN status adds predictive value to clinical parameters in predicting prostate recurrence, yet another aspect of the disclosure provides an in vitro method comprising determining PTEN status and determining at least one clinical parameter for a cancer patient. Often the clinical parameter is at least somewhat independently predictive of recurrence and the addition of PTEN status improves the predictive power. In some embodiments the disclosure provides a method of determining whether a cancer patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence comprising determining the status of PTEN in a sample obtained from the patient and determining a clinical nomogram score for the patient, wherein low or negative PTEN status and/or a unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score indicate the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score to an increased likelihood of recurrence; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score; or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression) and/or unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0139">Because all three of the above markers are additive, some embodiments of the disclosure provide a method of determining whether a cancer patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence comprising determining the status of PTEN in a sample obtained from the patient, determining a clinical nomogram score for the patient and determining the status of at least one CCG in a sample obtained from the patient, wherein low or negative PTEN status, an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status indicate the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence. In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression) to an increased likelihood of recurrence; (b) concluding that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression); or (c) communicating that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status (e.g., low or negative expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or elevated CCG status (e.g., high or increased expression).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0140">The present disclosure is also based on the discovery that kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3) RNA status predicts aggressive prostate cancer. KLK3 (Entrez Gene Id No. 354) is the gene encoding PSA protein. KLK3 status adds to both clinical parameters (e.g., Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) and CCGs (e.g., the genes in Table 1 or Panels A through G). As described in more detail in Examples 7 &amp; 9 below, KLK3 RNA expression was measured in prostate cancer patient samples with accompanying clinical history data and CCG signature data. Of note, KLK3 RNA expression in FFPE was not well-correlated to serum PSA protein levels. Decreased KLK3 expression was found to be a significant predictor for risk of recurrence (p-value&lt;0.0005). KLK3 was a significant predictor of recurrence independent of post-surgery clinical parameters (e.g., Gleason score, PSA) and the CCG signature shown in Panel F (p-value 2×10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0141">Other genes were analyzed specifically for their ability to add prognostic power beyond CCP score and clinical variables. These genes are found in Tables R, S &amp; Y below and form Panels H &amp; I of the disclosure. Each of these genes can independently be used to diagnose a patient's prognosis for cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death according to the methods, systems, kits, etc. of the disclosure discussed herein. Or one or more of these genes can be added to a panel of the disclosure comprising CCP genes to form a larger panel with improved predictive power.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0142">Because KLK3 and the genes of Panel H or I are independent predictors of cancer recurrence and cancer-specific death, one aspect of the disclosure provides a method of predicting a patient's prognosis (e.g., likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence or cancer-specific death) comprising determining KLK3 status and/or the status of one or more genes in Panel H or I in a sample from the patient, wherein an abnormal status (e.g., decreased expression, increased expression) indicates the patient has a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death). In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating abnormal status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression) to a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death); (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death) based at least in part abnormal status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression); or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death) based at least in part on abnormal status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression). KLK3 status or the status of one or more genes in Panel H or I an be determined by applying and adapting techniques known in the art, including but not limited to those discussed herein.

In some embodiments, the method comprises at least one of the following steps: (a) correlating low or negative PTEN status, abnormal KLK3 status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status to a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death); (b) concluding that the patient has a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death) based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status, abnormal KLK3 status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status; or (c) communicating that the patient has a poor prognosis (e.g., high likelihood of recurrence or cancer-specific death) based at least in part on low or negative PTEN status, abnormal KLK3 status (e.g., decreased mRNA expression), an unfavorable (e.g., high) nomogram score and/or an elevated CCG status. Determining the status of one or more genes in Panel H or I can also be added to any of these analyses, with abnormal status (e.g., high expression) indicating poor prognosis.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a computer-implemented method [<b>700</b>] of the disclosure that may be implemented with the computer system [<b>600</b>] of the disclosure. The method [<b>700</b>] begins with one of three queries ([<b>710</b>], [<b>711</b>], [<b>712</b>]), either sequentially or substantially simultaneously. If the answer to/result for any of these queries is “Yes” [<b>720</b>], the method concludes [<b>730</b>] that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence. If the answer to/result for all of these queries is “No” [<b>721</b>], the method concludes [<b>731</b>] that the patient does not have an increased likelihood of recurrence. The method [<b>700</b>] may then proceed with more queries, make a particular treatment recommendation ([<b>740</b>], [<b>741</b>]), or simply end.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0168">When the queries are performed sequentially, they may be made in the order suggested by <figref>FIG. 7</figref> or in any other order. Whether subsequent queries are made can also be dependent on the results/answers for preceding queries. In some embodiments of the method illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, for example, the method asks about clinical parameters [<b>712</b>] first and, if the patient has one or more clinical parameters identifying the patient as at increased risk for recurrence then the method concludes such [<b>730</b>] or optionally confirms by querying CCG status, while if the patient has no such clinical parameters then the method proceeds to ask about CCG status [<b>711</b>]. Optionally, if CCG status is not elevated, then the method may continue to ask about PTEN status [<b>710</b>]. As mentioned above, the preceding order of queries may be modified. In some embodiments an answer of “yes” to one query (e.g., [<b>712</b>]) prompts one or more of the remaining queries to confirm that the patient has increased risk of recurrence.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0169">In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method of the disclosure [<b>700</b>] is open-ended. In other words, the apparent first step [<b>710</b>, <b>711</b>, and/or <b>712</b>] in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> may actually form part of a larger process and, within this larger process, need not be the first step/query. Additional steps may also be added onto the core methods discussed above. These additional steps include, but are not limited to, informing a health care professional (or the patient itself) of the conclusion reached; combining the conclusion reached by the illustrated method [<b>700</b>] with other facts or conclusions to reach some additional or refined conclusion regarding the patient's diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, etc.; making a recommendation for treatment (e.g., “patient should/should not undergo radical prostatectomy”); additional queries about additional biomarkers, clinical parameters, or other useful patient information (e.g., age at diagnosis, general patient health, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0170">Regarding the above computer-implemented method [<b>700</b>], the answers to the queries may be determined by the method instituting a search of patient data for the answer. For example, to answer the respective queries [<b>710</b>, <b>711</b>, <b>712</b>], patient data may be searched for PTEN status (e.g., PTEN IHC or mutation screening), CCG status (e.g., CCG expression level data), or clinical parameters (e.g., Gleason score, nomogram score, etc.). If such a comparison has not already been performed, the method may compare these data to some reference in order to determine if the patient has an abnormal (e.g., elevated, low, negative) status. Additionally or alternatively, the method may present one or more of the queries [<b>710</b>, <b>711</b>, <b>712</b>] to a user (e.g., a physician) of the computer system [<b>100</b>]. For example, the questions [<b>710</b>, <b>711</b>, <b>712</b>] may be presented via an output module [<b>624</b>]. The user may then answer “Yes” or “No” via an input module [<b>630</b>]. The method may then proceed based upon the answer received. Likewise, the conclusions [<b>730</b>, <b>731</b>] may be presented to a user of the computer-implemented method via an output module [<b>624</b>].</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0171">Thus in some embodiments the disclosure provides a method comprising: accessing information on a patient's CCG status, clinical parameters and/or PTEN status stored in a computer-readable medium; querying this information to determine at least one of whether a sample obtained from the patient shows increased expression of at least one CCG, whether the patient has a recurrence-associated clinical parameter, and/or whether the patient has a low/negative PTEN status; outputting [or displaying] the sample's CCG expression status, the patient's recurrence-associated clinical parameter status, and/or the sample's PTEN status. As used herein in the context of computer-implemented embodiments of the disclosure, “displaying” means communicating any information by any sensory manner. Examples include, but are not limited to, visual displays, e.g., on a computer screen or on a sheet of paper printed at the command of the computer, and auditory displays, e.g., computer generated or recorded auditory expression of a patient's genotype.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0172">As discussed at length above, recurrence-associated clinical parameters or PTEN status combined with elevated CCG status indicate a significantly increased likelihood of recurrence. Thus some embodiments provide a computer-implemented method of determining whether a patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence comprising accessing information on a patient's PTEN status (e.g., from a tumor sample obtained from the patient) or clinical parameters and CCG status (e.g., from a tumor sample obtained from the patient) stored in a computer-readable medium; querying this information to determine at least one of whether the patient has a low/negative PTEN status or whether the patient has a recurrence-associated clinical parameter; querying this information to determine whether a sample obtained from the patient shows increased expression of at least one CCG; outputting (or displaying) an indication that the patient has an increased likelihood of recurrence if the patient has a low/negative PTEN status or a recurrence-associated clinical parameter and the sample shows increased expression of at least one CCG. Some embodiments further comprise displaying PTEN, clinical parameters (or their values) and/or the CCGs and their status (including, e.g., expression levels), optionally together with an indication of whether the PTEN or CCG status and/or clinical parameter indicates increased likelihood of risk.</p>

      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0188">The sample analyzer can be any instrument useful in determining gene expression, including, e.g., a sequencing machine (e.g., Illumina HiSeg™, Ion Torrent PGM, ABI SOLiD™ sequencer, PacBio RS, Helicos Heliscope™, etc.), a real-time PCR machine (e.g., ABI 7900, Fluidigm BioMark™, etc.), a microarray instrument, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0189">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of treating a cancer patient comprising obtaining CCG status information (e.g., the CCGs in Table 1 or Panels A through G), and recommending, prescribing or administering a treatment for the cancer patient based on the CCG status. In some embodiments, the method further includes obtaining clinical parameter information, and/or obtaining PTEN status information from a sample from the patient and treating the patient with a particular treatment based on the CCG status, clinical parameter and/or PTEN status information. For example, the disclosure provides a method of treating a cancer patient comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0190">(1) determining the status of at least one CCG;</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0191">(2) determining the status of at least on clinical parameter;</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0192">(3) determining the status of PTEN in a sample obtained from the patient; and</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0193">(4) recommending, prescribing or administering either <ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00005-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) an active (including aggressive) treatment if the patient has at least one of increased expression of the CCG, recurrence-associated clinical parameter, or low/negative PTEN status, or</li><li>(b) a passive (or less aggressive) treatment if the patient has none of increased expression of the CCG, recurrence-associated clinical parameter, or low/negative PTEN status. <br /> In some embodiments, the determining steps comprise receiving a report communicating the relevant status (e.g., CCG status). In some embodiments this report communicates such status in a qualitative manner (e.g., “high” or “increased” expression). In some embodiments this report communicates such status indirectly by communicating a score (e.g., prognosis score, recurrence score, combined score as discussed above, etc.) that incorporates such status. </li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0196">Whether a treatment is aggressive or not will generally depend on the cancer-type, the age of the patient, etc. For example, in breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy is a common aggressive treatment given to complement the less aggressive standards of surgery and hormonal therapy. Those skilled in the art are familiar with various other aggressive and less aggressive treatments for each type of cancer. “Active treatment” in prostate cancer is well-understood by those skilled in the art and, as used herein, has the conventional meaning in the art. Generally speaking, active treatment in prostate cancer is anything other than “watchful waiting.” Active treatment currently applied in the art of prostate cancer treatment includes, e.g., prostatectomy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy (e.g., GnRH antagonists, GnRH agonists, antiandrogens), chemotherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound (“HIFU”), etc. Each treatment option carries with it certain risks as well as side-effects of varying severity, e.g., impotence, urinary incontinence, etc. Thus it is common for doctors, depending on the age and general health of the man diagnosed with prostate cancer, to recommend a regime of “watchful-waiting.”</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0197">“Watchful-waiting,” also called “active surveillance,” also has its conventional meaning in the art. This generally means observation and regular monitoring without invasive treatment. Watchful-waiting is sometimes used, e.g., when an early stage, slow-growing prostate cancer is found in an older man. Watchful-waiting may also be suggested when the risks of surgery, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy outweigh the possible benefits. Other treatments can be started if symptoms develop, or if there are signs that the cancer growth is accelerating (e.g., rapidly rising PSA, increase in Gleason score on repeat biopsy, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0198">Although men who choose watchful-waiting avoid the risks of surgery and radiation, watchful-waiting carries its own risks, e.g., increased risk of metastasis. For younger men, a trial of active surveillance may not mean avoiding treatment altogether, but may reasonably allow a delay of a few years or more, during which time the quality of life impact of active treatment can be avoided. Published data to date suggest that carefully selected men will not miss a window for cure with this approach. Additional health problems that develop with advancing age during the observation period can also make it harder to undergo surgery and radiation therapy. Thus it is clinically important to carefully determine which prostate cancer patients are good candidates for watchful-waiting and which patients should receive active treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0199">Thus, the disclosure provides a method of treating a prostate cancer patient or providing guidance to the treatment of a patient. In this method, the status of at least one CCG (e.g., those in Table 1 or Panels A through G), at least one recurrence-associated clinical parameter, and/or the status of PTEN is determined, and (a) active treatment is recommended, initiated or continued if a sample from the patient has an elevated status for at least one CCG, the patient has at least one recurrence-associated clinical parameter, and/or low/negative PTEN status, or (b) watchful-waiting is recommended/initiated/continued if the patient has neither an elevated status for at least one CCG, a recurrence-associated clinical parameter, nor low/negative PTEN status. In certain embodiments, CCG status, the clinical parameter(s) and PTEN status may indicate not just that active treatment is recommended, but that a particular active treatment is preferable for the patient (including relatively aggressive treatments such as, e.g., RP and/or adjuvant therapy).</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0200">In general, adjuvant therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, HIFU, hormonal therapy, etc. after prostatectomy or radiotherapy) is not the standard of care in prostate cancer. According to the present disclosure, however, physicians may be able to determine which prostate cancer patients have particularly aggressive disease and thus should receive adjuvant therapy. Thus in one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of treating a patient (e.g., a prostate cancer patient) comprising determining the status of at least one CCG (e.g., those in Table 1 or Panels A through G), the status of at least one recurrence-associated clinical parameter, and/or the status of PTEN and initiating adjuvant therapy after prostatectomy or radiotherapy if a sample from the patient has an elevated status for at least one CCG, the patient has at least one recurrence-associated clinical parameter and/or the patient has low/negative PTEN status.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0201">In one aspect, the disclosure provides compositions for use in the above methods. Such compositions include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid probes hybridizing to PTEN or a CCG (or to any nucleic acids encoded thereby or complementary thereto); nucleic acid primers and primer pairs suitable for amplifying all or a portion of PTEN or a CCG or any nucleic acids encoded thereby; antibodies binding immunologically to a polypeptide encoded by PTEN or a CCG; probe sets comprising a plurality of said nucleic acid probes, nucleic acid primers, antibodies, and/or polypeptides; microarrays comprising any of these; kits comprising any of these; etc. In some aspects, the disclosure provides computer methods, systems, software and/or modules for use in the above methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0202">In some embodiments the disclosure provides a probe comprising an isolated oligonucleotide capable of selectively hybridizing to PTEN or at least one of the genes in Table 1 or Panels A through G. The terms “probe” and “oligonucleotide” (also “oligo”), when used in the context of nucleic acids, interchangeably refer to a relatively short nucleic acid fragment or sequence. The disclosure also provides primers useful in the methods of the disclosure. “Primers” are probes capable, under the right conditions and with the right companion reagents, of selectively amplifying a target nucleic acid (e.g., a target gene). In the context of nucleic acids, “probe” is used herein to encompass “primer” since primers can generally also serve as probes.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0203">The probe can generally be of any suitable size/length. In some embodiments the probe has a length from about 8 to 200, 15 to 150, 15 to 100, 15 to 75, 15 to 60, or 20 to 55 bases in length. They can be labeled with detectable markers with any suitable detection marker including but not limited to, radioactive isotopes, fluorophores, biotin, enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase), enzyme substrates, ligands and antibodies, etc. See Jablonski et al., N<smallcaps>UCLEIC </smallcaps>A<smallcaps>CIDS </smallcaps>R<smallcaps>ES</smallcaps>.

Indeed, probes may be modified in any conventional manner for various molecular biological applications. Techniques for producing and using such oligonucleotide probes are conventional in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0204">Probes according to the disclosure can be used in the hybridization/amplification/detection techniques discussed above. Thus, some embodiments of the disclosure comprise probe sets suitable for use in a microarray in detecting, amplifying and/or quantitating PTEN and/or a plurality of CCGs. In some embodiments the probe sets have a certain proportion of their probes directed to CCGs—e.g., a probe set consisting of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% probes specific for CCGs.

Such probe sets can be incorporated into high-density arrays comprising 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, 600,000, 700,000, 800,000, 900,000, or 1,000,000 or more different probes. In other embodiments the probe sets comprise primers (e.g., primer pairs) for amplifying nucleic acids comprising at least a portion of PTEN or of one or more of the CCGs in Table 1 or Panels A through G.</p>

      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0210">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from blocks or slides of prostatic adenocarcinoma biopsies may be used. Blocks may include at least 2 mm of tumor on diagnostic H&amp;E slides for sample processing and RNA extraction. In cases where blocks are not available, one 3-5 μm H&amp;E slide followed by ten consecutive 10 μm unstained slides and a final H&amp;E slide may be acceptable. Sample barcodes, which are scanned and tracked, may be applied to each block (or slide). The H&amp;E slides from each case may be evaluated, e.g., by a pathologist, to determine the location and amount of tumor per slide. Using the H&amp;E stained slides as a guide, tumor tissue may be removed from ten unstained slides and total RNA may be extracted from the tissue. The expression of the genes in any of Panels A-F, normalized to that of housekeeping genes, may then be measured in triplicate to generate a test value (e.g., CCP score).</p>

      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0213">A clinically reportable CCP score range of −1.3 to 4.7 may be applied. A scale of CCP scores may be reported for the American Urological Association (AUA) risk category of the individual patient. The scale may consist of five 1-unit intervals, with the middle interval being centered at the median CCP score for that specific AUA risk category in the U.S. population. There may be approximately a 2-fold change in risk of prostate cancer mortality between intervals, which would be the hazard ratio corresponding to a 1-unit change in the CCP score.</p>

      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0221">Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from prostatectomy blocks of prostatic adenocarcinoma may be used. Blocks may include at least 5 mm of tumor on diagnostic H&amp;E slides for sample processing and RNA extraction. In cases where blocks are not available, one 3-5 μm H&amp;E slide followed by five consecutive 10 μm unstained slides and a final H&amp;E slide may be acceptable. Sample barcodes, which are scanned and tracked, may be applied to each block (or slide). The H&amp;E slides from each case may be evaluated, e.g., by a pathologist, to determine the location and amount of tumor per slide. Using the H&amp;E stained slides as a guide, tumor tissue may be removed from five unstained slides and total RNA may be extracted from the tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0222">The expression of the genes in any of Panels A-F, normalized to that of housekeeping genes, may then be measured in triplicate to generate a test value (e.g., CCP score). This CCP score can be used to estimate probability of recurrence (e.g., biochemical recurrence) within a given time period (e.g., within 10 years after surgery). A patient's CCP score can also be compared with the CCP scores of other patients within a U.S. distribution of scores previously observed. For a more accurate estimation of 10-year biochemical recurrence risk, clinical information provided by the healthcare provider may be used to calculate a nomogram score. The CCP score may then be combined with the nomogram score to generate a combined score. This combined score may be used to estimate the 10-year risk of biochemical recurrence, and it can be compared with the combined scores of other patients within a U.S. distribution of scores. In some embodiments, the combined score is only communicated to the healthcare provider if all required clinical information has been provided and, if all required clinical parameters are not provided on the test request form, only the Prolaris Score is reported. In some such embodiments, the combined score may be obtained by inputting the required clinical information subsequent to the reporting of the CCP score by entering clinical parameters required for the nomogram along with the patient's CCP score.</p>

      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0343">The mean of CCG expression is robust to measurement error and individual variation between genes. In order to determine the optimal number of cell cycle genes for the signature, the predictive power of the mean was tested for randomly selected sets of from 1 to 30 of the CCGs listed above. This simulation showed that there is a threshold number of CCGs in a panel that provides significantly improved predictive power.</p>

This signature was further evaluated to determine whether it added to an established clinical nomogram for prostate cancer recurrence (the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram). In summary, the nomogram was a highly significant predictor of recurrence (p-value 1.6×10<sup>−10</sup>) and, after adjusting for the nomogram, the CCG signature was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (p-value 4.8×10<sup>−5</sup>, Table C).</p>

      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0350">The CCG expression signature (Table 7, supra) was predictive of disease recurrence in a univariate analysis (p-value=1.8×10<sup>−9</sup>, Table C). The distribution of the signature score was skewed toward higher values (lower expression). The median value of signature score was used to divide the training cohort into two groups containing samples with either high or low CCG expression. The survival versus time for both groups is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0351">Predictive power of the CCG signature after accounting for clinical variables typically included in a post-surgical nomogram (the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) was also evaluated. The nomogram was a highly significant predictor of recurrence (p-value 1.6×10<sup>−10</sup>). After adjusting for the nomogram, the CCG signature was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) in the discovery cohort (p-value 0.03) and in the clinical validation cohort (p-value 4.8×10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>

      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0352">To help understand the interaction between the nomogram and the CCG expression signature, a scatter plot comparing these predictors (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) was generated (light gray stars represent patients whose cancer recurred while black stars represent patients whose cancer did not). Analysis of the scatter plot by KM means divided the samples into three clusters based on nomogram score only. Subsequently, it was discovered that the clusters were based on well-understood clinical parameters. The patients in the lowest scoring cluster (116/117) had organ-confined disease. Patients in the middle scoring cluster (48/60) had at least one post-surgical parameter known to be associated with poor outcome (i.e., disease through the capsule, disease positive lymph nodes, and/or disease positive seminal vesicles) and low pre-surgical PSA (&lt;10 ng/ml). Patients in the highest scoring cluster had at least one unfavorable post-surgical parameter and high pre-surgery PSA. Next, the patients in the low and medium scoring clusters were divided by the mean of the CCG score. Outcomes for patients in the highest scoring cluster are adequately predicted by the nomogram and, therefore, were not divided further. As a result, the scatter plot defines five patient groups with disease recurrence rates of 2%, 40% (for two groups), 65%, and 80% (Table D). The recurrence rate of all five groups versus time is shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0353">The scatter plot shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> suggests that there is a non-linear interaction between the CCG signature and the post-surgical nomogram. That is, the CCG signature is a better predictor in patients with low nomogram scores. Therefore, the study tested for statistical evidence of an interaction between these variables in a multivariate model for predicting disease recurrence (Table E). There was significant evidence for a favorable interaction in both training and validation studies. Including the interaction term in the model dramatically improved the prognostic significance of the CCG signature after adjusting for the nomogram (p-values of 0.0015 in training and 1.2×10<sup>−8 </sup>in validation cohort).</p>

      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0354">The following study aimed at determining the optimal number of CCGs to include in the signature. As mentioned above, CCG expression levels are correlated to each other so it was possible that measuring a small number of genes would be sufficient to predict disease outcome. In fact, single CCGs from the 31-gene set in Table 7 (Panel C) add significantly to the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram, as shown in Table F below (after adjustment for the nomogram and an interaction term between the nomogram and CCG expression):</p>

Time to chemical recurrence after prostate surgery was regressed on the CCG mean adjusted by the post-RP nomogram score. Data consist of TLDA assays expressed as deltaCT for 199 FFPE prostate tumor samples and 26 CCGs and were analyzed by a CoxPH multivariate model.

      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0356">The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the association between PTEN mutations and biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer patients after radical prostatectomy. Somatic mutations in PTEN were found to be significantly associated with recurrence, and importantly, it added prognostic information beyond both the established clinical nomogram for prostate cancer recurrence (the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) and the CCG signature score (described in Examples 1 &amp; 2, supra).</p>
      <heading id="h-00089-en" level="2">Patients and Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0357">Eight hundred four consecutive RP patients were followed for a median of 9.5 years. The patient characteristics and the treatment outcomes of the entire cohort have been previously reported (Swanson et al., U<smallcaps>ROL</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL</smallcaps>. (2007) 25:110-114). Tissue blocks and/or slides from the final pathological evaluation with enough tissue for analysis were available for 430 patients. Of these, 191 were selected for PTEN mutation screening based on the amount of available tumor.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0358">Genomic DNA was isolated from the FFPE tumor samples for mutation screening of PTEN using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) according to the kit protocol. The FFPE slides were first stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by a pathologist to identify the tumor region. After deparaffinization, tumor tissue was cut out from the slides by a razor blade. For a few samples dissection was aided by laser capture microscopy (LCM), owing to the dispersion of the tumor cells</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0359">Mutations were detected by designing sequencing primers to interrogate the PTEN genomic sequence. The primers contained M13 forward and reverse tails to facilitate sequencing. After amplification, DNA sequence was determined on a Mega BASE 4500 (GE healthcare) using dye-primer chemistry as described in Frank et al., J. C<smallcaps>LIN</smallcaps>. O<smallcaps>NCOL</smallcaps>. (2002) 20:1480-1490. Due to the technical difficulties associated with sequencing DNA derived from FFPE material, each mutation was detected by at least two independent amplification and sequencing reactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0360">Statistical Methods:</p>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0361">Unless otherwise specified, the association between biochemical recurrence and PTEN mutations was evaluated using Cox PH models for time to recurrence. The resultant p-values were derived from a likelihood ratio test comparing the null model to the model containing the test variable. In this example (Example 4), the CCG signature was derived from 26 CCGs (Panel D in Table 2, supra). All of the expression data were generated in triplicate. The expression data were combined into a signature by calculating the mean expression level for 26 CCGs. The clinical data were the variables included in the Kattan-Stephenson nomogram.</p>
      <heading id="h-00090-en" level="2">Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00345-en" num="0362">PTEN mutations were found in 13 individuals (13/191). In this subset of 191 patients, PTEN was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence (p-value=0.031). The recurrence rate in mutation carriers was 69% (9/13) compared to 36% (64/178) in non-mutant patients. The difference in recurrence rate is also significant using a Fisher's exact test (p-value=0.034). In the subset of patients with clinical parameter data, CCG signature score, and PTEN mutations, PTEN status was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence after adjusting for both clinical parameters and CCG signature (p-value 0.024). Finally, the combination of PTEN mutation with CCG signature was a better predictor of outcome after adjusting for clinical parameters than using the CCG signature after adjusting for clinical parameters (p-value=0.0002 for the combination compared to 0.0028 for CCG only). These results show that PTEN mutations provide information about the likelihood of recurrence that is uncorrelated with either clinical parameters or CCG signature, and that using all three parameters to evaluate recurrence risk provides a more accurate estimate of recurrence probability than previously possible.</p>

      <heading id="h-00092-en" level="2">Patients and Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0364">Eight hundred four consecutive radical prostatectomy patients were followed for a median of 9.5 years. The median age was 67 years. The clinical stage was T1 34%, T2 66% and T3&lt;1%. The median preoperative PSA was 6.6 ng/ml with 72%&lt;10 ng/ml and 28%&gt;10 ng/ml. The specimens were inked and clinical parameters were recorded as to positive bladder neck or urethral margin, invasion into the capsule, extension through the capsule, positive margins and the involvement of the seminal vesicles. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a PSA&gt;0.3 ng/ml. For this study we had access to clinical data on 690 patients. Tissue blocks and/or slides from the final pathological evaluation with enough tissue for analysis were available for 442 patients. The cohort was divided into 195 patients for a training cohort, and 247 patients for validation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00093-en" level="2">Selection of Genes</heading>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0365">Assays of 126 CCGs and 47 HK (housekeeping) genes were run against 96 commercially obtained, anonymous prostate tumor FFPE samples without outcome or other clinical data. The working hypothesis was that the assays would measure with varying degrees of accuracy the same underlying phenomenon (cell cycle proliferation within the tumor for the CCGs, and sample concentration for the HK genes). Assays were ranked by the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the individual gene and the mean of all the candidate genes, that being the best available estimate of biological activity. Results for the correlation of each of the 126 CCGs to the mean are reported in Table 23. Not including CCGs with low average expression, or assays that produced sample failures, approximately half the CCGs had correlations less than 0.58, and a quarter of the HK genes had correlations less than 0.95. These assays were eliminated, leaving a subset of 56 CCGs (Panel G) and 36 HK candidate genes (Tables 11 and 12). Correlation coefficients were recalculated on this subset, and the final selection was made from the ranked list.</p>
      <heading id="h-00094-en" level="2">Gene Expression</heading>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0366">Total RNA was extracted from representative 5 μM thick FFPE tumor sections. The samples were de-paraffinized using a xylene bath and subsequently hydrated in graded series of ethanol baths. Afterward, the tumor region was dissected from the slide using a razor blade according to the pathologist instructions. Alternatively, the tumor region was dissected directly into an eppendorf tube and the paraffin was removed using xylene and washed with ethanol. After, samples were treated overnight with proteinase K digestion at 55° C. Total RNA was extracted using either RNeasy FFPE or miRNeasy (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer (with the only exception being the extended proteinase K digestion described above). Isolated total RNA was treated with DNase I (Sigma) prior to cDNA synthesis. Subsequently, we employed the High-capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems) to convert total RNA into single strand cDNA as described by the manufacturer. A minimum of 200 ng RNA was required for the RT reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0367">Prior to measuring expression levels, the cDNA was pre-amplified with a pooled reaction containing TaqMan™ assays. Pre-amplification reaction conditions were: 14 cycles of 95° C. for 15 sec and 60° C. for 4 minutes. The first cycle was modified to include a 10 minute incubation at 95° C. The amplification reaction was diluted 1:20 using the 1×TE buffer prior to loading on TaqMan™ Low Density Arrays (TLDA, Applied Biosystems) to measure gene expression.</p>
      <heading id="h-00095-en" level="2">CCG Score</heading>
      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0368">The CCG score is calculated from RNA expression of 31 CCGs (Panel F) normalized by 15 housekeeper genes (HK). The relative numbers of CCGs (31) and HK genes (15) were optimized in order to minimize the variance of the CCG score. The CCG score is the unweighted mean of CT values for CCG expression, normalized by the unweighted mean of the HK genes so that higher values indicate higher expression. One unit is equivalent to a two-fold change in expression. Missing values were imputed using the mean expression for each gene determined in the training set using only good quality samples. The CCG scores were centered by the mean value, again determined in the training set.</p>
      <p id="p-00352-en" num="0369">A dilution experiment was performed on four of the commercial prostate samples to estimate the measurement error of the CCG score (se=0.10) and the effect of missing values. It was found that the CCG score remained stable as concentration decreased to the point of 5 failures out of the total 31 CCGs. Based on this result, samples with more than 4 missing values were not assigned a CCG score.</p>
      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0370">The CCG score threshold for determining low-risk was based on the lowest CCG score of recurrences in the training set. The threshold was then adjusted downward by 1 standard deviation in order to optimize the negative predictive value of the test.</p>
      <heading id="h-00096-en" level="2">Model of Clinical Risk</heading>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0371">A Cox proportional hazards model was used to summarize the available clinical parameter data and estimate the prior clinical risk of biochemical recurrence for each patient. The data set consisted of 195 cases from the training set and 248 other cases with clinical parameter information but insufficient sample to measure RNA expression. Univariate tests were performed on clinical parameters known to be associated with outcome (see Table H below). Non-significant parameters were excluded from the model. A composite variable was created for organ-confined disease, with invasion defined as surgical margins, extracapsular extension, or involvement of any of seminal vesicles, bladder neck/urethral margins, or lymph nodes. The composite variable for organ-confined disease proved more significant in the model than any of its five components, some of which were inter-correlated or not prevalent. Model fitting was performed using the AIC criteria for post-operative covariates.</p>

This model includes all of the clinical parameters incorporated in the post-RP nomogram (i.e., Kattan-Stephenson nomogram) except for Year of RP and the two components of the Gleason score. The distribution of prior clinical risk shows three distinct nodes (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). K-means clustering with 3 centers was used to set the threshold for the low-risk cluster, which comprises approximately 50% of the sample.</p>

      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0373">Clinical parameters were compared between the training and validation sets using the Student's t-test for continuous parameters and Fisher's exact test for categorical parameters. The prior clinical risk of patients for biochemical recurrence after surgery was estimated by a post-RP nomogram score summarizing 7 covariates. K-means clustering of the nomogram score was used to categorize patients as low or high prior clinical risk. Expression data were expressed as the CT (the PCR cycle at which the fluorescence intensity exceeds a predetermined threshold) of each CCG normalized by the mean of the 15 housekeeper genes (Table 12 above).</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0374">Poor quality samples were excluded from analysis to eliminate poor quality samples or dubious readings without compromising the integrity of the signature by inadvertently excluding samples with low CCG expression. Accordingly, the thresholds for cleaning or filtering the data were set conservatively. Mean expression levels of the HK genes for each sample, which were higher than those of the CCGs, were used to identify poor quality samples. Technical metrics for the amplification efficiency and excessively high standard deviations of replicates were used to identify unreliable CT measurements. No failures of HK genes, and no more than 1 failure out of 3 replicates for CCGs, were allowed.</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0375">The association between biochemical recurrence and CCG expression after adjusting for clinical risk predicted by clinical parameters was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-recurrence. The proportional hazards assumption of no time-dependence was tested for the full model of the CCG signature plus the binary clinical parameter score with an interaction term, and for the CCG signature only in the clinical risk subsets. It was not significant in either training or validation, indicating that there is no evidence for time-dependence. All of the p-values reported are from a likelihood ratio test comparing the reduced or null model to the model containing the test variable. Kaplan-Meier plots are used to show estimated survival probabilities for subsets of patients; however, p-values are from the Cox likelihood ratio test for the continuous values of the variable. All statistical analyses were performed in S+Version 8.1.1 for Linux (TIBCO Spotfire) or R 2.9.0 (http://www.r-project.org).</p>

      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0376">We isolated RNA from FFPE tumor sections derived from 442 prostate cancer patients treated with RP. The cohort was split into 195 patients for initial characterization of the signature (“training set”) and 247 patients for validation. The clinical parameters of the training and validation cohort are listed in Table J. There were no significant differences after adjusting for multiple comparisons.</p>

      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0377">To analyze the CCG signature for this study, we tested 126 CCGs on RNA derived from 96 prostate tumors (Table 11). The tumor samples were anonymous and not associated with clinical data. From this set of genes, we selected 31 genes (Panel F) for inclusion in our signature (Table K). The genes were selected based on their technical performance, and by how well each gene correlated with the mean expression level of the entire CCG set, in the 96 anonymous samples.</p>

      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0378">To evaluate the prognostic utility of the CCG signature, we generated expression data on 195 patients in the training set. Since the individual gene expression levels were correlated, we combined them into a signature score by calculating the mean expression for the entire set of 31 genes (Panel F), normalized by 15 housekeepers (Table 12). The CCG score distribution was centered at zero, and each score unit corresponds to a 2-fold change in expression level. Poor quality samples were identified by observing either low expression of housekeeping genes or an unacceptable number of CCG failures, and excluded from the analysis. After applying our exclusion rules, there were 140 samples available for analysis. Association between biochemical recurrence and CCG expression was evaluated using Cox PH models for time to recurrence. A high CCG expression value was predictive of disease recurrence in a univariate analysis (p-value=0.01, Table 17).</p>
      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0379">Next, we evaluated the prognostic utility of the CCG signature after accounting for clinical parameters known to be associated with recurrence after RP. To account for clinical measures in our analysis, we created a model/nomogram that included preoperative PSA, Gleason score, and evidence of disease outside the prostate (i.e., any of either extracapsular extension, or positive post-surgical pathology on lymph nodes, margins, bladder neck, urethral margin or seminal vesicles). The model was optimized in 443 patients (Tables 13 &amp; 14), including all patients for whom we had clinical data but were not in the validation set, and was a highly significant predictor of recurrence in the training cohort (p-value=2.5×10<sup>−11</sup>). The distribution of the scores from the clinical model contained several modes (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>), separating high- and low-risk patient groups. Therefore, the score was used subsequently as a binary variable (high or low risk). The low-risk cluster correlated with a consistent set of clinical parameters. Specifically, the vast majority (215/218) had organ-confined disease and Gleason score&lt;7. In addition, 80% had low pre-surgical PSA (&lt;10 ng/ml). Patients in the high-risk cluster (N=225) were more heterogeneous, but tended to have clinical characteristics known to be associated with poor outcome (e.g., Gleason&gt;6 and/or disease through the capsule).</p>
      <p id="p-00367-en" num="0380">Multivariate analysis of the training set incorporating our binary clinical model, showed evidence for a non-linear interaction between the expression signature and clinical parameters (Table L). To help us understand the nature of this interaction, we generated a scatter plot comparing these predictors (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). As evident from the figure, the CCG score proved useful for evaluating recurrence risk in patients defined as low risk by clinical parameters. In fact, even after adjusting for the clinical model within the low risk patients, the CCG signature was a strong predictor of biochemical recurrence (p-value=0.0071).</p>

      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0381">We used our training data in the scatter plot to establish an optimized threshold score of −0.16 for the CCG signature (the mean CCG score is zero). <figref>FIG. 12</figref> shows this threshold applied to the 443 patients studied in this example. Forty percent of low-risk patients fall below this threshold, and it was selected so that there were no recurrences 10-years after RP (i.e., negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%). As a result of establishing threshold values for both the clinical model and CCG score, the scatter plot was divided into four sections with recurrence rates of 0% (low CCG) and 26% (high CCG) for low-risk patients; and 60% (low CCG) and 50% for high-risk patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0382">Next, we generated CCG expression data on 247 patients in our validation cohort. Thirty-two samples were eliminated from further analysis according to the exclusion rules developed on the training cohort. Panel F was a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in a univariate analysis (p-value=5.8×10<sup>−8</sup>, Table L). After adjusting for the binary clinical model, the CCG signature was highly predictive of recurrence in the validation cohort (p-value 8.3×10<sup>−7</sup>), and as in the training set, there was significant evidence for a non-linear interaction between variables. The CCG signature was informative across the entire spectrum of clinically defined risk (Table 17). In terms of validating the training results, the p-value for association between recurrence and CCG signature in low-risk patients was 1.9×10<sup>−4</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0383">We applied the CCG threshold derived from our analysis of the training cohort to our validation data set (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). Low risk patients with CCG scores below the threshold had a 10-year predicted recurrence rate of 5% (equivalent to validated NPV of 0.95). Overall, the combination of CCG score and clinical parameters divided the cohort into four groups with 10 year predicted recurrence rates of 5%, 22%, 36% and 70% (Table M). The predicted recurrence rate versus CCG score for patients in the validation cohort is shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 &amp; 11</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00375-en" num="0385">We have developed and validated a prognostic molecular signature for prostate cancer. The signature is based on measuring mRNA expression levels of cell cycle genes (CCGs). By definition, expression of CCGs is regulated as a function of cell cycle stage. That is, they are turned on at specific cell cycle stages, so that actively growing cells have higher expression levels of CCG than quiescent cells. Presumably this fact underlies the signature's ability to predict cancer progression. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that by measuring the expression levels of CCG we are indirectly measuring the growth rate and inherent aggressiveness of the tumor, which ultimately impacts on the likelihood of prostate cancer recurrence after prostatectomy.</p>
      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0386">There is an important distinction between this study and many others that have attempted to generate prognostic molecular signatures. Often, similar studies begin with a very large number of candidate biomarkers (sometimes exceeding 1000's of genes) that are then evaluated for association with a clinical phenotype of interest. This approach may at times suffer from inherent multiple testing which can make the significance of the derived signature uncertain. Here we have tested a single hypothesis: CCG would be prognostic in prostate cancer (in fact we selected genes based on their correlation with CCG expression, not based on association with recurrence). And since CCG expression is correlated, we combined the expression data into a predictive signature by determining the mean expression value of all the genes in the signature. The simplicity of this approach, biologically and computationally, supports the view that the central claim of this study is likely to be highly robust, and replicated in subsequent studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0387">The CCG signature (Panel F) is independently predictive and adds significantly to the predictive power of the clinical parameters typically employed to predict disease recurrence after surgery. This is true in both our training and validation cohorts.</p>
      <p id="p-00378-en" num="0388">The signature is immediately useful for defining the risk of patients who present with low-risk clinical parameters. Here, we essentially defined low-risk as Gleason&lt;7, PSA&lt;10 and organ-confined disease. The CCG signature score effectively subdivides the low-risk group into patients with very low recurrence rates (5%), and a higher risk of recurrence (22%) (<figref>FIG. 9</figref> &amp; Table M). This is the most dramatic effect of the molecular signature—accurately redefining the risk of patients previously defined as low-risk based on clinical parameters. It is noteworthy that within this patient subpopulation (i.e., patients defined as low-risk based on clinical parameters) clinical parameters are not particularly prognostic (see Table L). Therefore as a diagnostic test, the signature could be useful for a large number of patients. In this study, nearly 60% of the cohort was characterized as low-risk and 40% of those are expected to have low CCG scores. Therefore, the CCG signature can predict indolent disease in a quarter of the patients who have previously been identified as high-risk (and therefore identified as candidates for radical prostatectomy). Finally, the validation data in particular suggests that the CCG signature may be useful for defining risk in all patients. Specifically, it helped to divide patients defined as high-risk according to clinical parameters into those with 30% and 70% recurrence rates (Table M).</p>
      <p id="p-00379-en" num="0389">The combination of clinical parameters and CCG signature enables physicians to more accurately predict risk of surgical failure, and therefore, identify the appropriate course of therapeutic intervention. As we have shown, the signature dramatically improves the recurrence prediction for patients who present with general clinical parameters of non-aggressive disease (Table N). Within this clinical subgroup, patients with low CCG scores would benefit from the absolute reassurance that no further treatment is indicated. Conversely, the high CCG group may warrant immediate intervention. Patients with unfavorable post-surgical clinical parameters benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy. Therefore the CCG signature should predict the efficacy of adjuvant radiation for patients with low-risk clinical characteristics and high CCG scores. In the validation cohort, patients with high CCG scores and disease beyond the prostate have a recurrence rate of 70%, which should clearly identify patients who are good candidates for adjuvant radiation. Thus the combination of clinical parameters and CCG signature clearly leads to more accurately defined patient risk, which should enable a more intelligent assessment of the need for further treatment.</p>

      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0392">Expression data for each of the genes in Panels C, D and F was gathered from these datasets and the mean expression level for each Panel was determined for each patient, whose clinical outcome was known (e.g., recurrence, progression, progression-free survival, overall survival, etc.). CCG score is an average expression of the genes in a panel. If a gene is represented by more than one probe set on the array, the gene expression is an average expression of all the probe sets representing the gene. The association between CCG score and survival or disease recurrence was tested using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Multivariate analysis was performed when relevant clinical parameters (grade in brain cancer, stage in lung cancer, NPI in breast cancer) were available.</p>

      <p id="p-00389-en" num="0396">We selected 25 cases with the lowest combined scores and 31 controls with the highest combined scores for expression analysis of the transcriptome using Illumina™ Hi-Seq 2000™. RNA isolation and library construction were done according to the manufacture's protocol.</p>

      <p id="p-00390-en" num="0397">RNA expression is measured for all transcript products (TP). Raw counts were normalized by the 75<sup>th </sup>percentile of all TP's for each sample and run, then converted to the base 2 logarithm. Multiple TP's for the same gene locus are combined into a unified gene (UG).</p>
      <p id="p-00391-en" num="0398">RNA expression data for each sample were compiled from the TP's for the set of loci with single TP's, and UG's from the set of loci with multiple TP's. In order to be able to include transcripts with zero counts, we used the base 2 logarithm of the normalized counts+1 for the analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0399">The primary analysis was designed to find associations between RNA expression and case-control status. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were performed at each locus, and the results were ranked by p-value. In addition, each of the candidate genes was tested in a logistic regression model including CCP score, serum PSA, and Gleason.</p>

      <p id="p-00393-en" num="0400">Based on the analysis of the whole transcriptome, we identified six candidate genes (Table R) as being associated with prostate cancer death after adjustment for CCP score and clinical parameters. All of these genes had a p-value of less than 0.001 in the multivariate model. The distribution of observed p-values compared to the expected (given no association) is given in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>. Some p-values were more significantly associated with prostate cancer death than expected by chance.</p>

Patients who could be assigned to an AUA risk category but who did not have a CAPRA score were also excluded from any analysis. Time-to-event data were censored at 10 years in all cohorts. Inception was date of diagnosis for patients with TURP and needle biopsy samples, and date of surgery for patients with surgical tumor samples. Times were recorded as days for all studies except P1, P5A &amp; P5B, which were in months, and converted to days by a factor of 365.25/12. For patients whose clinical stage did not include the substage, the following conversions were made: T1 to T1A, T2 to T2A, and T3 to T3A.</p>

Each patient's risk category was determined according to guidelines interpreted below (AUA Guidelines 2007, page 10).

The scores (0 to 10) were calculated according to a point system, interpreted below (see Cooperberg et al. at Table 1). Patients with clinical stage T3B or higher were assigned a score although technically the scoring system did not apply. Patients with PSA≦2 ng/mL were included in the lowest interval, which is (2, 6] in Cooperberg et al. Clinical stage and Gleason grades were used instead of pathological data in the post-prostatectomy cohorts, although the CCP score was from a sample of the surgical tumor instead of a biopsy.</p>

      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0412">The Combined score was fit in the training set by a Cox Proportional Hazards model stratified by cohort. Cohort stratification adjusted for the differences in survival profiles that might be produced by various treatment regimens and endpoints in each cohort. CAPRA was treated as an integer-valued variable (0-10), and CCP score as a continuous numeric variable. To assure that CAPRA was an approximately linear predictor, we tested the quadratic term. It was significant (X<sup>2</sup>=8; p-value=0.0041), but minor in comparison to the linear term (X<sup>2</sup>=53, p-value&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>).</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0413">Interactions with cohort were tested in a preliminary model to confirm that the prognostication of CAPRA and CCP score was not dependent on cohort. The interaction had a p-value of 0.059 with CAPRA; and a p-value of 0.050 with CCP score, and was not included in the final model (Table V).</p>

      <heading id="h-00112-en" level="2">Predicting Mortality Risk</heading>
      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0416">The predicted risk of prostate cancer death within 10 years of diagnosis was estimated in the P2 validation cohort. Times were censored at 10 years (120 months) and the predicted risk was estimated at the time of the last event (118.1109 months). The range of CCP scores in the validation set (n=180) was −0.8 to 4.1. Sample mortality risks are shown in paragraphs [00186] and [00197] above.</p>
      <heading id="h-00113-en" level="2">Restratifying AUA Risk Based on CCP Score or Combined Score</heading>
      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0417">The percentile corresponding to each 0.1 increment of the CCP score was determined for the US clinical samples from each cohort within each AUA risk category. Individuals with clinical stages of T3 were excluded, leaving 1219 (97%) of the available 1262. The percentile for each patient was the fraction of patients within that AUA risk category who had a lower CCP score. Where multiple patients shared the same CCP score, rounded to a tenth, the percentile would be the same; namely, the fraction of patients with CCP scores lower than the rounded score.</p>
      <p id="p-00416-en" num="0418">The median CCP score of the US clinical samples from each cohort within each AUA risk category was used to assess cancer aggressiveness, as described in the following section. We compared the CCP score of each individual to the average CCP score of patients in the same AUA risk category in order to offer a relative assessment of cancer aggressiveness and in order to modify or confirm the risk prediction given using AUA guidelines.</p>
      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0419">The scale of CCP scores for each AUA risk category consisted of five 1-unit intervals, with the middle interval being centered at the median CCP score for that category in our sample cohort. There was approximately a 2-fold change in risk between intervals, which was the hazard ratio corresponding to a 1-unit change in the CCP score. We have given each section a qualitative label (Table X).</p>

      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0421">The patients whose samples were used in this experiment were incidentally diagnosed with prostate cancer after undergoing TURP and managed conservatively. The cohort has been described previously (in the Examples above and in Cuzick et al., <i>Long</i>-<i>term outcome among men with conservatively treated localised prostate cancer</i>, B<smallcaps>R</smallcaps>. J. C<smallcaps>ANCER </smallcaps>(2006) 95:1186-1194). A portion of this cohort (but not including any of the men this experiment) was previously used for evaluating the clinical utility of the CCP score as discussed in the Examples above. Patients unique to this experiment, and not part of any previous evaluation of CCP score or KLK3) are referred to herein as TURP1B. Patients were excluded from the present analysis if their clinical records were missing information about PSA levels, Gleason score, or extent of disease. Clinical and molecular data were obtained for 303 individuals with 66 prostate cancer specific deaths for analyses with the CCP score, and 291 individuals for with 61 prostate cancer specific deaths for our analyses with KLK3. Patient data was censored at 10 years.</p>

      <p id="p-00421-en" num="0422">Association between expression levels and prostate cancer-specific mortality were tested using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Multivariate analysis was performed using relevant clinical parameters indicated below.

      <p id="p-00425-en" num="0429">The prognostic utility of adding KLK3 to CCP score was also validated. In these analyses we used the negative of KLK3 expression, so that higher values would correspond to increased risk, as they do for CCP. This is because, for KLK3, lower expression predicts higher risk of recurrence or prostate cancer-specific mortality. The univariate and multivariate summary statistics are below:</p>
      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0430">Univariate: KLK3 p-value&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>; HR=1.8 (95% CI 1.5, 2.2)</p>
