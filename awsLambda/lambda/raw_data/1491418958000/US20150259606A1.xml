      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of producing liquid hydrocarbons from carbonaceous materials. In particular, it relates to an improved process and apparatus for doing so in an efficient, economical and environmentally sustainable way.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The world is facing fluctuations in crude oil prices as well as challenges to energy security, economic stability and growth. Further environmental concerns related to climate change due to the âgreenhouse effectâ is coming more and more in focus. Furthermore a number of conventional energy sources such as oil are being depleted. This calls for a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, including non-conventional and alternative resources.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hence, there is a large and increasing global interest in new technologies for the production of liquid hydrocarbons from low value abundant resources such as lignite, peat, biomass, residues and waste. A general characteristic of such low value resources is that they typically have high moisture content, an oxygen content on a dry ash free basis in the range 20-60%, and an ash content ranging from a few percent to more than 50% by weight, which results in a low heating value as received.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Technologies for production nonconventional liquid hydrocarbons are known e.g. production of liquid hydrocarbons from coal has been known for more than 150 years. Pyrolysis or high temperature carbonization is another well known route for production of liquid hydrocarbons from solid fuel. Depending on the specific process the input stream may be heated to a temperature in the range 450 to 1000Â° C. in the absence of oxygen, driving of the volatile compounds and leaving a coke product. The hydrocarbon yields can be wide varying and ranges from 10 to 75% depending on the volatile content of the specific input streams and process conditions. In general fast heating (fast pyrolysis) and short residence time provides the highest yields. However, pyrolysis is limited to dry input streams e.g. moisture contents up to approximately 10% by weight. Further as only very limited conversion of the liquid hydrocarbon produced occurs during processing, the liquid hydrocarbons produced have a high oxygen and water content, and the liquid hydrocarbons produced consequently have a low heating value. Further, the liquid hydrocarbons are not mixable with petrodiesel and petrocrude, and are corrosive and susceptible to polymerization which makes long term storage difficult. This limits the direct use of such pyrolytic hydrocarbon liquids. Upgrading of pyrolytic hydrocarbons may be performed by hydrodeoxygenation or by addition of hydrogen during the pyrolysis process. However, though such hydrogenation processes are technically feasible, they will add significantly to the production costs as no oxygen is removed by the pyrolysis, and production of hydrogen is relatively expensive.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The production of liquid hydrocarbons from feedstock other than coal is also being conducted by the pyrolysis, as well as by indirect and direct liquefaction techniques described above. However, common for them are that they all require relatively dry input streams. A fundamental issue is difference in the stoichiometry of the input stream and liquid hydrocarbon fuels. For example dry wood may be represented by the formula CH<sub>1,4</sub>O<sub>0,7</sub>, whereas liquid hydrocarbon fuels may be represented by the formula CH<sub>2</sub>:</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]CH<sub>1,4</sub>O<sub>0,7</sub>CH<sub>2 </sub>[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">This fundamentals result in an indispensable need for hydrogen addition and/or removal of carbon during the processing for adaptation of the H/C ratio and removal of oxygen. Removal of carbon as char and CO<sub>2 </sub>reduces the maximum obtainable yields of the desired hydrocarbons, whereas production of hydrogen is relatively expensive and adds significantly to the complexity and reduces the efficiency of such processes. Hence to be viable such processes require a very large scale and thereby become very capital intensive (UK DTI, Coal Liquefaction, Cleaner Coal Programme, Technology Status Report 010, October 1999).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">Hence, there is a large interest in developing improved production techniques for liquid hydrocarbons not suffering from the drawbacks described above. Conversion of the feedstock in pressurized water at elevated temperatures is a route which has attracted significant attention over recent decades. Such techniques are generally called hydrothermal processing, and generally convert the feedstock into a liquid hydrocarbon product, a char product, a water phase comprising water soluble organics, a gas and a mineral product.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">An advantage of hydrothermal processing is that water is kept under pressure so that it is maintained in its liquid and/or supercritical state which means that no phase transition into steam occurs during processing. Hence, the energy loss, in the form of latent heat of evaporation, need not be supplied, and thus energy consuming processes such as evaporation or distillation are eliminated. This renders such processes very energy efficient particularly for wet input streams.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">Water, in the vicinity of its critical point (374Â° C., 221 bar) obtains physical properties which are very different from water at ambient conditions e.g. the dissociation product of water is more than three orders of magnitude higher, it changes its polarity from a polar solvent to a non-polar solvent, interphase mass and heat transfer resistances are significantly reduced and mass- and heat transfer rates are therefore enhanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0010">Due to these properties of water in the vicinity of its critical point, water may serve both as a reaction medium, a catalyst for acid and base catalyzed reactions and as a reactant and source of hydrogen in the conversion process.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0011">Hence hydrothermal processing holds the potential to reduce the oxygen content of wet oxygenated feedstock with lower parasitic energy losses and with less hydrogen required due to formation of hydrogen in situ.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">Deoxygenation goes through dehydration, decarboxylation and hydrogenation reactions. However, the reaction pathways are complex and are to a large extent unknown except for simple molecules. Carbonaceous macromolecules may undergo various reactions including hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, steam reforming, water gas shift, steam cracking, Bouduard reaction, hydrogenation, methanation, Fischer-Tropsch, aldol condensation, esterification, methanol synthesis etc. The rate of the individual reactions and the extent to which conversion proceeds via specific reaction pathways depends on a number of factors.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">Processes differ in the specific operating conditions and process design and layout being applied e.g. the feedstock, the dry solid content in the feed, the ash content of the feed, the operating pressure and temperature, the pH, the catalysts and other additives present in different parts of the process, the residence time in the different parts of the process, the heat integration, the separation techniques applied including further product handling and upgrading etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">Despite that hydrothermal technologies have many potential benefits over conventional methods of processing biomass and other organic macromolecules to useful fuels and chemicals, the fact remains that these technologies have yet not been being widely commercialized (A. Peterson et al, 2008).</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">An improved process and apparatus for production of liquid hydrocarbons as the main product and not suffering from the problems and disadvantages described above is disclose in PCT/DK2012/000071.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0016">Such continous production plants are connected with significant investments and the profitability of running a plant is highly dependent on the availability of the plant for production. Down time of any kind is therefore highly undesirable, but not totally avoidable as repair and maintenance always will be part of the operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">In the shut down phase of such processes the challenge of getting from a state of pressure and temperature that may be extremely high pressure and temperature operating conditions, to a much lower pressure and temperature condition, e.g. the pressure and temperature and pressure of the surroundings, present a particular significant challenge when dealing with biomass and similar materials. Most prior process examples are batch processes, where the continuity of the process is of little or no significance. For a continuous process the ability of actually operating uninterrupted is a key parameter for success. The invention therefore aims at the shut down phase of such continuously operating processes and the plants performing such processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0018">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved method for controlling a process equipment for performing a process for the production of liquid hydrocarbon, and further to provide an improved apparatus for the production of liquid hydrocarbon, where the availability of the process and the apparatus is improved.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0019">According to the invention the objective been achieved by a method for preparing shut down of a process system performing a process for converting carbonaceous material contained in one or more feedstocks into a liquid hydrocarbon product, said feedstocks including the carbonaceous material being in a feed mixture including one or more fluids, said fluids including water, the process comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>converting at least part of the carbonaceous material by:         <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li>pressurising the feed mixture to an operational pressure in the range 150-400 bar</li><li>heating the feed mixture to an operational temperature in the range 300-450Â° C., and</li><li>maintaining said pressurized and heated feed mixture in the desired pressure and temperature ranges in a reaction zone for a predefined time;</li><li>cooling the feed mixture to a temperature in the range 25-200Â° C. and</li><li>expanding the feed mixture to a pressure in the range of 1-70 bar, thereby causing the carbonaceous material to be converted to a liquid hydrocarbon product; and</li><li>separating from the converted feed mixture a fraction comprising liquid hydrocarbon product; <br /> where according to the method, in a state of discontinued operation the inflow of feed mixture is terminated and the system is filled with a fluid; where the pressure and temperature is set to a predetermined desired level, where the temperature is reduced to the predetermined lower level at a predetermined rate in the range 1 to 10Â° C./min and where the pressure during the temperature reduction is constantly kept at a level above the saturation pressure for the fluid at a given temperature. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0027">By following the described process the desired non-operational state may be reached in a manner faster and more reliable than else possible. The apparatus will likewise reach the desired state in a manner where any harmfull influence from cooling and de-pressurization/expansion are avoided. The desired state may be a stand-by condition e.g. due to change of feed mixture stream or a shut down of the apparatus for maintenance or repair. This will according to the procedure take place in an efficient manner. As a consequence the overall availability of the apparatus and thereby the effective production when reverting to normal operation has been improved by means of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0028">The fluid used in the procedure is different from feed mixture under normal operation conditions. The fluid often comprises water. Non limiting examples of preferred fluids include water, alcohols, oil or fraction of oil and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0029">Advantageously the cooling rate is within the range 0.1 to 20Â° C./min such as in the range 0.5 to 15Â° C./min, preferably the cooling rate is maintained in the range 1 to 10Â° C./min such as 2 to 10Â° C./min, most preferably the cooling rate is in the range 3-8Â° C./min. The cooling at the preferred rates will, besides providing an efficient cooling, ensure that harmful influence from thermal stress in the apparatus is avoided.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0030">Preferably the pressure during conversion is at least 150 bars such as at least 180 bars, preferably said pressure is at least 200 bars such as 221 bars and more preferably said pressure during conversion is at least 250 bar such as at least 300 bars, and the temperature during the conversion is at least 300Â° C., such as between 300Â° C. and 450Â° C., preferably between 350Â° C. and 430Â° C., more preferred between 370Â° C. and 430Â° C., e.g. between 385Â° C. and 430Â° C. and most preferred between 400Â° C. and 420Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0031">Advantageously the cooling time is in the range 30 minutes to 12 hours, such as in the range 1 hour to 8 hours, preferably in the range 1 hour to 6 hours and more preferably in the range 2 to 5 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment the pressure during cooling is maintained at a pressure of at 10 bars higher than corresponding saturation pressure such as at least 25 bars higher than the saturation pressure at the prevailing temperature in the process, preferably said pressure is maintained at least 50 bars higher than the saturation/boiling point pressure at the prevailing temperature such as at least 100 bars higher than the saturation/boiling point pressure at the prevailing temperature. By keeping the pressure higher as defined it is ensured that the fluid is kept in a liquid or supercritical state (single phase), and hence influence from multi phase state such as e.g precipitation are avoided.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0033">Preferably the duration of said cooling cycle corresponds to at least 3 exchanges of the volume in said high pressure high temperature part of the process such as at least 5 volume exchanges, preferably at least 10 volume exchanges such as at least 20 volume exchanges.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0034">Depending on the desired action the temperature and pressure may be maintained constant for a period of time before being altered to operational conditions again. Another option is where heating is terminated and the pressurisation is terminated and upon reaching essentially the pressure of the surroundings the fluid is drained from the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0035">Preferably the feed mixture further comprises liquid organic compounds at least partly produced by the process in a concentration of at least 1% by weight. This may even more advantageously be at least 3%, 5%, 10% and preferably 20% or more e.g 30%. The liquid organic compounds preferably comprises at least 20% hydrocarbon recycled from the process, and even more preferred 30%, such as 40%, further preferred 50% or 60%, and most preferred at least 70%.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0036">Further according to the invention the objective has been achieved by an apparatus for performing a process according to claim <b>1</b>, the apparatus being adapted for continous conversion of carbonaceous material contained in one or more feedstocks into a liquid hydrocarbon product, said carbonaceous material being in a feed mixture including said carbonaceous material and one or more fluids, said fluids including water, the apparatus comprising: <ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00005-en" list-style="none"><li>at least one feed pump for feeding the feed mixture into the processing zone;</li><li>a pressurization device adapted to pressurize the feed mixture to a pressure of 150-400 bar</li><li>a heating device adapted to heat the pressurized feed mixture to a temperature of 300-450Â° C.</li><li>a conversion device adapted to hold the pressurized and heated feed mixture for a conversion time of 10-40 minutes</li><li>a cooling device adapted to cool the treated feed mixture to a temperature of 25-200Â° C.</li><li>an expansion device adapted to reduce the pressure of the treated feed mixture to a pressure of 1-70 bar, and</li><li>a separation device adapted to separate a liquid hydrocarbon product from the treated and successively cooled and expanded feed mixture; <br /> where further valves are provided for closing of the inflow of feed mixture to the pressurization device and for opening the inflow of a fluid to the pressurization device, and <br /> where a control system is provided, with at least one pressure sendor and at least one temperature sensor for providing input to a central control unit and where the control unit provides control signals for the valves for closing and opening, respectively, and for the pressurization device and the heating device, to comply with the process according to the invention. </li></ul></li></ul></p>
