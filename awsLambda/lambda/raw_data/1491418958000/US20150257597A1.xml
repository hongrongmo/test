      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/953,451, filed on Mar. 14, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
    </related-apps>
    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a toaster, and more particularly to a toaster structure for rapid toasting.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A toaster typically includes a housing that has at least one slot configured to receive a slice of bread or other food product to be toasted. A basket is disposed underneath each slot to retain the food product. When the toaster is activated, typically by depressing a vertical slider button, the food product is lowered within the basket into a heating box. In at least some known toasters, the heating box is located within about 6.35 mm (0.25 in.) of a base of the toaster to minimize a vertical profile of the toaster.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Within the heating box, heating units disposed on each side of the basket apply heat to the respective sides of the food product. At least some known toaster heating units utilize a filament wrapped around a heat-resistant board, wherein the filament radiates heat at infrared wavelengths when a current is applied to it. Typically, a control circuit determines the length of the heating operation based on a user control setting.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Satisfactory toasting of bread and other food products involves removing moisture from the food product. Because fresh bread and other fresh food products often contain a significant amount of moisture, satisfactory toasting traditionally has required several minutes of heating. Efforts to decrease the required heating time have been limited by several factors. For example, at least some known toaster heater units use iron-chromium filaments. However, iron-chromium tends to radiate in a portion of the infrared spectrum that is relatively inefficient at transferring energy to the food product.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Another factor is that in at least some known toasters, heat dissipates from the outside edges of the heating box more quickly than from the center. Thus, with regard to baskets adjacent to the outer wall of the toaster, the side of the food product facing the outer wall tends to brown more slowly than the side of the food product facing the interior of the toaster. This problem is exacerbated when the radiated power is increased in an attempt to speed the toasting process.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In addition, known attempts to decrease the time needed for satisfactory toasting have been limited by the fact that moisture released from the food product, in the form of water vapor (i.e. steam), absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation emanating from the heating unit throughout the toasting process. If more power is applied to the heating unit in an attempt to speed the toasting process, correspondingly more steam is generated early in the process, thus absorbing more of the infrared radiation output from the heating unit and extending the process again.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">There is a need, therefore, for an improved toaster that provides relatively rapid toasting of bread or other food products.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one embodiment, a rapid-toasting toaster is provided.

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">For each of the filament-wrapping embodiments illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>, and with reference also to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the toaster <b>101</b> is configured such that a higher wattage is applied by the first side <b>201</b> of each of the outer heating units <b>131</b> than by either of the two sides <b>251</b> and <b>253</b> of the inner heating unit <b>133</b>. For example, toaster <b>101</b> is configured to apply about 1200 total watts of heating power, with each of the two outer heating units <b>131</b> configured to provide about 360 watts of that total, and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> configured to provide about 480 watts of that total (that is, about 240 watts on each side). In other words, about 60 percent of the total wattage supplied by the toaster <b>101</b> is directed to the outer heating units <b>131</b>. Because the first side <b>201</b> of the outer heating unit <b>131</b> facing a particular basket <b>115</b> supplies 360 watts, or about 150 percent more than the 240 watts applied by the corresponding first side <b>251</b> or second side <b>253</b> of the inner heating unit <b>133</b> facing that particular basket <b>115</b>, the toaster <b>101</b> facilitates even browning of both sides of the food product in the basket <b>115</b> despite a tendency for heat to dissipate more quickly from the outside region of the heating box <b>129</b> than from the interior.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In certain embodiments, the application of the desired wattages by each of the outer heating units <b>131</b> and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> may be facilitated by splitting the voltage supplied to at least one heating unit. For example, if the toaster <b>101</b> is configured to be electrically coupled to a 120 volt power outlet, the two outer heating units <b>131</b> can be electrically configured to split the 120 volts, while the inner heating unit <b>133</b> can be configured to utilize the full 120 volts.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Alternatively, in certain embodiments, the application of the desired wattages by each of the outer heating units <b>131</b> and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> may be facilitated by wiring each of the heating units together in series. For example, for the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the filament <b>651</b> wrapped around the inner heating unit <b>133</b> may be wired in series with each of the filaments <b>601</b> wrapped around the respective two outer heating units <b>131</b>.

More preferably, some consecutive windings <b>409</b> in each of the patterns <b>407</b>, <b>457</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>557</b>, <b>607</b>, <b>657</b> are spaced apart approximately 5.5 mm (0.22 in.). In alternative embodiments, the space <b>408</b> may be any suitable distance.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In suitable embodiments, the spacing between windings <b>409</b> may be uniform or varied throughout the patterns <b>407</b>, <b>457</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>557</b>, <b>607</b>, <b>657</b>. For example, adjacent windings <b>409</b> may be configured in a plurality of groups <b>411</b> such that adjacent windings in each group are separated by the space <b>408</b>. The windings <b>409</b> in each group <b>411</b> may be spaced from the windings in other groups a distance that is greater than the space <b>408</b> between the adjacent windings, such as shown in FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A-<b>6</b>B. Therefore, the groups <b>411</b> facilitate some of the windings <b>409</b> having a minimal distance between each other when a limited number of the windings are included in the patterns <b>407</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>557</b>, <b>607</b>, <b>657</b>. Alternately, the windings <b>409</b> may be uniformly spaced throughout the pattern <b>457</b>, such as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, to facilitate all of the windings being separated by the minimal space <b>408</b> when the pattern has a maximum number of the windings.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Additionally, the heat that the outer heating units <b>131</b> and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> radiate is determined, at least in part, by the number of the windings <b>409</b> in the patterns <b>407</b>, <b>457</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>557</b>, <b>607</b>, <b>657</b>. The number of the windings <b>409</b> affects the average operating temperature of the filaments, which is directly proportional to the infrared head radiated by the filaments. Therefore, the heat each filament <b>401</b>, <b>451</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>651</b> will radiate will increase as the number of the windings <b>409</b> increases. Preferably, the patterns <b>457</b>, <b>557</b>, <b>657</b> of the inner heating units <b>133</b> have between about 8 of the windings <b>409</b> and about 20 of the windings and the patterns <b>407</b>, <b>507</b>, <b>607</b> of the outer heating units <b>131</b> have between about 6 of the windings and about 16 of the windings. In the example embodiments, the pattern <b>407</b> has 10 of the windings <b>409</b>, the pattern <b>457</b> has 16 of the windings, the pattern <b>507</b> has 14 of the windings, the pattern <b>557</b> has 11 of the windings, the pattern <b>607</b> has 8 of the windings, and the pattern <b>657</b> has 10 of the windings. In alternate embodiments, the filaments <b>401</b>, <b>451</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>651</b> may be configured in patterns having any number of the windings <b>409</b>. Preferably, the number of the windings <b>409</b> is sufficient for the filaments <b>401</b>, <b>501</b>, <b>601</b> to each have a resistance value between about 9 ohms and about 14 ohms and the filaments <b>451</b>, <b>551</b>, <b>651</b> to each have a resistance value between about 15 ohms and about 28 ohms.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Thus, with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>, each basket <b>115</b> is disposed between a pair of heating units configured to apply heat at a specified wattage to oppositely disposed sides of the received food product in the basket <b>115</b>. In alternative embodiments where the toaster <b>101</b> includes more than two baskets <b>115</b>, an inner heating unit <b>133</b> may be disposed between each adjacent pair of baskets <b>115</b>. In another alternative embodiment where the toaster <b>101</b> includes a single basket <b>115</b>, the inner heating unit <b>133</b> is omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">With reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the base vents <b>171</b>, cavity <b>157</b>, and upper housing vents <b>161</b> are coupled in flow communication to define an airflow path <b>305</b> through the interior of the housing <b>103</b>. The airflow path <b>305</b> is external to the heating box <b>129</b>. Notably, however, the apertures <b>141</b> and <b>143</b> defined through the sides of the heating box <b>129</b> also are in flow communication with the airflow path <b>305</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the air flow through the interior of the housing <b>103</b> during operation of the toaster <b>101</b> will now be described. The toaster <b>101</b> is located on a smooth surface <b>301</b>. A gap <b>303</b> between the base <b>109</b> and the surface <b>301</b> is established by the length <b>127</b> of the legs <b>125</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) upon which the toaster <b>101</b> is supported.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Air heated by the operation of the outer heating units <b>131</b> and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> rises due to natural buoyancy. A portion of the heat generated by the heating units heats air within the housing <b>103</b> that is exterior to the heating box <b>129</b>, including the air within the cavity <b>157</b> beneath the bottom plate <b>135</b>, and this air tends to rise toward, and to exit through, the upper housing vents <b>161</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The exit of heated air from the upper housing vents <b>161</b> draws a flow of ambient air into housing <b>103</b> through vents <b>171</b> disposed in the base <b>109</b>, facilitated by the gap <b>303</b>. The ambient air is heated in turn, causing it to flow toward the upper housing vents <b>161</b>, continuing the flow cycle. Thus, the cavity <b>157</b> established by the extended length <b>155</b> of the posts <b>151</b> facilitates the formation of a steady, well-distributed air flow in airflow path <b>305</b> around the exterior of the heating box <b>129</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The airflow <b>305</b> draws air <b>307</b> out of the interior of the heating box <b>129</b> through the apertures <b>141</b> and <b>143</b>. The heating box air <b>307</b> includes steam released from the food product in the baskets <b>115</b> during the toasting process. Because steam absorbs significant amounts of infrared radiation, the drawing of air <b>307</b> out of the heating box <b>129</b> through the external airflow path <b>305</b> enables a larger proportion of the heat generated by the outer heating units <b>131</b> and the inner heating unit <b>133</b> to reach the food product, thereby facilitating a decreased time required for satisfactory toasting.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">To minimize the airflow <b>305</b> around the outer heating units <b>131</b>, a cover <b>191</b> can extend on the exterior of the outer heating units as seen in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The cover <b>191</b> facilitates the outer heating units reaching higher operating temperatures. Preferably, the cover <b>191</b> extends substantially the entire distance between the upper housing portion <b>105</b> and the bottom plate <b>135</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Benchmark testing of an embodiment of the toaster <b>101</b> was performed. Trials were used to establish the time required for conventional 1200-watt toasters, as well as the toaster <b>101</b> configured to apply 1200 watts, to reach 60 percent of a maximum browning standard. The browning standard was quantified by photographing toasted white bread and evaluating the number of browned pixels in the photographs.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The results of the benchmark testing are illustrated in bar graph <b>800</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. In bar graph <b>800</b>, axis <b>811</b> represents time in minutes to achieve the browning standard, while axis <b>813</b> is a list of brand names of conventional toasters. Toaster <b>101</b> is embodied by a modified Black and Decker TR1256B, as identified at <b>801</b>. The conventional toasters most comparable to the toaster <b>101</b> required from about 2.5 minutes to about 3 minutes to achieve the standard, as illustrated by bars <b>803</b> and <b>805</b>, while the toaster <b>101</b> required only about 1.7 minutes to achieve the same standard, as illustrated by bar <b>801</b>. This results in a speed increase of from 32 to 43 percent over conventional toasters.</p>
