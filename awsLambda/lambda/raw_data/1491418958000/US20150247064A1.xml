      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an adhesive sheet, and more specifically, to a blister-resistant adhesive sheet that, when affixed to surface of various plastic molded articles, prevents blistering such as swelling or lifting and allows the surface of its support substrate to be smooth and to have an excellent appearance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Adhesive sheets having a support substrate applied a pressure-sensitive adhesive (adhesive agent) thereto have been conventionally used in a wide variety of fields because of its simplicity, specifically, because the sheets are easy to affix on adherends by pressing force. Meanwhile, plastic molded articles have been frequently used in recent years in accordance with the needs for lighter products. With this, use of adhesive sheets to be affixed on plastic molded articles has increased. Examples of the plastic molded article include those molded from resins such as polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, and ABS.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">When an adhesive sheet that has a support substrate having gas barrier properties (for example, an adhesive label) is affixed on the surfaces of such a plastic molded article for ornamentation and the like, gas may be generated from the plastic molded article to form air bubbles between the adhesive sheet and the plastic molded article, and thus swelling or lifting, that is, blisters may occur. Occurrence of such blisters impairs the appearance of the labels and significantly reduces the ornamental function as adhesive sheets.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">To solve such problems, Patent Literature 1, for example, discloses an acrylic adhesive agent composition, as the adhesive agent composition, containing a copolymer prepared by radically polymerizing a (meth)acrylic acid ester, a carboxyl group-containing compound that can copolymerize, and a tertiary amine having a vinyl group.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Patent Literature 2 suggests a blister-resistant adhesive sheet using an adhesive agent prepared by blending an aziridine-based crosslinking agent to a copolymer of an acrylic acid ester having an alkyl group having 4 to 12 carbon atoms and 0.1 to 10% by weight of a polar monomer such as acrylic acid or 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Additionally, Patent Literature 3 discloses an adhesive sheet that contains, as the components for forming an adhesive agent layer, an adhesive agent component and a curable component that is an acrylic monomer or oligomer. The curable component, however, may reduce the cohesive force of the adhesive agent layer, or may make the adhesive agent layer whitely turbid if having poor compatibility with the adhesive agent component.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Furthermore, Patent Literature 4 discloses an adhesive agent composition prepared by blending a resin composition having a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing an alkyl(meth)acrylate ester having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and a carboxyl group-containing unsaturated monomer, with a resin composition having a specific Tg and a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing one or more monomers selected from an alkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester or cycloalkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, benzyl methacrylate, or styrene with an amino group-containing unsaturated monomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Furthermore, Patent Literature 5 discloses a blister-resistant adhesive agent composition prepared by blending a crosslinking agent having a glycidyl group to a copolymer having a specific molecular weight obtained by copolymerizing an alkyl(meth)acrylic acid ester having 1 to 12 carbon atoms as the main component, a styrenic monomer, a carboxyl group-containing unsaturated monomer, and an amino group-containing unsaturated monomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Patent Literature 6 discloses a resin composition polymerized in acetone and having a weight average molecular weight of 1.5 million or more and a ratio of the weight average molecular weight/the number average molecule weight of 4.0 or less.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0016">Unfortunately, any techniques described in Patent Literatures 1 to 6 mentioned above have limitations on the compositions of adhesive agents, the types of crosslinking agents, molecular weights and the like, with the result that applicable adhesive agents are limited, and have a problem of difficulty to satisfy both of adhesive properties required for label applications and blister-resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0017">Under such situations, it is an object of the present invention to provide an adhesive sheet that, when affixed to the surface of various plastic molded articles, prevents swelling or lifting, in other words, blistering after a lapse of time to allow the surface of its support substrate to be smooth and to have an excellent appearance, wherein the adhesive sheet can exhibit excellent blister resistance regardless of the type of adhesive agent, and is furthermore easy to manufacture.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0018">The present inventors have extensively studied to solve the problem and found that the problem can be solved by an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer, a continuous void-containing layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, and an adhesive agent layer that are laminated in this order, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer is in a specific range. The present invention has been completed based on these findings.</p>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">An adhesive sheet of the present invention will be described first.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">The adhesive sheet of the present invention is an adhesive sheet including a support substrate, an adhesive agent layer (X), a continuous void-containing layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, and an adhesive agent layer (Y) that are laminated in this order, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the continuous void-containing layer is from 25 to 60%.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">[Support Substrate]</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">The support substrate used in the adhesive sheet of the present invention is not particularly limited, and various substrates conventionally used as the support substrate in adhesive sheets can be used. Example of the such support substrate include plastic films such as polyester films including polyethylene terephthalate films, polybutylene terephthalate films, and polyethylene naphthalate films, polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polyvinyl chloride films, polyvinylidene chloride films, polyvinyl alcohol films, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer films, polystyrene films, polycarbonate films, polymethylpentene films, polysulfone films, polyether ether ketone films, polyether sulfone films, polyphenylene sulfide films, polyether imide films, polyimide films, fluorine resin films, polyamide films, acrylic resin films, norbornene-based resin films, and cycloolefin resin films.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">Of these, polyethylene terephthalate films are preferable. Polyethylene naphthalate films, polyimide films, and polyether imide films, which have a high glass transition point (Tg), can be used in applications requiring heat resistance and the like. Furthermore, polyvinyl chloride films, polyvinylidene chloride films, fluorine resin films, and acrylic resin films, which have weatherability, can be used in applications requiring weatherability and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">The thickness of this plastic film is not particularly limited, and is usually from about 5 to about 200 Î¼m, preferably from 25 to 120 Î¼m, more preferably from 30 to 90 Î¼m, and still more preferably from 40 to 60 Î¼m.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">[Metal Layer]</heading>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0029">The support substrate in the present invention is preferably a non-breathable substrate, which further clearly exerts an effect of the present invention to prevent blisters.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0030">An example of this non-breathable substrate that can be used includes a substrate having a metal layer on the plastic film aforementioned. Examples of the method for forming the metal layer that can be employed include a method for depositing, for example, a metal having metal luster, specifically aluminum, tin, chromium, and titanium by a PVD method such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, and ion plating, or a method for affixing metal foil having metal luster, specifically aluminum foil, tin foil, chromium foil, and titanium foil via one of various adhesive agent layers usually used. Particularly, the method for depositing a metal having metal luster is advantageous from the viewpoints of the appearance and cost effectiveness of an adhesive sheet to be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0031">In order to improve the adhesion properties with a layer to be mounted on the surface, these plastic films also can be subjected to surface treatment by an oxidation method or a roughening method or primer treatment as required. Examples of the oxidation method aforementioned include corona discharge treatment, plasma discharge treatment, chromium acid treatment (wet type), hot-air treatment, and ozone and ultraviolet irradiation treatment. Examples of the roughening method include sandblast method and solvent treatment. Such surface treatment is arbitrarily selected depending on the type of plastic film. In terms of effects, handleability and the like, corona discharge treatment is preferably used in general.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">[Continuous Void-Containing Layer]</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0032">A continuous void-containing layer constituting an adhesive sheet of the present invention (sometimes simply referred to as a void-containing layer hereinbelow) is a layer composed of a composition containing an adhesive agent and silica particles, wherein the content by mass of the silica particles in the void-containing layer is necessarily from 25 to 60%, preferably from 28 to 55%, more preferably from 30 to 55%, still more preferably from 30 to 50%, and further still more preferably from 35 to 45%. A content by mass of the silica particles aforementioned of less than 25% cannot provide voids, and may result in insufficient blister resistance. On the other hand, a content by mass of more than 60% may reduce the film strength to thereby cause the following problems: the water resistance and chemical resistance are reduced; and, pressing force in affixing an adhesive sheet may make a dent to cause a defective appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0033">It is to be noted that the content by mass of the silica particles in the void-containing layer can be calculated by the following expression (2);</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Content by mass of the silica particles=[mass of the silica particles/total mass of the continuous void-containing layer]Ã100ââ(2)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">[Increment in Thickness Due to Voids]</heading>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0034">The increment in thickness due to voids of the void-containing layer is preferably from 120 to 170%, more preferably from 130 to 165%, still more preferably from 130 to 160%, further still more preferably from 135 to 150%, and further still more preferably from 135 to 145%.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0035">An increment in thickness due to the voids of 120% or more allows gas generated from plastic molded articles and the like to be easier to escape and makes the blister resistance of the adhesive sheet excellent. On the other hand, an increment in thickness of 170% or less makes the film strength higher and the water resistance and chemical resistance excellent.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0000">[Method for calculating the increment in thickness due to voids]</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0036">The increment in thickness due to voids of the void-containing layer can be calculated as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0037">First, the measurement of the amount applied is divided by the specific gravity of the dried coating film to calculate the film thickness containing no bubbles (underlined part). The measured film thickness is divided by the calculated film thickness as in the following expression (1) to calculate the increment in thickness due to voids.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Increment in thickness due to voids (%)=Measured film thicknessÃ100/(amount applied/specific gravity of the dried coating film)ââ(1)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0038">It is to be noted that a measured film thickness is a value of the thickness of the void-containing layer measured with a constant pressure thickness gauge (manufactured by TECLOCK Corporation, product name âPG-02â) in conformity with JIS K 7130. The amount applied is the dry mass of the void-containing layer per unit area (g/m<sup>2</sup>). The specific gravity of the dry coating film (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) is a value calculated from the mass fraction of the specific gravity of each material.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">[Voids]</heading>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0039">Silica particles that are a material to form the continuous void-containing layer are in fact constituted of secondary particles. The voids in the continuous void-containing layer thus include, in addition to the voids existing between the secondary particles, voids existing in the secondary particles. Accordingly, the continuous void-containing layer has a region where voids existing between the secondary particles communicate with voids existing in the secondary particles to form holes (micropores) toward the thickness direction.</p>
      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="2">[Silica Particles]</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0040">Silica particles that are a material to form the void-containing layer may be any of dry silica, wet silica, or organically modified silica, or may be a mixture of two or more of these. The content by mass of the silica in the silica particles is preferably from 70 to 100% by mass, more preferably from 85 to 100% by mass, and still more preferably from 90 to 100% by mass. The volume-average secondary particle size of the silica particles that are a material to form the void-containing layer is preferably from 0.5 to 10 Î¼m, more preferably from 1 to 8 Î¼m, and still more preferably from 1.5 to 5 Î¼m. The volume-average secondary particle size of the silica particles can be determined by measuring the particle size distribution using Multisizer 3 (manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc.) and the like in accordance with the Coulter counter method.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0041">It is to be noted that the void-containing layer may contain, together with the silica particles, other inorganic particles such as titanium oxide, barium sulfate, alumina, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and glass beads, and furthermore, organic particles such as acrylic beads as long as not impairing the object of the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">[Adhesive Agent]</heading>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0042">The continuous void-containing layer contains an adhesive agent as a component. The reasons are that adhesion properties at the interface between the continuous void-containing layer and the adhesive agent layer are easily obtainable, and that a material having adhesiveness can easily achieve larger adhesive strength to an adherend than a material having no adhesiveness due to the influence of bulk consequently when both materials have the same thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0043">The adhesive agent to constitute the continuous void-containing layer is not particularly limited, and examples of the adhesive agent that can be used include various types of adhesive agent such as rubber-based adhesive agents, silicone-based adhesive agents, and acrylic adhesive agents. From the viewpoints of the performance of the adhesive agent and the weatherability, acrylic adhesive agents are preferable. Additionally, the adhesive agent may be either of a solvent form or an emulsion form. It is to be noted that a solvent adhesive agent may contain a crosslinking agent as necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0044">The acrylic adhesive agent preferably contains a crosslinking agent as an adhesive component together with a (meth)acrylic acid ester copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 100000 to 1500000. From the viewpoint of the porosity, the storage shear modulus of the adhesive agent after crosslinking at 100Â° C. is preferably 9.0Ã10<sup>3 </sup>Pa or more, more preferably 1.0Ã10<sup>4 </sup>Pa or more, and still more preferably 0.0Ã10<sup>4 </sup>Pa or more. A storage shear modulus of 9.0Ã10<sup>3 </sup>Pa or more allows voids to remain, and thus the blister resistant will be excellent.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0045">The storage shear modulus can be determined by measurement using a viscoelasticity measuring apparatus (manufactured by Rheometrics, Inc., apparatus name: DYNAMIC ANALYZER RDA II) at a frequency of 1 Hz.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0046">Additionally, from the viewpoint of the adhesion properties of the interface between the continuous void-containing layer and the adhesive agent layer, the adhesive agent used as the adhesive agent constituting the continuous void-containing layer is preferably the same as used in the adhesive agent layer described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0047">Examples of the crosslinking agent include polyisocyanate compounds, epoxy resins, melamine resins, urea resins, dialdehydes, methylol polymers, aziridine-based compounds, metal chelate compounds, metal alkoxides, and metal salts, and a polyisocyanate compounds are preferably used. This crosslinking agent can be blended with respect to 100 parts by mass of the solid content of the (meth)acrylic acid ester copolymer aforementioned in an amount of preferably 0 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably 1 to 15 parts by mass, still more preferably 2 to 10 parts by mass, and further still more preferably 3 to 7 parts by mass.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0048">Examples of the polyisocyanate compounds here include aromatic polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and xylylene diisocyanate, aliphatic polyisocyanates such as hexamethylene diisocyanate, alicyclic polyisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate and hydrogenated diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and biuret products and isocyanurate products thereof, as well as adduct products that are reaction products from reaction with a low-molecular active hydrogen-containing compound such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, trimethylolpropane, and castor oil. These crosslinking agents may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0049">The thickness of the continuous void-containing layer is preferably from 5 to 100 Î¼m, more preferably from 7 to 50 Î¼m, still more preferably from 10 to 30 Î¼m, and further still more preferably from 15 to 25 Î¼m. When the thickness is 5 Î¼m or more, a sufficient thickness for embedding silica particles can be secured, and a continuous void-containing layer having lower roughness can be formed. Blister resistance also can be secured. A thickness of 100 Î¼m or less is economically preferable because the water resistance is not impaired, and the amount of the silica particles used also can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0050">The continuous void-containing layer is formed by applying a coating liquid for a continuous void-containing layer, the coating liquid containing the adhesive agent and the silica particles.</p>
