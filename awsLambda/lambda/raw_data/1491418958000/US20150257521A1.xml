      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention pertains to personal care appliances, such as a power skin care brush, that are used to care for, clean and otherwise treat skin and hair, and, in particular, to a portable, electrically driven, handheld device that may he used to care for, clean and otherwise treat skin and hair.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Handheld personal care appliances used to care for, clean or otherwise treat the skin or hair (e.g., to clean, massage and/or apply creams, cleansing solutions or other substances to the skin or hair) are known and have gained increasing popularity. Such devices are most often used to provide daily hygienic skin care, in particular care for the facial skin. These devices usually include a small handheld casing having an internal motor and a self-contained power source (such as a battery) for producing a particular movement/action of a workpiece (e.g., a brush or pad), which in turn produces desired functional results. Examples of such appliances include power skin brushes and power toothbrushes, among others. Such personal care appliances have motor arrangements which produce either rotational movement or oscillating (hack and forth) movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">While many such devices are known, there is room for improvement in the field of personal care appliances such as handheld skin and hair treatment devices. Hence, it is desirable to have a personal care appliance having a drive assembly which is powerful (stronger and faster), energy efficient, quiet and durable. It would also be further desirable to according to an aspect of the present invention described herein, incorporate into the workpiece during the manufacturing stage active ingredients that are safe for use on the skin and resist and inhibit the growth of mold, mildew, fungus and/or bacteria on the workpiece keeping the workpiece cleaner and healthier for a longer period of time. By helping prevent the growth of microorganisms, stain and odor control is also achieved.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a personal care appliance that (i) employs a new and improved mechanism for producing oscillating action of a workpiece, such as a brush or pad, which is powerful (stronger and faster), energy efficient, quiet and durable, and (ii) utilizes a workpiece incorporating active ingredients in the manufacturing stage that are safe for use on the skin and resist and inhibit the growth of mold, mildew, fungus and/or bacteria on the workpiece to maintain the workpiece cleaner and healthier for a longer period of time. By helping prevent the growth of microorganisms, stain and odor control is also achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one embodiment, a personal care appliance is provided that includes a housing, a drive assembly provided in the housing, and a workpiece member coupled to and driven by the drive assembly. On one specific exemplary implementation, the workpiece member includes active ingredients incorporated during the manufacturing stage that safely resist and inhibit the growth of mold, mildew, fungus and/or bacteria. The drive assembly includes a stator assembly, an armature assembly adjacent the stator assembly and responsive to the stator action to move through a path, a mounting member attached to the housing of the personal care appliance, an elongated pivot arm having a first end directly coupled to the armature assembly and a second end directly coupled to the mounting member such that the armature in operation oscillates in an arcuate manner about a pivot point located at the mounting member, and a mounting arm having a first end and a second end, the first end being directly coupled to the armature assembly. The stator, when energized, is structured to cause the armature to oscillate (which oscillation, as described above, is in an arcuate manner about a pivot point located at the mounting member). The workpiece member is coupled to the second end of the mounting arm such that oscillation of the armature assembly causes the workpiece member to oscillate relative to the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another embodiment, a personal care appliance is provided that includes a housing, a drive assembly provided in the housing, the drive assembly including a stator assembly and an armature assembly adjacent the stator assembly, wherein the stator, when energized, is structured to cause the armature to oscillate, and a workpiece member coupled to the armature assembly such that oscillation of the armature assembly causes the workpiece member to oscillate relative to the housing, wherein the workpiece member incldues one or more components made with an antimicrobial material that is both (i) safe for use on the skin, and (ii) resists and/or inhibits the growth of mold, mildew, fungus and/or bacteria.</p>
