    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A waist belt fastener system includes a belt and a buckle mechanism attached to the belt. The buckle includes a rectangular frame having upper and lower sides that are curved outwardly, creating a convex shape that curves away from the belt wearer. At the rear side of the buckle frame where the buckle attaches to the belt, a fixed tongue member projects away from the buckle frame. This tongue member is fastened to the belt such as by a rivet, firmly anchoring and securing the buckle to the belt and inhibiting movement of the buckle relative to the belt. At the front side of the buckle frame, a fixed prong projects inwardly towards the buckle opening. The prong rests against the belt once it is threaded through the buckle opening. A hook and loop closure system is used to attach the ends of the belt together once the belt is inserted through the buckle opening.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a belt fastener system, and more particularly, to a buckle mechanism that stabilizes the movement of the buckle within the waist belt.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A belt buckle is a clasp or fastening device used to join the loose ends of a belt or strap. The buckle typically has a flat rectangular frame. The buckle is attached to one end of the belt by looping the belt end over one side of the buckle frame, folding it back on itself, and securing this belt end to the inside of the belt, capturing one side of the buckle frame within a pocket or sleeve created by this belt loop. In this attached position, the belt buckle can freely move and swings back and forth. A hinged pin or prong is attached to the side of the buckle frame that is captured by the loop at the end of the belt. The hinged prong can freely pivot from this bar. The prong aids in cinching the belt around the waist of the wearer by insertion through an appropriate eyelet formed in the belt, after the free end of the belt has been threaded through the opening in the buckle frame.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The free movement of the belt buckle requires that a user employ both hands to fasten the belt. One hand must hold the buckle firmly in place while the other hand threads the free end of the belt through the buckle opening. Even after this threading exercise, the user must still exhibit a precise dexterity in handling the belt and buckle combination by first drawing the belt back against the buckle in a tightening motion, and then carefully inserting the buckle prong into the appropriate eyelet in the belt. As before with the threading operation, both hands are necessary in this cinching operation: one hand draws the free end of the belt tight while the other hand maneuvers the buckle prong into the appropriate eyelet in the belt. The manipulation of the belt and buckle, while a common task for most people, can present significant challenges for other individuals. The two-handed operation makes conventional belts very difficult to use for individuals who do not have both hands available or who have impaired dexterity in their hands or fingers.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A user with only a single available hand would find it very difficult to manage the threading operation, since the conventional belt buckle freely pivots within its attached position at the end of the belt. Even if such a user does succeed in threading the free end of the belt through the buckle opening, and is able to cinch the belt tight, there is the further challenge of how to insert the pivoting buckle prong through the appropriate belt eyelet.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a belt fastener system that can support a one-handed operation and that reduces the number of moving parts in the buckle design, creating a more stable fastening mechanism.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the known art and the problems that remain unsolved by providing a belt fastener system including a belt and buckle mechanism, a combination that offers improved stability regarding movement of the buckle, enabling the belt to be fastened using a single-handed operation.</p>

It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">A buckle mechanism <b>100</b> is presented in various configurations in the illustrations of <figref>FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>. The buckle <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>118</b> having a body <b>120</b> that defines an interior space or opening <b>110</b> through which an attached belt is maneuvered during operation. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the buckle <b>100</b> has a waist side <b>112</b> (proximate the wearer) and an exterior side <b>114</b> (distal the wearer). The buckle <b>100</b> includes an attachment end <b>115</b> where the buckle <b>100</b> is to attach to a belt, and a free end <b>116</b> opposite the attachment end <b>115</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As best shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the body <b>120</b> of buckle frame <b>118</b> includes a front (forward) or outer side <b>122</b> disposed at the free end <b>116</b> of buckle <b>100</b>; a rear or inner side <b>124</b> disposed at the attachment end <b>115</b> of buckle <b>100</b>; an upper side <b>126</b>; and a lower side <b>128</b>. In one exemplary form, the buckle frame <b>118</b> has a generally rectangular shape. Accordingly, the front side <b>122</b> and the rear side <b>124</b> are disposed in generally opposing and parallel relationship to one another, while the upper side <b>126</b> and the lower side <b>128</b> are disposed in generally opposing and parallel relationship to one another. Other geometries are possible for buckle frame <b>118</b>, including an oval, circular, or rounded shape. The combination of front side <b>122</b>, rear side <b>124</b>, upper side <b>126</b>, and lower side <b>128</b> defines the contour of frame <b>118</b> and constitutes a set of edges, ends, posts, bars, and frame pieces of buckle frame <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In an exemplary form, the upper side <b>126</b> and the lower side <b>128</b> of the frame body <b>120</b> are curved outwardly towards the exterior side <b>114</b> and away from the waist side <b>112</b> of buckle <b>100</b> (i.e., away from the wearer), as best shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. This curvature produces a convex shape to the buckle frame <b>118</b> that promotes ease of fit and comfort. The curvature can be adjusted during the manufacturing process of buckle <b>100</b> to produce any desired degree of curvature or convexity.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The buckle <b>100</b> further includes a tongue member <b>102</b> that projects from the rear side <b>124</b> of frame body <b>120</b> at the attachment end <b>115</b> of buckle <b>100</b>. The tongue <b>102</b> is fixedly mounted or attached to frame body <b>120</b> in a rigid, stationary connection. There is no relative movement between tongue <b>102</b> and frame body <b>120</b>. In an exemplary form, the tongue <b>102</b> is provided as a unitary piece with frame body <b>120</b>. The tongue <b>102</b> preferably extends in a direction generally parallel to a plane defined by the front side <b>122</b> and the rear side <b>124</b> of frame body <b>120</b>, as best seen in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. In particular, the tongue <b>102</b> extends in a direction generally opposite the buckle opening <b>110</b>. The tongue <b>102</b> can be variously characterized as an extension element, a projection, an ear component, a mounting element, a shank, or a tang. In an exemplary form, the tongue <b>102</b> extends from a midsection of the rear side <b>124</b> of frame body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The tongue <b>102</b> serves as the connection point for attaching and securing the buckle <b>100</b> to belt <b>130</b> at the attachment end <b>115</b> of buckle <b>100</b>, as presented in <figref>FIGS. 5 through 9</figref>. For this purpose, the tongue <b>102</b> includes a through hole <b>104</b>. In turn, the belt <b>130</b> includes a free end <b>132</b>, a buckle end <b>134</b> opposite the free end <b>132</b>, an inside or inner portion <b>136</b> facing towards the wearer, and an outside or outer portion <b>138</b> facing away from the wearer. During assembly, the buckle end <b>134</b> of belt <b>130</b> is threaded or looped through the buckle opening <b>110</b> from the exterior side <b>114</b> of buckle <b>100</b> and folded or wrapped around the rear side <b>124</b> of frame body <b>120</b> at the attachment end <b>115</b> of buckle <b>100</b>. In this threaded wrap-around position, the buckle end <b>134</b> of belt <b>130</b> is folded over on itself in a manner sufficient to cover the tongue <b>102</b> on both sides. The tongue <b>102</b> is now sandwiched between opposing sections of belt <b>130</b> at its buckle end <b>134</b>. A fastening rivet <b>144</b> is now used to secure the belt <b>130</b> to tongue <b>102</b>, by passing through the through hole <b>104</b> of the tongue <b>102</b>; the fastening rivet <b>144</b> thus functions to attach the buckle <b>100</b> to belt <b>130</b>. The use of rivet <b>144</b> to fasten the tongue <b>102</b> to belt <b>130</b> creates a very tight and rigid coupling between the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b> that renders the buckle <b>100</b> substantially immovable relative to belt <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The riveted fastening of the buckle <b>100</b> to belt <b>130</b> via tongue <b>102</b>, in combination with the fixed rigid connection of tongue <b>102</b> to the buckle frame <b>118</b>, produces a very stable and fixed mechanical coupling between the belt <b>130</b> and buckle <b>100</b>. There is substantially no movement between the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b>. The tongue <b>102</b>, along with its riveted fastening to belt <b>130</b>, functions as a stabilizer mechanism that prevents the buckle <b>100</b> from flopping around as one is attempting to buckle and secure the belt <b>130</b>, unlike conventional buckle mechanisms where the buckle freely swings at the end of the belt. The rigid stabilization of the buckle <b>100</b> is especially adapted for use by handicapped individuals, young children, or others with dexterity issues because there are no moving parts in the assembled buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b> combination. Even better, the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b> can be effectively manipulated in a one-handed operation due to the rigid positioning of buckle <b>100</b> relative to belt <b>130</b>, since there is no need for a free hand to be available to hold the buckle <b>100</b> in place while the free end <b>132</b> of belt <b>130</b> is looped through the buckle opening <b>110</b> during operation, i.e., as the wearer is putting on belt <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The tongue <b>102</b> preferably has a solid body metal construction. In an exemplary form, the tongue <b>102</b> has a generally rectangular shape, although other suitable shapes are possible. The geometry and design of tongue <b>102</b> are selected with a view towards ensuring the maximum amount of mechanical rigidity, and hence stabilization, between the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b> once the tongue <b>102</b> is riveted to belt <b>130</b> in the assembled configuration. The rivet <b>144</b> serves as the means for fastening buckle <b>100</b> to belt <b>130</b> via tongue <b>102</b>. The rivet <b>144</b> is especially adapted for use in this application since a riveted connection forms a very firm and stationary coupling between the parts, i.e., belt <b>130</b> and tongue <b>102</b> (with buckle <b>100</b>) are rendered relatively immovable with respect to one another. However, it should be apparent that other suitable means can be used to fasten buckle <b>100</b> to belt <b>130</b> via tongue <b>102</b>, keeping in view the need to create a rigid mechanical joint between the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b>. The riveted connection between the tongue extension <b>102</b> and belt <b>130</b> anchors the buckle <b>100</b> to the belt <b>130</b>, making the buckle <b>100</b> an immovable part relative to belt <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Turning back to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the buckle <b>100</b> preferably includes a prong or elongate finger projection <b>106</b> that extends from an inner surface of the front side <b>122</b> of frame body <b>120</b> towards the buckle opening <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the prong <b>106</b> rests against the belt <b>130</b> once the belt <b>130</b> is threaded through the buckle opening <b>110</b> during installation (wearing) of the belt <b>130</b>, helping to resist any outward bulging of the belt <b>130</b>. The prong <b>106</b> also features an aesthetic appearance in resemblance of the hinged movable prong present in conventional buckle mechanisms. The prong <b>106</b> has a solid body construction that is rigidly fixed to the frame body <b>120</b> at its front side <b>122</b>. The prong <b>106</b> preferably has a unibody construction with the frame body <b>120</b>. In alternate forms, the prong <b>106</b> can extend in various directions and angles from the front side <b>122</b> of frame body <b>120</b>. In an exemplary form, the prong <b>106</b> extends from a midpoint or midsection of the front side <b>122</b> of frame body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The illustrations of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> further present an additional feature comprised in the belt <b>130</b> of the present embodiment. As shown, the belt <b>130</b> includes a hook-and-loop fastener combination including a loop element <b>140</b> attached to the inside <b>136</b> of belt <b>130</b> at its free end <b>132</b>, and a hook element <b>142</b> attached to the outside <b>138</b> of belt <b>130</b> at its buckle end <b>134</b>. The loop element <b>140</b> and hook element <b>142</b> are preferably made of suitable hook-and-loop materials such as, but not limited to, VelcroÂ®, although other suitable fastening elements such as snap fasteners, hooks, magnets, or the like can be used to secure the free end <b>132</b> of belt <b>130</b> to the buckle end <b>134</b> of belt <b>130</b>. In a conventional manner, the loop element <b>140</b> and hook element <b>142</b> can engage and mate together in a reversible fastening connection.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">During installation, as the user or wearer attempts to put on the belt system <b>150</b>, the user initially inserts the free end <b>132</b> of belt <b>130</b> through the buckle opening <b>110</b> from the waist side <b>112</b> of buckle <b>100</b>. The loop element <b>140</b> is now facing towards the outside <b>138</b> of belt <b>130</b> and is thus in a position to be engaged to hook element <b>142</b>. Depending upon how securely the user wants to cinch the belt <b>130</b> around the waist, the user can maneuver the free end <b>132</b> of belt <b>130</b> and continue to coil or wrap the free end <b>132</b> around the waist until a desired tightness is reached. At this point, the user mates or engages the loop element <b>140</b> to the hook element <b>142</b> to firmly secure the belt <b>130</b> in its worn position, as best shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. The belt system <b>150</b> requires no manipulation of mechanical parts into an interlocking arrangement, such as the insertion of a hinged movable prong into a belt eyelet of conventional belts. Instead, the belt system <b>150</b> allows the user to secure the ends of the belt together by simply mating the loop element <b>140</b> and hook element <b>142</b> together in a simple press engagement. Likewise, the belt system <b>150</b> can be easily opened and removed by simply releasing the loop element <b>140</b> from the hook element <b>142</b> in a typical tearing or pulling operation, then maneuvering the free end <b>132</b> of belt <b>130</b> back through the buckle opening <b>110</b>. The fastening of the loop element <b>140</b> to the hook element <b>142</b> only requires a single hand to manipulate the belt <b>130</b> into position, compared to conventional belts that require one hand to maneuver the free end of the belt and another to hold the buckle. In the invention, the buckle <b>100</b> is held firmly in place by its rigid mechanical connection to belt <b>130</b> via the riveted fastening of tongue <b>102</b> to belt <b>130</b>, avoiding any need by the user to hold the buckle <b>100</b> either during installation or removal of belt <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The buckle extension or tongue <b>102</b> stabilizes the position of buckle <b>100</b> relative to belt <b>130</b>, allowing one-handed operation of buckle <b>100</b> and the fastening of belt <b>130</b>. The buckle extension <b>102</b> and hook-and-loop closure (i.e., loop element <b>140</b> and hook element <b>142</b>) make the belt simple and easy to wear and operate, particularly with one hand. The belt has the appearance of a normal belt article; however, the belt buckle extension <b>102</b> and the use of loop element <b>140</b> and hook element <b>142</b> material make the belt easy to operate, i.e., put on, open, and remove.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Various modifications are possible with the buckle <b>100</b> and belt <b>130</b> combination. The buckle <b>100</b> can be provided in any of various suitable shapes, such as a rounded or square shape. The fastener system for securing the ends of belt <b>130</b> can be implemented with any suitable combination of hook and loop materials, in addition to VelcroÂ®. The belt <b>130</b> can be made from any type of material, such as leather. The buckle <b>100</b> is preferably made with a solid, unibody construction, although it is possible to design buckle <b>100</b> with frame <b>118</b> and then attach the tongue <b>102</b> and prong <b>106</b> to frame <b>118</b> in a suitable manner, such as a welding operation. The buckle <b>100</b> is constructed so that tongue <b>102</b> is rigidly fixed to frame <b>118</b>.</p>
