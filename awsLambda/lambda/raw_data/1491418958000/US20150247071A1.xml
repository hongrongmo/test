      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present application claims priority to and the benefit of German patent application no. 10 2014 203 653.4, which was filed in Germany on Feb. 28, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for joining, in particular adhering, plastic to a substrate; to a plastic/substrate composite manufactured thereby; to a polymer; and to a polymer use for adhesive bonding.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Merely injection-molding a thermoplastic material, for example a plastic, onto or over another material, for example a metal, is often insufficient to achieve a hermetically sealed interface between the two materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In particular, gaps can form at the interface between the two materials and can result in lack of sealing. This can occur in particular when the adhesion between the two materials is not strong enough to withstand forces that act, for example as a result of different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) in the two materials, in particular in the case of plastic and metal, and/or material deformation under large loads.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In order to achieve improved sealing, small structures, for example nanostructures, can be formed on the surface of a, for example, metallic substrate, which serve as physical anchoring points for the injection-molding material and can increase the adhesion area.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The small structures are conventionally formed by chemical etching or laser etching. This is very cost-intensive, however, and unsuitable for large areas.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is also possible to apply onto the substrate an intermediate material onto which the injection-molding material is injected. The intermediate material is thermally softened in order to achieve sufficient adhesion between the intermediate material and the injection-molding material.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Thermal softening of the intermediate material can occur during the injection molding process. The temperature window in which the intermediate material softens sufficiently to achieve adhesion of the injection molded material, but does not soften too much and is not floated away by the injection-molding material, is nevertheless usually too narrow for mass production. In addition, the adhesion of the intermediate material to the substrate and/or to the injection-molding material is usually too weak to withstand large loads.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Thermal softening of the intermediate material can, however, also be accomplished by a thermal post-treatment. Intermediate materials suitable for this are, however, special materials, such as partly hardened epoxy adhesives, which for the most part are very cost-intensive. It is moreover problematic to establish, before injection molding with thermoplastics, a specific degree of pre-hardening which furthermore usually falls within a narrow range. Partly hardened coatings are moreover usually susceptible to damage during handling. In addition, for complete curing of the intermediate material, for example an adhesive, as a rule the entire article must be heated for a considerable time.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The subject matter of the present invention is a method for joining, in particular adhering, plastic to a substrate, encompassing the method tasks of: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>a) furnishing a plastic material that encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer,</li><li>b) bringing the plastic material into contact with a substrate,     <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>a portion of the plastic material which is brought into contact with the substrate being heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer becomes thermally cleaved, and re-cooling or being re-cooled while in contact with the substrate.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0015">Re-cooling can occur in particular both actively, for example by active cooling, and passively, for example by being left to cool.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0016">Thermal cleavage of a polymer can encompass or be, for example, a thermal depolymerization and/or radicalization, and/or linking initiation or linking activation, in particular of the polymer. Thermal cleavage of a polymer can, for example, encompass or be a thermal depolymerization and/or radicalization, in particular of the polymer. For example, a thermal cleavage of a polymer can encompass or be a thermal depolymerization, in particular of the polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0017">A âthermally reversibly cleavable polymerâ can be understood in particular as a polymer whose thermal cleavage, for example depolymerization and/or radicalization and/or linking initiation and/or linking activation, occurs reversibly, i.e. one which, once it has been cleaved at a specific temperature, which can also be referred to as a âcleavage temperatureâ and in particular can be appreciably above the melting point or softening temperature of the polymer, can (re-)polymerize upon cooling below that temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0018">As a result of the fact that the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer is heated to a temperature at which it becomes cleaved, the thermally reversibly cleavable polymer can be cleaved into very small structural units, which can penetrate into very small pores or structures in the surface of the substrate and can reassemble into the thermally reversibly cleavable polymer upon cooling. This can occur in particular in a manner accompanied by a reconfiguration of the polymer chains, which can also be referred to as âpolymer chain reconfiguration.â</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0019">The cleaved structural units occurring upon heating are advantageously appreciably smaller than softened or melted polymer chains can be, and can therefore also penetrate into smaller pores or structures in the surface of the substrate than softened and melted polymer chains can. Joining of the plastic to the substrate can in turn thereby advantageously be intensified or in some cases in fact be made possible in the first place.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0020">In the context of an embodiment, the substrate is a metal substrate. For example, the substrate can encompass or can be constituted from at least one metallic material selected from the group consisting of steel, for example stainless steel, copper, aluminum, magnesium, and combinations or mixtures thereof. The metal substrate can be, for example, a tube or a sleeve or a plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0021">Thermally reversibly cleavable polymers can advantageously be cleavable into, for example, radical and/or acidic and/or basic structural units that react with the surface of the substrate and, for example, can clean it or can remove a passivation layer from it. This has proven particularly advantageous in the context of metal substrates, made e.g. of steel, for example stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium, that conventionally have a passivated surface and must therefore usually be cleaned, for example by etching, before application of another material, for example an injection-molding material, and/or must be surface-treated, for example with a removing method, for example a grinding method.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0022">In the context of an embodiment, the substrate is a plastic substrate. The plastic substrate can be, for example, a tube or a sleeve or a plate or a disk. If the substrate is a plastic substrate, structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic material can advantageously react with structural units of the plastic substrate and can form chemical, in particular covalent, bonds between the plastic material and the substrate. Advantageously, for example, strong plastic-substrate joins, which can be stronger than bonds based on adhesion, can be achieved. Advantageously, the materials of the plastic material and of the plastic substrate can be selected relatively freely. For example, a coordination of mutually chemically reactive functional groups can be dispensed with in terms of the materials. In order to strengthen the joins further, however, it is nevertheless possible to coordinate the materials with one another, in particular additionally, in terms of chemically reactive functional groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0023">In the context of an embodiment, however, the plastic substrate (also) encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0024">Heating of the plastic material can occur in particular in a method task c).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0025">For example, upon heating, in particular in method task c), a portion of the plastic substrate that is brought into or is in contact with the plastic material can also be heated. For example, that portion of the plastic substrate which is brought into or is in contact with the plastic material can be heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic substrate becomes cleaved, and can re-cool or be re-cooled while in contact with the plastic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0026">It is thus in fact advantageously possible for structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic material to exchange, during heating, with structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic substrate; this can also be referred to as âreflow polymer chain member exchangeâ or green space (block) copolymerization and/or graft reaction, and additionally are configured, for example, to yield intermolecular, chemical, in particular covalent, bonds between structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic material and structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic substrate, for example also intramolecular, chemical, in particular covalent, bonds between structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic material and structural units of the thermally reversibly cleavable plastic, to the plastic material and to the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0027">Heating and re-cooling advantageously allows the achievement of particularly strong plastic-plastic joins, which can be appreciably stronger than bonds based on adhesion. Advantageously, the materials of the plastic material and of the plastic substrate can be selected relatively freely. Because reflow polymer chain member exchange can occur even without the coordination of mutually chemically reactive functional groups in the materials, this can advantageously also be dispensed with. In order to obtain particularly strong joins, however, it is nevertheless also possible to coordinate the materials with one another, in particular additionally, in terms of chemically reactive functional groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0028">Conventional methods for joining plastics to substrates, for example metal substrates and plastic substrates, are carried out at temperatures that are not sufficiently high to bring about thermal cleavage, for example depolymerization and/or radicalization and/or linking initiation and/or linking activation, of polymers. In conventional injection molding, for example, the temperature of the injection mold must be below the melting point or softening temperature of the injection-molding material, and in particular appreciably below the cleavage temperature of the polymers present therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0029">The invention is based on findings that were obtained in the context of adhesive bonding experiments between an injection-molded plastic and a metal substrate, in particular in the form of a metal plate. It was found in this context that at temperatures around the melting point or softening temperature, it was not possible to bring about sufficient adhesion between the plastic substrate and the metal substrate. Surprisingly, however, it was possible to achieve a very strong join as a result of treatment at a temperature above the cleavage temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0030">It has become apparent, for example, that materials that normally cannot adhere strongly to one another, such as polyamide to metal, e.g. polyamide 6.6 (PA66) to steel, or epoxy resin to polyamide, for example epoxy acrylic paint to polyamide 6.6 (PA66), or polyamide to polyester, for example polyamide 6.6 (PA66) to polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), can be caused to adhere strongly to one another by a thermal treatment above their cleavage temperature. For example, polyamide, e.g. polyamide 6.6 (PA66), can be caused to adhere strongly to metal, for example steel, or epoxy resin, for example epoxy acrylic paint, can be caused to adhere strongly to polyamide, for example polyamide 6.6 (PA66), or polyamide, for example polyamide 6.6 (PA66), can be caused to adhere directly to polyester, for example polybutylene terephthalate (PBT).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0031">This can advantageously be accomplished in a wide processing temperature window. In the case of adhesion of polyamide 6.6 (PA66) to polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) or steel, for example, a processing temperature window of at least 100Â° C. can be achieved. Process requirements, in particular temperature control, for the method can thus be decreased, and a wide processing window that is, for example, insensitive to manufacturing tolerances can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0032">In the context of the method, the plastic and the substrate can advantageously be joined directly to one another. The substrate can advantageously be both a plastic substrate and a metal substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0033">For example, the plastic can be joined directly to the substrate by the fact that the plastic material, encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, is placed onto the substrate, in particular directly, in the form of a shaped plastic part. Optionally, the plastic material can be pressed onto the substrate, or placement can be/accomplished under pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0034">In the context of an embodiment, the bringing of the plastic material into contact with the substrate, in particular in method task b), is therefore accomplished by, in particular direct, placement of the plastic material onto the substrate. The plastic material can be placed onto the substrate in particular in the form of a shaped plastic part, for example in the form of a plastic layer/plastic film, or of a sleeve, for example a plastic sleeve, or of a plastic-coated sheet, for example in the form of a sleeve, or of a plastic handle or of a plastic disk or of a plastic tube. The geometry of the shaped plastic part can advantageously be freely selected. In addition, the substrate can advantageously be both a plastic substrate and a metal substrate. The heating and re-cooling of the reversibly cleavable polymer thus advantageously allows a shaped plastic part, for example a plastic handle, to be fastened in particularly simple and economical fashion onto a metal substrate or also onto a plastic substrate. Advantageously, for example, direct attachment of a shaped polyester part onto a steel substrate can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0035">It is likewise possible, however, to join the plastic to the substrate by the fact that the plastic material, encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, is applied directly onto the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0036">In the context of a further embodiment, the bringing of the plastic material into contact with the substrate, in particular in method task b), is therefore accomplished by, in particular direct, application of the plastic material onto the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0037">In the context of an embodiment, the bringing of the plastic material into contact with the substrate, in particular in method task b), is accomplished by, in particular direct, application of the plastic material onto the substrate by injection molding. The plastic material can be, in particular, an injection-molding material. The geometry of the shaped injection-molded part constituted from the plastic material can advantageously be subject to few or no restrictions. In addition, the substrate can advantageously be both a plastic substrate and a metal substrate. The heating and re-cooling of the reversibly cleavable polymer thus advantageously allows a shaped injection-molded part, for example a plastic handle, to be fastened in particularly simple and economical fashion onto a metal substrate or also onto a plastic substrate. Advantageously, for example, direct attachment of a shaped polyamide part onto a steel substrate can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0038">In the context of another embodiment, the bringing of the plastic material with the substrate, in particular in method task b), is accomplished by, in particular direct, coating of the substrate with the plastic material. Here as well the substrate can advantageously be both a plastic substrate and a metal substrate. The heating and re-cooling of the reversibly cleavable polymer thus advantageously allows a plastic coating to be configured in particularly simple and economical fashion on a metal substrate or also on a plastic substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0039">Although many plastic materials, and in particular injection-molding materials, are suitable for adhering directly onto the substrate in the context of this method, and the method therefore allows a plastic, for example in the form of a shaped plastic part or a shaped injection-molded part or a plastic coating, to be joined directly to the substrate, it can be advantageous to use the plastic material, which in particular is to be brought into contact with the substrate and in particular encompasses the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, as an intermediate material for, in particular indirect, attachment of a further material, for example a metal or plastic, for example a metal object or a plastic object or a further plastic material, for example an injection-molding material. The further plastic material (explained in further detail below) both can itself represent the further material to be attached and optionally can itself serve as a further intermediate material. For example, the substrate can be joined to an injection-molding material and/or adhesively bonded to an object, for example a metal object or plastic object, via the plastic material serving as an intermediate material, for example in the form of an intermediate layer, and optionally via the further plastic material serving as a further intermediate material, for example in the form of a further intermediate layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0040">The plastic material or further plastic material serving as an intermediate material can advantageously be optimized with regard to a maximization of adhesion or even chemical bonding to the substrate or further material, for example the injected-molded material or object, with no need in that context to adapt the properties of the further material, for example the injection-molding material or object.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0041">For example, by way of a plastic material serving as an intermediate material and optionally a further plastic material serving as a further intermediate material, the surface of the substrate or of an object to be equipped therewith can be brought into and/or kept in a bondable and/or conductive state. For example, a substrate or object of this kind can be brought into and/or kept in a state that is free of a passivation layer, for example a corrosion-free state as in the case of stainless steel. A plastic material serving as an intermediate layer or the further plastic material serving as a further intermediate layer can advantageously additionally serve as a protective layer, for example in order to protect the surface of the substrate or of the object from passivation between being brought into contact with the substrate or object and being brought into contact with further material, for example plastic material, e.g. injection-molding material, and/or an object, for example during transport and/or storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0042">It is thus possible all in all by way of the method to achieve, advantageously, a good adhesive effect or adhesion between plastic and substrate, for example directly between the plastic material and the substrate, and optionally, for example indirectly, via the plastic material and optionally the further plastic material, between the substrate and a further material, for example an injection-molding material or object. In particular, a good adhesive effect or adhesion can thereby advantageously also be achieved between different materials, for example of the substrate and of an object.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0043">The adhesion or adhesive effect achievable can optionally in fact be so good that cost-intensive formation of anchoring structures, for example nanostructures, can be dispensed with.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0044">The method can be used particularly advantageously in injection-molding applications, for example in order to achieve good adhesion between a metal substrate and a plastic injection-molding material. The adhesion can be implemented both directly between an injection-molding material and a metal substrate, or optionally indirectly, for example by way of a plastic material, serving as an intermediate layer, which adheres on the one hand to the metal substrate and on the other hand to the injection-molding material.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0045">Seals having an excellent sealing effect can thus in turn advantageously be obtained. In particular, hermetically sealed adhesion between metal substrates and injection-molding materials can thus also advantageously be obtained. For example, hermetically sealed overmolding of metal parts, for example with thermoplastics, can thereby be achieved, in particular in economical fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0046">In the context of further embodiments the plastic material, which in particular encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, therefore serves as an intermediate material. For example, the plastic material serving as intermediate material can be applied, for example in method task b) or in a method task y) explained later, in the form of a shaped plastic part, for example in the form of a plastic layer/plastic film, or of a sleeve, for example a plastic sleeve, or of a plastic-coated sheet, for example in the form of a sleeve, or of a plastic handle or a plastic disk or a plastic tube, or a plastic coating, onto the substrate, in particular in method task b), or onto the further material, in particular in method task y). The layer or coating constituted from the plastic material can in particular serve as an intermediate layer and can be referred to as such. Economical application of an intermediate material onto a substrate, for example a metal substrate or plastic substrate, can therefore also be made available by the embodiments described above for bringing the plastic material into contact, for example by coating, placement, and/or injection molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0047">In the context of a further embodiment, in particular in which the plastic material serves as an intermediate material, a further plastic material is applied onto the plastic material. In particular in method task c), a portion of the plastic material that is brought into or is in contact with the further plastic material, can in particular be heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material becomes cleaved, and can re-cool or be re-cooled while in contact with the further plastic material. The further plastic material can advantageously be joined to the plastic material, for example via a crosslinking reaction and/or grafting reaction, by the heating and re-cooling of the reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material. A portion of the further plastic material which is brought into or is in contact with the plastic material can optionally also be heated. The first plastic material can optionally be a plastic material that does not encompass a thermally reversibly cleavable polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0048">In the context of an embodiment, however, the further plastic material also encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer or is constituted therefrom. In particular in method task c), for example, a portion of the further plastic material which is is brought into or is in contact with the plastic material can, for example, also be heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the further plastic material becomes cleaved, and can re-cool or be re-cooled while in contact with the plastic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0049">A reflow polymer chain member exchange or green space (block) copolymerization reaction and/or grafting reaction can thus advantageously be brought about between the thermally reversibly cleavable polymers of the plastic material and of the further plastic material, and particularly strong plastic/plastic joins, which can be appreciably stronger than bonds based on adhesion, can advantageously be achieved. Here as well, advantageously, the materials of the plastic material and of the further plastic material can be selected relatively freely. Because reflow polymer chain member exchange can occur even without coordination of mutually chemically reactive functional groups in the materials, such coordination can advantageously also be omitted. In order to strengthen the joins further, however, it is also possible here to coordinate the materials with one another, in particular additionally, with regard to mutually chemically reactive functional groups.</p>

Tube joins, for example of metal tubes, for example of a steel tube to an aluminum tube, or plastic tubes, or a metal tube and a plastic tube, can thereby advantageously be effected in simple fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0086">The tubes can be configured from different materials, for example from different metals such as aluminum and magnesium, or from different plastics, or one from metal, for example aluminum, and the other from plastic, for example carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic. In particular, the tubes can be metal tubes.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0087">In particular, one of the tubes can be partly introduced into the other tube, for example slid in or slid on. One of the tube can therefore be referred to as an âinner tubeâ and the other tube as an âouter tube.â</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0088">The overlapping region between the tubes can in particular be equipped at least partly with the plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, and optionally with the further plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. For example, the overlapping region between the tubes can be equipped with the plastic material and optionally with the further plastic material in the form of an internal coating and/or external coating and/or of a shaped part, for example a sleeve and/or a plastic-material-coated sheet or a film.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0089">In the context of an embodiment, the substrate and the further substrate are tubes. The object can be, for example, a sheet coated on both sides with plastic material, for example a steel sheet, for example in the form of a sleeve. The sheet coated on both sides with plastic material can be disposed between the tubes. The sheet can be coated at least with the plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0090">Optionally, the sheet can be coated (at least on one side) with the plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, and (at least on one side) with the further plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. For example, the sheet can be coated with the plastic material and optionally with the further plastic material in the form of a paint.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0091">Advantageously, as a result of the coating of the sheet on both sides with the plastic material, not only joining but also insulation is achieved, and in that manner, for example, galvanic corrosion is prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0092">In addition, the sheet advantageously makes possible heating, for example by low-frequency heating. The sheet can be heated, in particular in method task c), to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material and optionally of the further plastic material becomes thermally cleaved, and can re-cool or be re-cooled while in contact with the substrates. The heating, in particular in method task c), can advantageously be accomplished by the fact that, for example only, the sheet is, in particular selectively, heated. The tubes, in particular the outer tube, can remain unheated. This can be achieved, for example, by low-frequency heating, e.g. at approximately 50 Hz, for example by inductive low-frequency heating, or by the application of an eddy current. The outer tube can advantageously serve as a kind of cage that limits the expansion of the sheet, which can be advantageous in particular with material combinations in which the material of the outer tube, for example aluminum, has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than the sheet, for example steel, and or the inner tube. A sheet coated with plastic on both sides moreover can be manufactured in simple fashion and allows a possibly more complex internal coating to be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0093">In the context of another embodiment, the substrate is a first tube and the object is a second tube. For example, the substrate can be configured in the form of a first metal tube and the object in the form of a second metal tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0094">In this context in particular, a side of the first tube which faces toward the second tube can be equipped, in particular coated, with the plastic material encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. Optionally, a side of the second tube which faces toward the first tube can be equipped, for example coated, at least partly with the further plastic material, in particular encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. It is thereby once again advantageously possible to achieve not only joining but also insulation, and in that manner, for example, to prevent galvanic corrosion.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0095">The first tube can be, for example, the inner tube, and the second tube can be the outer tube. It is likewise possible, however, for the first tube to be the outer tube and the second tube to be the inner tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0096">For example, the outer side of the first, in particular inner, tube, for example of the substrate, can be or become equipped, for example coated, with the plastic material encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. The inner side of the second, in particular outer, tube, for example of the object, can be or become equipped, for example coated, with the further plastic material. Or conversely the outer side of the second, in particular inner, tube, for example of the object, can be or become equipped, for example coated, with the plastic material encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. The inner side of the first, in particular outer, tube, for example of the substrate, can be or become equipped, for example coated, with the further plastic material. In particular, the further plastic material can also encompass at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">Alternatively thereto, a shaped plastic part, for example in the form of a sleeve, or a plastic film, which part or film encompasses or is constituted from the plastic material encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer and optionally the further plastic material encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, can be disposed between the inner tube and the outer tube. This also advantageously makes it possible to achieve not only joining but also insulation, and in that manner, for example, to prevent galvanic corrosion. In addition, a shaped plastic part, for example a plastic sleeve or a plastic film, can easily be manufactured and allows a possibly more complex internal coating to be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0098">In the context of a further embodiment, the action of bringing into contact is accomplished, in particular in method task b), by way of a deformation method. In particular, at least one of the tubes can be deformed. For example, the outer tube can be shrunk onto the inner tube and/or the inner tube can be expanded, for example inflated, against the outer tube. The plastic material and the further plastic material, as well as optionally the sheet, can advantageously be brought into contact with one of the tubes or with both tubes, and can optionally be pressed between the tubes, for example under pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0099">Deformation can be implemented using a variety of deformation methods. For example, deformation can be accomplished by hydroforming and/or by way of a magnetic pulse method and/or by way of a mechanical deformation method.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0100">Alternatively or additionally, for example, the inner tube can be explained or inflated by hydroforming. The outer tube can also be shrunk onto the inner tube by hydroforming.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0101">Deformation can, however, also, for example, be accomplished by way of a magnetic pulse method, for example magnetic shaping (also called electromagnetic pulse technology, EMPT). The result can be that the inner tube becomes expanded or inflated, and/or the outer tube becomes shrunk.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0102">Deformation can also be accomplished mechanically, for example by hammering, forging, etcetera. For example, the outer tube can be forged onto the inner tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0103">The non-overlapped region or regions of the tubes or the undeformed region of the inner tube and/or of the outer tube can advantageously be used for a, for example analogous, join to a further component, for example to a further tube. Vehicle frames, for example for motor vehicles and/or bicycles, can thus advantageously be manufactured in simple fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0104">The inner tube can, in particular, have an outer radius that is smaller than the inner radius of the outer tube. In particular, the radial distance between the outer radius of the inner tube and the inner radius of the outer tube can be greater than or equal to the radial thickness of the plastic material or the sum of the radial thickness of the plastic material and/or the radial thickness of the further plastic material and/or the radial thickness of the sheet. If the radial distance between the outer radius of the inner tube and the inner radius of the outer tube is greater than the radial thickness of the plastic material or the sum of the radial thickness of the plastic material and/or the radial thickness of the further plastic material and/or the radial thickness of the sheet, the action of bringing into contact, in particular in method task b) can be accomplished, for example, using a deformation method.</p>

      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0108">In the context of a further embodiment, in particular in which the plastic material serves as an intermediate material, an intermediate layer segment constituted from the plastic material is applied, in particular in method task b), onto the substrate. In particular, a plurality of intermediate layer segments constituted from the plastic material can be applied onto the substrate.</p>

The smooth surface can be both a flat surface and a curved surface. In particular, the intermediate layer can also become or be completely solidified. Method task b) can, for example, be carried out after method task b<b>1</b>) and/or x).</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0112">Thanks to an intermediate layer of this kind, heating can advantageously cause the formation of chemical anchoring joins between the intermediate layer segments and the substrate and between the intermediate layer segments and the segments, adjacent thereto, of the injection-molded further plastic material (injection-molded segments), the result being that good attachment of the injection-molded further plastic material to the substrate can be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0113">In the context of a special embodiment, application of the plastic material and/or of the further plastic material, in particular of the further plastic material, for example in method task b) and/or x), in particular x), is accomplished by injection molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0114">Application can be accomplished in particular by way of an injection method and/or molding method. For example, in method task x) the plastic material can be over-injected and/or overmolded with the further plastic material. The further plastic material can serve, for example, as an injection-molding material, for example an over-injected and/or overmolded material. The plastic material can serve in particular as an intermediate material and can be, for example, pre-applied onto the substrate. The substrate can be, for example, a metal substrate.</p>

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0117">The plastic material pre-applied onto the substrate, for example in the form of a coating on the substrate, can, for example, be overmolded with the further plastic material and thermally treated in such a way that the temperature of the interfaces between the different layers of the layer systemâsubstrate, plastic material (intermediate material), and further plastic material (injection-molding material)âin particular the temperature of the interfaces of the plastic material (intermediate material) with the substrate and with the further plastic material (injection-molding material), is sufficiently high that the thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material (intermediate material) becomes cleaved. At the interfaces of the plastic material (intermediate material), the temperature can in particular be higher than the melting point or softening point of the further plastic material (injection-molding material). The bulk of the further plastic material (injection-molding material) can, however, remain in particular below its melting point or softening point. This can be achieved, for example, by way of the heating methods explained later.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0118">All in all it is thereby advantageously possible to achieve not only, for example in the case of a metal substrate, an adhesive bond between the plastic material (intermediate material) and the substrate, but also in particular a strong chemical, for example covalent, bond between the, for example coating-like, plastic material (intermediate material) and the further, for example thermoplastic, plastic material (injection-molding material). In the case of a plastic substrate, a strong chemical, for example covalent, bond between the, for example coating-like, plastic material (intermediate material) and the material of the plastic substrate can additionally be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0119">For example, the substrate can be embodied in the form of a sleeve, for example a metallic sleeve, which becomes or is coated, for example painted, with the plastic material (intermediate material). The coating-like plastic material (intermediate material) can then be overmolded with the further plastic material (injection-molding material). After coating and/or overmolding, the materials can adhere only weakly to one another or can not yet form a chemical anchoring bond. As a result of heating, in particular of the interfaces of the plastic material (intermediate material), for example to a temperature of approximately 400Â° C., stable attachment of the materials to one another, and in particular a chemical anchoring bond, can then be achieved.

Handling or processing management can thereby advantageously be simplified.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0121">The portion of the plastic material or of the further plastic material or of the substrate or of the object can, as already explained, be heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer becomes thermally cleaved, for example depolymerized and/or radicalized and/or linking initiated and/or linking activated, in particular depolymerized and/or radicalized. This can be accomplished in particular by way of a thermal treatment or a thermal post-treatment. During this, in particular at least one functional group can be produced from the polymer chain of the at least thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, which can clean the surface of the substrate and/or form a chemical bond with the substrate and/or, for example if the plastic material serves as an intermediate material, can clean a further material, for example of a metal object, or a further plastic material, for example an injection-molding material, or of a plastic object, and/or can form a chemical bond therewith. The at least one functional group produced from the polymer chain of the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer can be, for example, a radical group and/or an acid and/or basic group, for example a carboxylic acid group and/or amine group.</p>

      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0201">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> provides an overview of some embodiments of the method according to the present invention for joining, in particular adhering, plastic to a substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0202">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows that firstly, in a method task a), a plastic material that encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer is furnished. In a method task b) this plastic material is brought into contact with a substrate. The substrate can be, for example, a metal substrate or a plastic substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0203">In order to achieve an adhesion effect and/or adhesive bonding effect between the plastic material and the substrate, a portion of the plastic material which is brought into contact with the substrate is heated, in particular in a method task c), to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material becomes cleaved, and is re-cooled while in contact with the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0204">It is possible in this context to heat that portion of the plastic material which is to be brought into contact with the substrate, before being brought into contact with the substrate, to the temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer becomes cleaved, for example in method task c), and then to bring it into contact with the substrate and to cool it while in contact with the substrate (not depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0205">It is also possible to heat a portion of the substrate, before being brought into contact with the plastic material, for example in method task c), to a temperature that is high enough to heat a portion of the plastic material, when brought into contact with the plastic material, to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material becomes cleaved, and to re-cool it while in contact with the plastic material (not depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0206">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, however, method task c) can be carried out in particular after method task b), so that a portion of the plastic material which is brought into or is in contact with the substrate becomes heated to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material becomes cleaved and re-cools or is re-cooled while in contact with the substrate. This can be achieved, for example, by electromagnetic induction.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0207">In the case of a metal substrate, for example, a portion of the metal substrate adjacent to the plastic substrate can be heated by electromagnetic induction to a temperature that is sufficiently high to heat that part of the plastic material which is adjacent thereto to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of the plastic material becomes cleaved. The cleaved polymer units, for example monomers, can penetrate into smaller pores in the surface of the metal substrate than melted polymers, so that on the one hand an improved adhesion effect is achieved. On the other hand, the cleaved polymer units can exhibit passivation layer-dissolving properties and can in that manner further improve the adhesion effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0208">In the case of a plastic substrate, for example at least that part of the plastic material which is adjacent to the plastic substrate, and/or at least that part of the plastic substrate which is adjacent to the plastic material, can be electrically conductive and can in that manner be heated by electromagnetic induction. The material of the plastic substrate can optionally also encompass at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. Particularly strong chemical, in particular covalent, bonds can thereby be formed by way of a polymer chain member exchange between the polymer of the plastic material and the polymer of the plastic substrate, and a particularly good adhesive effect can in that manner be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0209">The plastic material can be applied in method task b), for example, in the form of a coating onto the substrate, or injection-molded as an injection-molding material onto the substrate, or placed as a shaped part or shaped element onto the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0210">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the method can furthermore encompass the method task b<b>1</b>) in which the plastic material becomes completely solidified, in particular fully polymerized or cured, before heating, in particular in method task c). A plastic material applied, for example, as a coating or injection-molding material onto the substrate can thus advantageously be protected from damage during processing thereof, for example between application onto the substrate and heating.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0211">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates that the method can encompass, alternatively or in addition to method task b<b>1</b>), the method task x) of applying a further plastic material onto the plastic material. The further plastic material can, in method task x), for example be overmolded in the form of an injection-molding material onto the plastic material, or can be applied in the form of a coating onto the plastic material, or overmolded as an injection-molding material onto the substrate, or placed as a shaped part or shaped element onto the substrate. In particular if the plastic material is embodied in the form of a coating and the further plastic material is applied by injection molding, it can be advantageous to completely solidify, for example cure, the plastic material in method task b<b>1</b>). The plastic material can thus advantageously not deform during injection molding of the further plastic material, and injection molding is thus simplified and/or the quality of the composite to be manufactured is thus improved. The further plastic material can optionally likewise encompass a thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. Particularly strong chemical, in particular covalent, bonds can thus be formed by a polymer chain member exchange between the polymer of the plastic material and the polymer of the further plastic material, and a particularly good adhesive effect can be achieved in this manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0212">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the method can further encompass, alternatively or in addition to method task b<b>1</b>) and alternatively or in addition to method task x), the method task y) of bringing the plastic material or the further material into contact with an object or bringing the plastic material into contact with an object equipped with the further plastic material. The object can be, for example, a metal object or a plastic object. If the object is equipped with the further plastic material, the object can in particular be brought into contact with the plastic material in such a way that the plastic material and the further plastic material contact one another. The material of the plastic object and/or the further plastic material can optionally likewise encompass at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. Particularly strong chemical, in particular covalent, bonds can thus advantageously be formed by a polymer chain member exchange between the polymer of the plastic material and the polymer of the plastic object and/or the polymer of the further plastic material, and a particularly good adhesive effect can be achieved in this manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0213">If the further plastic material and/or the material of the plastic substrate and/or the material of the plastic object likewise encompasses a thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, in method task c) in particular interface-forming parts of the materials can be heated to a temperature at which the respective polymer becomes thermally cleaved.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic cross section through an embodiment of an intermediate layer <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>â² that can be used in the method according to the present invention, for example, as a self-supporting shaped plastic part, for example a film. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> shows that intermediate layer <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>â² has a structured or discontinuous or interrupted layer <b>1</b> of isolated anchoring structures (intermediate layer segments) which are embodied from a plastic material <b>1</b> that encompasses at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates that anchoring structures <b>1</b> are partly overmolded with a further plastic material <b>1</b>â², such that exposed or unovermolded surfaces of anchoring structures <b>1</b>, and sub-segments of further plastic material <b>1</b>â² that partly surround anchoring structures <b>1</b>, together form a smooth outer surface of the shaped plastic part.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> illustrate a further embodiment of the method and composite according to the present invention. Parts <b>2</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>* that are to be joined are two tubes <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>*, of which one tube <b>2</b> represents an inner tube and the other tube <b>2</b>* represents an outer tube, which are joined to one another via a steel sheet <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b> disposed between them and equipped on both sides with plastic material <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0241">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> shows parts <b>2</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>* that are to be joined, before the method; <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows the resulting composite <b>2</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>* after the method.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0242">Outer tube <b>2</b>* can be, for example, a metal tube, e.g. an aluminum tube. Inner tube <b>2</b> can be a tube made of a different material, for example a metal tube, for example made of magnesium, or a plastic tube, for example made of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0243">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> furthermore shows that inner tube <b>2</b> is partly introduced, for example slid, into outer tube <b>2</b>*.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0244">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> shows in particular that a steel sheet <b>2</b>â², for example in the form of a sleeve, is disposed between inner tube <b>2</b> and outer tube <b>2</b>*, said sheet being equipped on both sides with a plastic material <b>1</b> encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer. Steel sheet <b>2</b>â² can, for example, be coated with plastic material <b>1</b>, for example in the form of a paint.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0245">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> illustrates that inner tube <b>2</b> has an outer radius that is smaller than the inner radius of outer tube <b>2</b>*. In particular, the radial spacing between the inner radius of outer tube <b>2</b>* and the outer radius of inner tube <b>2</b> is greater than the radial thickness of steel sheet <b>2</b>â² coated on both sides with plastic material <b>1</b>. For example, outer tube <b>2</b>* can have a diameter of approximately 30 mm and, for example, a wall thickness of 1.5 mm, and inner tube <b>2</b> can have a diameter of approximately 25 mm. Steel sheet <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b> that is coated on both sides can be a sleeve having an axial length of approximately 20 mm, for example in order to achieve a joining length of approximately 20 mm. The axial length of steel sheet <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b> can in principle, however, also be shorter or longer.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0246">Length l of outer tube <b>2</b>* can in this context be, for example, approximately 200 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0247">In the context of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, inner tube <b>2</b> and/or outer tube <b>2</b>* can be regarded as a substrate. Coating <b>1</b> on both sides of steel sheet <b>2</b>â² serves here on both sides as plastic material <b>1</b> encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, and steel sheet <b>2</b>â² itself can be regarded as an (intermediate) object. In other words, in the context of this embodiment, two substrates <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>*, namely inner tube <b>2</b> and outer tube <b>2</b>*, are joined via an object <b>2</b>â² coated on both sides with plastic material <b>1</b> encompassing at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer, namely via coated steel sheet <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0248">Advantageously, thanks to the coating <b>1</b> on both sides of steel sheet <b>2</b>â² with plastic material <b>1</b> not only joining but also insulation is achieved, and galvanic corrosion, for example, can thereby be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0249">In the context of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the bringing of plastic material <b>1</b> into contact with the two substrates <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>*, namely with inner tube <b>2</b> and with outer tube <b>2</b>*, is accomplished by deformation of one of tubes <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>*. In particular, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, outer tube <b>2</b>* is shrunk onto inner tube <b>2</b> and in that manner both outer tube <b>2</b>* and inner tube <b>2</b> are brought into contact with plastic material <b>1</b> of steel sheet <b>2</b>â², <b>1</b> that is coated on both sides. Alternatively thereto, the inner tube can also be expanded, for example inflated, and in this manner both the inner tube and the outer tube can be brought into contact with the plastic material of the steel sheet that is coated on both sides (not depicted). In both cases, the action of bringing into contact can be accomplished under pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0250">Deformation can be implemented using a variety of deformation methods. For example, inner tube <b>2</b> can be expanded or inflated by hydroforming. Deformation can also be accomplished, however, by a magnetic pulse method, for example magnetic shaping (also called electromagnetic pulse technology, EMPT), in which context, for example, the inner tube can be expanded or inflated and/or the outer tube can be shrunk. Deformation can also be accomplished mechanically, for example, by hammering, forging, etcetera, for example such that the outer tube can be forged onto the inner tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0251">The method can be adapted in various ways with regard to different coefficients of thermal expansion of the various materials, in particular of the inner tube and/or outer tube and/or of the steel sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0252">On the one hand, adaptation can be accomplished by the fact that the inner tube exhibits greater thermal expansion than the outer tube; this can be achieved, for example, by suitable material selection and optionally dimensioning.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0253">On the other hand, the method can be optimized with regard to different coefficients of thermal expansion by way of a suitable heating method.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0254">In the context of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, for example the heating of plastic material <b>1</b> to a temperature at which the at least one thermally reversibly cleavable polymer of plastic material <b>1</b> becomes thermally cleaved can be accomplished by the fact that steel sheet <b>2</b>â² is selectively heated, in particular without thereby heating outer tube <b>2</b>*. This can be achieved, for example, by low-frequency heating, for example at approximately 50 Hz, for example by inductive low-frequency heating, or by the application of eddy current. Outer tube <b>2</b>* can advantageously serve as a kind of cage that limits the expansion of steel sheet <b>2</b>â². This can be advantageous in particular with material combinations in which the material of outer tube <b>2</b>*, for example aluminum, has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel sheet <b>2</b>â² or inner tube <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0255">The undeformed region, shown on the left in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, of outer tube <b>2</b>* can advantageously be used for joining to a further component. In this manner, for example, a vehicle frame, for example for a motor vehicle or bicycle, can be manufactured.</p>
