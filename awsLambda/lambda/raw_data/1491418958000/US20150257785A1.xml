    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of medical devices used in the extraction of tissue ingrowth cuffs and fluid lines. More particularly, the invention relates to a circular-shaped cuffed fluid line extraction device with an opening slit for insertion of the cuffed fluid line tube and a removal channel for receiving the cuffed fluid line, facilitating the safe, convenient, and reliable manner for removal of cuffed or tunneled fluid lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many medical procedures and therapies require the surgical implantation of a fluid line into a patient for removal or introduction of fluids. These procedures and therapies include introduction of, antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, IV fluids, blood products, peritoneal dialysis, and chemotherapy treatment; obtaining of blood samples; and preparation for plasmapheresis and hemodialysis. Such fluid lines can be inserted at specific entry points in the internal juglar, subclavian, or femoral veins, or intraperitoneal. These fluid lines are implanted into the patient for either short-term need, like surgery, or for extended periods associated with more long-term treatment applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Fluid lines include stabilizing devices for the critical purpose of anchoring the fluid line to the subcutaneous tissues of the patient when surgically implanted. There are many approaches for anchoring the fluid line to the patient; one of the most common approaches is the placement of a Dacron® fiber cuff on the implanted fluid line inside the body of the patient to promote tissue ingrowth within the fiber cuff. Most often, the fiber cuff is affixed around the fluid line tube. The tissue ingrowth cuff seals the opening created by the surgical implantation of the fluid line, from within the patient's body and helps stop bleeding and prevent infection. Although Dacron® cuffs are explicitly identified above; the fiber cuff can be made of any other biocompatible material.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Implantation of a fluid line involves surgically creating a subcutaneous tunnel formed by a tunneling tool, such as a trocar, through the skin and into the blood vessel of the patient, and positioning the cuff below the surface of the skin in the subcutaneous tissue. After a period of time, the surrounding tissue grows into the fabric of the cuff such that the fluid line is stabilized at the surgical entry point. While such fabric cuffs are inexpensive to make and are generally effective at stabilizing the fluid line, they are also difficult to remove. A common eventuality is that each and every fluid line cuff will need to be carefully extracted from the subcutaneous tunnel to allow for cuffed fluid line extraction from the patient's body.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In order to remove a fluid line from the ingrown subcutaneous tissue as a result of a tunnel, the medical practitioner must free the cuff from the subcutaneous tissue by cutting around the cuff into the subcutaneous tissue surrounding all edges of the cuff into which the tissue has grown with a scalpel or other cutting devices. Tissue growth occurs substantially transverse to the longitudinal axis of the cuff and around the outer circumference of the cuff. In addition, tissue growth occurs at angles oblique to the longitudinal axis of the cuff along both of the cuff's side edges. The medical practitioner must cut around the circumference of the cuff and both side edges to completely free the cuff and the indwelling fluid line. This surgical procedure is both difficult and time-consuming and can also result in increased patient bleeding and infection risk if the entire cuffed fluid line is not removed successfully. The procedure can also contribute to an increased chance of scar tissue formation and build-up within the subcutaneous tissues, which increases the difficulty of the surgical implantation and tunneling of future cuffed fluid lines. Also, since the fabric cuffs are generally sized as to provide a snug fit in the subcutaneous tissue, frictional forces against the tunnel wall make extraction through the tunnel extremely difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There has been some effort to develop tools to make extraction of fluid lines with tissue ingrowth cuffs from patients easier. Such efforts can be seen in U.S. Patent Application No.'s 2006/0129134 A1 to Kerr, 2007/0185510 A1 to Tran, 2007/0244490 A1 to Moehle et. al., and U.S. Pat. No. 7,758,590 B2 to Daniele et. al. Despite the existence of such tools, there are still risks posed to patients undergoing these procedures, rendering improvements to fluid line extraction devices desirable and warranted. One such risk is the breaking or severing of the cuffed fluid line during extraction, which may require the medical practitioner to perform yet another surgical procedure to extract the severed distal portion of the cuffed fluid line that is left within the patient. This is caused in part due to the use of softer malleable materials, such as urethane and silicone in the production of fluid lines. Use of such materials in addition to the serrated and sharpened cutting edges of current tools increases the risk the fluid line will snap, break or become severed during the extraction procedure. Further, use of such materials also increases the risk the affixed cuff will result in the elongation of the fluid line tube and alter its dimensions while placing in traction. This stress placed on the proximal end of the fluid line during extraction from the tunnel is concentrated at the location of the cuff and can also lead to the snapping or breaking of the cuffed fluid line. Another risk to patients posed by the existing tools is the physical trauma caused to the skin and subcutaneous tissue due to the cumbersome nature and/or inferior cutting edge design. Use of existing tools for the extraction of cuffed fluid lines can result in patients sustaining unnecessary scaring, bruising and scar tissue formation. Lastly, existing tools are limited in their circumferential size and quality, often resulting in medical practitioners having to use the wrong size tool for the particular procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">With the foregoing in mind, a need exists for a removal method and device overcoming these shortcomings of the prior art. The present invention provides such an apparatus and associated method.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The subject invention is directed to a cuffed fluid-line extraction device for the extraction of tissue ingrowth cuffs and fluid lines from the body. The device includes a grip member located at the proximal end of the cylindrical cuffed fluid line extraction device, extending until adjacent to the cutting shaft member and a razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head at the distal end of the cutting shaft member. The grip member at the proximal end being spaced apart from the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head at the distal end by the grip member and cutting shaft member. An opening slit for insertion of the cuffed fluid line tube, in addition to a removal channel for receipt of a cuffed fluid line extends through and from the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head at the distal end to and through the grip member at the proximal end, passing through the cutting shaft member. The cuffed fluid-line extraction device includes a channel guide carried within the cuffed fluid line removal channel extending from the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head at the distal end, through the cutting shaft member and the grip member located at the proximal end, for supporting the cuffed fluid line during movement and manipulation of the grip member, allowing the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head to cut and dissect body tissue away from the tissue ingrowth cuff and fluid line for extraction of the cuffed fluid line from within the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">For extraction of a cuffed fluid line, with tissue ingrowth, the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth, cutting head at the distal end shall have a circumference greater than the circumference of the tissue ingrowth cuff on the cuffed fluid line. The opening slit of the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head, cutting shaft member and grip member shall be greater than the diameter of the fluid line tube for insertion of the fluid line tube and receipt of the cuffed fluid line in the cuffed fluid line removal channel extending from the razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head at the distal end through the cutting shaft member and the grip member located at the proximal end.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">More particularly, the distal end razor sharp “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head may be beveled or tapered inward or outward and the cutting head shall be sharp and smooth to facilitate the safe cutting and dissection of body tissue.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0045">The detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein and made with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, the descriptions disclosed herein should not be construed as limiting the embodiments set forth herein, rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in alternative embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0046">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 8C</figref>, a cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> is disclosed. The cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> is designed to cut or dissect the fibrous tissue from the tissue ingrown cuff <b>150</b> of a tunneled fluid line <b>140</b> in order to remove the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> and the fluid line <b>140</b> from the patient's body <b>130</b>. Through implementation of the present cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>, tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> and fluid line <b>140</b> extraction is capable of being performed in a more expeditious manner while dramatically reducing the risk of severing or puncturing the fluid line <b>140</b>, and at the same time reducing the physical trauma, in the form of excessive bleeding, bruising, scar tissue formation, scaring, or physical pain, sustained by the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0047">Those skilled in the art will appreciate the present invention may be used for the extraction of varied and numerous types of tissue ingrowth cuffs <b>150</b> and fluid lines <b>140</b> from both human and non-human bodies in different embodiments. By way of example, these fluid lines <b>140</b> can be used in the introduction of antibiotics, parenteral nutrition, IV fluids, blood products, peritoneal dialysis, and chemotherapy treatment; obtaining of blood samples; and preparation for plasmapheresis and hemodialysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0048">The cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> illustratively includes a cylindrical-shaped grip member <b>10</b>, at the proximal end of the device and a beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> at the distal end. In the present example, the exterior of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> grip member <b>10</b> has rigid gripping and knuckling exterior structures <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>′ to facilitate the medical practitioner's ability to grip and manipulate the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> by hand or instrument. The exterior gripping and knuckling structures <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>′ allow the medical practitioner to effectively and easily rotate the cuffed fluid line extraction device about the longitudinal axis <b>160</b> 360° in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions to circumferentially cut and separate the ingrown cuff <b>150</b> and fluid line <b>140</b> from the surrounding tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0049">The grip member <b>10</b> extends from its proximal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> towards the distal end of the grip member <b>10</b>, which is spaced apart from the proximal end and terminating at the grip member and cutting shaft retaining means <b>40</b>, here the cutting shaft member <b>20</b> is affixed into the interior surface of the grip member <b>10</b> by force fit, frictional or other retention means. The cutting shaft member <b>20</b> has a proximal end closest to the grip member <b>10</b> and a distal end spaced apart from the proximal end and terminating in a beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The cutting shaft member <b>20</b> is comprised of three separate and distinct connective support members <b>50</b> that are equidistantly spaced and extend from the proximal end of the cutting shaft member <b>20</b> to the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> located at the distal end of the cutting shaft member <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0050">The beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> at the distal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> and cutting shaft member <b>20</b> is comprised of a smooth and sharp beveled cutting head blade <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>′. There are two separate and distinct embodiments of the beveled cutting head blade <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>′ their use being depending on the extraction being performed by the medical practitioner. One embodiment is a beveled cutting head blade that tapers inwardly <b>120</b>; the other embodiment has a beveled cutting head blade tapering outwardly <b>120</b>′ from the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>. Both embodiments aid in the separation of tissue from the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>140</b> and the fluid line <b>150</b>. These beveled cutting head blades <b>120</b>,<b>120</b>′ permit the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> to be inserted into the patient's body <b>130</b>, around the fluid line <b>140</b> and tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>. The beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> located at the distal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> will preferably have a circumference greater than that of the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> to allow the entire tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> to be removed with the fluid line <b>140</b>. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, there will be varying beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> circumferences to correspond to the varying tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> dimensions. When inserted into the patient's body <b>130</b>, through rotational application of pressure, the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>, separates tissue from both the ingrown cuff <b>150</b> and the fluid line <b>140</b> utilizing the beveled cutting head blades <b>120</b>,<b>120</b>′.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0051">The cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> further comprises a small fluid line removal channel <b>90</b>; the channel extends from the proximal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>, through the grip member <b>10</b>, cutting shaft member <b>20</b>, and beveled, C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b>. The fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> terminates at the distal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> that is separated apart from the proximal end, at the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting edge head <b>30</b>. The fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> and opening slit <b>80</b> shall have openings that are at least slightly greater than the diameter of the fluid line <b>140</b> for insertion of the fluid line <b>140</b> through the opening slit <b>80</b> and receipt of the fluid line <b>140</b> in the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b>. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, there will be varying fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> and opening slit <b>80</b> widths to correspond to the varying fluid line <b>140</b> circumferential dimensions. In the present example, the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> further comprises a cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b>, within the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> for support and retention of the fluid line <b>140</b> during the manipulation and rotation of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>. The cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b> spans the length of the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> as seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The fluid line <b>140</b> rests against the cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b> and is retained in place by the grip member <b>10</b>, cutting shaft member <b>20</b>, and beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> being relatively encapsulated with the exception of the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> and opening slit <b>80</b>. Maintaining of the fluid line <b>140</b> within the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> and against the cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b> allows for the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> to remain centered on the tissue ingrown cuff <b>150</b> and the fluid line <b>140</b> when penetrating the patient's body <b>130</b>. In addition to the cuffed fluid line channel guide shown <b>100</b>, those skilled in the art will understand the ability of the cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b> to take other shapes or orientations.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0052">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, it is preferred that the fluid line <b>140</b> first be inserted through the opening slit <b>80</b> and into the fluid line removal channel <b>90</b> of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b>, assuring that the fluid line <b>140</b> travels against the cuffed fluid line channel guide <b>100</b> from the distal end through and out of the end of the grip member <b>10</b> at the proximal end. Next, the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> proceeds down the fluid line <b>140</b> towards the patient's body <b>130</b>. When the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> located at the distal end of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> makes contact with the exterior surface of the patient's body <b>130</b>, it is preferred that the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> be perpendicular in relation to the exterior of the patient's body <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0053">Once the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> has penetrated the patient's body shown in <figref>FIG. 8C</figref>, it is then manipulated by the medical practitioner by hand or instrument, in concert with application of some pressure in the direction of the patient's body <b>130</b>. This manipulation may be performed in many ways; however, it is preferred that rotational movement of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> is made in the clock-wise and counter-clockwise directions. The rotational movement of the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> may consist of several full 360° rotations, in either the clock-wise or counter-clockwise direction, around the fluid line <b>140</b> and/or tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>, and/or rotations in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction that are less than 360° around the fluid line <b>140</b> and/or ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>. Using the applied pressure and rotational circular motion, the sharp and beveled cutting head blades <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>′ of the “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> cuts, dissects and separates the tissue surrounding the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>, while reducing the risk of the severing or puncture of the fluid line <b>140</b> by the beveled cutting head blades <b>120</b>,<b>120</b>′. This allows the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> to penetrate further into the patient's body <b>130</b> and around the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> and/or fluid line <b>140</b> as seen in <figref>FIG. 8C</figref>. Once the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> cuts, dissects and separates the body tissue surrounding the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b> and/or the fluid line <b>140</b> and is around the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>, the fluid line <b>140</b> and the tissue ingrowth cuff <b>150</b>, are extracted together from the patient's body <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0054">The cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> is preferably made out of bio-compatible material such as bio-compatible metal or plastic for the cutting shaft member <b>20</b>, cutting shaft connective support sections <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>′, beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b>, and beveled cutting head blades <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>′, and grip member <b>10</b>. It is particularly advantageous to construct the cuffed fluid line extraction device <b>01</b> from bio-compatible plastic where appropriate in embodiments where the device <b>01</b> is intended for one use or a very limited number of uses.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0055">Turning to <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, an alternate embodiment, for the cutting shaft member <b>20</b>, is shown, comprised of a single, solid, partially enclosed, cutting section connective support member <b>50</b>′, extending from the distal end of the grip member <b>10</b> and retaining means <b>40</b> to the beveled, “C-shaped,” smooth cutting head <b>30</b> to provide additional structural support.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0056">While the preferred embodiments have been shown and described a particular configuration of cuffed fluid line extraction devices and methods for removing those devices, such embodiments are exemplary. While certain embodiments and details have been included herein for purposes of illustrating aspects of the present invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, which is defined, in part, in the appended claims. It is understood that there is no intent to limit the invention by such disclosure, but rather, it is intended to cover all modifications and alternate constructions falling within the spirit and scope of this invention. The words “including” and “having,” as used herein, including the claims, shall have the same meaning as the word “comprising.”</p>
