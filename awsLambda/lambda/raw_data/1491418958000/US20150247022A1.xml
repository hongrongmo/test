    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of precipitated silica, to novel precipitated silicas and to their applications, such as the reinforcement of polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It is known to employ reinforcing white fillers in polymers, in particular elastomers, such as, for example, precipitated silica.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The aim of the present invention is to provide in particular an alternative filler for polymer compositions which advantageously provides them with a reduction in their viscosity and an improvement in their dynamic properties, while retaining their mechanical properties. It thus advantageously makes possible an improvement in the hysteresis/reinforcement compromise.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention first of all provides a novel process for the preparation of precipitated silica employing, during or after the liquefaction operation, a particular polycarboxylic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Generally, the preparation of precipitated silica is carried out by a precipitation reaction of a silicate, such as an alkali metal silicate (for example sodium silicate), with an acidifying agent (for example sulfuric acid), then separation by filtration, with a filtration cake being obtained, of the precipitated silica obtained, subsequently liquefaction said filtration cake and, finally, drying (generally by atomization). The silica can be precipitated in any mode: in particular, addition of acidifying agent to a silicate vessel heel or total or partial simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and of silicate to a vessel heel of water or of silicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The subject matter of the invention is a novel process for the preparation of a precipitated silica, in which: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>at least one silicate is reacted with at least one acidifying agent, so as to obtain a suspension of precipitated silica,</li><li>the suspension of precipitated silica obtained is filtered, so as to obtain a filtration cake,</li><li>the filtration cake obtained on conclusion of the filtration is subjected to a liquefaction operation comprising the addition of an aluminum compound,</li><li>after the liquefaction operation, a drying stage is preferably carried out (generally by atomization), <br /> characterized in that methylglutaric acid is added to the filtration cake, during or after the liquefaction operation. </li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0011">According to the invention, the filtration cake is subjected to a liquefaction operation during which an aluminum compound and methylglutaric acid are introduced or after which methylglutaric acid is introduced. The mixture then obtained (suspension of precipitated silica) is preferably subsequently dried (generally by atomization).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0012">The liquefaction operation is a fluidification or liquefaction operation, in which the filtration cake is rendered liquid, the precipitated silica being re-encountered in suspension.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0013">In two first alternative forms of the invention, this liquefaction operation is carried out by subjecting the filtration cake to a chemical action by addition of an aluminum compound, for example sodium aluminate, and of methylglutaric acid, preferably coupled with a mechanical action (for example, by passing through a continuously stirred tank or through a mill of colloid type) which normally brings about a reduction in particle size of the suspended silica. The suspension (in particular aqueous suspension) obtained after liquefaction exhibits a relatively low viscosity.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0014">In the first alternative form, during the liquefaction operation, the aluminum compound and the methylglutaric acid are simultaneously added (coaddition) to the filtration cake.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0015">In the second alternative form, during the liquefaction operation, the aluminum compound is added to the filtration cake prior to the addition of the methylglutaric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0016">In a third (preferred) alternative form, this liquefaction operation is carried out by subjecting the filtration cake to a chemical action by addition of an aluminum compound, for example sodium aluminate, preferably coupled with a mechanical action (for example, by passing through a continuously stirred tank or through a mill of colloid type) which normally brings about a reduction in particle size of the suspended silica.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0017">In this third alternative form, methylglutaric acid is added after the liquefaction operation, that is to say, to the disintegrated silica cake.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0018">The filtration cake which has to be subjected to the liquefaction operation can be composed of the mixture of several filtration cakes, each of said cakes being obtained by filtration of a portion of the suspension of precipitated silica obtained above.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0019">According to the invention, the methylglutaric acid is preferably used without supplementary addition of another carboxylic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0020">The methylglutaric acid employed according to the invention can be in the anhydride, ester, alkali metal (for example sodium or potassium) salt (carboxylate) or ammonium salt (carboxylate) form.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0021">The methylglutaric acid used in the invention can optionally be preneutralized (in particular by pretreating it with a base, for example of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide type) before it is added to the filtration cake. This makes it possible in particular to modify the pH of the silica obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0022">The methylglutaric acid can be employed in the form of an aqueous solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0023">According to the invention, the aluminum compound is preferably chosen from alkali metal aluminates. In particular, the aluminum compound is sodium aluminate.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">According to the invention, the amount of aluminum compound (in particular sodium aluminate) used is generally such that the ratio of aluminum compound to amount of silica, expressed as SiO<sub>2</sub>, present in the filtration cake is between 0.20% and 0.50% by weight, preferably between 0.25% and 0.45% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">The amount of methylglutaric acid employed is in general such that the ratio of methylglutaric acid to amount of silica, expressed as SiO<sub>2</sub>, present in the filtration cake (at the time of the addition of the methylglutaric acid) is between 0.75% and 2% by weight, preferably between 1% and 1.75% by weight, in particular between 1.1% and 1.5% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">In the invention, the filtration cake can optionally be washed.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">The precipitated silica thus obtained after the liquefaction operation is subsequently dried. This drying operation can be carried out by any means known per se.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">Preferably, the drying operation is carried out by atomization. To this end, use may be made of any type of suitable atomizer, in particular a rotary, nozzle, liquid pressure or two-fluid atomizer. In general, when the filtration is carried out using a filter press, a nozzle atomizer is used and, when the filtration is carried out using a vacuum filter, a rotary atomizer is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0029">When the drying operation is carried out using a nozzle atomizer, the precipitated silica capable of then being obtained usually exists in the form of substantially spherical beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0030">On conclusion of this drying operation, it is optionally possible to carry out a stage of milling the product recovered; the precipitated silica capable of then being obtained generally exists in the form of a powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0031">When the drying operation is carried out using a rotary atomizer, the silica capable of then being obtained can exist in the form of a powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0032">Finally, the product, dried (in particular by a rotary atomizer) or milled as indicated above, can optionally be subjected to an agglomeration stage which comprises, for example, a direct compression, a wet granulation (that is to say, with the use of a binder, such as water, silica suspension, and the like), an extrusion or, preferably, a dry compacting. When the latter technique is employed, it can prove to be opportune, before carrying out the compacting, to deaerate (operation also referred to as predensifying or degassing) the pulverulent products so as to remove the air included in the latter and to provide more uniform compacting.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0033">The precipitated silica capable of then being obtained by this agglomeration stage generally exists in the form of granules.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0034">Another subject matter of the present invention is a specific process for the preparation of a precipitated silica of the type comprising the precipitation reaction between a silicate and an acidifying agent, whereby a suspension of precipitated silica is obtained, followed by the separation and the drying of this suspension, characterized in that it comprises the following successive stages: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>the precipitation reaction is carried out in the following way:         <ul id="ul-00005-en" list-style="none"><li>(i) an initial vessel heel comprising at least a portion of the total amount of the silicate involved in the reaction and an electrolyte is formed, the concentration of silicate (expressed as SiO<sub>2</sub>) in said initial vessel heel being less than 100 g/l and, preferably, the concentration of electrolyte in said initial vessel heel being less than 19 g/l,</li><li>(ii) the acidifying agent is added to said vessel heel until a pH value for the reaction medium of at least 7.0, in particular of between 7 and 8.5, is obtained,</li><li>(iii) acidifying agent and, if appropriate, simultaneously the remaining amount of silicate is/are added to the reaction medium,</li></ul></li><li>the silica suspension obtained is filtered,</li><li>the filtration cake obtained on conclusion of the filtration is subjected to a liquefaction operation comprising the addition of an aluminum compound,</li><li>the filtration cake thus obtained, preferably exhibiting a solids content of at most 25% by weight, is dried, <br /> said process being characterized in that methylglutaric acid is added to the filtration cake, either during the liquefaction operation, or after the liquefaction operation and before the drying stage. </li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0042">That which is indicated in the above account on the subject of the liquefaction operation, of the addition of the methylglutaric acid and of the three alternative forms of the process applies to the present process according to the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0043">The choice of the acidifying agent and of the silicate is made in a way well known per se.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0044">Use is generally made, as acidifying agent, of a strong inorganic acid, such as sulfuric acid, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, or also of an organic acid, such as acetic acid, formic acid or carbonic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0045">The acidifying agent can be dilute or concentrated; its normality can be between 0.4 and 36N, for example between 0.6 and 1.5N.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0046">In particular, in the case where the acidifying agent is sulfuric acid, its concentration can be between 40 and 180 g/l, for example between 60 and 130 g/l.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0047">Use may be made, as silicate, of any common form of silicates, such as metasilicates, disilicates and advantageously an alkali metal silicate, in particular sodium or potassium silicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0048">The silicate can exhibit a concentration (expressed as SiO<sub>2</sub>) of between 40 and 330 g/l, for example between 60 and 300 g/l.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0049">Preferably, use is made, as silicate, of sodium silicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0050">In the case where use is made of sodium silicate, the latter generally exhibits an SiO<sub>2</sub>/Na<sub>2</sub>O ratio by weight of between 2 and 4, in particular between 2.4 and 3.9, for example between 3.1 and 3.8.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0051">During stage (i), a vessel heel is formed which comprises silicate and an electrolyte. The amount of silicate present in the initial vessel heel advantageously represents only a portion of the total amount of silicate involved in the reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0052">As regards the electrolyte present in the initial vessel heel (stage (i)), this term is understood here as normally accepted, that is to say that it means any ionic or molecular substance which, when it is in solution, decomposes or dissociates to form ions or charged particles; mention may be made, as electrolyte, of a salt of the group of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, in particular the salt of the starting silicate metal and of the acidifying agent, for example sodium chloride in the case of the reaction of a sodium silicate with hydrochloric acid or, preferably, sodium sulfate in the case of the reaction of a sodium silicate with sulfuric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0053">According to one characteristic of this preparation process, the concentration of electrolyte in the initial vessel heel is less than 19 g/l, in particular less than 18 g/l, especially less than 17 g/l, for example less than 15 g/l (while generally being greater than 6 g/l).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0054">According to another characteristic of this process, the concentration of silicate (expressed as SiO<sub>2</sub>) in the initial vessel heel is less than 100 g/l. Preferably, this concentration is less than 80 g/l, in particular than 70 g/l. In particular, when the acid used for the neutralization exhibits a high concentration, in particular of greater than 70%, it is then advisable to work with an initial vessel heel of silicate, the SiO<sub>2 </sub>concentration of which is less than 80 g/l.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0055">The addition of acidifying agent in stage (ii) leads to a correlating fall in the pH of the reaction medium and is carried out until a value for the pH of the reaction medium of at least 7, in particular of between 7 and 8.5, for example of between 7.5 and 8.5, is reached.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0056">Once the desired pH value has been reached, and in the case of a starting vessel heel comprising only a portion of the total amount of the silicate involved, a simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and of the remaining amount of silicate is then advantageously carried out in stage (iii).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0057">This simultaneous addition is generally carried out in such a way that the value of the pH of the reaction medium is always equal (to within Â±0.1) to that reached on conclusion of stage (ii).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0058">On conclusion of stage (iii) and in particular after the abovementioned simultaneous addition, a maturing of the reaction medium (aqueous suspension) obtained can be carried out, at the pH obtained on conclusion of stage (iii), in general with stirring, for example for 2 to 45 minutes, in particular for 3 to 30 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0059">Finally, it is possible, both in the case of a starting vessel heel comprising only a portion of the total amount of silicate involved and in the case of a starting vessel heel comprising the total amount of silicate involved, after the precipitation, in an optional subsequent stage, to add an additional amount of acidifying agent to the reaction medium. This addition is generally carried out until a pH value of between 3 and 6.5, preferably between 4 and 6.5, is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0060">The temperature of the reaction medium is generally between 75 and 97Â° C., preferably between 80 and 96Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0061">According to an alternative form of this preparation process, the reaction is carried out at a constant temperature of between 75 and 97Â° C. According to another alternative form of this process, the temperature at the end of the reaction is higher than the temperature at the start of the reaction: thus, the temperature at the start of the reaction is preferably maintained between 75 and 90Â° C.; then, the temperature is increased in a few minutes, preferably up to a value of between 90 and 97Â° C., at which it is maintained until the end of the reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0062">On conclusion of the stages which have just been described, a silica slurry is obtained, which slurry is subsequently separated (liquid/solid separation). This separation normally comprises a filtration, followed, if necessary, by a washing operation, carried out by means of any suitable method, for example by means of a belt filter, a vacuum filter or, preferably, a filter press.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0063">The filtration cake is then subjected to a liquefaction operation comprising the addition of an aluminum compound. In accordance with the above account, methylglutaric acid is added during or after the liquefaction operation. According to the preferred alternative form, the methylglutaric acid is added to the disintegrated filtration cake after the liquefaction operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0064">The disintegrated filtration cake is subsequently dried.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0065">Preferably, in this preparation process, the suspension of precipitated silica obtained after the liquefaction operation should exhibit, immediately before it is dried, a solids content of at most 25% by weight, in particular of at most 24% by weight, especially of at most 23% by weight, for example of at most 22% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0066">This drying operation can be carried out according to any means known per se. Preferably, the drying operation is carried out by atomization. To this end, use may be made of any type of suitable atomizer, in particular a rotary, nozzle, liquid pressure or two-fluid atomizer. In general, when the filtration is carried out using a filter press, a nozzle atomizer is used and, when the filtration is carried out using a vacuum filter, a rotary atomizer is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0067">When the drying operation is carried out using a nozzle atomizer, the precipitated silica capable of then being obtained usually exists in the form of substantially spherical beads. On conclusion of this drying operation, it is optionally possible to carry out a stage of milling the product recovered; the precipitated silica capable of then being obtained generally exists in the form of a powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0068">When the drying operation is carried out using a rotary atomizer, the precipitated silica capable of then being obtained can exist in the form of a powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0069">Finally, the dried (in particular by a rotary atomizer) or milled product as indicated above can optionally be subjected to an agglomeration stage, which consists, for example, of a direct compression, a wet granulation (that is to say, with use of a binder, such as water, silica suspension, and the like), an extrusion or, preferably, a dry compacting. When the latter technique is employed, it can prove to be opportune, before carrying out the compacting, to deaerate (operation also referred to as predensifying or degassing) the pulverulent products so as to remove the air included in the latter and to provide more uniform compacting.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0070">The precipitated silica capable of then being obtained by this agglomeration stage generally exists in the form of granules.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0071">The invention also relates to the precipitated silicas obtained or capable of being obtained by the process according to the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0072">In general, these precipitated silicas exhibit, at their surface, molecules of methylglutaric acid and/or of carboxylate corresponding to the methylglutaric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0073">An additional subject matter of the present invention is a precipitated silica with the specific characteristics, which can be used in particular as alternative filler for polymer compositions, advantageously providing them with a reduction in their viscosity and an improvement in their dynamic properties, while retaining their mechanical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0074">In the account which follows, the BET specific surface is determined according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method described in The Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 60, page 309, February 1938, and corresponding to the standard NF ISO 5794-1, Appendix D (June 2010). The CTAB specific surface is the external surface, which can be determined according to the standard NF ISO 5794-1, Appendix G (June 2010).</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0075">The content of polycarboxylic acid+corresponding carboxylate denoted (C), expressed as total carbon, can be measured using a carbon/sulfur analyzer, such as the Horiba EMIA 320 V2. The principle of the carbon/sulfur analyzer is based on the combustion of a solid sample in a stream of oxygen in an induction furnace (adjusted to approximately 170 mA) and in the presence of combustion accelerators (approximately 2 grams of tungsten (in particular Lecocel 763-266) and approximately 1 gram of iron). The analysis lasts approximately 1 minute.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0076">The carbon present in the sample to be analyzed (weight of approximately 0.2 gram) combines with the oxygen to form CO<sub>2</sub>, CO. These decompression gases are subsequently analyzed by an infrared detector.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0077">The moisture from the sample and the water produced during these oxidation reactions is removed by passing over a cartridge comprising a dehydrating agent (magnesium perchlorate) in order not to interfere with the infrared measurement.</p>

The intensity of this line is proportional to the aluminum content. It is possible to employ a precalibration carried out using another measurement method, such as ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy).</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0082">The aluminum content can also be measured by any other suitable method, for example by ICP-AES after dissolving in water in the presence of hydrofluoric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0083">The presence of methylglutaric acid in the acid form and/or in the carboxylate form can be established by surface infrared or diamond-ATR (Attenuated Total Reflection) Infrared.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0084">The surface infrared analysis (by transmission) is carried out on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer on a pellet of pure product.

The weight of the pellet is between 10 and 20 mg. The pellet thus obtained is placed in the high vacuum chamber (10<sup>â7 </sup>mbar) of the spectrometer for one hour at ambient temperature before the analysis by transmission.

In this instance, the stationary phase in the column is replaced by the (solid) material to be analyzed, in this instance the precipitated silica. With regard to the mobile phase, it consists of the carrier gas (helium) and of the âprobeâ molecules chosen as a function of their interaction capability. The measurements are successively carried out with each probe molecule. For each measurement, each probe molecule is injected into the column, in a very small amount (infinite dilution), as a mixture with methane. The methane is used to determine the t<b>0</b>, the dead time of the column.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0094">The subtraction of this dead time t<b>0</b> from the retention time of the injected probe results in the net retention time (t<sub>N</sub>) of the latter.</p>

Physically, t<sub>N </sub>corresponds to the mean time which the probe molecule has spent in contact with the stationary phase (the solid analyzed). For each probe molecule injected, three net retention times t<sub>N </sub>are measured. The mean value and the corresponding standard deviation are used to determine the specific retention volumes (V<sub>g</sub><sup>0</sup>) on the basis of the following relationship (formula [1]).</p>

      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0195">Process for the preparation of the elastomeric compositions:</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0196">The process for the preparation of the rubber compositions is carried out in two successive preparation phases. A first phase consists of a phase of high-temperature thermomechanical working. It is followed by a second phase of mechanical working at temperatures of less than 110Â° C. This phase makes possible the introduction of the vulcanization system.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0197">The first phase is carried out using a mixing device, of internal mixer type, of Thermofischer Haake brand (capacity of 380 ml). The filling coefficient is 0.6. The initial temperature and the speed of the rotors are set on each occasion so as to achieve mixture dropping temperatures of approximately 140-160Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0198">Broken down here into two passes, the first phase makes it possible to incorporate, in a first pass, the elastomers and then the reinforcing filler (introduction in installments) with the coupling agent and the stearic acid. For this pass, the duration is between 4 and 10 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0199">After cooling the mixture (temperature of less than 100Â° C.), a second pass makes it possible to incorporate the zinc oxide and the protecting agents/antioxidants (in particular 6-PPD). The duration of this pass is between 2 and 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0200">After cooling the mixture (temperature of less than 100Â° C.), the second phase makes possible the introduction of the vulcanization system (sulfur and accelerators, such as CBS). It is carried out on an open mill, preheated to 50Â° C. The duration of this phase is between 2 and 6 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0201">Each final mixture is subsequently calandered in the form of plaques with a thickness of 2-3 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0202">With regard to these ârawâ mixtures obtained, an evaluation of their rheological properties makes it possible to optimize the vulcanization time and the vulcanization temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0203">Subsequently, the mechanical and dynamic properties of the mixtures vulcanized at the curing optimum (T98) are measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0204">Rheological Properties</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0205">Viscosity of the Raw Mixtures:</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0206">The Mooney consistency is measured on the compositions in the raw state at 100Â° C. using an MV 2000 rheometer and also the determination of the Mooney stress-relaxation rate according to the standard NF ISO 289.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0207">The value of the torque, read at the end of 4 minutes after preheating for one minute (Mooney Large (1+4)âat 100Â° C.), is shown in table II. The test is carried out after preparing the raw mixtures and then after aging for 3 weeks at a temperature of 23+/â3Â° C.</p>
