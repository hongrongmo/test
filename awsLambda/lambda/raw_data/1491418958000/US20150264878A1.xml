      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of soybean cultivar breeding and development. The present invention particularly relates to the soybean cultivar WN1116094-1 and its progeny, and methods of making.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Soybean <i>Glycine max </i>(L) is an important oil seed crop and a valuable field crop. However, it began as a wild plant. This plant and a number of other plants have been developed into valuable agricultural crops through years of breeding and development. The pace of the development of soybeans, into an animal foodstuff and as an oil seed has dramatically increased in the last one hundred years. Planned programs of soybean breeding have increased the growth, yield and environmental hardiness of the soybean germplasm.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Due to the sexual reproduction traits of the soybean, the plant is basically self-pollinating. A self-pollinating plant permits pollen from one flower to be transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. Cross-pollination occurs when the flower is pollinated with pollen from a different plant; however, soybean cross-pollination is a rare occurrence in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Thus the growth and development of new soybean germplasm requires intervention by the breeder into the pollination of the soybean. The breeders' methods of intervening depends on the type of trait that is being bred. Soybeans are developed for a number of different types of traits morphological (form and structure), phenotypical, or for traits like growth, day length, temperature requirements, initiation date of floral or reproductive development, fatty acid content, insect resistance, disease resistance, nematode resistance, fungal resistance, herbicide resistance, tolerance to various environmental factors like drought, heat, wet, cold, wind, adverse soil condition and also for yield. The genetic complexity of the trait often drives the selection of the breeding method.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Due to the number of genes within each chromosome, millions of genetic combinations exist in the breeders' experimental soybean material. This genetic diversity is so vast that a breeder cannot produce the same two cultivars twice using the exact same starting parental material. Thus, developing a single variety of useful commercial soybean germplasm is highly unpredictable, and requires intensive research and development.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The development of new soybeans comes through breeding techniques, such as: recurrent selection, mass selections, backcrossing, single seed descent and multiple seed procedure. Additionally, marker assisted breeding allows more accurate movement of desired alleles or even specific genes or sections of chromosomes to be moved within the germplasm that the breeder is developing. RFLP, RAPD, AFLP, SSR, SNP, SCAR, isozymes, are some of the forms of markers that can be employed in breeding soybeans or in moving traits into soybean germplasm. Other breeding methods are known and are described in various plant breeding or soybean textbooks.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">When a soybean variety is being employed to develop a new soybean variety or an improved variety the selection methods may include backcrossing, pedigree breeding, recurrent selection, marker assisted selection, modified selection and mass selection or a combination of these methods. The efficiency of the breeding procedure along with the goal of the breeding are the factors for determining which selection techniques are employed. A breeder continuously evaluates the success of the breeding program and therefore the efficiency of any breeding procedures. The success is usually measured by yield increase, commercial appeal and environmental adaptability of the developed germplasm.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The development of new soybean cultivars most often requires the development of hybrid crosses (some exceptions being initial development of mutants directly through the use of the mutating agent, certain materials introgressed by markers, or transformants made directly through transformation methods) and the selection of progeny. Hybrids can be achieved by manual manipulation of the sexual organs of the soybean or by the use of male sterility systems. Breeders often try to identify true hybrids by a readily identifiable trait or the visual differences between inbred and hybrid material. These heterozygous hybrids are then selected and repeatedly selfed and reselected to form new homozygous soybean lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Mass and recurrent selection can be used to improve populations. Several parents are intercrossed and plants are selected based on selected characteristics like superior yield or excellent progeny resistance. Outcrossing to a number of different parents creates fairly heterozygous breeding populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Pedigree breeding is commonly used with two parents that possess favorable, complementary traits. The parents are crossed to form a F1 hybrid. The progeny of the F1 hybrid is selected and the best individual F2s are selected; this selection process is repeated in the F3 and F4 generations. The inbreeding is carried forward and at approximately F5-F7 the best lines are selected and tested in the development stage for potential usefulness in a selected geographic area.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In backcross breeding a genetic allele or loci is often transferred into a desirable homozygous recurrent parent. The trait from the donor parent is tracked into the recurrent parent. The resultant plant is bred to be like the recurrent parent with the new desired allele or loci.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The single-seed descent method involves use of a segregating plant population for harvest of one seed per plant. Each seed sample is planted and the next generation is formed. When the F2 lines are advanced to approximately F6 or so, each plant will be derived from a different F2. The population will decline due to failure of some seeds, so not all F2 plants will be represented in the progeny.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">New varieties must be tested thoroughly to compare their development with commercially available soybeans. This testing usually requires at least two years and up to six years of comparisons with other commercial soybeans. Varieties that lack the entire desirable package of traits can be used as parents in new populations for further selection or are simply discarded. The breeding and associated testing process is 8 to 12 years' of work prior to development of a new variety. Thousands of varietal lines are produced but only a few lines are selected in each step of the process. Thus the breeding system is like a funnel with numerous lines and selections in the first few years and fewer and fewer lines in the middle years until one line is selected for the final development testing.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The selected line or variety will be evaluated for its growth, development and yield. These traits of a soybean are a result of the variety's genetic potential interacting with its environment. All varieties have a maximum yield potential that is predetermined by its genetics. This hypothetical potential for yield is only obtained when the environmental conditions are near perfect. Since perfect growth conditions do not exist, field experimentation is necessary to provide the environmental influence and to measure its effect on the development and yield of the soybean. The breeder attempts to select for an elevated soybean yield potential under a number of different environmental conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Selecting for good soybean yield potential in different environmental conditions is a process that requires planning based on the analysis of data in a number of seasons. Identification of the varieties carrying a superior combination of traits, which will give consistent yield potential, is a complex science. The desirable genotypic traits in the variety can often be masked by other plant traits, unusual weather patterns, diseases, and insect damage. One widely employed method of identifying a superior plant with such genotypic traits is to observe its performance relative to commercial and experimental plants in replicated studies. These types of studies give more certainty to the genetic potential and usefulness of the plant across a number of environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In summary, the goal of the soybean plant breeder is to produce new and unique soybeans and progeny of the soybeans for farmers' commercial crop production. To accomplish this, the plant breeder painstakingly crosses two or more varieties or germplasm. Then the results of this cross are repeatedly selfed or backcrossed to produce new genetic patterns. Newer avenues for producing new and unique genetic alleles in soybeans include introducing (or creating) mutations or transgenes into the genetic material of the soybean are now in practice in the breeding industry. These genetic alleles can alter pest resistance such as disease resistance, insect resistance, nematode resistance, herbicide resistance, or they can alter the plant's environmental tolerances, or its seeds fatty acid compositions, the amount of oil produced, and/or the amino acid/protein compositions of the soybean plant or its seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The traits a breeder selects for when developing new soybeans are driven by the ultimate goal of the end user of the product. Thus if the goal of the end user is to resist a certain plant disease so overall more yield is achieved, then the breeder drives the introduction of genetic alleles and their selection based on disease resistant levels shown by the plant. On the other hand, if the goal is to produce specific fatty acid composition, with for example a high level of oleic acid and/or a lower level of linolenic acid, then the breeder may drive the selection of genetic alleles/genes based on inclusion of mutations or transgenes that alter the levels of fatty acids in the seed. Reaching this goal may allow for the acceptance of some lesser yield potential or other less desirable agronomic trait.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The new genetic alleles being introduced in to soybeans are widening the potential uses and markets for the various products and by-products of the oil from the seed plants such as soybean. A major product extracted from soybeans is the oil in the seed. Soybean oil is employed in a number of retail products such as cooking oil, baked goods, margarines and the like. Another useful product is soybean meal, which is a component of many foods and animal feedstuffs.</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0042">Stem Canker (Southern) (DPM_R) Greenhouse screen to identify vertical (gene) type of resistance. One week old soybean seedlings are inoculated with the stem canker pathogen by opening up a small slit into the hypocotyl and depositing a small drop of the fungal suspension. The inoculated seedlings are then placed into a moisture chamber. When the seedlings of the known checks have collapsed, disease severity rating are given on a 1-9 score. One being the best.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0043">Stem canker (Southern) tolerance (DPMTR) Field nursery. The objective of this test is to evaluate the Field Resistance/Tolerance of soybean lines under field conditions. This is necessary due to the fact that of the four known genes that convey vertical type of resistance to stem canker, one gene (Rdc4 from the variety Dowling), exhibits a 40-50% plant kill (false positive) when screened in the greenhouse using the hypocotyl inoculation technique. Lines that scored a rating of 4-9 in the greenhouse are planted in the field. They are sprayed at least 5 times during their first month of development with a spore suspension containing the stem canker fungus. With the inclusion of very susceptible stem canker checks, we are able to identify horizontal (field resistance/tolerance) resistance in certain lines. Quite often, lines scoring a 9 in the greenhouse, rate a score of 1 in the field due to either having the Rdc4 gene or having good field resistance/tolerance. Disease severity scores are once again given on a 1-9 scale when the plants have reached the R6 growth stage of plant development. One being the best.</p>

The disease appears mainly in the reproductive growth stages (R2-R6) of soybeans. Normal diagnostics are distinctive scattered, intervienal chlorotic spots on the leaves. Yield losses may be total or severe in infected fields. The Sudden Death Syndrome Rating is both a field nursery and an opportunistic field rating. It is based on leaf area affected as defined by the Southern Illinois University method of SDS scoring. The scale used for these tests is 1-9. A one rating is best.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0046">

Yield losses may be total or severe in infected fields. <i>Sclerotinia </i>White Mold (SCL_R) rating is a field rating (1-9 scale) based on the percentage of wilting or dead plants in a plot. A one rating is the best.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0047">Frog Eye Leaf Spot (FELSR) This is caused by the fungal pathogen <i>Cercospora sojina</i>. The fungus survives as mycelium in infected seeds and in infested debris. With adequate moisture new leaves become infected as they develop until all the leaves are infected. Yield losses may be up to 15% in severe infected fields. Frog Eye Leaf Spot (FELSR) rating is a field rating (1-9 scale) based on the percentage of leaf area affected. The scale is 1-9 where 1=no leaf symptoms and 9=severe leaf symptoms. One is the best rating. To test varieties for Frog Eye Leaf Spot a disease nursery is artificially inoculated with spores. The ratings are done when the plants have reached the R5-R6 growth stage. Visual calibration is done with leaf photos of different frogeye severity ratings as used by the University of Tennessee and Dr. Melvin Newman, State Plant Pathologist for TN.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0048">Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN) The Soybean Cyst Nematode <i>Heterodera glycines</i>, is a small plant-parasitic roundworm that attacks the roots of soybeans. Soybean Cyst Nematode Ratings are taken from a 30 day greenhouse screen using cyst infested soil. The rating scale is based upon female reproduction index (FI %) on a susceptible check set ((female reproduction on a specific line/female reproduction on Susceptible check)*100) where &lt;10%=R (RESISTANT); &gt;10%-&lt;30%=MR (MODERATELY RESISTANT); &gt;30%-&lt;60%=MS (MODERATELY SUSPECTIBLE); &gt;60%=S (SUSPECTIBLE). The screening races include: 1, 3, 5, 14. Individual ratings CN1_P, CN3_P, CN5_P, and CN14_P refer to the resistance to SCN races 1, 3, 5 and 14 FI % respectively.</p>

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0079">The plant development staging system employed in the testing of this invention divides stages as vegetative (V) and reproductive (R). This system accurately identifies the stages of any soybean plant. However, all plants in a given field will not be in the stage at the same time. Therefore, each specific V or R stage is defined as existing when 50% or more of the plants in the field are in or beyond that stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0080">The first two stages of V are designated a VE (emergence) and VC (cotyledon stage). Subdivisions of the V stages are then designated numerically as V1, V2, V3 through V (n). The last V stage is designated as V (n), where (n) represents the number for the last node stage of the specific variety. The (n) will vary with variety and environment. The eight subdivisions of the reproductive stages (R) states are also designated numerically. R1=beginning bloom; R2=full bloom; R3=beginning pod; R4=full pod; R5=beginning seed; R6=full seed; R7=beginning maturity; R8=full maturity.</p>

Traits measured may include yield, maturity, lodging, plant height, branching, field emergence, and shatter. The results of the comparison are presented in the table below. The number of tests in which the varieties were compared is shown with the environments, mean and standard deviation for some traits.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">The present invention WN1116094-1 can carry genetic engineered recombinant genetic material to give improved traits or qualities to the soybean. For example, but not limited to, the present invention can carry the glyphosate resistance gene for herbicide resistance as taught in the Monsanto patents (WO92/00377, WO92/04449, U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,642 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,312,910) or STS mutation for herbicide resistance. Additional traits carried in transgenes or mutation can be transferred into the present invention. Some of these genes include genes that give disease resistance to <i>sclerotinia </i>such as the oxalate oxidase (Ox Ox) gene as taught in PCT/FR92/00195 Rhone Polunc and/or an oxalate decarboxylase gene for disease resistance or genes designed to alter the soybean oil within the seed such as desaturase, thioesterase genes (shown in EP0472722, U.S. Pat. No. 5,344,771) or genes designed to alter the soybean's amino acid characteristics. This line can be crossed with another soybean line which carries a gene that acts to provide herbicide resistance or alter the saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acid content of the oil within the seed, or the amino acid profile of the seed. Thus through transformation or backcrossing of the present invention with a transgenic line carrying the desired event, the present invention further comprise a new transgenic event that is heritable.

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">The present invention can also carry herbicide tolerance where the tolerance is conferred to an herbicide selected from the group consisting of glyphosate, glufosinate, acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitors, phytoene desaturase (PDS) inhibitors, photosystem II (PSII) inhibitors, dicamba and 2,4-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0089">This invention also is directed to methods for producing a new soybean plant by crossing a first parent plant with a second parent plant wherein the first or second parent plant is the present invention. Additionally, the present invention may be used in the variety development process to derive progeny in a breeding population or crossing. Further, both first and second parent plants can be or be derived from the soybean line WN1116094-1. A variety of breeding methods can be selected depending on the mode of reproduction, the trait, the condition of the germplasm. Thus, any such methods using the WN1116094-1 are part of this invention: selfing, backcrosses, recurrent selection, mass selection and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0090">The scope of the present invention includes use of marker methods. In addition to phenotypic observations, the genotype of a plant can also be examined. There are many techniques or methods known which are available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant's genotype and for understanding the pedigree of the present invention and identifying plants that have the present invention as an ancestor; among these are Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0091">A backcross conversion, transgene, or genetic sterility factor, may be in an embodiment of the present invention. Markers can be useful in their development, such that the present invention comprising backcross conversion(s), transgene(s), or genetic sterility factor(s), and are identified by having a molecular marker profile with a high percent identity such as 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 99.9% identical to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0092">These embodiments may be detected using measurements by either percent identity or percent similarity to the deposited material. These markers may detect progeny plants identifiable by having a molecular marker profile of at least 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 99.5% genetic contribution from an embodiment of the present soybean variety. Such progeny may be further characterized as being within a pedigree distance of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 or more cross-pollinations to a soybean plant other than the present invention or a plant that has the present invention as a progenitor. Molecular profiles may be identified with SNP, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, or other tools also.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0093">Traits are average values for all trial locations, across all years in which the data was taken. In addition to the visual traits that are taken, the genetic characteristic of the plant can also be characterised by its genetic marker profile. The profile can interpret or predict the pedigree of the line, the relation to another variety, determine the accuracy of a listed breeding strategy, or invalidate a suggested pedigree. Soybean linkage maps were known by 1999 as evidenced in Cregan et. al, âAn Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean Genomeâ Crop Science 39:1464 1490 (1999); and using markers to determine pedigree claims was discussed by Berry et al., in âAssessing Probability of Ancestry Using Simple Sequence Repeat Profiles: Applications to Maize Inbred Lines and Soybean Varietiesâ Genetics 165:331 342 (2003), each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Markers include but are not limited to Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites, and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). There are known sets of public markers that are being examined by ASTA and other industry groups for their applicability in standardizing determinations of what constitutes an essentially derived variety under the US Plant Variety Protection Act. However, these standard markers do not limit the type of marker and marker profile which can be employed in breeding or developing backcross conversions, or in distinguishing varieties or plant parts or plant cells, or verify a progeny pedigree. Primers and PCR protocols for assaying these and other markers are disclosed in the Soybase (sponsored by the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Iowa State University) located at the world wide web at 129.186.26.94/SSR.html.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0094">Additionally, these markers such as SSRs, RFLP's, SNPs, Ests, AFLPs, gene primers, and the like can be developed and employed to identify genetic alleles which have an association with a desired trait. The allele can be used in a marker assisted breeding program to move traits (native, nonnative (from a different species), or transgenes) into the present invention. The value of markers includes allowing the introgression of the allele(s)/trait(s) into the desired germplasm with little to no superfluous germplasm being dragged from the allele/trait donor plant into the present invention. This results in formation of the present invention for example, cyst nematode resistance, brown stem rot resistance, aphid resistance, <i>Phytophthora </i>resistance, IDC resistance, BT genes, male sterility genes, glyphosate tolerance genes, Dicamba tolerance, HPPD tolerance, rust tolerance, Asian Rust tolerance, fungal tolerance, or drought tolerance genes. Additionally, the invention through transgenes, or if a native trait through markers or backcross breeding, can include a polynucleotide encoding phytase, FAD-2, FAD-3, galactinol synthase or a raffinose synthetic enzyme; or a polynucleotide conferring resistance to soybean cyst nematode, brown stem rot, <i>phytophthora </i>root rot, or sudden death syndrome or resistance, tolerance to FUNGAL DISEASES such as: <i>Alternaria </i>spp., <i>Agrobacterium rhizogenes, Calonectria crotalariae, Cercospora kikuchii, Cercospora sojina, Choanephora infundibulifera, Colletotrichum </i>spp., <i>Corynespora cassiicola, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Dactuliochaeta glycines, Diaporthe phaseolorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Macrophomina phaseolina, Microsphaera difusa, Peronospora manshurica, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, Phialophora gregata, Phomopsis phaseolorum, Phyllosticta sojicola, Phytophthora sojae, Pseudomonas syringae, Pythium </i>spp., <i>Rhizoctonia solana, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Septoria glycines, Sphaceloma glycines, Thielaviopsis basicota</i>; or tolerance to BACTERIAL and VIRAL DISEASES such as: <i>Xanthomonas campestres</i>, Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV), Peanut Mottle Virus (PMV), Tobacco Streak Virus (TSV), Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV), Black Gram Mottle Virus (BGMV), Cowpea Mild Mottle Virus (CMMV), Cowpea Severe Mosaic Virus (CSMV), Indonesian Soybean Dwarf Virus (ISDV), Mung Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV), Peanut Stripe Virus (VPMM), Soybean Chlorotic Mottle Virus, Soybean Crinkle Leaf Virus, Soybean Yellow Vein Virus (SYVV), Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV); NEMATODES such as: <i>Belonolaimus gracilis, Meloidogyne </i>spp, <i>Rotylenchulus reniformis, Pratylenchus </i>spp., <i>Hoplolaimus sulumbus, Heterodera schachtii. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0095">Many traits have been identified that are not regularly selected for in the development of a new cultivar. Using materials and methods well known to those persons skilled in the art, traits that are capable of being transferred, to cultivar of the present invention include, but are not limited to, herbicide tolerance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, nematode resistance, insect resistance, enhanced nutritional quality, such as oil, starch and protein content or quality, improved performance in an industrial process, altered reproductive capability, such as male sterility or male/female fertility, yield stability and yield enhancement. Other traits include the production of commercially valuable enzymes or metabolites within the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0096">A transgene typically comprises a nucleotide sequence whose expression is responsible or contributes to the trait, under the control of a promoter capable of directing the expression of the nucleotide sequence at the desired time in the desired tissue or part of the plant. Constitutive, tissue-specific or inducible promoters are well known in the art and have different purposes and each could be employed. The transgene(s) may also comprise other regulatory elements such as for example translation enhancers or termination signals. The transgene may be adapted to be transcribed and translated into a protein, or to encode RNA in a sense or antisense orientation such that it is not translated or only partially translated.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0097">Transgenes may be directly introduced into the cultivar using genetic engineering, site specific insertion techniques, and transformation techniques well known in the art or introduced into the cultivar through a process which uses a donor parent which has the transgene(s) already introgressed. This process of introduction of a transgene(s) or native/non-native traits into the cultivar may use the donor parent in a marker assisted trait conversion process, where the trait may be moved for example by backcrossing using the markers for selection of subsequent generations.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0098">The laboratory-based techniques described above, in particular RFLP and SSR, can be used in such backcrosses to identify the progenies having the highest degree of genetic identity with the recurrent parent. This permits one to accelerate the production of soybean cultivars having at least 90%, 95%, 99% genetic, or genetically identical to the recurrent parent, and further comprising the trait(s) introgressed from the donor parent. Such determination of genetic identity can be based on markers used in the laboratory-based techniques described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0099">The last backcross generation is then selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred. The resulting plants have essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of cultivar of the present invention, in addition to the gene trait(s) transferred to the inbred. The exact backcrossing protocol will depend on the trait being altered to determine an appropriate testing protocol. Although backcrossing methods are simplified when the trait being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele may also be transferred. In this instance it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired trait has been successfully transferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0100">The cultivar of the invention can also be used for transformation where exogenous genes are introduced and expressed by the cultivar of the invention. Genetic variants created either through traditional breeding methods using cultivar of the present invention or through transformation of such cultivar by any of a number of protocols known to those of skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of this invention (see e.g. Trick et al. (1997) Recent Advances in Soybean Transformation, Plant Tissue Culture and Biotechnology, 3:9-26).</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0101">Transformation methods are means for integrating new genetic coding sequences (transgenes) into the plant's genome by the incorporation of these sequences into a plant through man's assistance. Many dicots including soybeans can easily be transformed with <i>Agrobacterium</i>. Methods of introducing desired recombinant DNA molecule into plant tissue include the direct infection or co-cultivation of plant cells with <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, Horsch et al., Science, 227:1229 (1985). Descriptions of <i>Agrobacterium </i>vector systems and methods are shown in Gruber, et al., âVectors for Plant Transformation, in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology &amp; Biotechnologyâ in Glich et al., (Eds. pp. 89-119, CRC Press, 1993). Transformed plants obtained via protoplast transformation are also intended to be within the scope of this invention. Other transformation methods such as whiskers, aerosol beam, etc. are well known in the art and are within the scope of this invention. The most common method of transformation after the use of <i>agrobacterium </i>is referred to as gunning or microprojectile bombardment. This process has small gold-coated particles coated with DNA (including the transgene) shot into the transformable material. Techniques for gunning DNA into cells, tissue, explants, meristems, callus, embryos, and the like are well known in the prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0102">The DNA used for transformation of these plants clearly may be circular, linear, and double or single stranded.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0103">Some of the time the DNA is in the form of a plasmid. The plasmid may contain additional regulatory and/or targeting sequences which assist the expression or targeting of the gene in the plant. The methods of forming plasmids for transformation are known in the art. Plasmid components can include such items as: leader sequences, transit polypeptides, promoters, terminators, genes, introns, marker genes, etc. The structures of the gene orientations can be sense, antisense, partial antisense or partial sense: multiple gene copies can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0104">After the transformation of the plant material is complete, the next step is identifying the cells or material, which has been transformed. In some cases, a screenable marker is employed such as the beta-glucuronidase gene of the uidA locus of <i>E. coli</i>. Then, the transformed cells expressing the colored protein are selected for either regeneration or further use. In many cases, a selectable marker identifies the transformed material.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0105">The putatively transformed material is exposed to a toxic agent at varying concentrations. The cells not transformed with the selectable marker, which provides resistance to this toxic agent, die. Cells or tissues containing the resistant selectable marker generally proliferate. It has been noted that although selectable markers protect the cells from some of the toxic effects of the herbicide or antibiotic, the cells may still be slightly affected by the toxic agent by having slower growth rates. If the transformed materials are cell lines then these lines are used to regenerate plants. The cells' lines are treated to induce tissue differentiation. Methods of regeneration of plants are well known in the art. General methods of culturing plant tissues are provided for example by Maki et al. âProcedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plantsâ in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology &amp; Biotechnology, Glich et al. (Eds. pp. 67-88 CRC Press, 1993); and by Phillips et al. âCell-Tissue Culture and In-Vitro Manipulationâ in Soybean &amp; Soybean Improvement, 3rd Edition Sprague et al. (Eds. pp. 345-387) American Society of Agronomy Inc. et al. 1988.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0106">The plants from the transformation process or the plants resulting from a cross using a transformed line or the progeny of such plants which carry the transgene are transgenic plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0107">The genes responsible for a specific gene trait are generally inherited through the nucleus. Known exceptions are, e.g. the genes for male sterility, some of which are inherited cytoplasmically, but still act as single gene traits. Male sterile soybean germplasm for hybrid soybean production was taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,648,204. In a preferred embodiment, a transgene to be introgressed into the cultivar WN1116094-1 is integrated into the nuclear genome of the donor, non-recurrent parent or the transgene is directly transformed into the nuclear genome of cultivar WN1116094-1. In another embodiment of the invention, a transgene to be introgressed into cultivar WN1116094-1 is integrated into the plastid genome of the donor, non-recurrent parent or the transgene is directly transformed into the plastid genome of cultivar WN1116094-1. In a further embodiment of the invention, a plastid transgene comprises a gene that has transcribed from a single promoter, or two or more genes transcribed from a single promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0108">A non-exclusive list of traits or nucleotide sequences capable of being transferred into cultivar WN1116094-1, using material and methods well known to those persons skilled in the art are as follows: genetic factor(s) responsible for resistance to brown stem rot (U.S. Pat. No. 5,689,035) or resistance to cyst nematodes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081); a transgene encoding an insecticidal protein, such as, for example, a crystal protein of <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>or a vegetative insecticidal protein from <i>Bacillus cereus</i>, such as VIP3 (see, for example, Estruch et al. Nat Biotechnol [1997] 15:137-41); a herbicide tolerance transgene whose expression renders plants tolerant to the herbicide, for example, expression of an altered acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) enzyme confers upon plants tolerance to various imidazolinone or sulfonamide herbicides (U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,373.) Other traits capable of being transformed into cultivar WN1116094-1 include, for example, a non-transgenic trait conferring to cultivar WN1116094-1 tolerance to imidazolinones or sulfonylurea herbicides; a transgene encoding a mutant acetolactate synthase (ALS) that renders plants resistant to inhibition by sulfonylurea herbicides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659); a gene encoding a mutant glutamine synthetase (GS) resistant to inhibition by herbicides that are known to inhibit GS, e.g. phosphinothricin and methionine sulfoximine (U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,374); and a <i>Streptomyces </i>bar gene encoding a phosphinothricin acetyl transferase resulting in tolerance to the herbicide phosphinothricin or glufosinate (U.S. Pat. No. 5,489,520.)</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0109">Other genes capable of being transferred into the cultivar WN1116094-1 of the invention include toleration to inhibition by cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropanoic acid herbicides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,602), which is conferred by an altered acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase); transgenic glyphosate tolerant plants, which tolerance is conferred by an altered 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate (EPSP) synthase gene; tolerance to a protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor, which is achieved by expression of a tolerant protoporphyrinogen oxidase enzyme in plants (U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,373.) Genes encoding altered protox resistant to a protox inhibitor can also be used in plant cell transformation methods. For example, plants, plant tissue or plant cells transformed with a transgene can also be transformed with a gene encoding an altered protox (See U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,904 incorporated by reference) capable of being expressed by the plant. The thus-transformed cells are transferred to medium containing the protox inhibitor wherein only the transformed cells will survive. Protox inhibitors contemplated to be particularly useful as selective agents are the diphenylethers (e.g. acifluorfen, 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobezoic acid; its methyl ester, or oxyfluorfen, 2-chloro-1-(3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)-4-(trifluorobenzene)), oxidiazoles, (e.g. oxidiazon, 3-[2,4-dichloro-5-(1-methylethoxyl)phenyl]-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-(3H)-one), cyclic imides (e.g. S-23142, N-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-propargyloxyphenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide; chlorophthalim, N-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide), phenyl pyrazoles (e.g. TNPP-ethyl, ethyl 2-[1-(2,3,4-trichlorophenyl)-4-nitropyrazolyl-5-oxy]propionate; M&amp;B 39279), pyridine derivatives (e.g. LS 82-556), and phenopylate and its 0-phenylpyrrolidino- and piperidinocarbamate analogs and bicyclic triazolones as disclosed in the International patent application WO 92/04827; EP 532146).</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0110">The method is applicable to any plant cell capable of being transformed with an altered protox-encoding gene, and can be used with any transgene of interest. Expression of the transgene and the protox gene can be driven by the same promoter functional on plant cells, or by separate promoters.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0111">Modified inhibitor-resistant protox enzymes of the present invention are resistant to herbicides that inhibit the naturally occurring protox activity. The herbicides that inhibit protox include many different structural classes of molecules (Duke et al., Weed Sci. 39: 465 (1991); Nandihalli et al., Pesticide Biochem. Physiol. 43: 193 (1992); Matringe et al., FEBS Lett. 245: 35 (1989); Yanase and Andoh, Pesticide Biochem. Physiol. 35: 70 (1989)), including the diphenylethers {e.g. acifluorifen, 5-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]-2-nitrobezoic acid; its methyl ester; or oxyfluorfen, 2-chloro-1-(3-ethoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)-4-(trifluorobenzene)}, oxidiazoles (e.g. oxidiazon, 3-[2,4-dichloro-5-(1-methylethoxyl)phenyl]-5-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-(3H)-one), cyclic imides (e.g. S-23142, N-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-5-propargyloxyphenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide; chlorophthalim, N-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophthalimide), phenyl pyrazoles (e.g. TNPP-ethyl, ethyl 2-[1-(2,3,4-trichlorophenyl)-4-nitropyrazolyl-5-oxy]propionate; M&amp;B 39279), pyridine derivatives (e.g. LS 82-556), and phenopylate and its 0-phenylpyrrolidino- and piperidinocarbamate analogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0112">Direct selection may be applied where the trait acts as a dominant trait. An example of a dominant trait is herbicide tolerance. For this selection process, the progeny of the initial cross are sprayed with the herbicide prior to the backcrossing. The spraying eliminates any plant that does not have the desired herbicide tolerance characteristic, and only those plants that have the herbicide tolerance gene are used in the subsequent backcross. This process is then repeated for the additional backcross generations.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0113">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a transgene transformed or introgressed into cultivar WN1116094-1 comprises a gene conferring tolerance to a herbicide and at least another nucleotide sequence for another trait, such as for example, insect resistance or tolerance to another herbicide. Another gene capable of being transferred into the cultivar WN1116094-1 of the invention expresses thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase enzymes for modifying grain digestibility and nutrient availability (U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 20030145347.)</p>

Industrial uses of soybean oil that is subjected to further processing include ingredients for paints, plastics, fibers, detergents, cosmetics, and lubricants. Soybean oil may be split, inter-esterified, sulfurized, epoxidized, polymerized, ethoxylated, or cleaved. Designing and producing soybean oil derivatives with improved functionality, oliochemistry is a rapidly growing field. The typical mixture of triglycerides is usually split and separated into pure fatty acids, which are then combined with petroleum-derived alcohols or acids, nitrogen, sulfonates, chlorine, or with fatty alcohols derived from fats and oils.</p>

      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0127">Soybean is not just a seed it is also used as a grain. The grain is used as a food source for both animals and humans. Soybean is widely used as a source of protein for animal feeds for poultry, swine and cattle. The soybean grain is a commodity. The soybean commodity plant products include but are not limited to protein concentrate, protein isolate, soybean hulls, meal, flower, oil and the whole soybean itself. During processing of whole soybeans, the fibrous hull is removed and the oil is extracted. The remaining soybean meal is a combination of carbohydrates and approximately 50% protein. For human consumption soybean meal is made into soybean flour that is processed to protein concentrates used for meat extenders or specialty pet foods. Production of edible protein ingredients from soybean offers a healthy less expensive replacement for animal protein in meats as well as dairy-type products.</p>
