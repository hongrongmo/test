      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">It is desirable to produce confectionery products formed of different components, so as to increase sensory pleasure. A number of existing confectionery products have multiple regions formed of different components. For example, multi-layer confectionery products can include multiple layers of different confectionery components stacked one above another. Center-filled confectionery compositions are also known that comprise a core (or center-fill) confectionery component and a shell confectionery component surrounding the core component. Also known are coated confectionery compositions, which comprise a coating of one confectionery component over another confectionery component. The presence of different components increases sensory pleasure by providing a variety of flavors and textures to a consumer.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">International Publication No. WO 2007/056685 A2 of Fornaguera discloses a method and apparatus for producing a plurality of center-filled ropes, where the rope material can be a chewing gum material. The ropes are subsequently separated and crimped to form individual pieces in which the centerfill material is sealed within each piece. International Publication No. WO 2010/034977 A1 of Vaman et al. discloses a chewing gum product that includes a chewing gum material in the form of an extruded body portion having a plurality of capillaries disposed therein. When making chewing gum products that include a plurality of filled capillaries, a number of challenges are encountered. For example, the fill material should be added to the capillaries at a temperature less than or equal to 80Â° C. to be compatible with the extruded chewing gum material. The capillary fill material should also have a low enough viscosity for pumping during the addition process, but a high enough viscosity to prevent leakage when the extruded confection is cut to expose the open ends of capillaries. One approach to avoiding leakage is to incorporate into the fill material a thickening agent, such as carboxymethylcellulose or pectin. However, the attendant increase in fill material viscosity can interfere with addition of the fill material through the small diameter orifices needed to fill capillaries. When a chewing gum product having a crunchy fill material is desired, then a crystallizable fill material is useful, but a thickening agent can interfere with the rate and extent of fill material crystallization. Accordingly, there remains a need for chewing gum products having capillaries filled with materials that are easily added to a capillary within a chewing gum material but harden to a crunchy material and avoid leakage during cutting and packaging.</p>

      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">One embodiment is a method of forming a chewing gum product, the method comprising: extruding a chewing gum material to form an extruded body portion and a plurality of capillaries disposed in the extruded body portion; adding a fill material to at least one capillary to form a filled extruded body; and separating the filled extruded body to form the chewing gum product; wherein the fill material comprises, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 20 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol, and about 20 to about 80 weight percent xylitol; wherein the total of sorbitol and xylitol is at least 80 weight percent.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The fill material is composed primarily of sorbitol and xylitol. Specifically, sorbitol and xylitol collective make up at least 80 weight percent of the fill material. The total amount of sorbitol and xylitol can be at least 85 weight percent, at least 90 weight percent, or at least 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The weight ratio of sorbitol to xylitol in the fill material can be about 20:80 to about 80:20. In some embodiments, the fill material comprises the sorbitol and xylitol in a weight ratio of about 20:80 to about 50:50, specifically about 20:80 to about 40:60. In other embodiments, the fill material comprises the sorbitol and xylitol in a weight ratio of about 60:40 to about 80:20, specifically about 70:30 to about 80:20.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The fill material can be prepared, in part, by melting a mixture of sorbitol and xylitol to form a homogeneous liquid (molten) mixture. Alternatively, the sorbitol and xylitol can be separately melted and then combined to form a homogeneous mixture. Although it is possible to utilize water or another solvent to facilitate liquefying the sorbitol/xylitol mixture, such solvent use is preferably avoided in order to eliminate the need for a subsequent solvent removal step. Moreover, the presence of a substantial amount of solvent can interfere with subsequent crystallization of the fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material comprises less than or equal to 5 weight percent water, specifically less than or equal to 4 weight percent water, based on the total weight of fill material. It will be understood that in this context âwaterâ includes all forms of water, and not just water intentionally added to the fill material. For example, water present as an impurity in the sorbitol and/or xylitol is included. Because of the equilibrium water contents of sorbitol and xylitol under ambient conditions, it can be challenging to maintain a water content much lower than a few weight percent. In some embodiments, the method comprises forming the fill material prior to said adding the fill material to at least one capillary. In these embodiments, forming the fill material comprises blending about 1 to about 20 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol, and about 80 to about 99 weight percent liquid sorbitol and xylitol, based on the total weight of the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">One advantage of the fill material is that it avoids the need for a thickening agent. Specifically, only moderate and brief cooling of the filled extruded body is needed to harden the fill material sufficiently to reduce or eliminate leakage during the subsequent separating step. So, it is possible to reduce or eliminate the use of thickening agents in the fill material. For example, the fill material can comprise less than or equal to 0.1 weight percent thickening agent, specifically less than or equal to 0.05 weight percent thickening agent, more specifically less than or equal to 0.01 weight percent thickening agent, based on the total weight of fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material excludes thickening agents. The thickening agents to be reduced or eliminated include, for example, pectin, gum arabic, acacia gum, alginates, agar, carrageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, locust bean gum, gelatin, gellan gum, galactomannans, tragacanth gum, karaya gum, curdlan, konjac, chitosan, xyloglucan, beta glucan, furcellaran, gum ghatti, tamarin, bacterial gums, starch, cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In some embodiments, the fill material during the addition to at least one capillary comprises, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 1 to about 20 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol, and about 80 to about 99 weight percent liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol. Note that the liquid necessarily includes both sorbitol and xylitol in order to benefit from the reduced melting points associated with their mixtures. The crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol facilitates or âseedsâ the crystallization of the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol. When present, the amount of the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol can be about 1 to about 20 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. Within this range, the amount of the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol can be about 2 to about 18 weight percent, specifically about 4 to about 16 weight percent, more specifically about 5 to about 15 weight percent. When crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol is included in the fill material, the amount of the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol can be about 80 to about 99 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. Within this range, the amount of the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol can be about 82 to about 98 weight percent, specifically about 84 to about 96 weight percent, more specifically about 85 to about 95 weight percent.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol can be crystalline sorbitol, crystalline xylitol, a co-crystalline sorbitol/xylitol blend, or a combination of at least two of the foregoing. The composition of the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol can range from pure sorbitol to pure xylitol and encompasses sorbitol/xylitol blends in any weight ratio. In some embodiments, the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol comprises about 10 to about 90 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and about 10 to about 90 weight percent crystalline xylitol, based on the total weight of crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol. In some embodiments, the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol comprises about 20 to about 40 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and about 60 to about 80 weight percent crystalline xylitol, based on the total weight of crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol. In other embodiments, the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol comprises about 70 to about 80 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and about 20 to about 30 weight percent crystalline xylitol. As noted above, the specified amounts of crystalline sorbitol and crystalline xylitol can include contributions from cocrystallized sorbitol and xylitol. The particle size of the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol is not critical as long as it is smaller than the diameter of the capillary into which the fill material is added. In some embodiments, the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol has a particle size mean diameter of about 25 to about 500 micrometers, specifically about 35 to about 400 micrometers, more specifically about 50 to about 300 micrometers. Particle size mean diameter can be determined by those skilled in the art. Suitable particle size determination techniques include, for example, sieving, microscopic analysis, and dynamic light scattering. In some embodiments, the crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol comprises less than 10 number percent, specifically less than 5 number percent, of particles having a diameter less than 25 micrometers, and less than 10 number percent, specifically less than 5 number percent, of particles having a diameter greater than 500 micrometers.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The fill material is added to at least one capillary to form a filled extruded body. In this context the word âaddedâ includes pumping the fill material, extruding the fill material, and other means of forcing the fill material into the at least one capillary. At the time at which it is added to a capillary, the fill material comprises liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol. The composition of the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol is any composition that, accounting for the composition of the optional crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol, provides a total fill material composition of about 20 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol, and about 20 to about 80 weight percent xylitol, wherein the total of sorbitol and xylitol is at least 80 weight percent, based on the total weight of fill material. In some embodiments, the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol comprises about 20 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol, and about 20 to about 80 weight percent xylitol, based on the total weight of the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol. In some embodiments, the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol comprises about 20 to about 40 weight percent sorbitol and about 60 to about 80 weight percent xylitol, based on the total weight of liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol. In some embodiments, the liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol comprises about 70 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol and about 20 to about 30 weight percent xylitol, based on the total weight of liquid (molten) sorbitol and xylitol.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In addition to the sorbitol and xylitol, the fill material can, optionally, further comprise up to 20 weight percent of other components. Such additional components can include, for example, sweetening agents other than the xylitol and sorbitol (including high-intensity sweeteners), sweetener modulators and potentiators, flavoring agents, flavor modulators and potentiators, aroma agents, cooling agents, warming agents, tingling agents, colorants (including dyes and pigments), breath fresheners, oral care agents, throat care agents, medicaments, mouth moisteners, humectants, acidulants, buffering agents, antioxidants, preservatives, and combinations thereof. These additional components are described in detail below. In some embodiments, such confectionery additives are used in an amount of less than or equal to 10 weight percent, specifically less than or equal to 5 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material excludes confectionery additives. In some embodiments, the fill material comprises one or more flavoring agents in an amount of 0.05 to about 10 weight percent, specifically about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent, more specifically about 0.2 to about 2 weight percent, even more specifically about 0.3 to about 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material consists of xylitol, sorbitol, and, optionally, one or more flavoring agents and/or coloring agents. In some embodiments, the fill material consists of xylitol and sorbitol.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">One advantage of the fill material is that it can be added to a capillary at a low temperature relative to the higher melting points characteristic of the separate sorbitol and xylitol components used to prepare the fill material. The fill material addition temperature is compatible with simultaneous extrusion of chewing gum material and addition of fill material to a capillary. For example, the fill material can be added to a capillary at a temperature of about 60 to about 80Â° C., specifically about 65 to about 75Â° C., more specifically about 70 to about 75Â° C. The chewing gum material can be extruded at a temperature of about 30 to about 50Â° C., specifically about 35 to about 45Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In some embodiments, the viscosity of the gum material at its extrusion temperature (e.g., its temperature at the die) is greater than the viscosity of the fill material at its addition temperature (e.g., its temperature at the die).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Another advantage of the fill material is that it hardens rapidly on cooling. As noted above, only moderate and brief cooling of the filled extruded body is needed to harden the fill material sufficiently to reduce or eliminate leakage during the subsequent separating step, and any wrapping step. For example, the filled extruded body can be air-cooled for about 60 to about 300 seconds at a temperature of about â10 to about 10Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">After its formation, the filled extruded body can be further sized, for example by stretching, or shaped, for example by folding.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Chewing gum products can be prepared by simultaneous extrusion of chewing gum material and addition of fill material to at least one capillary. The extrusion equipment can be, for example, a Davis-Standard single screw extruder, with a screw diameter of 19 millimeters, and a screw length to diameter ratio of 24:1. In some embodiments, the extruder has multiple temperature zones. In a specific embodiment, the extruder has four different temperature zones (denoted T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), each of which can be independently controlled using proportional integral derivative controllers connected to band heaters. An extrusion die, containing an entrainment array consisting of 3 needles, is connected on the extruder endplate. Two opposed air jets, used to rapidly cool the extrudate emerging from the extrusion die, are placed above and below the die exit; these jets are connected via a valve to a compressed air line at 7Ã10<sup>5 </sup>Newton per square meters. A schematic diagram showing the general layout of the extrusion line is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and a schematic drawing of the capillary die is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic diagram of the extrusion apparatus <b>10</b> used in the experiments. The apparatus comprises an electric motor <b>12</b> which is rotatably coupled to an extrusion screw <b>14</b>. The screw <b>14</b> is fed at one end by a hopper <b>16</b> and the opposing end is coupled to an extrusion die <b>18</b> having an extrudate outlet <b>20</b>. Quench jets <b>22</b> are directed toward the die outlet <b>20</b> so as to cool the extruded material <b>23</b>, and these jets are fed with compressed air <b>24</b>. If desired, the area of the apparatus where the hopper <b>16</b> is coupled to the screw <b>14</b> can be cooled by means of a cooling feed <b>26</b>. Surrounding the screw <b>14</b> is a barrel <b>28</b>, which has three barrel temperature zones denoted T<b>1</b> to T<b>3</b>âthe temperatures of each zone can be controlled independent of other zones. The barrel <b>28</b> is connected to the die <b>18</b> by means of a feed conduit <b>29</b> which has a temperature zone T<b>4</b> which can be controlled. In use, the hopper <b>16</b> is filled with chewing gum material <b>30</b> which can be heated so as to maintain it in a flowable form. Before the chewing gum material passes into the screw <b>14</b>, it can be cooled by means of the cool feed <b>26</b>, so as to ensure that the material is at the correct temperature for entering the screw extruder. As the screw is rotated, the liquid material is drawn along the screw <b>14</b>, inside the barrel <b>28</b> and the temperature of the zones T<b>1</b>-T<b>3</b> adjusted accordingly. The material then passes through the feed conduit <b>29</b> and the temperature adjusted again (if required) by temperature control T<b>4</b> before entering the die <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">With reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a schematic diagram of the extrusion die assembly used together with the apparatus of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> for preparing various chewing gum products. Reservoir <b>50</b> holds the fill material. The reservoir <b>50</b> is heated so that the fill material is maintained at correct temperature so as to maintain it in liquid state. The reservoir <b>50</b> is connected to a conduit <b>52</b> having an isolation valve <b>54</b> for controlling the flow of liquid. The conduit <b>52</b> is encased in a trace heating tube <b>56</b> which maintains the temperature of the conduit so that the liquid remains in a liquid state during its movement within the conduit. The conduit <b>52</b> is coupled to the inlet to the die <b>18</b> having a number of needles, so that when the chewing gum material is being extruded, the capillaries formed around the needles can be simultaneously filled with the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows the die <b>18</b> in more detail. In particular, this figure shows that the metallic die <b>18</b> has, at one end, a plurality of needles <b>60</b> which are joined to a cavity <b>62</b> which is in fluid communication with an inlet channel <b>64</b> for pumping a fill material into the needles <b>60</b>. While the chewing gum material is being extruded, the fill material is added (e.g., pumped or extruded) through the needles so that the extrudate contains a number of capillaries filled with the fill material. Referring again to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the extrudate <b>23</b> is cooled by means of the quench jets <b>22</b> as it is released from the die <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The chewing gum material and the fill material are typically used in proportions such that the extruded gum material is a major portion of the chewing gum product, and the fill material is a minor portion of the chewing gum product. For example, the chewing gum product can comprise about 60 to about 90 weight percent of the chewing gum material, and about 10 to about 40 weight percent of the fill material, based on the total weight of the chewing gum product. Within the range of about 60 to about 90 weight percent, the chewing gum material amount can be about 70 to about 85 weight percent, specifically about 75 to about 85 weight percent. Within the range of about 10 to about 40 weight percent, the fill material amount can be about 15 to about 30 weight percent, specifically about 15 to about 25 weight percent.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Another advantage of the fill material is that it provides a pleasing crunchiness when the chewing gum product is consumed. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory of operation, the inventors believe that the crunchiness is provided by crystals formed when the fill material crystallizes with cooling, which can be accomplished in seconds, and aging on the timescale of minutes, hours, or days. Note that crystallization of the fill material can continue after the initial hardening that accompanies cooling. In some embodiments, the crystallized fill material comprises crystals having at least one dimension of at least 20 micrometers, specifically 20 to about 2,000 micrometers, more specifically about 25 to about 1,000 micrometers, still more specifically about 25 to about 250 micrometers, even more specifically about 50 to about 200 micrometers.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The method includes separating the filled extruded body to form the chewing gum product. As used herein, the term âseparatingâ includes cutting, slicing, cleaving, and other means of dividing the filled extruded body into chewing gum pieces. In some embodiments, the chewing gum piece approximates the shape of a rectangular prism having a length of about 20 to about 50 millimeters, a width of about 6 to about 20 millimeters, and a thickness of about 2 to about 8 millimeters. The method can, optionally, further include wrapping the chewing gum product. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows a rectangular prism chewing gum product <b>200</b> having an extruded body <b>201</b> with a rectangular cross-section. Within the extruded body <b>201</b> is a plurality of (in this case, three) capillaries <b>202</b>, <b>203</b>, and <b>204</b> filled with fill material. In some embodiments, at least two of the capillaries contain different fill materials. The fill materials differ in at least one aspect of their composition, such as, for example, their sorbitol amount, xylitol amount, color, or flavoring. In such embodiments, the different fill materials are delivered via different extrusion die assemblies of the type shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In a very specific embodiment of the method of forming a chewing gum product, the fill material comprises less than or equal to 5 weight percent water, based on the total weight of fill material; the fill material comprises less than or equal to 0.05 weight percent thickening agent, based on the total weight of fill material; the fill material comprises the sorbitol and xylitol in a weight ratio of about 20:80 to about 40:60; the total of sorbitol and xylitol in the fill material is at least 90 weight percent; the adding a fill material to at least one capillary comprises adding the fill material at a temperature of about 60 to about 80Â° C.; and the chewing gum product comprises about 60 to about 90 weight percent of the chewing gum material, and about 10 to about 40 weight percent of the fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material during the addition to at least one capillary comprises, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 1 to about 20 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol, and about 80 to about 99 weight percent liquid sorbitol and xylitol.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Another embodiment is a method of forming a chewing gum product, the method comprising: forming a fill material comprising, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 20 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol, and about 20 to about 80 weight percent xylitol, wherein the total of sorbitol and xylitol is at least 80 weight percent; wherein the fill material comprises, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 1 to about 20 weight percent crystalline sorbitol and/or xylitol, and about 80 to about 99 weight percent liquid sorbitol and xylitol; extruding a chewing gum material to form an extruded body portion and a plurality of capillaries disposed in the extruded body portion; adding the fill material to at least one capillary to form a filled extruded body; and separating the filled extruded body to form the chewing gum product.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The invention includes a chewing gum product prepared by any of the above-described variations of the method.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Another embodiment is a chewing gum product, comprising: an extruded body portion comprising a chewing gum material, and a plurality of capillaries disposed in the extruded body portion, at least one of the capillaries comprising a fill material comprising, based on the total weight of the fill material, about 20 to about 80 weight percent sorbitol, and about 20 to about 80 weight percent xylitol; wherein the total of sorbitol and xylitol is at least 80 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The compositional variations described above in the context of the method apply as well to the chewing gum product. For example, the total of sorbitol and xylitol in the fill material can be at least 85, at least 90, or at least 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. As another example, the fill material can comprise less than or equal to 5 weight percent water, specifically less than or equal to 4 weight percent water, based on the total weight of fill material. As another example, the fill material can comprises less than or equal to 0.1 weight percent thickening agent, specifically less than or equal to 0.05 weight percent thickening agent, more specifically less than or equal to 0.01 weight percent thickening agent, based on the total weight of fill material. Or the fill material can exclude thickening agents. As another example, the fill material can comprise the sorbitol and xylitol in a weight ratio of about 20:80 to about 40:60. As another example, the total of sorbitol and xylitol in the fill material can be at least 90 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. As another example, the chewing gum product can comprise the chewing gum material in an amount about 60 to about 90 weight percent, specifically about 70 to about 85 weight percent, more specifically about 75 to about 85 weight percent; and it can comprise the fill material in an amount of about 10 to about 40 weight percent, specifically about 15 to about 30 weight percent, more specifically about 15 to about 25 weight percent, based on the total weight of the chewing gum product.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The fill material can, optionally, further comprise glycerol, propylene glycol, or a combination thereof. Among their other functions, these compounds can depress the melting point of the fill material. In some embodiments, glycerol alone is employed. When present, the glycerol, propylene glycol, or combination thereof can be used in an amount of about 0.5 to 10 weight percent, specifically about 1 to about 5 weight percent, based on the total weight of the fill material. In some embodiments, the fill material excludes glycerol and propylene glycol.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In a very specific embodiment of the chewing gum product, the fill material comprises less than or equal to 5 weight percent water, based on the total weight of fill material; the fill material comprises less than or equal to 0.05 weight percent thickening agent, based on the total weight of fill material; the fill material comprises the sorbitol and xylitol in a weight ratio of about 20:80 to about 40:60; the total of sorbitol and xylitol in the fill material is at least 90 weight percent; and the chewing gum product comprises about 60 to about 90 weight percent of the chewing gum material, and about 10 to about 40 weight percent of the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some embodiments, the chewing gum product comprises a first capillary comprising a first fill material (which is the âfill materialâ described in the embodiments above), and a second capillary comprising a second fill material different from the first fill material. The fill materials differ in at least one aspect of their composition, such as, for example, their sorbitol amount, xylitol amount, color, or flavoring.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">There is no particular limitation on the chewing gum material used to prepare the chewing gum product. As used herein, the terms âgum,â âchewing gum,â and âbubble gumâ are used interchangeably and are meant to include any gum composition. Chewing gum materials typically contain a water-insoluble gum base, sweeteners, flavors, and a variety of additional ingredients tailored to provide specific release characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The chewing gum product can be coated or uncoated, and it can be extruded and, if necessary, separated and/or shaped into the form of slabs, sticks, pellets, balls, and the like. In some embodiments, the chewing gum product comprises a clear coating to facilitate visibility of the filled capillaries. Different forms of the chewing gum material can vary with regard to the types and amounts of the ingredients. For example, coated gum compositions can contain a lower percentage of softeners. Pellets and balls can have a chewing gum core that has been coated with either a sugar solution or a sugarless solution to create a hard shell. Slabs and sticks are usually formulated to be softer in texture than the chewing gum core. In some cases, a hydroxy fatty acid salt or other surfactant active can have a softening effect on the gum base. In order to adjust for any potential undesirable softening effect that the surfactant actives can have on the gum base, it can be beneficial to formulate a slab or stick gum having a firmer texture than usual (i.e., use less conventional softener than is typically employed).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The chewing gum material can comprise a gum base, bulk sweeteners, high intensity sweeteners, flavorants, coloring agents, sensates (such as cooling agents, warming agents, and tingling agents), and any other optional additives, including throat-soothing agents, spices, tooth-whitening agents, breath freshening agents, vitamins, minerals, caffeine, drugs (e.g., medications, herbs, and nutritional supplements), oral care products, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Generally, the chewing gum material comprises a water insoluble gum base portion and a water-soluble bulk portion. The gum base can vary greatly depending upon various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum desired, and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum product. The gum base can be any water-insoluble gum base known in the art, and includes those gum bases utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers and rubbers. For example, natural elastomers and rubbers include substances of vegetable origin such as smoked or liquid latex and guayule, natural gums such as jelutong, lechi caspi, perillo, sorva, massaranduba balata, massaranduba chocolate, nispero, rosidinha, crown gum, chicle, gutta percha, gutta kataiu, gutta kay, niger gutta, tunu, chilte, chiquibul, gutta hang kang, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Synthetic elastomers include high molecular weight elastomers and low molecular weight elastomers. Useful high molecular weight elastomers include butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, polyethylene, and combinations thereof. Useful low molecular weight elastomers include polybutene, polybutadiene, polyisobutylene, and combinations thereof.

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">These examples illustrate the preparation of fill materials for use in the chewing gum product. Xylitol used in these examples had a mean particle size of about 90 micrometers. Sorbitol used in these examples had a mean particle size of about 250 micrometers. The fill materials were prepared by mixing a melt composition comprising xylitol and sorbitol with a seed composition comprising xylitol and sorbitol to form a fill material. In Table 1, âMelt xylitol (%)â is the weight percent of xylitol in the melt composition, based on the total weight of the melt composition. âMelt sorbitol (%)â is the weight percent of sorbitol in the melt composition, based on the total weight of the melt composition. âSeed xylitol (%)â is the weight percent of xylitol in the seed composition, based on the total weight of the seed composition. âSeed sorbitol (%)â is the weight percent of sorbitol in the seed composition based on the total weight of the seed composition. âMelt (%)â is the weight percent of the melt composition, based on the total weight of the fill material. âSeed (%)â is the weight percent of the seed composition, based on the total weight of the fill material. âTotal xylitol (%)â is the weight percent of total xylitol (melt composition xylitol plus seed composition xylitol), based on the total weight of the fill material. âTotal sorbitol (%)â is the weight percent of total sorbitol (melt composition sorbitol plus seed composition sorbitol), based on the total weight of the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">Melt compositions were prepared by melting xylitol and sorbitol in a stirred and scraped steam-jacketed kettle at 120Â° C. The resulting homogeneous mass was cooled to 72Â° C. before adding the seed composition, which had been prepared by dry blending xylitol and sorbitol. The resulting fill material was held at 75Â° C. until used to form the chewing gum product.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0154">These examples illustrate the preparation of chewing gum products.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0155">Compositions of the chewing gum material and the fill material are summarized in Table 2, where component amounts are expressed in parts by weight. Maltitol used in these examples had a mean particle size of about 35 micrometers. The isomalt associated with the Table 2 row labeled âIsomalt (%)â had a mean particle size of about 40 micrometers. The isomalt associated with the Table 2 row labeled âIsomalt F (%)â had a mean particle size of 480 micrometers. The component associated with the Table 2 row labeled âLYCASIN 75/55 (%)â is a maltitol syrup (i.e., hydrogenated hydrolyzed starch) containing 75 weight percent solids based on the total weight of the maltitol syrup, and 55 weight percent maltitol based on the total solids in the maltitol syrup. The rows associated with the CHEWING GUM MATERIAL section of Table 2 provide the amounts of the respective components in weight percent based on the total weight of the chewing gum material. The rows associated with the FILL MATERIAL section of Table 2 have the meanings described in the preceding preparative examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0156">The chewing gum material was prepared according to a conventional gum blending procedure. In a representative gum blending procedure, a mixing kettle is pre-heated to 38Â° C. All polyols except for the Isomalt F are added to the kettle with the coloring agents, and the resulting blend is mixed for 30 seconds. Gum base and softener are then added to the kettle and heated to a temperature of 85-100Â° C. Mixing of the gum base and softener is conducted for four minutes. The flavoring agents and cooling agents are combined and added to the kettle over the course of 30 seconds with mixing. The Isomalt F is then added to the kettle, and mixing is conducted for three minutes. The temperature of the mixture is reduced to less than 48Â° C., then the encapsulated and unencapsulated high intensity sweeteners are added, and mixing is conducted for four minutes.</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0158">To form the chewing gum product, extrusion of the chewing gum material and addition of the fill material were simultaneous, the fill material temperature during addition to capillaries was 72-78Â° C., and the temperature of the chewing gum material during extrusion was about 40-45Â° C. The extrusion rate of the chewing gum material and the pumping rate of the fill material were adjusted to provide an extrudate with 75-85% chewing gum material and 15-25% fill material. The fill material was deposited in capillaries having a diameter of about 3.5 millimeters, adjacent capillaries being separated by a wall having a thickness of about 1.2 millimeters. The extrudate was air-cooled in a cooling tunnel for about 1.5-2 minutes at 2-4Â° C., which resulted in cooling the filled extrudate to about 20Â° C. The cooled extrudate was cut to chewing gum product (pieces) having approximate dimensions 35 millimeters by 11 millimeters by 5.5 millimeters, then wrapped. Cooling in the cooling tunnel was sufficient to avoid leakage of the fill material during cutting of the extrudate.</p>

      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0159">This example illustrates the preparation of a chewing gum product with flavoring in the fill material.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0160">Compositions of the chewing gum material and the fill material are summarized in Table 3. The âencapsulated aspartameâ contained 30 weight percent aspartame and 70 weight percent of a poly(vinyl acetate)-based encapsulant, based on the total weight of the encapsulated aspartame. The âencapsulated acesulfame-Kâ contained 30 weight percent acesulfame-K and 70 weight percent a poly(vinyl acetate)-based encapsulant, based on the total weight of the encapsulated acesulfame-K.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0161">The chewing gum material was prepared according to the general procedure described in the previous examples. The fill material was prepared as described in the preparative examples above, except that the flavoring was added just after addition of the seed composition. The chewing gum product was prepared according to the general procedure described in the previous examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0162">The presence of flavoring in the fill material had no noticeable adverse effect (e.g., it did not cause leakage, nor did it interfere with hardening or crystallization).</p>
