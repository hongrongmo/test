      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a soap holder, and more particularly, to a soap holder with ribs extending from the support face thereof so as to support the ribs and provides better ventilation.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Descriptions of Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The conventional soap holder is designed to allow the user to put the soap in the soap holder. In most of the soap holders, there are slots defined through the soap holder so as to drain exceed liquid from the soap holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a conventional soap holder <b>21</b> which has a support face <b>22</b> which is a recessed face and the soap <b>10</b> is put on the support face <b>22</b>. The support face <b>22</b> has holes <b>23</b> for drainage purpose. This prevent exceed liquid accumulated at the support face <b>22</b> so as to prevent the soap <b>10</b> from being softened and to maintain the soap <b>10</b> to be solid.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">There are multiple ribs <b>24</b> extending from the support face <b>22</b>, and the soap <b>10</b> is supported on the ribs <b>24</b>. Although the soap <b>10</b> is not in contact with the support face <b>22</b> directly, the exceed liquid of the soap <b>10</b> will be firmly attach the soap <b>10</b> to the ribs <b>24</b>. When the user picks up the soap <b>10</b>, the user has to apply force, and sometimes pulls the soap holder up. The ventilation problem between the soap <b>10</b> and the soap holder <b>21</b> is not satisfied.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention intends to provide a soap holder to eliminate the shortcomings mentioned above.</p>

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Preferably, a water dish is connected to the underside of the holder, and the support face has at least one drain hole so that exceed liquid drains to the water dish. A third rib extends from the top of the support face and is located between the first and second ribs. The third rib is lower than the first rib.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Preferably, the holder has an opening in the underside thereof and the water dish is engaged with the opening. The water dish has a second wall extending from the top thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Preferably, the distance between the third rib and the second rib is shorter than the distance between the third rib and the first rib.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the height of the first rib is lower than the height of the first wall, and the height of the second rib is higher than the height of the first wall.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the soap holder of the present invention comprises a holder <b>30</b> having a first wall <b>32</b> and a support face <b>31</b> which is enclosed by the first wall <b>32</b>. The first wall <b>32</b> extends from the periphery of the holder <b>30</b>. A first rib <b>33</b>, a second rib <b>34</b> and a third rib <b>35</b> respectively extend from the top of the support face <b>31</b>. The first rib <b>33</b> is parallel to the second rib <b>34</b>, and the height of the first rib <b>33</b> from the support face <b>31</b> is lower than the height of the second rib <b>34</b>. The third rib <b>35</b> is located between the first and second ribs <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, wherein the height of the third rib <b>35</b> is lower than the height of the first rib <b>33</b>. The distance between the third rib <b>35</b> and the second rib <b>34</b> is shorter than the distance between the third rib <b>35</b> and the first rib <b>33</b>. Preferably, the height of the first rib <b>33</b> is lower than that of the first wall <b>32</b>, and the height of the third rib <b>34</b> is higher than that of the first wall <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The support face <b>31</b> has at least one drain hole <b>36</b> defined through the support face <b>31</b>. The at least one drain hole <b>36</b> can be an elongate slot which is parallel to the first rib <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the soap <b>10</b> is put on and supported on the first and second ribs <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> so that the soap <b>10</b> is rested at angle relative to the holder <b>30</b> and located within the area enclosed by the first wall <b>32</b>. The length of the soap <b>10</b> becomes shorter after use, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the soap <b>10</b> is then supported on the first and third ribs <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and still located within the area enclosed by the first wall <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the soap <b>10</b> may also rested on the side of the third rib <b>35</b> and the body of the soap <b>10</b> is supported on the first rib <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The first and second ribs <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> allow the soap <b>10</b> to be positioned at an angle regardless of the length of the soap <b>10</b>, the exceed liquid can easily flow downward along the inclined surface of the soap <b>10</b>. For a shorter soap <b>10</b>, the third rib <b>35</b> lifts the soap <b>10</b> from the support face <b>31</b> so that the soap <b>10</b> will not be attached on the larger support face <b>31</b>. The present invention provides a better ventilation between the soap <b>10</b> and the support face <b>31</b>, the soap <b>10</b> is not soaked in water or liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the holder <b>30</b> has an opening defined in the underside thereof and a water dish <b>40</b> is engaged with the opening. The water dish <b>40</b> has a second wall <b>42</b> extending from the top thereof. In detail, the second wall <b>42</b> extends from a distance from the periphery of the water dish <b>40</b> so as to form a shoulder portion <b>43</b> between the second wall <b>42</b> and the periphery of the water dish <b>40</b>. The shoulder portion <b>43</b> can also be formed at only one side of the water dish <b>40</b>. The second wall <b>42</b> prevents water from splashing out from the water dish <b>40</b>. The shoulder portion <b>43</b> allows the user to easily remove the water dish <b>40</b> from the holder <b>30</b>. The at least one drain hole <b>36</b> of the holder <b>30</b> is an elongate slot and parallel to the first rib <b>33</b>. The exceed liquid drains into the water dish <b>40</b> via the at least one drain hole <b>36</b>. The water dish <b>40</b> has at least one reinforcement ridge <b>44</b> formed on the top thereof so as to have better strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The present invention has the following advantages:</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The first and second ribs <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> allow the soap <b>10</b> to be positioned at angle relative to the holder <b>30</b>, so that the user can easily grab the soap <b>10</b>. A distance is formed between the soap <b>10</b> and the support face <b>31</b>, so that the ventilation is improved compared with the conventional soap holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The inclination of the soap <b>10</b> allows water or liquid to flow downward quickly, so that the soap <b>10</b> will not be soaked in the water or liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The third rib <b>35</b> allows the shorter soap <b>10</b> to be positioned at an angle, and a distance is formed between the soap <b>10</b> and the support face <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The soap <b>10</b> is not attached to the support face <b>31</b>, and the water dish <b>40</b> collects the water or liquid to keep the area clean and neat.</p>
