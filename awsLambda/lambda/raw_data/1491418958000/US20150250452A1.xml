    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Provided is a method of manufacturing an ultrasound probe. The method includes: preparing a backing layer having first and second surfaces with different heights due to forming a groove in the backing layer, wherein first and second electrodes are exposed on the first and second surfaces, respectively; forming a third electrode that is in contact with the first electrode; forming a base piezoelectric unit on the third electrode, the base piezoelectric unit including a piezoelectric layer; forming a piezoelectric unit by removing an upper region of the base piezoelectric unit; and forming a fourth electrode on the backing layer and the piezoelectric unit.</p>

      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a configuration of an ultrasound probe <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the ultrasound probe <b>100</b> includes a backing layer <b>110</b> having first and second surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> with different heights due to forming a groove <b>120</b> in the backing layer <b>110</b>, a first electrode <b>130</b> that is disposed inside the backing layer <b>110</b> and exposed on the first surface S<b>1</b>, a second electrode <b>140</b> that is disposed inside the backing layer <b>110</b> and exposed on the second surface S<b>2</b>, a third electrode <b>150</b> that is disposed in the groove <b>120</b> and contacts the first electrode <b>130</b>, a piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> that includes a piezoelectric layer <b>161</b> and is disposed on the third electrode <b>150</b>, and a fourth electrode <b>170</b> disposed on the backing layer <b>110</b> and the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b>. The ultrasound probe <b>100</b> may further include a matching layer <b>180</b> formed on the fourth electrode <b>170</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The backing layer <b>110</b> may absorb ultrasounds transmitted thereinto and has the groove <b>120</b> formed therein. The groove <b>120</b> may be formed in a top surface of the backing layer <b>110</b> so that the groove <b>120</b> has a shape corresponding to that of the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> and is concave in the backing layer <b>110</b>. Thus, the backing layer <b>110</b> may have first and second surfaces S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> having different heights. Furthermore, the backing layer <b>110</b> may be formed of a material containing rubber with epoxy resin and tungsten powder added thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The backing layer <b>110</b> may be formed by joining together a plurality of sub-backing layers, e.g., first through third sub-backing layers <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>115</b>. For example, the second sub-backing layers <b>113</b> are disposed on either edge of the third sub-backing layer <b>115</b>, and the first sub-backing layers <b>111</b> are respectively disposed on edges of the second sub-backing layers <b>113</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The second electrodes <b>140</b> may be disposed between the first and second sub-backing layers <b>111</b> and <b>113</b>, and the first electrode <b>130</b> may be disposed between the second and third sub-backing layers <b>113</b> and <b>115</b>. Each of the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> has one end exposed on a top of the backing layer <b>110</b> and the other end exposed on a bottom of the backing layer <b>110</b>. Therefore, the ends of the and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> on one side of each of the first and the second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are in contact with other electrodes disposed on the backing layer <b>110</b>, e.g., the third and fourth electrodes <b>150</b> and <b>170</b>, respectively. The ends of the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> on the other side thereof are electrically connected to a chip module substrate (not shown?) of the ultrasound probe <b>100</b>. Although only the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are disposed between the second sub-backing layer <b>113</b> and either the third or first sub-backing layer <b>115</b> or <b>111</b>, embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto. For example, the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may be disposed on insulating layers, respectively, and the insulating layers having the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> thereon may be disposed between each of the first through third sub-backing layers <b>111</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>115</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">One of the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may receive a driving signal from the chip module substrate while the other may receive a ground signal therefrom. For example, the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may receive a driving signal and a ground signal from the chip module substrate, respectively. In this case, the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may also be called a signal electrode and a ground electrode, respectively. The first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are hereinafter referred to as a signal electrode and a ground electrode, respectively, but are not limited thereto. For example, a ground signal and a driving signal may be applied to the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The first electrode <b>130</b> serving as a signal electrode may include a plurality of first electrode elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> that are separate from each other so that one of the first electrode elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> may contact one of a plurality of piezoelectric elements, as described below. The second electrode <b>140</b> serving as a ground electrode may include a plurality of second electrode elements (<b>142</b> and <b>144</b>?) that are separate from each other, and each second electrode element <b>142</b> or <b>144</b> may be formed of a single conductive material layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, each of the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may include (two types of electrode elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> (or <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>). The first electrode elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> are disposed on the left and right sides of the third sub-backing layer <b>115</b>, respectively, and in a staggered form. This staggered arrangement may decrease the size of a piezoelectric element. Furthermore, since the second electrode <b>140</b> includes the two second electrode elements <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, one of the second electrode elements <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> may receive a ground signal even if the other electrode element suffers from a ground failure. Thus, a failure rate of the ultrasound probe <b>100</b> may be reduced. To achieve this, the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> each may include one type of electrode elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">At least one of the first and second electrodes <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may be a flexible printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The third electrode <b>150</b> is disposed in the groove <b>120</b> and contacts the first electrode <b>130</b>. Thus, when the first electrode <b>130</b> serves as a signal electrode, the third electrode <b>150</b> may be a signal electrode as well. The third electrode <b>150</b> may include a plurality of third electrode elements <b>152</b> that are separate from each other. Since the third electrode <b>150</b> is formed using a deposition process such as sputtering, the third electrode <b>150</b> may be thin. For example, the third electrode <b>150</b> may have a thickness of about 7000 â«.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> is disposed within the groove <b>120</b> and on the third electrode <b>150</b>. The piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may also include a plurality of separate piezoelectric elements <b>162</b> that are in contact with the third electrode elements <b>152</b>, respectively. Thus, the piezoelectric elements <b>162</b> convert electrical signals into ultrasounds and vice versa while oscillating. The piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may be made of a material that causes a piezoelectric phenomenon to occur. The material may include at least one of zinc oxide (ZnO), aluminum nitride (AlN), lead zirconate titanate (PbZrTiO<sub>3</sub>; PZT), lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PbLaZrTiO<sub>3</sub>; PLZT), barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>; BT), lead titanate (PbTiO<sub>3</sub>; PT), and lead magnesium niobate (Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>âPT (PMNâPT). The third electrode <b>150</b> and the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may be formed in the groove <b>120</b> by using a deposition process. Since the piezoelectric unit is formed by using a deposition method, the piezoelectric layer <b>161</b> may have a thickness of less than or equal to 200 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may only include the piezoelectric layer <b>161</b> made of a piezoelectric material. If the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> only includes the piezoelectric layer <b>161</b>, a bottom surface and a top surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>161</b> may contact the third and fourth electrodes <b>150</b> and <b>170</b>, respectively, but are not limited thereto. The piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may further include an auxiliary electrode (not shown) that contacts the bottom surface of the piezoelectric layer <b>161</b>. The auxiliary electrode may contact the third electrode <b>150</b> as well. In other words, by joining the auxiliary electrode directly with the third electrode <b>150</b>, a separation between the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> and the third electrode <b>150</b> may be reduced, and accordingly, a failure rate of the ultrasound probe <b>100</b> may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The fourth electrode <b>170</b> is disposed on the backing layer <b>110</b> and the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> and is electrically connected to the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> and the second electrode <b>140</b>. For example, the fourth electrode <b>170</b> may contact the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> and the second electrode <b>140</b> for electrical connection. Like the first through third electrodes <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, and <b>150</b>, the fourth electrode <b>170</b> may include a plurality of fourth electrode elements <b>172</b> that are separate from one another. Each of the fourth electrode elements <b>172</b> is disposed on regions of the piezoelectric element <b>162</b> and the backing layer <b>110</b> and is electrically connected to the second electrode <b>140</b>. For example, each of the fourth electrode elements <b>172</b> may contact the second electrode <b>140</b> for electrical connection. A surface of the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> may be at the same level as the second surface S<b>2</b> of the backing layer <b>110</b>. The fourth electrode <b>170</b> may be formed by using a deposition process such as sputtering, vacuum evaporation, vapor deposition, plating, silk screen, printing. Since the fourth electrode <b>170</b> is formed using a deposition process, the fourth electrode <b>170</b> may be thin. For example, the fourth electrode <b>170</b> may have a thickness of about 7000 â«.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The first through fourth electrodes <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>170</b> may be formed of conductive materials. Examples of the conductive materials may include metals, carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, various conductive polymers such as polypyrrole, polyaniline, polyacetylene, polythiophene, polyphnylene vinylene, polyphenylene sulfide, poly p-phenylene, and polyheterocycle vinylene, metal oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO), aluminum zinc oxide (AZO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), or indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and thin-films with dispersed metal nanoparticles including Al, copper (Cu), gold (Au), and silver (Ag).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The matching layer <b>180</b> may match an acoustic impedance of an ultrasound generated by the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b> to an acoustic impedance of an object. The matching layer <b>180</b> may gradually change the acoustic impedance of the ultrasound so that it is close to that of the object. The matching layer <b>180</b> may also include a plurality of matching elements <b>182</b> disposed on the fourth electrode elements <b>172</b>, respectively, but is not limited thereto. The matching layer <b>180</b> may be formed of a single layer or have a multi-layer structure. Since the matching layer <b>180</b> may also be formed using a deposition process, the matching layer <b>180</b> may have a thickness of less than or equal to 50 Î¼m. The matching layer <b>180</b> may be formed by using a molding process and then a polishing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The ultrasound probe <b>100</b> may further include an acoustic lens (not shown) for condensing ultrasounds. The acoustic lens is used to focus ultrasounds generated by the piezoelectric unit <b>160</b>. The acoustic lens may be formed of a material such as silicon rubber having acoustic impedance that is close to that of an object. In addition, the acoustic lens may have a convex or flat central portion. The acoustic lens may have various shapes according to design requirements.</p>

Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the second electrode <b>140</b> may be formed on a side of the first sub-backing layer <b>111</b> by depositing a conductive material. In this case, the second electrode <b>140</b> may be formed as a pattern by partitioning the conductive material into the plurality of second electrode elements <b>142</b> and <b>144</b>, or as a single electrode layer. Then, the first electrode <b>130</b> may be formed on a side of the second sub-backing layer <b>113</b>. The first electrode <b>130</b> may be patterned into the plurality of first electrode elements <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> by depositing a conductive material and then patterning the same. Thereafter, the second sub-backing layer <b>113</b> with the first electrode <b>130</b> formed on the side thereof may be joined to a side of the third sub-backing layer <b>115</b>, and the first sub-backing layer <b>111</b> having the second electrode <b>140</b> on the side thereof may be bonded to a side of the second sub-backing layer <b>113</b>.

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The ultrasound probe <b>100</b> is configured to transmit an ultrasound to an object and receive an ultrasound echo signal reflected from the object, which will be described in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The signal processor <b>220</b> may process ultrasound data generated by the ultrasound probe <b>100</b> and generate an ultrasound image. For example, the ultrasound image may be at least one of a brightness (B) mode image indicating the intensity of an ultrasound echo signal reflected from an object as brightness, a Doppler mode image showing a moving object as a spectrum by using a Doppler effect, a motion (M) mode image showing movement of an object at a predetermined position over time, an elasticity mode image indicating a difference between deformations of an object when compression is applied and when no compression is applied, and a color (C) mode image representing the speed of a moving object in color by using a Doppler effect. Since an ultrasound image may be generated by using a currently implementable method, a detailed description thereof is omitted herein. In addition, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the ultrasound image may include images of all dimensions, such as one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D), and four-dimensional (4D) images.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The display <b>230</b> displays information that is processed by the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b>. For example, the display <b>230</b> may display an ultrasound image generated by the signal processor <b>220</b> as well as a graphical user interface (GUI) for requesting a user input.</p>

The ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b> may include two or more displays according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The user interface <b>240</b> is a means via which a user inputs data for controlling the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b>. The user interlace <b>240</b> may include a keypad, a mouse, a touch panel, and a trackball. However, the user interface <b>240</b> is not limited thereto and may further include various other input elements such as a jog wheel, jog switch, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The touch panel may detect both a real touch where a pointer actually touches a screen and a proximity touch where the pointer approaches the screen while being separate from the screen by less than a predetermined distance. In the present specification, the term âpointerâ means a tool for touching a particular portion on or near the touch panel. Examples of the pointer may include a stylus pen and a body part such as fingers.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In addition, the touch panel may be realized as a touch screen that forms a layer structure with the display <b>230</b>. The touch screen may be implemented as various types such as capacitive overlay, resistive overlay, infrared beam, surface acoustic wave, integral strain gauge, and piezoelectric touch screens. The touch screen is very useful because it functions as both the display <b>230</b> and the user interface <b>240</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Although not shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, various sensors may be disposed within or near the touch panel so as to sense a touch. A tactile sensor is an example of the sensors for sensing a touch. The tactile sensor is used to sense a touch of a particular object to the same or greater degree than the degree to which a human can sense the touch. The tactile sensor may detect various types of information including the roughness of a contact surface, the hardness of an object to be touched, and the temperature of a point to be touched.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">A proximity sensor is another example of the sensors for sensing a touch. The proximity sensor means a sensor that senses the presence of an object that is approaching or is located near a predetermined detection surface by using the force of an electromagnetic field or infrared light without any mechanical contact. Examples of the proximity sensor include a transmissive photoelectric sensor, a direct reflective photoelectric sensor, a mirror reflective photoelectric sensor, a high-frequency oscillation proximity sensor, a capacitive proximity sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, and an infrared proximity sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The storage <b>250</b> stores various types of information that are processed by the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b>. For example, the storage <b>250</b> may store medical data related to diagnosis of an object, such as images, and algorithms or programs that are executed in the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The storage <b>250</b> may include at least one storage medium from among a flash memory-type storage medium, a hard disk-type storage medium, a multimedia card micro-type storage medium, card-type memories (e.g., an SD memory, an XD memory, and the like), Random Access Memory (RAM), Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), Read-Only Memory (ROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM (EEPROM), PROM, magnetic memory, a magnetic disc, and an optical disc. The ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b> may utilize a web storage or a cloud server that functions as the storage <b>250</b> online.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The controller <b>260</b> controls the overall operations of the ultrasound diagnostic apparatus <b>200</b>. In detail, the controller <b>260</b> may control operations of the ultrasound probe <b>100</b>, the signal processor <b>220</b>, and the display <b>230</b>. For example, the controller <b>260</b> may control the signal processor <b>220</b> to generate an image by using a user command received via the user interface <b>240</b> or programs stored in the storage <b>250</b>. The controller <b>260</b> may also control the display <b>230</b> to display the image generated by the signal processor <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As described above, according to the one or more of the above embodiments of the present invention, it is possible to form a thin piezoelectric unit and a thin matching layer. In addition, a failure rate may be reduced during the manufacture of an ultrasound probe.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">While one or more embodiments of the present invention have been described with reference to the figures, it should be understood that the exemplary embodiments described therein should be considered in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
