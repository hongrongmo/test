      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention relates to dental devices for cleaning teeth and massaging the gums, and in particular to a device for brushing teeth of a whole dental arch.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">2. Description of Related Art Including Information</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Tooth brushing is a necessary part of oral hygiene maintenance, aiding in the prevention of dental caries and of gingival and periodontal diseases. However, improper tooth brushing may cause traumatization of teeth and gingiva.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Dental plaque is a dense, non-calcified mass of bacterial colonies that adheres to the teeth. Plaque can be removed by mechanical methods, such as tooth brushing.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Many people have difficulty brushing their teeth properly and therefore do not remove the plaque from the tooth surfaces and the gums. The effectiveness of brushing depends on personal dexterity, form and contour of the dental arches, tooth dimensions, brush position and inclination, and the time dedicated to brushing Many people do not brush their teeth properly because of lack of knowledge, improper dexterity, lack of care, and/or insufficient brushing time.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Over the years, several full jaw toothbrushes have been disclosed. Examples of such prior art devices: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>Rainer, U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,652;</li><li>Cole, U.S. Pat. No. 3,874,084;</li><li>Solow, U.S. Pat. No. 4,224,710;</li><li>Kelly, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,237,574;</li><li>Rabinowitz, U.S. Pat. No. 5,175,901.</li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0016">These devices generally operate by manual chewing or manual manipulation of handles. A tooth brushing device disclosed in Kennedy, U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,616, includes a vibratory device at the front of the arch, which shakes bristles directed towards the teeth.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0017">A more convenient and effective toothbrush for a full dental arch would be advantageous.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0034">The following detailed description is made with reference to the figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic drawing of a dental arch toothbrush <b>20</b>. The toothbrush includes a brush unit <b>22</b> that fits over either a superior (upper) or inferior (lower) dental arch, enabling the simultaneous brushing of all maxillary (upper) teeth, or alternatively, all mandibular (lower) teeth.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0036">Dental arch toothbrush <b>20</b> includes a detachable handle <b>24</b>. Typically, a person will employ two separate brush units, a first unit designed for the lower jaw, and a second for the upper jaw. The same handle can be employed for both units.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective, schematic drawing of the dental arch toothbrush described above with respect to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Brush unit <b>22</b> includes a brush track <b>28</b>, configured in an arc so as to align to the U-shape of a person's dental arch. Typically, the shape of the brush track is configured according to the particular shape of a specific user's dental arch.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0038">Positioned on track <b>28</b> are multiple brushes <b>30</b>. Each brush has an open trapezoidal shape, which opens away from the track so as to engage one or more individual teeth. Attached to the inner surfaces of each brush are multiple bristles <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0039">The brush unit is mounted to a detachable, protective housing <b>34</b>, which protects the underside of the brush unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0040">Handle <b>24</b> is attached to the brush unit by means of a quick coupler or one or more connector pins <b>36</b>. The toothbrush is operated by gripping the handle, positioning the brush unit over the dental arch, and switching on a power button <b>38</b>. The brush unit is positioned such that the brushes envelope teeth of the dental arch, including molar, premolar, canine, and incisor teeth. The brushes are typically designed to reach all exposed sides of all the teeth (occlusal, lingual, and buccal), as well as the gingival margins of the gums.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0041">Typically, brushes that will contact the posterior molar and pre-molar teeth are wider than brushes that will contact the anterior canine and incisor teeth, and include bristles to sweep the occlusal, lingual, and buccal tooth surfaces. Anterior brushes typically have only side bristles to sweep the lingual and buccal surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0042">The power button turns on a motor <b>40</b> within the handle. Power for the motor may be provided by a rechargeable or replaceable battery inside the handle or additionally or alternatively by external power. The motor transmits mechanical power to the brush unit by means of a transmission coupler, such as motion lever <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0043">Coupling of the lever to the brush unit transforms the motor motion to a linear reciprocating motion of the brushes, as described further hereinbelow. In operation, the brushes move or vibrate back-and-forth along the track in a reciprocating manner so as to sweep horizontally across the teeth, thereby cleaning the teeth and massaging and cleaning the gingival margins of the gums. The power button or a separate tempo button <b>44</b> on the handle may optionally be configured to set various patterns of speed and movement of the brushes.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating a cross-sectional view of the brush unit, viewed in a plane perpendicular to the length of brush track <b>28</b>, as indicated by plane I-II in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The brush unit is positioned to brush teeth of a dental arch, such that brush <b>30</b> is positioned so as to brush a tooth <b>202</b>, as well as the gingival margins of gums <b>204</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0045">Each brush of the brush unit is attached to a respective rod <b>206</b> by means of a spring attachment <b>208</b>. The spring attachment may include a spring to allow partial movement of the brush, so as to maximize the surface engagement with teeth that are malocclused. The spring allows a lateral movement of the brushes (in a plane normal to the direction of movement of the brushes), so devised to allow each brush to adapt to the location of the teeth, while simultaneously preventing the brush from lagging behind in its movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0046">Alternatively, the attachment may be hexagonal, or polygonal, or alternative shape to allow flexibility in the dynamic or static positioning of the brush, or a spring with a measure of sideways freedom of motion.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0047">The rod <b>206</b> passes through a groove <b>210</b> of track <b>28</b> and through a hole in a guide plate <b>212</b>. The guide plate connects two or more rods to move together. As described further herein below, the multiple rods of the brushes <b>30</b> are connected together by a series of such guide plates, such that the multiple brushes move in unison when a motive force is applied to one guide plate. The underside of the brush unit is protected by protective housing <b>34</b>, as described above with respect to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic drawing illustrating a cut-away view of the underside of brush track <b>28</b>, that is, the underside of the brush unit with the protective housing removed. Each brush <b>30</b> is attached to its respective rod <b>206</b>, whose movement is guided by one or more grooves <b>210</b> in the brush track. Grooves may be several millimeters in length, permitting movement of the brushes when a reciprocating force is applied to one or more of the plates. Grooves are positioned along a center line of the track, the length of each groove being parallel to the edges of the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0049">The positions and lengths of the grooves may be customized for a particular user.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective, schematic drawing of the dental arch toothbrush, including a brush unit <b>22</b> and a handle <b>24</b> for another embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0056">In this embodiment, the handle <b>24</b> is mounted at an angle with the plane of the brush unit <b>22</b>. The angle may be <b>90</b> arc degrees, or a slant angle as may be comfortable to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0057">In the embodiment as illustrated, the brush unit <b>22</b> is used to brush the superior (upper) dental arch, enabling the simultaneous brushing of all the maxillary (upper) teeth.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0058">The brush unit <b>22</b> is detachably connected to the handle <b>24</b> using snap-on means as known in the art, which enable easy connection or separation of the units <b>24</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0059">Similarly, a second brush unit (not shown) belonging to that person, but adapted to the shape of the inferior (lower) dental arch, may be connected to the handle <b>24</b>, enabling the simultaneous brushing of all the mandibular (lower) teeth.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0060">In the embodiment as shown, an electric motor <b>40</b> in the handle <b>24</b> rotates eccenter means <b>8</b>. The brushes are moved using eccenter means <b>8</b> in the handle <b>24</b>. The eccenter <b>8</b> with its pin rotates and engages a slot <b>11</b> in the motion coupling means <b>7</b>. The motion coupling means <b>7</b> is an extension of the anterior guide plate <b>212</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0061">Thus, rotation of the motor in the handle <b>24</b> causes a linear, back and forth movement of the brushes <b>30</b> along their track <b>28</b> in the brush unit <b>22</b>. The brush track extension <b>28</b>A is not moving, rather it is part of the track <b>28</b> and provides a support for the moving brushes. The structure may also include standoff means <b>10</b>, or quick connect means.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0062">In other aspects, this embodiment is somewhat similar to that in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0063">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the brush unit <b>22</b> with the brush track <b>28</b> may be contained in a detachable cartridge. The cartridge may include quick connect means for attaching to the handle <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0064">Preferably the handle <b>24</b> also includes moving means (such as an electric motor) and a battery.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0065">The quick connect means include attaching means for the fixed part with the track <b>28</b>, and attaching means for the moving part (the brushes).</p>
