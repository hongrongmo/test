      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> thereof, a new wreath device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As best illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, the decorative wreath device <b>10</b> generally comprises a base <b>12</b> having a back face <b>14</b>. The base <b>12</b> is annular forming the general shape of a wreath such as one may hang as a decoration. The back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b> may be planar to facilitate resting of the base <b>12</b> against a vertical surface such as a wall, door, or the like. A cover <b>18</b> is annular having an inner perimeter edge <b>20</b> and an outer perimeter edge <b>22</b>. Each of a plurality of fasteners <b>24</b> is coupled to the cover <b>18</b>. Each of the fasteners <b>24</b> removably engages the back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b> such that the cover <b>18</b> extends over a front section <b>26</b> of the base <b>12</b>. Each of the fasteners <b>24</b> is coupled to and extends outwardly from an associated one of the inner perimeter edge <b>20</b> and the outer perimeter edge <b>22</b>. A radial distance between the inner perimeter edge <b>20</b> and the outer perimeter edge <b>22</b> of the cover <b>18</b> is greater than a distance across a surface <b>30</b> of the front section <b>26</b> of the base <b>12</b> measured radially between concentric peripheral edges <b>32</b> of the back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b>. Thus, the inner perimeter edge <b>20</b> and the outer perimeter edge <b>22</b> are each positionable on the back face <b>14</b> when the cover <b>18</b> is positioned to extend over the front section <b>26</b> of the base <b>12</b>. The cover <b>18</b> may be patterned, colored, painted, adorned with items like a bow <b>50</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, or otherwise constructed to provide a decorative appearance. The cover <b>18</b> is removable from the base <b>12</b> allowing for interchanging of multiple such covers <b>18</b> each having a distinct appearance. Thus, a user may periodically change the appearance of the device <b>10</b> by changing the cover <b>18</b> coupled to the base <b>12</b>. Covers <b>18</b> may be provided with seasonal themes or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In an embodiment of the invention shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> and <b>5</b>, each of the fasteners <b>24</b> is a respective portion of hook fastener <b>40</b>. Loop fastener <b>42</b> is coupled to and positioned on the back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b> wherein each portion of hook fastener <b>40</b> is removably couplable to the back face <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the hook fastener and loop fastener positions may be reversed but it is noted that portions of the loop fastener <b>42</b> are exposed when the fasteners <b>24</b> are coupled to loop fastener <b>42</b>. Exposure of hook fastener in such a manner could lead abrading of a surface positioned adjacent to the back surface <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In an embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, each fastener <b>24</b> is magnetically couplable to the back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b>. Each fastener <b>24</b> is a magnet <b>48</b> and the back face <b>14</b> of the base <b>12</b> is magnetically attracted to each fastener <b>24</b>. The back face <b>14</b> may comprise either a metallic material or a second magnet having opposite polarity to each magnet <b>48</b> comprising the fasteners <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In use, the base <b>12</b> is covered by the cover <b>18</b> to provide a desired appearance. Multiple such covers <b>18</b> may be provided having unique appearances. The base <b>12</b> may be selectively covered and recovered to vary the appearance of the device <b>10</b>. The structure of the fasteners <b>24</b> and the back face <b>14</b> facilitates interchanging of covers <b>18</b> and establishing a neat appearance of a selected cover <b>18</b> on the base <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word âcomprisingâ is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article âaâ does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.</p>
