    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An apparatus for locating an embedded passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag is provided. An embodiment of the locating apparatus includes a resonator capable of electromagnetically coupling to the PIT tag, and a feedback circuit connected to the resonator and configured to monitor a load conductance of the resonator. A distance between the resonator and the PIT tag is indicated by a change in the monitored load conductance when the resonator and the PIT tag are electromagnetically coupled. Another embodiment includes a resonator capable of stimulating a response signal from a PIT tag, and a processing circuit capable of calculating the distance between the resonator and the PIT tag based on the amplitude of the response signal.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to location devices and more specifically to methods and apparatus used to locate passive integrated transponder tags (hereinafter âPIT tagsâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Location devices, such as metal detectors and radio frequency transponder locators for tracking objects or specimens such as animals are known in the art. However, these devices have drawbacks that make them unsuitable for some tasks. For example, radio frequency transponder tags are intended for location and tracking of objects or animals at comparatively long range, and not for close-range location of small objects with great precision. Metal detectors react to any substantial amount of metal found within an object, and therefore do not differentiate between PIT tags and metal objects, or multiple devices embedded in a single object. They are also incapable of the precision required for certain applications. Thus, when it is necessary to identify a location of a single embedded device to within a few millimeters, and/or it is desirable to differentiate between multiple implanted devices, PIT tags are preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">PIT tags have been used for many years to identify specimens, including livestock, domestic pets, birds, fish, and other marine animals for various management and/or research purposes. Each PIT tag generally includes a small ferrite-cored coil attached to a microchip. The microchip has a capacitor that causes the coil to resonate at a predetermined frequency when energized and circuitry to generate and transmit a coded identification number or message in response to a received interrogation signal which energizes the coil. PIT tags do not contain an internal energy source. Instead, energy needed to transmit the coded identification number is obtained through electromagnetic coupling, which causes a transfer of energy from a powered device to the PIT tag. Typically, the PIT tag is enclosed in a glass covering or envelope about 2 mm in diameter and about 11 mm in length, although other packaging is possible. PIT tags are usually injected up to a few centimeters below the outer surface of an object or the specimen's skin using a hypodermic syringe, but other methods of attachment, for example ear tags, are also known.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Protocols for a PIT tag interrogation and messaging system include those defined by International Standards Organization (ISO) standards 11784 and 11785, and other protocols that have been introduced by various manufacturers. PIT tags may be either half-duplex (HDX) or full-duplex (FDX). An HDX PIT tag receives a pulsed interrogation signal from a âPIT tag readerâ and then responds with a coded identification number. An FDX PIT tag continuously transmits a coded identification number while receiving an interrogation signal, which may be either pulsed or continuous. PIT tags are typically read at close range, generally well under 1 meter, and often less than a few centimeters.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In many applications, the embedded PIT tags remain in position for the life of the specimen or object and are treated as disposable items. One known limitation of PIT tag readers, which are devices that are capable of receiving the coded identification number transmitted by the PIT tag and displaying the number, is that the readers cannot accurately determine the position of the PIT tag after it has been embedded within an object or specimen. However, in certain situations it is beneficial to be able to accurately determine the location of the PIT tag in terms of the depth of the PIT tag relative to the object's surface and/or the location on the surface of the object below which the PIT tag is embedded. For example, knowing the exact position of a PIT tag is helpful to reduce damage to an object or specimen if it is necessary to remove the PIT tag from the object or specimen. Knowledge of a PIT tag's position is also beneficial if the location of the PIT tag is used as a marker for some other device having the PIT tag attached or adjacent thereto and which is also disposed in the object or specimen. Thus, there is a need for a PIT tag locating device that is able to determine the position and depth of a PIT tag that has been embedded in an object or specimen in addition to receiving a coded identification number transmitted by the PIT tag.</p>

      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A locating apparatus for locating a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag responds to the above-identified need for improved PIT tag locating. The locating apparatus allows a user to pass a device over the outer surface of an object or the skin of a specimen to locate an embedded PIT tag with improved precision relative to conventional techniques. The improved precision reduces the need for guesswork and/or exploratory cutting by the device user to locate the PIT tag.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In one embodiment of the invention, an apparatus for locating an embedded passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag is provided. The locating apparatus includes a resonator capable of electromagnetically coupling to the PIT tag, and a feedback circuit connected to the resonator and configured to monitor a load conductance of the resonator. A distance D between the resonator and the PIT tag is indicated by a change in the monitored load conductance when the resonator and the PIT tag are electromagnetically coupled.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another embodiment, an apparatus for locating an embedded PIT tag includes a resonator capable of electromagnetically coupling to the PIT tag and outputting an interrogating signal. The locating apparatus also has a drive circuit configured to drive said resonator to stimulate a response signal from the PIT tag, the response signal being superimposed over the interrogating signal in the resonator. Also included are a demodulator configured to demodulate the combined interrogating signal and response signal output from the resonator, and a bandpass amplifier configured to receive an output of the demodulator and isolate and amplify the response signal. Finally, the locating apparatus includes a peak detector configured to measure at least an amplitude of the amplified response signal, where the amplitude is a function of a distance D between the resonator and the PIT tag.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A method for locating a PIT tag embedded in an object includes steps of providing an energized locating apparatus having a search coil and an indicator, and placing said search coil directly adjacent to an outer surface of the object such that the search coil electromagnetically couples to and identifies the PIT tag. Once the search coil and the PIT tag are electromagnetically coupled, the apparatus displays an indication value that indicates a distance between the search coil and the PIT tag. The search coil is then repositioned on the outer surface of the object to obtain a new indication value until the indication value reaches a maximum. The indicator displays a maximum indication value when the distance between the search coil and the PIT tag is at a minimum.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The following is a detailed description of certain embodiments of the invention presently contemplated by the inventor to be the best mode of carrying out his invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags are useful for providing ID information about a particular PIT tag that is embedded in a body or specimen. In the particular embodiments that are discussed hereinbelow, an actual physical location of a PIT tag within the object or specimen can be determined by using an apparatus for locating a PIT tag. Additionally, a coded identification number transmitted by the PIT tag can optionally be read. In particular, an embodiment of the apparatus uses electromagnetic coupling to change load conductance on an oscillator, which is measured and output to an accessory to provide an audio and/or video indication to a user. In this manner, the user can determine the position of the PIT tag embedded within the object or specimen, including the depth of the PIT tag relative to the outer surface of the object. This improved locating apparatus reduces the need for exploratory surgery or other locating methods to determine the location of the PIT tag within the object or under the skin of the specimen. For simplicity, present embodiments of the invention will contemplate a PIT tag implanted under a specimen's skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">When a passive resonator, such as a PIT tag, is brought near a driven resonator or oscillator, electromagnetic coupling causes a transfer of energy. The exact amount of energy transferred depends upon the resonant frequencies of the two resonators (or resonator and oscillator), as well as the distance between them and their relative orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a locating system is generally designated <b>10</b>. The locating system includes a transponder, such as a PIT tag <b>12</b>, and a transceiver, such as a PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b>. The PIT tag <b>12</b> is configured to be implanted under the skin of a specimen <b>16</b>. The PIT tag <b>12</b> is further capable of transmitting a response signal when energized by an interrogating signal or electromagnetically coupled to a driven coil such as the coil in the locating apparatus <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">An embodiment of the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> includes a processing and display unit <b>18</b> for analyzing data such as a load conductance on the locating apparatus, strength of a signal emitted by the transponder, and optionally encoded content of a message incorporated in this signal. The locating apparatus <b>14</b> also includes a search coil <b>20</b>, which is preferably annular or solenoidal in shape, attached to the processing and display unit <b>18</b>. The search coil <b>20</b> can be driven at a pre-selected frequency substantially equal to the natural resonant frequency of a PIT tag <b>12</b>. The processing and display unit <b>18</b> is housed in a hand-held case <b>22</b> that defines a display window <b>24</b>. The display window <b>24</b> allows a user to view distance and/or PIT tag identification number information. The PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> measures a distance D between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b> when the search coil <b>20</b> is energized due to electromagnetic coupling to the PIT tag <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The search coil <b>20</b> preferably has an outer diameter of approximately 30 millimeters and an inner diameter of approximately 17 millimeters. The search coil <b>20</b> may however be larger or smaller as appropriate to the expected depth of the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the detection range required. As indicated in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, which is a top view of the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> of <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the search coil <b>20</b> may be moved laterally (i.e., in any of the directions indicated by the arrows L) over the skin of the specimen <b>16</b> at a small distance above the skin or at the surface thereof to determine the lateral position of a PIT tag <b>12</b> implanted within the specimen. Once the lateral position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> is known, the search coil <b>20</b> can be lowered to contact the skin of the specimen <b>16</b> to determine the depth at which the PIT tag <b>12</b> was implanted, which is calculated by the processing and display unit <b>18</b> based upon (i) the change in load conductance when there is electromagnetic coupling between the locating apparatus <b>14</b> and the PIT tag, or (ii) the strength of the transponded signal received from the PIT tag, and the depth can be viewed via the display window <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">It will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the measured data displayed by the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> will depend upon the size, shape, and orientation of the search coil <b>20</b> in relation to the PIT tag <b>12</b>, as well as the distance D between the PIT tag and the search coil. For example, considering the magnetic flux distribution surrounding the search coil <b>20</b>, one skilled in the art can appreciate that the maximum generated response for a PIT tag <b>12</b> that is oriented parallel to a center axis Z of the search coil will occur when the center of the search coil is directly over the center of the PIT tag. A PIT tag <b>12</b> that is oriented obliquely relative to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b> will generate a maximum response when the PIT tag is slightly off-center relative to the center axis Z of the search coil, and a horizontal PIT tag (i.e., a PIT tag oriented perpendicular to the center axis of the search coil) will generate two maxima of positions a little to either side of center of the PIT tag, with lower values in between the two maxima. Thus, it should be noted that the effects of orientation, as well as other factors, limit the ability to obtain an exact measurement of the depth and lateral position of a PIT tag <b>12</b> implanted in a specimen <b>16</b>. However, measurements obtained using the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> are generally accurate within a few millimeters both in lateral position and in depth.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">It will also be apparent that a calibration procedure should be performed in order to select suitable algorithms to correctly relate the output audio or visual display, for instance a range of tones, a bar-graph or a numerical readout, to the distance D between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the search coil <b>20</b>. It is contemplated that one or more sets of calibration data could be included to suit PIT tags of different characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In most applications, the PIT tag <b>12</b> will be at least nearly parallel to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b>. Thus, when the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> indicates that distance between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the search coil <b>20</b> is at a minimum (i.e., the lateral position of the PIT tag is found), the locating apparatus will also indicate the approximate vertical placement of the PIT tag. In the embodiments shown and described herein, the distance scale used for determining vertical placement has been calibrated for vertical PIT tags, and will be slightly less accurate for oblique PIT tags that are offset relative to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b>. For PIT tags <b>12</b> that are oriented perpendicular to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b>, a different scale is preferably implemented to take into account the dual maxima when a determination of the vertical placement is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> a first example of a PIT tag locator circuit is generally designated <b>30</b>. The PIT tag locator circuit <b>30</b> is used in a transceiver such as the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b>, and can be used to locate transponders such as PIT tags <b>12</b> that have been implanted under a specimen's skin. The PIT tag locator circuit <b>30</b> is formed by an oscillator <b>32</b> (shown in dashed lines) connected to a feedback circuit <b>34</b> (shown in dashed lines). The oscillator <b>32</b> is made up of an inductor L<b>1</b>, two capacitors C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, a transistor Q<b>1</b>, and a resistor R. A voltage Vcc is applied to one end <b>36</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b>. Another end <b>38</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b> is connected to a node M. Also connected to the node M are a collector <b>40</b> of the transistor Q<b>1</b> and one end <b>42</b> of the capacitor C<b>1</b>. Another end <b>44</b> of the capacitor C<b>1</b> and an emitter <b>46</b> of the transistor Q<b>1</b> are connected to a node N, as are one end <b>48</b> of the capacitor C<b>2</b> and one end <b>50</b> of the resistor R. A second end <b>52</b> of the capacitor C<b>2</b> and a second end <b>54</b> of the resistor R are grounded. (As used herein, the term âgroundâ refers to a common or reference node, which may or may not be connected to main or building earth type grounds.) Bias current le, which flows across the resistor R, and a voltage VI at the node N are controlled by the feedback circuit <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The feedback circuit <b>34</b> has a peak detector <b>56</b>, an error amplifier <b>58</b>, and a low-pass filter <b>60</b>. An input of the peak detector <b>56</b> is connected to the node M. The output of the peak detector <b>56</b> is fed into the error amplifier <b>58</b>, which also receives a reference voltage as an input. The output of the error amplifier <b>58</b> is fed into the low-pass filter <b>60</b>, and the output of the low-pass filter is connected to the base <b>62</b> of the transistor Q<b>1</b>. The feedback circuit <b>34</b> keeps the oscillation amplitude of the oscillator <b>32</b> substantially constant by changing its bias current le to compensate for a variation in load conductance.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Load conductance can increase, for example, when a resonant frequency of a PIT tag <b>12</b> is equal to or at least near the resonant frequency of the oscillator <b>32</b>, and the PIT tag is positioned close enough to the locator circuit <b>30</b> so as to electromagnetically couple with the inductor L<b>1</b>. The inductor L<b>1</b> serves as the search coil <b>20</b> in the locating apparatus <b>14</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, which may include the locator circuit <b>30</b>. An increase in load conductance will cause an increase in output of the error amplifier <b>58</b> and the low-pass filter <b>60</b>, as well as an increase in the current le and the voltage VI. Furthermore, it should be understood that other variations of the locator circuit <b>30</b> can be implemented, as is known to those skilled in the art. An advantage of the locator circuit <b>30</b> is that it is easily adapted to a dual or multiple frequency operation mode and/or to locating of both HDX and FDX PIT tags <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">It will be apparent to one versed in the art that other oscillator configurations and/or other active devices (for example, field effect transistors) could be used in place of oscillator <b>32</b> without altering the scope or nature of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The oscillator <b>32</b> may or may not operate at a power level capable of causing the PIT tag <b>12</b> to transmit a message in a response signal. The message can include information such as a tag identification number identifying the PIT tag <b>12</b>. However, since no response from the PIT tag <b>12</b> is needed to locate the PIT tag by using locator circuit <b>30</b>, the oscillator <b>32</b> may be driven by using a small amount of power. Driving the oscillator <b>32</b> at this reduced power level advantageously increases battery life and reduces potential interference with other electronic equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a second example of a PIT tag locator circuit is generally designated <b>70</b>. Locator circuit <b>70</b> is less susceptible to error due to electromagnetic coupling to metal objects other than PIT tags. Additionally, locator <b>70</b> is less affected by variations in load conductance caused by temperature changes in the inductor. The location range of locator circuit <b>70</b> is also larger than that of locator circuit <b>30</b>. In this example, a microcontroller <b>72</b> uses a crystal <b>74</b> to generate a drive frequency that is selected to match the resonance frequency of a PIT tag <b>12</b>. Further, it is contemplated that PIT tags of different resonant frequencies could be used with different selected drive frequencies to detect multiple embedded PIT tags. The output of the microcontroller <b>72</b> is provided as an input to a drive circuit <b>76</b>, which drives a resonator <b>78</b> (shown in dashed lines) formed by a capacitor C<b>1</b> and an inductor L<b>1</b> at a power level sufficient to excite a response from the PIT tag <b>12</b>. The output of the drive circuit <b>76</b> is connected to one end <b>80</b> of the capacitor C<b>1</b>. A second end <b>82</b> of the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to one end <b>84</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b> and an input of a demodulator <b>86</b>. Another end <b>88</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b> is grounded. The output of the demodulator <b>86</b> is fed into a bandpass amplifier <b>90</b>. The output of the bandpass amplifier <b>90</b>, designated V<b>2</b>, is fed into an analog peak detector <b>92</b>. The output of the peak detector <b>92</b> is designated V<b>3</b>. It should be noted that while a free-running oscillator is also contemplated for use with the present locator circuit <b>70</b>, the described crystal-controlled drive frequency locator circuit is preferred because it provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio. It will also be apparent to one versed in the art that a drive circuit could function without the aid of the microcontroller <b>72</b>. However, in some locator apparatuses, the microcontroller <b>72</b> may also be used to analyze the signals V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b>, and to control audio and/or visual display devices, as discussed herein in relation to the examples shown in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">When the resonator <b>78</b> in the locator circuit <b>70</b> is driven at a sufficient power, a signal, such as an interrogating signal, is output via the inductor L<b>1</b>. In response to the interrogating signal, a PIT tag <b>12</b> that is electromagnetically coupled with the resonator <b>78</b> transmits a response signal, which includes a message. When received by the locator circuit <b>70</b>, the response signal is superimposed over the interrogating signal, which is held in the resonator <b>78</b>. The demodulator <b>86</b> is configured to demodulate the signal held in the resonator <b>78</b>. For PIT tags conforming to the ISO standard with a resonance frequency of 134.2 kHz, the demodulated response signal has a frequency of approximately 4.2 kHz.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Next, the response signal is separated from other components of the demodulator output by using the band-pass amplifier <b>90</b>, and the response signal V<b>2</b> is output to the peak detector <b>92</b>. An amplitude peak value V<b>3</b> is extracted from the demodulated response signal using the peak detector <b>92</b>. Alternatively, the amplitude peak value can be determined from the output signal V<b>2</b>. Regardless of which of the output signals V<b>2</b> and V<b>3</b> is used, the peak amplitude can be calculated. The peak amplitude is related to the distance D between the inductor L<b>1</b>, which functions as the search coil <b>20</b> in a locating apparatus <b>14</b> that includes the locator circuit <b>70</b>, and a PIT tag <b>12</b> that is electromagnetically coupled with the resonator <b>78</b>. It is contemplated that a tag ID number can be included in the message to identify the PIT tag <b>12</b>. The message can optionally be extracted and analyzed and the tag number determined using the signal V<b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of an audio indicator <b>100</b> that can be implemented with either of the above-described locator circuits <b>30</b>, <b>70</b> to indicate the proximity of a PIT tag <b>12</b>. Using the audio indicator <b>100</b>, the voltage output from the first or second examples (i.e., V<b>1</b> or V<b>3</b>) is input into a voltage-to-frequency converter <b>102</b>. The voltage-to-frequency converter <b>102</b> converts the provided voltage into a frequency that will produce an audible tone. The frequency produced by the voltage-to-frequency converter <b>102</b> increases as the distance between the inductor L<b>1</b> and the PIT tag decreases. Thus, the audible tone can also be configured to increase in pitch to provide feedback to the user as the distance decreases between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b>. In particular, the frequency, and thus the pitch of the audible tone, will be at a maximum when the PIT tag <b>12</b> is directly below the center axis Z of the inductor L<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> further shows the output of the voltage-to-frequency converter <b>102</b> being fed into an amplifier <b>104</b>, and then into a loudspeaker or headphone <b>106</b> to provide the audible tone. Advantageously, the lateral position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> (i.e., the position directly above where the PIT tag is implanted) can accurately be determined by locating the position on the specimen's skin that corresponds to the highest-frequency audible tone. Additionally, the distance of the PIT tag from the surface of the skin (i.e., the depth that the PIT tag was implanted) can be estimated from the pitch of the audible tone when the lateral position has been determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows an example of an audiovisual indicator <b>110</b> that can be used with either the first or second embodiment locator circuits <b>30</b>, <b>70</b>. The indicator <b>110</b> receives as an input a voltage signal (V<b>1</b>, V<b>2</b>, or V<b>3</b>) having an amplitude that is non-linearly related to the distance between the search coil <b>20</b> and a PIT tag <b>12</b> that is electromagnetically coupled to the search coil. The input signal is digitized using an analog-to-digital converter <b>112</b>. The output of the analog-to-digital converter <b>112</b> is input into a microcontroller <b>114</b>. The microcontroller <b>114</b> processes the output from the analog-to-digital converter <b>112</b> to provide a binary output signal that is linearly related to the distance between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b>. Thereafter, a first output <b>116</b> of the microcontroller <b>114</b> is input into a frequency synthesizer <b>118</b>, which converts the output of the microcontroller into a signal that can be used to generate an audible tone. The audible tone provides distance data similar to that discussed above with respect to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> preferably converts the output of the microcontroller <b>114</b> to one of a multitude of distinct tones (e.g., one of <b>48</b> distinct tones spanning four octaves) that are used to indicate the distance D between the search coil <b>20</b> and the electromagnetically coupled PIT tag <b>12</b>. One output from the frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> is amplified by an amplifier <b>120</b>. A second output <b>122</b> from the microcontroller <b>114</b> is used to control the gain of the amplifier <b>120</b>. The amplified signal output from the amplifier <b>120</b> is input to a loudspeaker <b>106</b>, which provides an audible tone to a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Additionally, a third output <b>124</b> of the microcontroller <b>114</b> can be fed into an alphanumeric display <b>126</b>, which may be but is not limited to a 2-line by 16 character display. One line of the display <b>126</b> is configured to display a bar-graph, which may conveniently contain 48 bars for a 16-character display, and another line of the display is configured to show a corresponding range scale in, for example, centimeters. The length of the bar-graph increases as the distance D between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b> decreases. The bar-graph type display <b>126</b> can provide a user with a visual indication of the vertical position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> (i.e., the distance the PIT tag was implanted into the specimen) once the lateral position of the PIT tag has been determined, and the inductor Li in the resonator <b>32</b>, <b>78</b> is centered above the electromagnetically coupled PIT tag. In this position the length of the bar-graph will be a maximum. Of course, other visual display types are also contemplated and capable of being implemented with the output <b>124</b> of the microcontroller <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Sometimes a PIT tag <b>12</b> is implanted in an area where the specimen's skin is irregular or not generally flat. In such circumstances, it may be difficult to accurately determine the lateral position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> using the search coil <b>20</b>. Instead, a pencil-shaped probe <b>130</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> may be used to locate a PIT tag <b>12</b>. The probe <b>130</b> is generally formed from a relatively long and thin cylindrical tube <b>132</b> configured for insertion into a specimen and having a first end <b>134</b> and a second end <b>136</b>. The tube <b>132</b> may be made of any durable material that will not adversely react with the specimen, such as plastic or stainless steel, and preferably has an outer diameter of about 4.8 mm and a length of about 150-200 mm. The first end <b>134</b> of the tube <b>132</b> is capped by a plastic cap <b>138</b>, and the second end <b>136</b> of the tube <b>132</b> is fitted with a cable or connector <b>140</b> so that the probe <b>130</b> can be connected to the processing and display unit <b>18</b>. The interior of the probe <b>130</b> has a small coil <b>144</b>, which is preferably but not necessarily ferrite-cored, disposed within the plastic cap <b>138</b>. The coil <b>144</b> functions as a search coil similar to the search coil <b>20</b> of <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>. The coil <b>144</b> can output a signal to the processing and display unit <b>18</b> via lead wires <b>146</b> and connector <b>140</b> located at the second end <b>136</b> of the tube <b>132</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">To use the probe <b>130</b>, an approximate lateral location of the PIT tag <b>12</b> is first determined using the search coil <b>20</b>. A small incision is made in the specimen at this location, and the probe <b>130</b> is inserted therein. The probe <b>130</b> may then be manipulated within the incision to determine the shortest distance between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the coil <b>144</b>. It should be noted that because of the relative size difference between the coil <b>144</b> used within the probe <b>130</b> and the search coil <b>20</b>, the range of the probe is less than that of the search coil.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">If the orientation of the search coil <b>20</b> is fixed relative to the processing and display unit <b>18</b>, it may be difficult or inconvenient to read the bar graph from the display window <b>24</b> of the processing and display unit while the search coil is positioned against the specimen. In such situations, a rotatable search coil is advantageous. <figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show another embodiment of a PIT tag locating apparatus <b>150</b> including a rotatable coil assembly <b>152</b> for use with the circuits of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The rotatable coil assembly <b>152</b> has a search coil <b>20</b> disposed on a first end of the rotatable coil assembly and a rotationally symmetrical plug <b>154</b> disposed on a second end of the rotatable coil assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The PIT tag locating apparatus <b>150</b> also includes a processing and display unit <b>18</b>â². The processing and display unit <b>18</b>â² includes many of the same features as processing and display unit <b>18</b>, but may also incorporate additional features, such as a female connector (not shown) configured to receive the plug <b>154</b>, connecting the rotatable coil assembly <b>152</b> to the processing and display unit <b>18</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The plug <b>154</b> of the rotatable search coil assembly <b>150</b> can be generally cylindrical in shape, and is axially aligned generally along a direction that is perpendicular to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b>. The plug <b>154</b>, after being connected to the processing and display unit <b>18</b>â², preferably is freely rotatable about its alignment axis. This construction allows the rotatable coil assembly <b>152</b> to rotate freely about an axis that is generally perpendicular to the center axis Z of the search coil <b>20</b>. The rotatable coil assembly <b>152</b> enables more convenient viewing of the processing and display unit <b>18</b>â² when scanning angled, irregular, or even downward-facing surfaces of specimens.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">It may further be desirable to locate an implanted PIT tag <b>12</b> and read a tag identification number associated therewith. The signal V<b>2</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> has a message which contains a binary tag identification number sequence along with header information and error-detection bits, as defined by ISO 11784 and 11785 standards. The signal V<b>2</b> and message can be decoded using known techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a circuit <b>160</b> capable of FDX PIT tag location using the example locator circuit <b>70</b>, reading a decoded tag identification number, and automatic detection of the probe is disclosed. This example generally combines the locator circuit <b>70</b> and the audiovisual indicator <b>110</b>, and components shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> are designated with the same reference numbers as similar components shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As described above, the microcontroller <b>72</b> uses the crystal <b>74</b> to control a drive frequency selected to match a resonance frequency of a selected PIT tag <b>12</b>. The drive frequency of the present embodiment is derived from a timer output of the microcontroller <b>72</b>. However, other methods of obtaining the drive frequency are contemplated, such as by using a frequency synthesizer. An output of the microcontroller <b>72</b> is input into a drive circuit <b>76</b> that drives a resonator <b>162</b> (shown in dashed lines) formed from the capacitor CI and a plug-in coil or probe <b>164</b> connected to the circuit <b>160</b> via a socket <b>166</b>. The output of the drive circuit <b>76</b> is connected to one end of the capacitor C<b>1</b>. The other end of the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to the socket <b>164</b> and the demodulator <b>86</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The resonator <b>162</b> is driven at a particular frequency and with enough power to generate an interrogation signal that excites a response from the PIT tag <b>12</b> when electromagnetic coupling between the resonator <b>162</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b> occurs. The response signal generated by the PIT tag <b>12</b> is superimposed onto the interrogating signal across the resonator <b>162</b>, and is demodulated by the demodulator <b>86</b>. A bandpass amplifier <b>90</b> receives the output of the demodulator <b>86</b> which includes the interrogating signal as an input, and separates the interrogating signal from the response signal, as in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The response signal is provided as the output of the bandpass amplifier <b>90</b>, and is input into both a comparator <b>168</b> that converts the response signal to logic levels suitable for the microcontroller interface and a peak detector <b>92</b>. The output of the comparator <b>168</b> includes the tag identification number transmitted by the PIT tag <b>12</b> in its response signal. The output of the peak detector <b>92</b> is a voltage that is related to the distance D between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the coil or probe <b>164</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">A probe detector <b>170</b> detects whether the search coil <b>20</b> or the probe <b>130</b> is connected to the circuit <b>160</b> via the socket <b>166</b>. In another embodiment (not shown) the search coil may be fixed, as in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, and only the probe <b>130</b> attached using a plug and socket. The output of the probe detector <b>170</b> is provided to the microcontroller <b>72</b> so that the microcontroller can properly interpret received data.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Additionally, the microcontroller <b>72</b> is connected to two switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>. The switches allow a user to adjust settings such as audio tone amplitude, and display backlight level. The switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> can also cause the locating apparatus <b>14</b> to read, store, and display the tag identification number of a detected PIT tag that is within range of the locating apparatus. If no PIT tag <b>12</b> is within an operating range (i.e., capable of electromagnetically coupling with the coil or probe <b>164</b>), the switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b> may have the alphanumeric display <b>126</b> show previously-stored tag identification numbers. Microcontroller flash memory or an external EEPROM, for example, may be used to store tag identification numbers and selected audio and/or backlight levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The microcontroller <b>72</b> also provides an output to a frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> to generate a tone that is related to the distance D between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the search coil <b>20</b>. The output of the frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> is input into an amplifier <b>120</b>. Another output of the microcontroller <b>72</b> is fed into a digital-to-analog converter <b>172</b>. The digital-to-analog converter <b>172</b> connects to the amplifier <b>120</b>, and sets the gain of the amplifier. The output of the amplifier <b>120</b> is provided to a loudspeaker <b>106</b>, which creates an audible tone as an indication of the distance D between the PIT tag <b>12</b> and the coil or probe <b>164</b> to a user. The microcontroller <b>72</b> also outputs another signal to the alphanumeric display <b>126</b> which can display a bar graph and scale similar to that described above with respect to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Although the location circuits described in these examples have some response to PIT tags of a different resonant frequency from that to which they are tuned, improved lateral position sensitivity and depth determination occurs when the location circuit and the PIT tag have the same resonant frequency. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> shows one embodiment of a circuit generally designated <b>180</b> that can be tuned to either a 125 kHz or 134.2 kHz resonant frequency PIT tag, and also can read the identification numbers of FDX ISO 134.2 kHz PIT tags. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> has similar components of the examples described in <figref>FIGS. 1-8</figref> identified with similar reference numerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">To locate a PIT tag <b>12</b>, a microcontroller <b>72</b> controls a relay RL<b>1</b> such that one end <b>182</b> of an inductor L<b>1</b> is connected to the voltage Vice and the collector of a transistor Q<b>1</b> is connected to node P. Another end <b>186</b> of inductor L<b>1</b> is also connected to the node P, as is one end <b>188</b> of a capacitor C<b>1</b>. A second end <b>190</b> of the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to both the emitter of a transistor Q<b>1</b> and one end <b>192</b> of a capacitor C<b>2</b>. Another end <b>194</b> of capacitor C<b>2</b> is grounded. Depending on the frequency of the PIT tag <b>12</b> a user is searching for, the microcontroller <b>72</b> may operate a relay RL<b>2</b> such that one end <b>196</b> of an additional capacitor C<b>3</b> is also connected to the node P. The other end <b>198</b> of the capacitor C<b>3</b> is grounded. Increasing the capacitance by use of the capacitor C<b>3</b> changes the resonant frequency of oscillation of the circuit <b>180</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">A peak detector <b>56</b> is also connected to the node P. An output of the peak detector <b>56</b> is input into an error amplifier <b>58</b> and low-pass filter <b>60</b>, and the output of the error amplifier and filter is provided to the base of the transistor Q<b>1</b>. In this configuration the operation of the circuit is as described in relation to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and the voltage at the end <b>202</b> of the resistor R is related to the distance between the inductor L<b>1</b> (search coil <b>20</b>) and the PIT tag <b>12</b>. This voltage is connected to an analog to digital converter <b>112</b>. The output of the analog to digital converter <b>112</b> is input into the microcontroller <b>72</b>, which is controlled by the crystal <b>74</b>. The microcontroller <b>72</b> produces outputs that are used to generate an audio tone and to drive an alphanumeric display <b>126</b> as described above in relation to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In order to read a PIT tag <b>12</b> after it has been located, the microcontroller <b>72</b> controls the relay RL<b>1</b> so that one end <b>182</b> of the inductor L<b>1</b> is connected to a drive circuit, and the node P is connected to a demodulator <b>86</b>. The microcontroller <b>72</b> also controls the frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> to output a signal to the drive circuit <b>76</b> for driving the resonator formed by L<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> at the predetermined resonant frequency. The resonator is driven at a power level such that an interrogating signal is generated and so that a PIT tag <b>12</b> will respond to the interrogating signal when in range (i.e., when the PIT tag is energized). The response signal from the PIT tag <b>12</b> is superimposed across the inductor L<b>1</b> and capacitors C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>. The response signal, is demodulated and input to the microcontroller <b>72</b> as described in relation to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The microcontroller <b>72</b> then determines, displays, and stores the tag identification number from the response signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">It should be noted that this embodiment uses the frequency synthesizer <b>118</b> to provide a timing signal for the driving circuit. This enables the drive frequency (or a plurality of drive frequencies) to be set independently of the crystal frequency, but it does require that audio tone indication be turned off momentarily while reading the PIT tag identification number. The overall power consumption of this embodiment is advantageously reduced, because for most of the time only the low-powered oscillator composed of Q<b>1</b>, L<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> is operating, and the high power drive circuit <b>76</b> is activated only for a brief interval to read the tag number. Additionally, it should be understood that features of the present embodiment can be incorporated into other embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, an exemplary method <b>210</b> of using the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> is shown. The method <b>210</b> includes a step <b>212</b> of providing a search mechanism, such as the search coil <b>20</b>, adjacent to the outer surface of the object <b>16</b> into which the PIT tag <b>12</b> is embedded.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Next, in step <b>214</b> the search mechanism is repositioned along the outer surface of the object, and a user notes the indication provided by either the audio indicator <b>100</b> or the audiovisual indicator <b>110</b>. In step <b>216</b>, the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> is used to identify the embedded PIT tag <b>12</b>. For example, the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b> may receive an identification number from the PIT tag <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In step <b>218</b>, it is determined if the indication value from the indicator <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> is a maximum. A maximum indication value indicates that the current position of the search mechanism corresponds to a minimum straight-line distance D between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b>. The indication value is at a maximum value when, for example the pitch emitted by the indicator <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> is highest, or when the display of the audiovisual indicator <b>110</b> indicates the shortest distance, for example by showing maximum length of a bar-graph.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">If the indicator <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> indicates a maximum value (i.e., if the position of the search coil <b>20</b> corresponds to a minimum distance D), the process proceeds to step <b>220</b>. Otherwise, the process returns to step <b>214</b>, and the search coil is repositioned, and a new indication value is obtained. This repositioning process continues until a maximum indication value is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In step <b>220</b> the lateral position of the embedded PIT tag <b>12</b> is determined. When the indication value reaches a maximum as determined in step <b>214</b>, the lateral position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> is at the center of the search coil <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Next, at step <b>222</b>, the search coil <b>20</b> is placed directly onto the outer surface of the object, with the lateral position of the PIT tag at the center of the search coil. The distance D between the search coil <b>20</b> and the PIT tag <b>12</b>, which is the distance that the PIT tag <b>12</b> is embedded into the object, can be determined based upon one or both of the pitch of the audio tone from the indicator <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, or the display of the audiovisual indicator <b>110</b> as discussed above in relation to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. In this way, a location of the PIT tag can be determined using the PIT tag locating apparatus <b>14</b>. The lateral position of the PIT tag <b>12</b> may be marked through the hole in the search coil <b>20</b> using a suitable marking instrument.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">While an embodiment of the invention has been described herein, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes, modifications and combinations of various example components may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and as set forth in the following claims.</p>
