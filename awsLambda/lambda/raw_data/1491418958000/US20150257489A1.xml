    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Climbing shoes are often used by climbers to protect the foot and to grip or grasp ledges or surface of the rock or other object that is being climbed. Climbers commonly purchase shoes that are sized smaller than the climber's foot in order to maximize the contact of the shoe with the foot. For example, climber's typically want the shoe's arch to remain firmly in contact with the foot's arch and similarly want the toe and heel portions of the shoe to remain firmly in contact with the foot's heel and toe. Maximum contact of the shoe with the foot often provides a significant performance advantage because it allows the climber to grip and feel the surface of the object that is being climbed. These smaller shoes, however, are often uncomfortable and even painful to wear, especially after extended periods of time. The discomfort and/or pain is normally tolerated due to the performance advantage that is achieved via the smaller sized shoes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention is related to closure devices for footwear. The closure devices and other embodiments described herein may be particularly useful for closing and tightening a climbing shoe about a user's foot, although the embodiments may be employed in various other types of footwear. According to one aspect, a tightening system for a climbing shoe includes a tension member that is routed about the climbing shoe along a path via one or more guide members. A tightening mechanism is operationally coupled with the tension member to effect tensioning of the tension member. The tightening system also includes a fit adjustment system that includes a first end, a second end, and a mid-section that extends between the first and second ends. The fit adjustment system also includes a third end, a fourth end, and a mid-section that extends between the third and fourth ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The first end, second end, third end, and fourth end are each: 1) positioned above an upper of the climbing shoe, 2) attached to the climbing shoe near an eyestay of the climbing shoe, and 3) operationally coupled with the tension member so that tensioning of the tension member effects tensioning of the fit adjustment system. The first end of the fit adjustment system is positioned on a first side of the climbing shoe adjacent an upper portion of the eyestay and the second end is positioned adjacent a lower portion of the eyestay on a second side of the climbing shoe opposite the first side. The mid-section of the fit adjustment system extends under an insole and diagonally across the climbing shoe between the first and second ends. The third end of the fit adjustment system is positioned on the second side of the climbing shoe adjacent the upper portion of the eyestay and the fourth end is positioned adjacent the lower portion of the eyestay on the first side of the climbing shoe. The mid-section of the fit adjustment system extends under the insole and diagonally across the climbing shoe between the third and fourth ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, the fit adjustment system is a harness. In such an embodiment, the mid-section is a main body and the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end extend from the main body. In a specific harness embodiment, the first and third ends extend approximately horizontally from the main body and the second and fourth ends extend approximately diagonally from the main body. In another embodiment, the fit adjustment system is a pair of independent straps. In such an embodiment, the mid-section is a main body of each strap and the first and second ends and the third and fourth ends are respective end portions of each strap.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some embodiments, the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end are each coupled with the climbing shoe to form a loop within which the tension member is inserted. In such embodiments, each of the formed loops forms a guide member for routing the tension member along the path. In some embodiments, the tightening system further includes a heel component that is positioned around a heel portion of the climbing shoe and operationally coupled with the tension member. In such embodiments, tensioning of the tension member effects tensioning of the heel component and thereby adjusts a fit of the heel portion about a user's heel.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In some embodiments, the mid-section of the fit adjustment system is positioned within a channel or groove of a rand or outsole, or the mid-section is otherwise unattached from the rand or outsole of the climbing shoe. In such instances, the mid-section is slidable under or relative to the insole of the climbing shoe. In other embodiments, the mid-section of the fit adjustment system is coupled with a rand or outsole of the climbing shoe. In some embodiments, the tightening mechanism is positioned remotely of the climbing shoe or otherwise not attached directly to the climbing shoe. In some embodiments, a knob of the tightening mechanism is removably couplable to the climbing shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to another aspect, a method for configuring a climbing shoe with a tightening system is provided. The method includes routing a tension member about the climbing shoe along a path via one or more guide members and operationally coupling a tightening mechanism with the tension member. The tightening mechanism is configured to effect tensioning of the tension member upon user operation of the tightening mechanism. The method also includes coupling a fit adjustment system with the climbing shoe. The fit adjustment system includes a first end, a second end, and a mid-section that extends between the first and second ends, and also includes a third end, a fourth end, and a mid-section that extends between the third and fourth ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Coupling the fit adjustment system with the climbing shoe includes positioning the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end above an upper of the climbing shoe. The first end is positioned on a first side of the climbing shoe adjacent an upper portion of the eyestay and the second end is positioned on a second side of the climbing shoe adjacent a lower portion of the eyestay. The mid-section extends under an insole and diagonally across the climbing shoe between the first and second ends. The third end is positioned on the second side of the climbing shoe adjacent the upper portion of the eyestay and the fourth end is positioned on the first side of the climbing shoe adjacent the lower portion of the eyestay. The mid-section extends under the insole and diagonally across the climbing shoe between the third and fourth ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Coupling the fit adjustment system with the climbing shoe also includes attaching the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end to the climbing shoe near an eyestay of the climbing shoe and operationally coupling the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end with the tension member so that tensioning of the tension member effects tensioning of the fit adjustment system.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one embodiment, the fit adjustment system is a harness. In such an embodiment, the mid-section is a main body of the harness and the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end extend from the main body. In a specific harness embodiment, the first end and the third end extend approximately horizontally from the main body and the second end and the fourth end extend approximately diagonally from the main body. In another embodiment, the fit adjustment system is a pair of independent straps. In such an embodiment, the mid-section is a main body of each strap and the first and second ends and the third and fourth ends are respective end portions of each strap.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The method may further include coupling the first end, the second end, the third end, and the fourth end with the climbing shoe so that each end forms a loop within which the tension member is insertable. In such embodiments, each of the formed loops forms a guide member for routing the tension member along the path. The method may additionally include positioning a heel component around a heel portion of the climbing shoe and operationally coupling the heel component with the tension member so that tensioning of the tension member effects tensioning of the heel component and thereby adjusts a fit of the heel portion about a user's heel.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some embodiments, the method may additionally include positioning the mid-section of the fit adjustment system within a channel or groove so that the mid-section is unattached from a rand or outsole of the climbing and so that the mid-section is slidable under the insole of the climbing shoe. In other embodiments, the method may additionally include coupling the mid-section of the fit adjustment system with the rand of the climbing shoe. In some embodiments, the tightening mechanism may be positioned remotely of the climbing shoe so that the tightening mechanism is not attached directly to the climbing shoe. In some embodiments, a knob of the tightening mechanism may be removably couplable to the climbing shoe.</p>

      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The ensuing description provides exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing one or more exemplary embodiments. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The embodiments described herein provide various improvements for footwear that is used in rock climbing (hereinafter climbing shoe). The embodiments are directed toward closure devices for climbing shoes and various strap or tension member configurations associated therewith. The closure devices generally include tension members that are tensioned via a tensioning device or mechanism. The tension members are tensioned to tighten the climbing shoe about a user's foot. In many embodiments, the tension member may be a lace or cord that is often constructed or metal, polymer fibers or materials, or some combination thereof. In other embodiments, the tension member may include fabric or other straps and/or a combination of straps and lace. The tightening mechanism used to tension the tension members and thereby tighten the climbing shoe may include a reel based mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The reel based mechanism may include a reel assembly having a knob that is graspable by a user and a spool that is contained within a housing. The tension member (e.g., lace) may be coupled with a channel of the spool and windable there around by grasping and rotating the knob in a tightening direction (i.e., clockwise). Winding of the tension member around the spool may tension the tension member and tighten the climbing shoe. The tension of the tension member may likewise be released via operation of the reel based mechanism. For example, the knob may be grasped and pulled axially upward relative to the housing to release the tension, or the knob may be rotated in a loosening direction (e.g., counter-clockwise) to release the lace tension. In other embodiments, a button, lever, or other mechanism may be used to release the lace tension. The reel based mechanism may include various other internal components, such as interlocking teeth, pawls, clutching mechanisms, springs, clamps, and the like, that enable the various functions of the reel based mechanism. Exemplary embodiments of reel based mechanism are further described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2011/0266384, filed Apr. 29, 2011, and titled âReel Based Lacing Systemâ; U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/328,521, filed Jul. 10, 2014, and titled âClosure Devices Including Incremental Release Mechanisms and Methods Therefor,â the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">For convenience in describing the embodiments herein, the tightening mechanism will be generally referred to as being a reel based mechanism, such as those described above. It should be realized, however, that many of the embodiments described herein may be used with other tightening mechanism, such as pull cord based mechanisms, tie or knot based mechanisms, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to limit the rotation of the climbing shoe about the user's foot. For example, climbers often place a portion of their shoes on rather small ledges or protrusions and press against the ledges or protrusions in climbing. The climber may place any portion of the shoe against the ledge or protrusion in climbing (e.g., the toe, heel, medial, lateral, upper, or sole of the shoe). In pressing against the ledge or protrusion, significant rotations or torsional forces may be imparted to the shoe. For gripping purposes and/or to transfer a force to the ledge or protrusion, the climber may not want the climbing shoe to twist or rotate about the foot due to the imparted torsional forces. In some embodiments, a harness or straps may be sued to limit or minimize the rotation of the climbing shoe due to the torsional forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">An additional concern with climbing shoes is the fit of the shoe about the climber's foot. Climbers commonly purchase shoes that are 1-2 sizes smaller than the climber's foot to maximize the contact of the shoe against the foot. For example, climber's typically want the shoe's arch to remain firmly in contact with the foot's arch and similarly want the toe and heel portions of the shoe to remain firmly in contact with the foot's heel and toe. Maximum contact of the shoe with the foot often provides a significant performance advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The smaller sized shoes, however, may be uncomfortably and even painful to wear, especially after long periods of time. The discomfort and/or pain are often tolerated due to the performance advantage that is achieved via the smaller sized shoes. The straps or harness described herein may also provide a fit advantage by enabling a climber to wear larger sized climbing shoes without sacrificing the fit or contact of the shoe with the foot. For example, the harness and/or straps may pull the shoe's arch, forefoot, and heel firmly against the foot's arch, toes, and heel, respectively. Accordingly, the embodiments described herein may maximize the climbing shoe's performance while increasing user comfort in wearing and using the shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, illustrated are embodiments of harnesses or straps that may be used to prevent or limit rotation of the climbing shoe and/or improve the fit and comfort of wearing the climbing shoe. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>100</b> having a reel based mechanism <b>102</b> that is operable to tension lace <b>104</b> that is guided or routed along a path about a tongue portion of the shoe <b>100</b>. Tensioning of the lace <b>104</b> causes opposing sides of the tongue portion of the shoe to be pulled toward one another, which tightens the shoe about the user's foot. The shoe <b>100</b> includes an upper <b>112</b> that is commonly made of fabric or another lightweight, durable, and breathable material. The shoe <b>100</b> also includes a sole or rand <b>110</b> that is commonly made of an elastic and grippable type material, such as rubber. The rand <b>110</b> aids in gripping small and/or tight spaces of the rock or object the individual is climbing.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A pair of straps <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are positioned on an outer surface of the upper <b>112</b> and within the rand <b>110</b>. The pair of straps <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> crisscross one another near a bottom surface of the shoe and under the rand <b>110</b>. The crisscrossing of the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, result in opposing end portions of the straps being positioned toward the heel and toward the forefoot of the shoe <b>100</b>. For example, a proximal end of strap <b>106</b> is positioned toward the heel and coupled near the shoe's eyestay adjacent the reel based mechanism <b>102</b>. The strap <b>106</b> traverses underneath the rand <b>110</b> and toward the forefoot of the shoe <b>100</b> so that a distal end of the strap <b>106</b> is positioned toward the forefoot of the shoe and is coupled near the shoe's eyestay on the opposite side of the shoe's tongue. Similarly, a proximal end of strap <b>108</b> is positioned toward the forefoot of the shoe <b>100</b> and is coupled near the shoe's eyestay. The strap <b>108</b> traverses underneath the rand <b>110</b> (crossing strap <b>106</b>) and toward the heel of the shoe <b>100</b> so that a distal end of the strap <b>108</b> is positioned toward the heel and is coupled near the shoe's eyestay on the opposite side of the shoe's tongue.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, are coupled to the shoe to form loops or guides <b>114</b> through which the lace <b>104</b> is inserted. Tensioning of the lace <b>104</b> causes the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, to be tensioned, which pulls the shoe <b>100</b> tightly against the user's foot. The shoe <b>100</b> may also include one or more additional fabric loops or guides <b>116</b> through which the lace <b>104</b> is inserted. The straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, are made of a relatively inelastic material such that the straps do not stretch or deform under tension. Because the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, crisscross in the above-described manner and are made of a relatively inelastic material, the straps minimize or limit rotation of the shoe <b>100</b> due to torsional forces imparted to the shoe <b>100</b> during climbing. In addition, because each of the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, traverse from near the heel toward the forefoot of the shoe <b>100</b>, the straps pull the forefoot of the shoe against the user's toes and pull the heel of the shoe against the user's heel. Further, because each of the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, traverse under the rand <b>110</b> near the shoe's arch, the shoe's arch is pulled upward and against the foot's arch.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Because the shoe's forefoot, heel, and arch are pulled tightly against the foot's toes, heel, and arch, respectively, the fit or contact of the shoe with the foot is greatly increased. This allows larger shoes to be wornâe.g., shoes closer to the user's foot sizeâwithout sacrificing the performance of the shoe, thereby increasing the comfort and performance of the shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In some embodiments, the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, may be positioned under the rand <b>110</b> so as to be movable relative thereto. For example, the rand <b>110</b> may include channels or tunnels within which the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, are positioned. The channels or tunnels of the rand <b>110</b> may allow the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, to slide or move relative to the rand <b>110</b>. This configuration may allow the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, to increase the contact and fit of the shoe <b>100</b> about the user's foot and/or limit rotation of the shoe since the tension and torsional forces are imparted on the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, and not necessarily to the shoe's other materials. In some embodiments, the channels or tunnels may be formed via stitching or adhesion of the adjacent material layers, such as the rand, upper, and/or sole material. Exemplary embodiments of forming tunnels or channels via stitching or adhesion of adjacent material layers of a shoe are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/479,173, filed Sep. 5, 2014, and titled âGuides and Components for Closure Systems and Methods Therefor,â the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In other embodiments, the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, may be coupled with the rand <b>110</b> so that tensioning of the straps tensions the rand. Tensioning of the rand <b>110</b> via the straps, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, may cause the rand to deform or stretch, which may pull the shoe's arch into contact with the foot's arch and/or otherwise cause the tension and/or torsional forces to be imparted to the straps.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated is another embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>200</b> having a reel based mechanism <b>202</b> that is configured to tension lace <b>204</b>. The shoe <b>200</b> includes a pair of straps, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, that are attached near the shoe's eyestay and that traverse between the heel and the forefoot of the shoe as previously described. The straps, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, crisscross beneath the rand <b>210</b> of the shoe <b>200</b> to provide torsional or rotational resistance as previously described. In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, each strap, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, is configured to traverse between the heel and forefoot of the shoe <b>200</b> to form a W type pattern. For example, a proximal portion of strap <b>206</b> is positioned near the shoe's heel and is coupled near the shoe's eyestay. The strap <b>206</b> traverses under the rand <b>210</b> so that a middle portion of the strap <b>206</b> is positioned on the opposite side of the shoe and is coupled near a mid-point along the shoe's tongue and eyestay. The strap <b>206</b> again traverses under the rand <b>210</b> so that a distal portion of the strap <b>206</b> is positioned near the forefoot of the shoe and is coupled near the shoe's eyestay. The resulting configuration forms a W-type or shaped pattern between the shoe's heel and forefoot. Strap <b>208</b> has a similar configuration, but on the opposite side of the shoe. The additional crossing of the straps, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, may aid in pulling the shoe more tightly against the foot and/or limit the rotation of the shoe due to torsional forces imparted on the shoe when climbing. As with the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the straps, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, may be positioned above the upper <b>212</b> and within tunnels or channels formed with or between the rand <b>210</b>, or the straps, <b>206</b> and/or <b>208</b>, may be fixedly attached to the rand <b>210</b>. Tensioning of the lace <b>204</b> causes the straps, <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, to be tensioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a shoe <b>300</b> having a similar embodiment to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, except that the straps, <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, are positioned above the rand <b>310</b> rather than below the rand. In some embodiments, the rand <b>310</b> may be âfloatingâ or unattached to the upper material. Positioning the straps, <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>, above the rand <b>310</b> may cause the rand <b>310</b> to be pressed against the shoe and against the user's foot as the straps are tensioned via the lace and reel based mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 4-4C</figref>, illustrated are various embodiments of harnesses that may be used with the climbing shoe. The harnesses may be used in place of the straps described in the previous embodiments. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a harness <b>402</b> may be coupled with the shoe so that a main body portion of the harness <b>402</b> is positioned under the shoe's rand <b>410</b>. Opposing arms, <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>, that extend from the harness's main body may extend from the rand <b>410</b> and be positioned above the shoe's upper <b>412</b>. The opposing arms, <b>404</b> and <b>406</b>, may be tensionable via lace (not shown) and function similar to the straps described in the previous embodiments to limit rotation of the shoe and/or pull the shoe's arch, forefoot, and heel tightly against the foot's arch, toes, and heel, respectively. In many embodiments, the harness <b>402</b> may be made of a single piece of material, such as fabric or various other inelastic materials. In other embodiments, the harness <b>402</b> may be made of multiple sections.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIGS. 4A-C</figref> illustrate various embodiments of other harnesses that may be used to prevent rotation of the shoe and/or pull the shoe tightly against the user's foot. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, a first embodiment of a harness <b>430</b> may have a roughly X configuration. First harness <b>430</b> may be used in instances where it is not desired to pull the forefoot of the shoe tightly against the user's toes. This embodiment may be ideal for beginning climbers or other climbers that are mostly interested in comfort. Harness <b>430</b> includes a pair first arms <b>434</b> and a pair of second arms <b>432</b> that extend from the main body portion of harness <b>430</b> in roughly opposite diagonal directions to form the X configuration. Tensioning of harness <b>430</b> simultaneously pulls the main body portion of harness <b>430</b> toward the forefoot and heel of the shoe. As such, the tension placed on the arms, <b>432</b> and <b>434</b>, slightly counteracts so that the forefoot and heel of the shoe are pulled against the foot's toes and heel, respectively, but not as aggressively as in the other illustrated harness configurations. The angle of the arms, <b>432</b> and <b>434</b>, may be varied as desired to alter the force with which the harness <b>430</b> pulls the forefoot and heel against the user's foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, harness <b>420</b> is similar to harness <b>430</b> except that a first pair of arms <b>422</b> extend roughly orthogonally from the main body portion of harness <b>420</b> while a second set of arms <b>424</b> extend at an angle from the main body portion. The harness <b>420</b> may be coupled with the shoe so that the first pair of arms <b>422</b> are closer to the forefoot than the second pair of arms <b>424</b>. Stated differently, the harness <b>420</b> may be positioned with respect to the shoe so that the second pair of arms <b>424</b> point toward the heel of the shoe. In other embodiments, this orientation may be reversed. This configuration results in the first pair of arms <b>422</b> tensioning the shoe circumferentially about the foot so that the portion of the shoe adjacent the first pair of arms <b>422</b> is pressed or pulled tightly against the user's foot. This configuration also results in the first pair of arms <b>422</b> counteracting the tension of the second pair of arms <b>424</b> to a much lesser degree than harness <b>430</b>. As such, the second pair of arms <b>424</b> are able to pull the forefoot of the shoe more tightly against the user's toes. This configuration may be ideal for climber's that are relatively interested in comfort, but also concerned with increasing shoe/foot contact.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>, harness <b>440</b> is similar to the previous harnesses except that both a first pair of arms <b>442</b> and a second pair of arms <b>444</b> are angled in roughly the same direction with respect to the main body portion. The harness <b>440</b> may be coupled with the shoe so that the first pair of arms <b>442</b> and the second pair of arms <b>444</b> are directed roughly toward the heel. In other embodiments, this orientation may be reversed so that the first pair of arms <b>442</b> and the second pair of arms <b>444</b> point toward the forefoot. This configuration results in the tension provided of the first pair of arms <b>442</b> and the second pair of arms <b>444</b> cooperating to aggressively pull the forefoot of the shoe against the user's toes. The configuration may be ideal for climbers that are most interested in maximizing the contact of the shoe with the foot in addition to limiting rotation of the shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 5A-B</figref>, illustrated are cross-sections of a climbing shoe showing various configurations of a harness or strap. Specifically, <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates a harness <b>502</b> that is positioned above the shoe's upper or insole <b>504</b> and below the shoe's rand <b>506</b>. The harness <b>502</b> may be positioned within channels or tunnels of the rand <b>506</b> or may be fixedly attached thereto as previously described. The rand <b>506</b> in turn is coupled with the upper or insole <b>504</b>. The shoe may also include an outsole <b>508</b> that is coupled or otherwise positioned above the rand <b>506</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates a harness <b>512</b> that is positioned above an upper or insole <b>514</b> and below the rand <b>516</b>. Harness <b>512</b> may transition from above the upper <b>514</b> to below the upper and within the shoe at or near the intersection of the rand <b>516</b> and the upper <b>514</b>. <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> also illustrates the rand <b>516</b> âfloatingâ or otherwise being unattached to the upper <b>514</b>. In these embodiments, the rand <b>516</b> may flex or bend away from the upper <b>514</b>. The shoe may also include an outsole <b>518</b> is coupled with or otherwise positioned above the rand <b>516</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment in which the previously described straps and/or harnesses may be coupled with the shoe's rand. A distal end of the strap <b>602</b> is coupled with the upper material <b>606</b> near the shoe's eyestay <b>604</b>. The strap <b>602</b> extends across the shoe's upper <b>606</b> and is coupled with the rand <b>608</b>. Tensioning of the strap <b>602</b> causes the rand <b>608</b>, which is typically made of a relatively elastic material, to stretch and conform to and/or about the user's foot. In some embodiments, the upper material <b>606</b> may also be made of a stretchable or elastic material, or a fabric material that is designed or arranged to stretch, so that the upper <b>606</b> stretches to some degree and thereby conforms to the user's foot. In other embodiments, the upper <b>606</b> may be made of a relatively inelastic material so that the upper <b>606</b> does not stretch as the strap <b>602</b> is tensioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the straps are replaced with lace, such as the lace that is coupled with the reel based mechanism. In such embodiments, a first guide <b>624</b> is attached to the rand <b>618</b> while a second guide <b>620</b> is attached to the upper material <b>616</b> near the shoe's eyestay <b>614</b>. The lace <b>612</b> is routed between the first and second guides, <b>624</b> and <b>620</b>, and may be tensionable via operation of a reel based mechanism (not shown). The lace <b>612</b> functions similar to the previously described straps and/or harnesses. In some embodiments, the lace includes a gross adjustment components <b>622</b> that allows a length of the lace between the rand <b>618</b> and the eyestay <b>614</b> to be adjusted. For example, the lace <b>612</b> may include one or more coupling components, protrusions, or knobs that may be releasably coupled with an aperture of the second guide <b>620</b>. The lace <b>612</b> may be pulled relative to the second guide <b>620</b> and coupled thereto to adjust a length of the lace between the first guide <b>624</b> and the second guide <b>620</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In some embodiments, it may be desirable to pull the heel portion of the climbing shoe tightly against the user's heel and/or to adjust the fit of the heel portion of the shoe about the user's heel. <figref>FIGS. 7A-D</figref> illustrate various embodiments that may be used to pull the heel portion of the climbing shoe tightly against the user's heel and/or to adjust the fit of the heel portion of the shoe about the user's heel. Referring now to <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>700</b> in which the lace <b>702</b> is wrapped around the heel portion of the shoe <b>700</b> to pull or press the heel portion of the shoe firmly against the user's heel. Specifically, as the reel based mechanism <b>708</b> is operated, the lace <b>702</b> is tensioned, which presses the heel portion of the shoe against the user's foot. The lace <b>702</b> is coupled with a guide <b>704</b> that is attached to the heel portion of the shoe. In some embodiments, the guide <b>704</b> includes a plurality of channels <b>706</b> within which the lace <b>702</b> is positioned. Repositioning of the lace <b>702</b> within a respective channel <b>706</b> vertically adjusts the position of the lace <b>702</b> about the heel portion of the shoe. This vertical adjustment of the lace <b>702</b> relative to the shoe's heel portion alters the force with which the heel portion is pressed against the user's heel.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>710</b> having a component that presses or pulls the heel portion of the shoe against the user's heel.

      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of a reel based mechanism <b>808</b> having a knob portion <b>802</b> that is removable from a body <b>800</b> of a footwear (i.e., climbing shoe). The knob portion <b>802</b> includes a shaft <b>804</b> that is insertable within an aperture <b>806</b> of the reel based mechanism <b>808</b>. The shaft <b>804</b> may be keyed so as to engage with a corresponding keyed or geared mechanism within the reel based mechanism <b>808</b>. Rotation of the knob portion <b>802</b> may cause the lace <b>810</b> to be wound around a spool (not shown) that is positioned within the reel based mechanism <b>808</b>. The removable knob <b>802</b> may allow a climber to tighten the shoe and then remove the knob <b>802</b> to prevent accidental opening or contact with the knob <b>802</b>. A cover member (not shown) may automatically cover the aperture <b>806</b> when the knob <b>802</b> is removed to prevent dirt and debris from contaminating and/or fouling the internal components of the reel based mechanism <b>808</b>. In some embodiments, the climber's gear or apparel may include a knob storage pocket or receiver (not shown) that is configured to house the knob <b>802</b> when the knob is removed from the climbing shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>820</b> in which a reel based mechanism <b>822</b> is located remotely of the shoe. For example, the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> may be attached to a sleeve <b>830</b> that may be fit about the user's leg. The lace <b>826</b> of the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> may be routed from the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> to the shoe <b>820</b> via tubing <b>824</b>. In some embodiments, the body of the tubing may include a plurality of beads <b>828</b> having a central aperture or lumen through which the lace <b>826</b> is inserted. The beads <b>826</b> may allow the tube body to bend or flex to a relatively high degree as the user moves his or her foot during climbing. Remotely locating the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> from the shoe <b>820</b> allows the climber to use the full surface of the shoe without worrying about nearby objects contacting or hitting the reel based mechanism <b>822</b>. Remotely locating the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> also prevents the reel based mechanism <b>822</b> from catching or hanging up on objects as the user climbs and manipulates the shoe <b>820</b> about challenging terrain.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 8C</figref> illustrates a similar embodiment of a climbing shoe <b>840</b> having a remotely located reel based mechanism <b>842</b>. Unlike the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, however, the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> is not attached to a sleeve <b>830</b>. Rather, the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> may be removably attached to various objects or materials. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8C</figref> the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> may be coupled with the climber's sock. In other embodiments, the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> may be attached to the user's pant or elsewhere as desired. The reel based mechanism <b>842</b> may include a Velcro surface, or other coupling mechanism, that allows the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> to be releasably coupled with the climber's apparel or other objects as desired. Similar to the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, the lace <b>846</b> of the reel based mechanism <b>842</b> may be routed through tubing <b>844</b> that may include a plurality of beaded surfaces <b>848</b> to increase the flexibility of the tubing <b>844</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, illustrated is another embodiment of climbing shoe <b>900</b> having a reel based mechanism <b>902</b> that is operable to tension lace <b>903</b> and thereby tighten the climbing shoe <b>900</b>. The reel based mechanism <b>902</b> is positioned about a panel <b>904</b> that is foldable over the shoe's tongue portion. The reel based mechanism <b>902</b> is positioned about the panel <b>904</b> so as to be located on the lateral side of the shoe <b>900</b> between the shoe's eyestay and tongue. Positioning of the reel based mechanism <b>902</b> in this location typically decreases a chance of contact between the reel based mechanism <b>902</b> and surrounding objects since this portion of the shoe <b>900</b> is not commonly used in rock climbing. Coupling of the reel based mechanism <b>902</b> in this location and/or the use of panel <b>904</b> also relocates the closure zone <b>906</b> of the lace <b>903</b> from the shoe's tongue toward the lateral side of the shoe. Positioning of the closure zone <b>906</b> toward the lateral side of the shoe <b>900</b> may decrease the pressure points about the user's foot that may be formed from closure zones positioned closer to the tongue. The creation of pressure points may be problematic in climbing shoes due to the smaller shoe sizes commonly used. Decreasing such pressure points may increase the comfort of wearing the climbing shoe <b>900</b>. Climbing shoe <b>900</b> also includes a strap that extends from a first side <b>910</b><i>a</i>, around the heel portion of the shoe <b>900</b>, and to a second side <b>910</b><i>b </i>of the shoe. The shoe <b>900</b> may also include one or more wider straps, <b>908</b><i>a </i>and <b>908</b><i>b</i>, that wrap around the shoe <b>900</b> toward the forefront of the shoe and help close the shoe <b>900</b> about the user's foot.</p>
