      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The step of manufacturing a semiconductor device includes the step of forming a silicon insulating film such as a silicon oxide film (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and a silicon nitride film (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) on a wafer such as a silicon wafer. The silicon oxide film has excellent insulation property and low dielectric property, and is widely used as an insulating film and an inter-layer film. Further, the silicon nitride film has excellent insulation property, corrosion-resistant property, and film stress controllability, etc., and is widely used as the insulating film and a mask film, a charge storage film, and a stress control film. A formation method includes a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, etc. When a silicon insulating film is formed by the CVD method and the ALD method, either a chlorosilane-based source or an aminosilane-based source is generally used for example, as a silicon source (for example see patent document 1).</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">However, when the insulating film is formed particularly in a low temperature region, using either the chlorosilane-based source or the aminosilane-based source, reduction of a film quality is observed, like a case that the insulating film with low silicon density is formed. Further, when SiH<sub>4 </sub>and Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>are used for depositing silicon in a process of forming the insulating film, thin film control is carried out by adjusting a wafer temperature and an inner pressure of a processing chamber. However, layered deposition is difficult in this case, and therefore a deposition method by surface reaction is expected. Note that according to an experiment by inventors of the present invention, it is difficult to deposit silicon at a film formation rate satisfying a production efficiency, when the chlorosilane-based source alone is used and when temperature is set to 550Â° C. or less. Further, when the aminosilane-based source alone is used, deposition of silicon is not confirmed at 550Â° C. or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, a method for processing a substrate and a substrate processing apparatus, capable of forming a high quality insulating film in a low temperature region, when the insulating film is formed using a chlorosilane-based source and an aminosilane-based source.</p>

The supply flow rate of the HCD gas controlled by the mass flow controller <b>241</b><i>a </i>is set in a range of 1 to 1000 sccm for example. The supply flow rate of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas controlled by the mass flow controller <b>241</b><i>e </i>is set in a range of 200 to 10000 sccm for example. The supply flow rate of the N<sub>2 </sub>gas controlled by the mass flow controller <b>241</b><i>e </i>is set in a range of 200 to 10000 sccm. The time required for exposing the HCD gas to the wafer <b>200</b>, namely the gas supply time (irradiation time) is set in a range of 1 to 120 seconds for example, and preferably set in a range of 1 to 60 seconds. The temperature of the heater <b>207</b> at this time, is set so that the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> is in a range of 250 to 700Â° C. and preferably in a range of 350 to 600Â° C. for example. Note that when the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> is set to less than 250Â° C., HCD is hardly chemically adsorbed on the wafer <b>200</b>, and a practical film formation speed cannot be obtained in some cases. This can be solved by setting the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> to 250Â° C. or more. Note that HCD can be sufficiently adsorbed on the wafer <b>200</b> by setting the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> to 350Â° C. or more, and further sufficient film formation speed can be obtained. Further, when the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> exceeds 700Â° C., CVD reaction is strongly exhibited (vapor phase reaction is dominant), to thereby easily deteriorate the uniformity of the film thickness, thus making it difficult to control the film thickness. The deterioration of the uniformity in the film thickness can be suppressed by setting the temperature of the wafer in a range of 200 to 700Â° C. or less, thus making it easy to control the film thickness. Particularly, surface reaction is dominant by setting the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> to 600Â° C. or less, thus making it easy to secure the uniformity in the film thickness, thus making it easy to control the film thickness. Therefore, the temperature of the wafer <b>200</b> is preferably set in a range of 250 to 700Â° C. and preferably in a range of 350 to 600Â° C.</p>

The silicon-containing layer may be a chemical adsorption layer of HCD, or may be a silicon layer (Si layer), or may include both of them. Here, the silicon layer includes not only a continuous layer made of silicon, but also a discontinuous layer or a thin film formed by overlap of them. Note that the discontinuous layer made of silicon is sometimes called the thin film. Further, the chemical adsorption layer of HCD includes not only a continuous chemical adsorption layer of HCD molecules, but also a discontinuous chemical adsorption layer. Note that the layer of less than 1 atomic layer means the atomic layer formed discontinuously. When the thickness of the silicon-containing layer formed on the wafer <b>200</b> exceeds several atomic layers, nitriding action in step 3 as will be described later does not reach an entire body of the silicon-containing layer. Further, a minimum value of the silicon-containing layer that can be formed on the wafer <b>200</b> is less than 1 atomic layer. Therefore, the thickness of the silicon-containing layer is preferably set to less than 1 atomic layer to several atomic layers. Note that the silicon layer is formed by deposition of silicon on the wafer <b>200</b>, and the chemical adsorption layer of HCD is formed by chemical adsorption of HCD on the wafer <b>200</b>.

Similarly to steps 1 to 2, the temperature of the heater <b>207</b> at this time is set so that the temperature of the wafer is set in a range of 250 to 700Â° C., and is preferably in a range of 350 to 600Â° C. When the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas is plasma-excited, the high frequency power applied between the first rod electrode <b>269</b> and the second rod electrode <b>270</b> from the high frequency power source <b>273</b>, is the power in a range of 50 to 1000 W for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The gas flowed through the processing chamber <b>201</b> at this time, is the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas thermally activated by increasing the pressure in the processing chamber <b>201</b>, or the active species obtained by plasma-exciting the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, and neither the HCD gas nor the 3DMAS gas is flowed through the processing chamber <b>201</b>. Accordingly, the activated NH<sub>3 </sub>gas or the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas turned into the active species, is reacted with at least a part of the first layer containing Si, N, and C formed on the wafer <b>200</b> in step 2, without causing the vapor phase reaction.

Note that at this time, by a thermally nitriding action of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, SiâN bond in the first layer is increased and meanwhile SiâC bond and SiâSi bond are reduced, thus reducing the ratio of C-component and the ratio of Si-component in the first layer. Namely, the first layer can be modified to the SiCN layer while varying the composition ratio in a direction of increasing the nitrogen concentration, and in a direction of reducing the carbon concentration and the silicon concentration. Further, the ratio of N-component in the SiCN layer, namely the nitrogen concentration can be finely adjusted by controlling processing conditions such as the pressure in the processing chamber <b>201</b> and the gas supply time.</p>

At this time, the first layer can be modified to the SiN layer by making the C-component in the first layer desorbed by energy of the active species, while increasing the ratio of the N-component in the first layer. Note that at this time, by plasma-nitriding action of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, SiâC bond and SiâSi bond are reduced while SiâN bond in the first layer is increased, and the ratio of the C-component and the ratio of the Si-component in the first layer are reduced. Particularly, the C-component is reduced to an impurity level or substantially disappears by desorption of its major part. Namely, the first layer can be modified to the SiN layer while varying a composition ratio in a direction of increasing the nitrogen concentration or in a direction of reducing the carbon concentration and the silicon concentration. Further, at this time, the ratio of the N-component in the SiN layer, namely the nitrogen concentration can be finely adjusted by controlling the processing conditions such as the pressure in the processing chamber <b>201</b> and the gas supply time.

      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Note that at this time, the nitriding reaction of the first layer is preferably not to be saturated. For example, when the first layer of 1 atomic layer or less than 1 atomic layer is formed in steps 1, 2, a part of the first layer is preferably not to be nitrided. In this case, nitriding is performed under a condition that the nitriding reaction of the first layer is unsaturated so that an entire body of the first layer of 1 atomic layer or less than 1 atomic layer is not nitrided.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Note that in order to set the nitriding reaction of the first layer in an unsaturated state, the aforementioned processing condition is used as the processing condition in step 3, and the nitriding reaction of the first layer is easily set in the unsaturated state by using the following processing condition as the processing condition in step 3.</p>

Accordingly, the O<sub>2 </sub>gas activated or turned into the active species, without causing the vapor phase reaction, is reacted with at least a part of the first layer containing Si, N, and C formed on the wafer <b>200</b> in step 2. Thus, the first layer is oxidized and is modified to the second layer including the silicon oxycarbonitride layer (SiOCN layer), the silicon oxide layer (SiO layer), or the silicon oxycabide layer (SiOC layer).</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>), the first layer can be modified (changed) to the SiOCN layer of the SiOC layer by thermally oxidizing the first layer by flowing the thermally activated O<sub>2 </sub>gas through the processing chamber <b>201</b>. At this time, the first layer is modified to the SiOCN layer or the SiOC layer while adding the O-component to the first layer. At this time, by thermally oxidizing action of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, SiâN bond, SiâC bond, and SiâSi bond are reduced, while SiâO bond is increased in the first layer, and the ratio of N-component, the ratio of C-component, and the ratio of Si-component in the first layer are reduced. At this time, by prolonging the thermally oxidation time or by increasing an oxidizing power of the thermal oxidation by the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, a major part of the N-component is desorbed to reduce the N-component to an impurity level, to achieve a substantial disappearance of the N-component. Namely, the first layer can be modified to the SiOCN layer or the SiOC layer while varying the composition ratio in a direction of increasing the oxygen concentration and in a direction of reducing the nitrogen concentration, the carbon concentration, and the silicon concentration. Further, at this time, the processing conditions such as the pressure in the processing chamber <b>201</b> and the gas supply time are controlled, so that the ratio of the O-component in the SiOCN layer, namely the oxygen concentration can be finely adjusted. Thus, the composition ratio of the SiOCN layer can be more strictly controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">Further, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>), the active species obtained by plasma-exciting the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is flowed into the processing chamber <b>201</b>, to plasma-oxidize the first layer and modify (change) the first layer to the SiO layer or the SiOC layer. At this time, the first layer can be modified to the SiO layer by making both components of the C-component and the N-component in the first layer desorbed by the energy of the active species while adding the O-component to the first layer. At this time, owing to the action of the plasma oxidation by the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, SiâO bond in the first layer is increased and meanwhile SiâN bond, SiâC bond, and SiâSi bond are reduced, and the ratio of the N-component in the first layer, and the ratio of the C-component and the ratio of the Si-component are reduced. Particularly, a major part of the N-component and the C-component is desorbed to be reduced to the impurity level, or substantially disappears. Namely, the first layer can be modified to the SiO layer while varying the composition ratio in a direction of increasing the oxygen concentration or in a direction of reducing the nitrogen concentration, the carbon concentration, and the silicon concentration. Further, at this time, the N-component in the first layer is desorbed by the energy of the active species and a part of the C-component is remained without being desorbed, to thereby modify the first layer to the SiOC layer. At this time, by the action of the plasma oxidation by the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, SiâO bond is increased, and meanwhile SiâN bond, SiâC bond, and SiâSi bond are reduced in the first layer, and the ratio of the N-component, the ratio of the C-component, and the ratio of the Si-component in the first layer are reduced. Particularly, a major part of the N-component is desorbed to be reduced to the impurity level, or substantially disappears. Namely, the first layer can be modified to the SiOC layer while varying the composition ratio in a direction of increasing the oxygen concentration, or in a direction of reducing the nitrogen concentration, the carbon concentration, and the silicon concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">Note that it is found that the C-component in the first layer formed in steps 1 and 2, is in a rich state compared with the N-component. For example, according to a certain experiment, the carbon concentration is sometimes about twice or more of the nitrogen concentration. Namely, when the C-component and the N-component in the first layer are desorbed by the energy of the active species, the C-component remains even in a stage in which the major part of the N-component is desorbed. Then, oxidation is stopped in this state, to modify the first layer to the SiOC layer. Further, the oxidation is continued even after the end of the desorption of the major part of the N-component, and the oxidation is stopped in a stage in which the major part of the C-component is desorbed, to thereby modify the first layer to the SiO layer. Specifically, the ratio of the C-component, namely the carbon concentration can be controlled by controlling the gas supply time (oxidation treatment time), and either SiO layer or SiOC layer can be formed while controlling the composition ratio. Further, at this time, the ratio of the O-component in the SiO layer or the SiOC layer, namely the oxygen concentration can be finely adjusted by controlling the processing conditions such as the pressure and the gas supply time in the processing chamber <b>201</b>. Thus, the composition ratio of the SiO layer or the SiOC layer can be more strictly controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">At this time, an oxidation reaction of the first layer is preferably not to be saturated. For example, when the first layer of 1 atomic layer or less than 1 atomic layer is formed in steps 1 and 2, a part of the first layer is preferably oxidized.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">In this case, oxidation is performed under a condition that the oxidation reaction of the first layer is unsaturated, so that an entire body of the first layer of 1 atomic layer or less than 1 atomic layer is not oxidized.</p>

      <p id="p-00298-en" num="0298">Note that when the O<sub>2 </sub>gas is thermally activated and is flowed into the processing chamber <b>201</b>, to thermally oxidize the SiCN layer and modify it to the SiOCN layer, the SiCN layer is modified to the SiOCN layer while adding the O-component of the SiCN layer. Further, at this time, by the thermal oxidizing action of the O<sub>2 </sub>gas, the SiâO bond in the SiCN layer is increased and meanwhile SiâN bond, SiâC bond, and SiâSi bond are reduced in the SiCN layer, and the ratio of the N-component, the ratio of the C-component, and the ratio of the Si-component in the SiCN layer are reduced. Namely, the SiCN layer and the SiOCN layer can be modified while varying the composition ratio in a direction of increasing the oxygen concentration, and in a direction of reducing the nitrogen concentration, the carbon concentration, and the silicon concentration. Further, at this time, the ratio of the O-component in the SiOCN layer, namely the oxygen concentration can be finely adjusted by controlling the processing conditions such as the pressure in the processing chamber <b>201</b> and the gas supply time. Thus the composition ratio of the SiOCN layer can be more strictly controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0299">In addition, at this time, the oxidizing reaction of the SiCN layer is preferably not to be saturated. Namely, a part of the SiCN layer is preferably not to be oxidized. In this case, oxidation is performed under a condition that the oxidizing reaction of the SiCN layer is unsaturated, so that the entire body of the SiCN layer is not oxidized. Note that in order to set the oxidizing reaction of the SiCN layer in the unsaturated state, the processing conditions in step 4 may be the same as the processing conditions in the step 4 of the sixth sequence (step 3 of the third sequence).</p>

      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0340">According to this embodiment, when the insulating film is formed using the chlorosilane-based source and the aminosilane-based source, the silicon insulating film having a desired composition with high silicon density can be formed in a low temperature region. Further, an ideal stoichiometric silicon insulating film can be formed. Note that according to the inventors of the present invention, it is difficult to deposit silicon on the wafer at a film formation rate of satisfying a production efficiency in a temperature zone of 550Â° C. or less. Moreover, when the aminosilane-based source is used alone, deposition of the silicon on the wafer cannot be confirmed in the temperature zone of 550Â° C. or less. However, according to the technique of this embodiment, an excellent silicon insulating film can be formed at the film formation rate of satisfying the production efficiency, even in the low temperature zone of 550Â° C. or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0341">Note that when the film formation temperature is lowered, usually, kinetic energy of a molecule is also lowered, thus hardly causing the reaction and desorption of chlorine included in the chlorosilane-based source and amine included in the aminosilane-based source, and ligands of them are remained on the surface of the wafer. Then, such residual ligands inhibit the adsorption of the silicon on the surface of the wafer as a steric hindrance, thus lowering the silicon density and causing deterioration of the film. However, even under a condition that hardly allowing such a reaction/desorption to occur, the residual ligands can be desorbed by properly causing the reaction between two silane sources, namely between the chlorosilane-based source and the aminosilane-based source. Then, the steric hindrance is resolved by the desorption of the residual ligands, and the silicon can be adsorbed on a site which is opened by the resolution of the steric hindrance, and the silicon density can be increased. Thus, it can be considered that the film with high silicon density can be formed even in the low temperature zone of 550Â° C. or less.</p>

Therefore, the nitrogen concentration, carbon concentration, oxygen concentration, or boron concentration of the silicon insulating layer can be adjusted.

Specifically, one of the chlorosilane-based source and the aminosilane-based source is supplied, and thereafter the other source may be supplied.

      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0348">Further, in the aforementioned embodiment, explanation is given for a case that when the first layer containing Si, N, and C is formed in each sequence, the chlorosilane-based source and the aminosilane-based source are used. However, the silane source having a halogen-based ligand other than the chlorosilane-based source may also be used. For example, a fluorosilane source can also be used instead of the chlorosilane-based source. Here, the fluorosilane source is the silane source having a fluoro group, which is a source containing at least silicon (Si) and fluorine (F). Silicon fluoride gas such as silicon tetrafluoride (SiF<sub>4</sub>) gas and disilicon hexafluoride (Si<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>) gas can be used as the fluorosilane source. In this case, when the first layer containing Si, N, and C is formed in each sequence, the fluorosilane source is supplied to the wafer <b>200</b> in the processing chamber <b>201</b>, and thereafter the aminosilane-based source is supplied, or the aminosilane-based source is supplied and thereafter the fluorosilane source is supplied.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0349">Further, in the above-described embodiment, explanation is given for a case that plasma is used in step 3 of the first sequence and in step 3 of the third sequence. However, plasma may also be used in each step of other sequence. For example, in each step of each sequence, it is also acceptable that the nitrogen-containing gas, the carbon-containing gas, the oxygen-containing gas, and the boron-containing gas are plasma-activated, to modify each layer by plasma-nitriding (nitrogen dope), plasma carbonization (carbon dope), plasma oxidation (oxygen dope), and plasma boronizing (boron dope). However, use of plasma is not suitable for the process in which there is a risk of plasma damage, and is preferably applied to other process in which there is no risk of plasma damage.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0350">Further, in the step of supplying the oxygen-containing gas, the hydrogen-containing gas may be supplied together with the oxygen-containing gas. When the oxygen-containing gas and the hydrogen-containing gas are supplied into the processing chamber <b>201</b> which is under atmosphere of a pressure of less than the air atmosphere (reduced pressure), the oxygen-containing gas and the hydrogen-containing gas are reacted in the processing chamber <b>201</b>, to generate oxidizing species (atomic oxygen, etc.) containing oxygen, and each layer can be oxidized by this oxidizing species. In this case, each layer can be oxidized by a higher oxidizing power than that of a case that the oxygen-containing gas alone is used for oxidation. The oxidation treatment is performed under a reduced atmosphere by non-plasma. Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) can be used for example, as the hydrogen-containing gas.</p>

      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0363">Further, in a case of an ALD method, a plurality of kinds of gases containing a plurality of elements that constitute the formed thin film, are alternately supplied. In this case, in order to control the composition ratio of the formed thin film, for example control of the gas supply flow rate and the gas supply time during supply of each gas can be considered. Note that in the case of the ALD method, the source gas is supplied for the purpose of the adsorption and saturation of the source gas on the surface of the substrate, and therefore pressure control in the processing chamber is not required. Namely, the adsorption and saturation of the source gas is generated under a prescribed pressure or less that allows the adsorption of the source gas to occur at a reaction temperature. Then, the adsorption and saturation of the source gas can be realized at any pressure value, provided that the pressure in the processing chamber is set to a prescribed pressure or less. Therefore, usually when the film formation is performed by the ALD method, the pressure in the processing chamber is determined depending on an exhaustion capability of the substrate processing apparatus, with respect to the gas supply amount. When the pressure in the processing chamber is varied, chemical adsorption of the source gas on the surface of the substrate is probably inhibited, or the reaction in this case is probably almost a CVD reaction, thus making it impossible to properly perform the film formation by the ALD method. Further, in order to form the thin film having a prescribed film thickness by the ALD method, the ALD reaction (adsorption and saturation, surface reaction) is repeatedly performed, and therefore deposition is insufficient unless each ALD reaction is sufficiently performed until each ALD reaction is saturated. In this case, probably a sufficient deposition rate cannot be obtained. Therefore, in the case of the ALD method, the composition ratio of the thin film is probably not controlled by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0364">Meanwhile, in this embodiment, in any one of the sequence, the composition ratio of the thin film is controlled (finely adjusted) by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber and the gas supply time in each step. More preferably, the composition ratio of the thin film is controlled by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber, or controlling the pressure and the gas supply time.</p>
      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0365">When the composition ratio of the thin film is controlled by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber in each step, an influence of a difference in machines in different substrate processing apparatuses can be reduced. Namely, the composition ratio of the thin film can be similarly controlled by similar control even in different substrate processing apparatuses. In this case, by controlling the gas supply time in each step, the composition ratio of the thin film can be finely adjusted, and the controllability of controlling the gas supply time can be increased. In addition, by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber, the composition ratio can be controlled while increasing the film formation rate. Namely, by controlling the pressure in the processing chamber, the composition ratio of the thin film can be controlled while increasing the growth rate of the silicon-containing layer formed in step 1 of each sequence for example. Thus, according to this embodiment, the composition ratio of the thin film can be similarly controlled by similar control, and also the controllability of controlling the composition ratio of the thin film can be increased, and further the film formation rate, namely productivity can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0366">Meanwhile, for example in the film formation by the ALD method, when the composition ratio of the thin film is controlled by controlling the gas supply flow rate and the gas supply time in each step, the influence of the difference in machines in different substrate processing apparatuses is large. Namely, the composition ratio of the tin film cannot be similarly controlled even if similar control is performed in the different substrate processing apparatuses. For example, even if the gas supply flow rate and the gas supply time are set to the same flow rate value and time in different substrate processing apparatuses, the pressure in the processing chamber is not the same pressure value due to the difference in machines. Therefore, in this case, the pressure in the processing chamber is varied in each substrate processing apparatus, and a desired control of the composition ratio cannot be similarly performed in the different substrate processing apparatuses. Further, the pressure in the processing chamber is varied in each substrate processing apparatus, and therefore chemical adsorption of the source gas on the surface of the substrate is probably inhibited, or the reaction in this case is probably almost a CVD reaction, thus making it impossible to properly perform the film formation by the ALD method.</p>
