      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part application of application Ser. No. 14/206,921, filed on Mar. 21, 2014, still pending, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention is directed to an apparatus that may be inserted into a potato chip can before or after the potato chips are loaded into the potato chip can.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">There are many ways to package and ship potato chips. The potato chips are packaged in bags, foil bags, recyclable bags, and cans. The potato chips in the bags are easy to retrieve by a potato chip eater. To get to the bottom of the container, the eater only needs to open the bag all the way. However, when the preformed chips that are shipped in the elongated cylindrical cans, it can be difficult to retrieve the chips once the first couple of inches of chips have been eaten. The eater can turn the can over or onto its side to get the remaining chips. However, the eater runs the risk of dumping pieces of broken chips all over one's self or into the surroundings. There are lifting mechanisms that are placed into the can before the chips are inserted and the can sealed. While these may be useful, it does not help with the cans that have no mechanism and they can't be added by the consumer later. Additionally, the preinstalled lifting mechanisms add weight to the can, thereby increasing the shipping costs. The preinstalled lifting mechanisms also make it more difficult to load the chips and can increase the number of broken potato chips. Therefore, a potato chip lifter than can be inserted into the potato chip can after it is purchased is needed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment(s) of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, one embodiment of a potato chip lifter <b>10</b> has an elongated handle <b>12</b> and a foot portion <b>14</b>. The potato chip lifter <b>10</b> is preferably a unitary element that is all formed as a single unit, but it could be made in pieces and connected together, by ultrasonic welding or another technique as is known in the art The elongated handle <b>12</b> has a top end <b>16</b> and a bottom end <b>18</b> that connects with the back end <b>20</b> of the foot portion <b>14</b>. The elongated handle <b>12</b> also has a front side <b>22</b> and a back side <b>24</b>. Extending from the back side <b>24</b> are catching mechanisms <b>30</b>. The catching mechanisms <b>30</b> are preferably spread along the elongated handle <b>12</b> at equal spacing. The catching mechanisms <b>30</b> are preferably inverted U-shaped members that engage the edge of a can. See <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. While the catching mechanisms <b>30</b> are illustrated as inverted U-shaped members, they may have any relevant shape (e.g., inverted V-shape, see also <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) and still fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The foot portion <b>14</b> is attached to the elongated handle <b>12</b> at the bottom <b>18</b> thereof. The foot portion <b>14</b> is preferably and elongated flat member having a front end <b>32</b> and a back end <b>20</b>. The foot portion <b>14</b> is preferably attached to the elongated handle <b>12</b> at about 90Â°, although other angles could be used and fall within the scope of the present invention. The front end <b>32</b> of the foot portion <b>14</b> is preferably wider than the back end <b>20</b>, the foot portion <b>14</b> tapering in its width about one third of the way from the back end <b>22</b> to the front end <b>32</b>. The front end <b>32</b> of the foot portion <b>14</b> may also be pointed to assist in moving under the potato chips. Adjacent the front end <b>32</b> is a support <b>34</b> extending upward from a top surface <b>36</b> of the foot portion <b>14</b>. The support <b>34</b> extends upward in a parallel direction to the elongated handle <b>12</b> and orthogonal to the top surface <b>36</b> to support potato chips resting on the potato chip lifter <b>10</b>. See <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The support <b>34</b> assists in keeping the chips on the potato chip lifter <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The potato chip lifter <b>10</b> also has a stability element <b>40</b>. The stability element <b>40</b> is connected to the foot portion <b>14</b> at the front side <b>42</b> of the stability element <b>40</b> and to the elongated handle <b>12</b> at the back side <b>44</b> of the stability element <b>40</b>. The stability element <b>40</b> may also provide support and guidance to the stack of chips (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref> after the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> has been inserted into the can of chips and is used to lift the stack of chips.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The elongated handle <b>12</b> also has a plurality of guides <b>50</b> adjacent the the back side <b>44</b> of the stability element <b>40</b>. The plurality of guides <b>50</b> project from the front side <b>22</b> of the elongation handle <b>12</b>, and preferably in a downward direction toward the foot portion <b>14</b>. The guides <b>50</b> can engage the edges of the chips in the stack and prevent them from rotating, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in a counterclockwise direction and fall off the front end <b>32</b> thereof. While four of the guides <b>50</b> are illustrated in the figures, it is possible to have more or fewer of the guides <b>50</b> and still come within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Beginning directly above the guides <b>50</b> are also a plurality of thinned areas or scored areas <b>52</b>. These scored areas <b>52</b> provide breaking points for the user if so desired. As can be realized, as the chips are taken from the top of the stack, and the stack gets shorter, the user must lift the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> higher in the can. Thus, more of the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> will extend above the top edge of the can. See <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. Because the length of the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> may get in the way of the user, the user can break off sections of the elongated handle <b>12</b> at the scored areas <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Turning now to <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> is inserted into the can <b>80</b> between the stack of chips <b>90</b> and the wall <b>82</b> of the can <b>80</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the stack of chips <b>90</b> can be moved relative to the can <b>80</b>. In this figure, the can <b>80</b> has been turned on its side so that the stack of chips <b>90</b> is lying on its side. The potato chip lifter <b>10</b> has been inserted into the space <b>84</b> created in the can <b>80</b>. The potato chip lifter <b>10</b> is sized to fit within the space <b>84</b>. Once the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> hits the bottom of the can <b>80</b>, the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> is rotated to pass under the bottom chip in the stack of chips <b>90</b>. The can <b>80</b> can be tilted or otherwise oriented to allow the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> to pass under the bottom chip in the stack <b>90</b>. The resulting position is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As the person eating the chips eats more of the chips, the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> is used to move the stack of chips <b>90</b> upward so the person can access the chips without turning the can on its side or over, and having pieces of the chips fall onto them. As noted above, as the stack becomes smaller, the more of the elongated handle <b>12</b> extends out of the can <b>80</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The user can, use the catching mechanisms <b>30</b>, engage the elongated handle <b>12</b> on the wall <b>82</b> of the can <b>80</b> and hold the stack of potato chips <b>90</b> toward the top of the can <b>80</b> so the chips can be easily retrieved. The catching mechanisms <b>30</b> can be fewer or more and have different spacings than that illustrated in the figures. Moreover, the catching mechanisms <b>30</b> can also be longer and extend at different angles, depending on the preference of the user and the space <b>84</b> in the can. See <figref>FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">It should be noted that while this invention can be used for those chips and cans after they have been packaged, a packing company could also include the potato chip lifter <b>10</b> in the space <b>84</b> between the stack <b>90</b> and the can <b>80</b>, or in the usable configuration as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">An alternative embodiment of a potato chip lifter <b>10</b>â² as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> has an elongated handle <b>12</b> and a foot portion <b>14</b>. The potato chip lifter <b>10</b>â² is similar to the first embodiment, but has catching mechanisms <b>30</b>â². The catching mechanisms <b>30</b>â² are preferably spread along the elongated handle <b>12</b> at equal spacing. The catching mechanisms <b>30</b>â² are preferably inverted U-shaped members that are longer than the previous embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> has another embodiment of a potato chip lifter <b>10</b>â³ has an elongated handle <b>12</b> and a foot portion <b>14</b>. The potato chip lifter <b>10</b>â³ is similar to the first two embodiments, but has catching mechanisms <b>30</b>â³. The catching mechanisms <b>30</b>â³ have an inverted configuration, but have a greater angle with the elongated handle <b>12</b> and are longer.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Another embodiment of a potato chip lifter <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 11-19</figref>. The potato chip lifter <b>100</b> is preferably a unitary element that is all formed as a single unit, but it could be made in pieces and connected together, by ultrasonic welding or another technique as is known in the art. The potato chip lifter <b>100</b> has an elongated handle <b>102</b>, which has a top end <b>106</b> and a bottom end <b>108</b> that connects with the back end <b>120</b> of a foot portion <b>104</b>. The elongated handle <b>102</b> also has a front side <b>122</b> and a back side <b>124</b>. Extending from the back side <b>124</b> are catching mechanisms <b>130</b>. The catching mechanisms <b>130</b> are preferably spread along the elongated handle <b>102</b> at equal spacing. The catching mechanisms <b>130</b> are preferably inverted U-shaped members that engage the edge of a potato chip can. See, e.g., <figref>FIG. 19</figref>. While the catching mechanisms <b>130</b> are illustrated as inverted U-shaped members, they may have any relevant shape (as indicated above) and still fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The foot portion <b>104</b> is attached to the elongated handle <b>102</b> at the bottom <b>108</b> thereof. The foot portion <b>104</b> is preferably a half-circle or spade-shaped member, but can have any appropriate shape, and has a front end <b>132</b>, a back end <b>120</b>, and a top surface <b>136</b>. The front end <b>132</b> is preferably curved upward, toward the top surface <b>136</b>, giving it a concave top surface <b>136</b>. As described in more detail below, this curvature assists in the rotation of the foot portion <b>104</b> relative to the elongated handle <b>102</b> when the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> is inserted into the potato chip can. The foot portion <b>104</b> is preferably attached to the the bottom <b>108</b> of the elongated handle <b>102</b> by a living hinge <b>126</b> at the back end <b>120</b> of the foot portion <b>104</b>. The living hinge <b>126</b> allows the foot portion <b>104</b> to be rotated relative to the elongated handle <b>102</b>. The potato chip lifter <b>100</b> has two configurations, a shipped-in configuration as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> and a to-be-used configuration as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In the shipped-in configuration, the foot portion <b>104</b> is at about <b>180</b>Â° relative to the elongated handle <b>102</b>, while in the to-be-used configuration, the foot portion <b>104</b> is at about 90Â° relative to the handle <b>102</b>. See <figref>FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The potato chip lifter <b>100</b> also has a stability element <b>140</b>. The stability element <b>140</b> has a triangular configuration, similar to stability element <b>40</b>, but is not permanently connected to the elongated handle <b>102</b> in the shipped-in configuration. The front side <b>142</b> of the stability element <b>140</b> is connected to the top surface <b>136</b> of the foot portion <b>104</b> and has a upward extending back portion <b>146</b> from the back end <b>120</b> of the foot portion <b>104</b> to connect with the back end <b>144</b> of the stability element <b>140</b> to make a triangular shape. The foot portion <b>104</b> also has a rearwardly extending projection <b>138</b>, projecting rearwardly from the stability element <b>140</b> in a curved arc. The rearwardly extending portion <b>138</b> is curved and has a forward facing engaging surface <b>148</b>. When the foot portion <b>104</b> is rotated about 90Â° relative to the elongated handle <b>102</b>, the rearwardly extending projection <b>138</b> pass through an opening <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The front side <b>122</b> of elongated handle <b>102</b> has a plurality of thinned areas or scored areas <b>152</b>. These scored areas <b>152</b> provide breaking points for the user if so desired. As can be realized, as the chips are taken from the top of the potato chip stack, and the potato chip stack gets shorter, the user must lift the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> out of the can <b>80</b>. Thus, more of the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> will extend above the top edge of the can. See <figref>FIG. 19</figref>. Because the length of the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> may get in the way of the user, the user can break off sections of the elongated handle <b>102</b> at the scored areas <b>152</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The use of the potato chip lifter is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, holding a portion of a stack of potato chips in the to-be-used position.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The use of the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> will now be described with reference to <figref>FIGS. 16-18</figref>. In <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, the stack of potato chips <b>90</b> has been moved to one side of the can <b>80</b> and the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> has been inserted into the can <b>80</b>. As noted above, it is also possible that the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> can be inserted at the factory and before or after the potato chips <b>90</b> are inserted. As the potato chip lifter <b>100</b> is continued to be pushed into the can <b>80</b>, the curved portion of the front end <b>132</b> of the foot portion <b>104</b> causes the foot portion <b>104</b> to begin to rotate relative to the elongated handle portion <b>102</b> and move under the stack of potato chips <b>90</b>. See <figref>FIG. 17</figref>. As the foot portion <b>104</b> is rotated relative to the elongated handle portion <b>102</b>, the rearwardly extending portion <b>138</b> is moved into and through the opening <b>160</b> and the forward facing engaging surface <b>148</b> engages the back side <b>124</b> of the elongated handle <b>102</b>. The potato chips <b>90</b> can then be lifted out of the can <b>80</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>. As the height of the stack of potato chips <b>90</b> is reduced, the length of the elongated handle <b>102</b> can also be reduced by bending the elongated handle <b>102</b> at the scored areas <b>152</b> to break the elongated handle <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Thus it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
