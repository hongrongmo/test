      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/952,744, filed Mar. 13, 2014, and 62/005,858, filed May 30, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is directed to a method for pre-screening an opioid-addicted patient to determine the patient's tolerance for a therapeutic dose of noribogaine.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Substance addiction is a serious public health problem throughout the world. Heroin and other opioids, including prescription painkillers, are widely abused and account for a large percentage of illicit drug use. Opioid use is also linked to approximately 50% of violent crimes in the United States and costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars per year.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Acute withdrawal from drug dependence is characterized by dramatic and traumatic symptoms, including sweating, racing heart, palpitations, muscle tension, tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, tremor, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, grand mal seizures, heart attacks, strokes, hallucinations and delirium tremens (DTs). Once acute withdrawal symptoms have subsided, post-acute withdrawal syndrome can last for months or years. Post-acute withdrawal symptoms include fatigue, depression, lack of motivation, and increased pain sensitivity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Noribogaine induces side effects in some patients. Methods are needed for pre-screening an opioid-addicted patient to determine the patient's tolerance for a therapeutic dose of noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Noribogaine is administered to ameliorate acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms. In particular, initial testing of noribogaine therapy with methadone addicted patients indicates that a single 120 mg dosing of noribogaine generally provides a meaningful therapeutic response, whereas a single 60 mg dosing of noribogaine generally does not provide a meaningful therapeutic response. It follows that a single 90 mg dose of noribogaine shows some therapy but is sub-therapeutic for commercial purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The use of noribogaine may impart a dose dependent prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval, rendering higher dosing of noribogaine unacceptable. A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential Torsades de Pointes, a serious arrhythmia that can result in death.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Unexpectedly, it was discovered that noribogaine behaves in a linear pattern regarding QT interval prolongation. For example, doubling the dose of noribogaine will result in about a doubling of the QT interval prolongation in the patient. As such, QT interval and QT interval prolongation data obtained from a sub-therapeutic dose of less than 120 mg of noribogaine, such as about 90 mg, can be used as a predictor of the patient's tolerance for therapeutic noribogaine treatment at the therapeutic dose of 120 mg. This is possible because the QT interval and QT interval prolongation data obtained from a sub-therapeutic dose of less than 120 mg of noribogaine can be accurately extrapolated for a dose of 120 mg noribogaine without subjecting the patient to a potentially life-threatening side effect at the therapeutic dosage.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">As initially noted above, opioid-addicted patients treated with 120 mg noribogaine exhibit a significantly longer time to resumption of opioid substitution therapy than patients treated with 60 mg. Patients receiving 120 mg noribogaine also exhibit variable QT interval prolongation with an average prolongation of approximately 38 milliseconds (ms). Some patients exhibit QT interval prolongation of greater than 50 ms, or a QT interval of greater than 500 ms. A patient with a QT interval that is greater than 500 ms, or is prolonged more than 50 ms, is at high risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and possibly death.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Provided is a pre-screening method for predicting which patients are eligible for noribogaine therapy based on those who exhibit an unacceptable QT interval prolongation or a QT interval of over 500 milliseconds when treated with noribogaine. This method for predicting either an unacceptable QT interval prolongation of greater than 50 milliseconds or a QT interval of greater than 500 milliseconds can be used as a means of using sub-therapeutic doses (less than 120 mg) of noribogaine to screen out such patients before therapeutic doses (120 mg) of noribogaine therapy are initiated.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">As will be apparent to the skilled artisan upon reading this disclosure, the present invention provides a method for pre-screening an opioid-addicted patient, or another patient in need of treatment or prevention as provided herein, to determine the patient's tolerance for a therapeutic dose of noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one aspect, provided is a method for screening an opioid-addicted patient to determine the patient's tolerance for a therapeutic dose of noribogaine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, the method comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>measuring the patient's pre-administration QT interval;</li><li>administering to the patient a sub-therapeutic dose of noribogaine or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;</li><li>measuring the patient's post-administration QT interval;</li><li>determining the difference between pre-administration QT interval and post-administration QT interval to determine a first prolongation;</li><li>estimating a second prolongation based on the first prolongation, wherein the second prolongation is the estimated QT interval prolongation expected to be observed in the patient upon administration of a therapeutic dose of noribogaine;</li><li>determining the patient's tolerance for the therapeutic dose of noribogaine; and</li><li>administering to the patient the therapeutic dose of noribogaine or discontinuing noribogaine treatment, wherein a therapeutic dose is administered if the second prolongation is estimated to be less than about 50 ms.</li></ul></li></ul></p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0036">It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of this invention will be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0037">The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0038">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ, and âtheâ include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âa compoundâ includes a plurality of compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0039">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein the following terms have the following meanings.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0040">The term âaboutâ when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time, amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may vary by (+) or (â) 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or any subrange or subvalue there between. Preferably, the term âaboutâ when used with regard to a dose amount means that the dose may vary by +/â20%. For example, âabout 2 mg/kg noribogaineâ indicates that a patient may be administered a dose of noribogaine between 1.6 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg. In another example, about 120 mg per unit dose of noribogaine indicates that the unit dose may range from 96 mg to 144 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0041">âAdministrationâ refers to introducing an agent, such as noribogaine, into a patient. Typically, an effective amount is administered, which amount can be determined by the treating physician or the like. Any route of administration, such as oral, topical, subcutaneous, peritoneal, intra-arterial, inhalation, vaginal, rectal, nasal, introduction into the cerebrospinal fluid, or instillation into body compartments can be used. The agent, such as noribogaine, may be administered by direct blood stream delivery, e.g. sublingual, buccal, intranasal, or intrapulmonary administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0042">The related terms and phrases âadministeringâ and âadministration ofâ, when used in connection with a compound or pharmaceutical composition (and grammatical equivalents) refer both to direct administration, which may be administration to a patient by a medical professional or by self-administration by the patient, and/or to indirect administration, which may be the act of prescribing a drug. For example, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug and/or provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0043">âPeriodic administrationâ or âperiodically administeringâ refers to multiple treatments that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Periodic administration may also refer to administration of an agent, such as noribogaine one, two, three, or more times per day. Administration may be via transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, intranasal, intrapulmonary, oral administration, or other administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0044">âComprisingâ or âcomprisesâ is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. âConsisting essentially ofâ when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination for the stated purpose. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. âConsisting ofâ shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0045">âNoribogaineâ refers to the compound:</p>

Demethylation may be accomplished by conventional techniques such as by reaction with boron tribromide/methylene chloride at room temperature followed by conventional purification. See, for example, Huffman, et al., J. Org. Chem. 50:1460 (1985), which incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Noribogaine can be synthesized as described, for example in U.S. Patent Pub. Nos. 2013/0165647, 2013/0303756, and 2012/0253037, PCT Patent Publication No. WO 2013/040471 (includes description of making noribogaine polymorphs), and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/593,454, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0046">âNoribogaine derivativesâ refer to, without limitation, esters or O-carbamates of noribogaine, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates of each thereof. Also encompassed within this invention are derivatives of noribogaine that act as prodrug forms of noribogaine. A prodrug is a pharmacological substance administered in an inactive (or significantly less active) form. Once administered, the prodrug is metabolized in vivo into an active metabolite. Noribogaine derivatives include, without limitation, those compounds set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,456 and 8,362,007; as well as in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/165,626; and US Patent Application Publication Nos. US2013/0131046; US2013/0165647; US2013/0165425; and US2013/0165414; all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Non-limiting examples of noribogaine derivatives encompassed by this invention are given in more detail in the âCompositionsâ section below.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0047">In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure entail the administration of a prodrug of noribogaine that provides the desired maximum serum concentrations and efficacious average noribogaine serum levels. A prodrug of noribogaine refers to a compound that metabolizes, in vivo, to noribogaine. In some embodiments, the prodrug is selected to be readily cleavable either by a cleavable linking arm or by cleavage of the prodrug entity that binds to noribogaine such that noribogaine is generated in vivo. In one preferred embodiment, the prodrug moiety is selected to facilitate binding to the Î¼ and/or Îº receptors in the brain either by facilitating passage across the blood brain barrier or by targeting brain receptors other than the Î¼ and/or Îº receptors. Examples of prodrugs of noribogaine are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/165,626, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0048">This invention is not limited to any particular chemical form of noribogaine or noribogaine derivative, and the drug may be given to patients either as a free base, solvate, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In the latter case, the hydrochloride salt is generally preferred, but other salts derived from organic or inorganic acids may also be used. Examples of such acids include, without limitation, those described below as âpharmaceutically acceptable saltsâ and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0049">âPharmaceutically acceptable compositionâ refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, preferably a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0050">âPharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0051">âTherapeutically effective amountâ or âtherapeutic amountâ refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine, in the context of treating opioid or opioid-like drug dependency, refers to an amount of noribogaine that attenuates the dependency and/or symptoms of acute withdrawal for at least 2 hours beyond control (placebo), at least 5 hours beyond control, and preferably at least 10 hours beyond control. In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine is a 120 mg dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0052">A âtherapeutic levelâ of a drug is an amount of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that is sufficient to treat opioid or opioid-like drug addiction or to treat, prevent, or attenuate acute withdrawal symptoms, but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the âserum concentration.â Where the serum concentration of noribogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term ânoribogaineâ encompasses any form of noribogaine, including derivatives thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0053">A âsub-therapeutic levelâ of noribogaine or pharmaceutical salt and/or solvate thereof that is less than the therapeutic level described above. For example, the sub-therapeutic level of noribogaine may be e.g., 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount (e.g., 120 mg) of noribogaine, or any subvalue or subrange there between. Sub-therapeutic levels of noribogaine may coincide with âmaintenance amountsâ of noribogaine which are amounts, less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provide some attenuation and/or prevention of post-acute withdrawal syndrome in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically addicted to opioid or opioid-like drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0054">As defined herein, a âprophylactically effective amountâ of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provides attenuation and/or prevention of a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. For example, the prophylactically effective amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who no longer has a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder (e.g., no longer physically addicted to nicotine). For example, a prophylactically effective amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount. However, a prophylactically effective amount may be the same as the therapeutically effective amount, for example when a patient who is physically addicted to nicotine is administered noribogaine to attenuate cravings for a period of time when nicotine use is not feasible. The prophylactically effective amount may vary for different a diseases or disorders or symptoms of different diseases or disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0055">As defined herein, a âmaintenance amountâ of a drug or an agent is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount that provides attenuation and/or prevention of syndrome disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically manifests a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder. For example, a maintenance amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount, or any subvalue or subrange there between.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0056">âTreatment,â âtreating,â and âtreatâ are defined as acting upon a disease, disorder, or condition with an agent, such as noribogaine, to reduce or ameliorate harmful or any other undesired effects of the disease, disorder, or condition and/or its symptoms. âTreatment,â as used herein, covers the treatment of a human patient, and includes: (a) reducing the risk of occurrence of the condition in a patient determined to be predisposed to the condition but not yet diagnosed as having the condition, (b) impeding the development of the condition, and/or (c) relieving the condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition and/or relieving one or more symptoms of the condition. âTreatingâ or âtreatment ofâ a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results such as the reduction of symptoms. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to: treating opioid or opioid-like drug addiction; treating, preventing, and/or attenuating acute withdrawal symptoms; treating, preventing, and/or attenuating long-term (post-acute) withdrawal symptoms; and preventing relapse of opioid or opioid-like drug use.</p>

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0063">A âpharmaceutically acceptable solvateâ or âhydrateâ of a compound of the invention means a solvate or hydrate complex that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound, and includes, but is not limited to, complexes of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0064">As used herein the term âsolvateâ is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term âsolvateâ. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest. The term âsolvateâ as used herein refers to complexes with solvents in which noribogaine is reacted or from which noribogaine is precipitated or crystallized. For example, a complex with water is known as a âhydrateâ. Solvates of noribogaine are within the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in organic chemistry that many organic compounds can exist in more than one crystalline form. For example, crystalline form may vary based on the solvate used. Thus, all crystalline forms of noribogaine or the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0065">The therapeutically effective amount of the compound may be higher or lower, depending on the route of administration used. For example, when direct blood administration (e.g., sublingual, pulmonary and intranasal delivery) is used, a lower dose of the compound may be administered. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine or derivative is from about 50 ng to less than 100 Î¼g per kg of body weight. Where other routes of administration are used, a higher dose of the compound may be administered. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound is from greater than about 1 mg to about 8 mg per kg of body weight per day.</p>

In one embodiment, a patient receiving a therapeutic dose of noribogaine is monitored in a clinical setting. Monitoring may be necessary to ensure the QT interval is not prolonged to an unacceptable degree. A âclinical settingâ refers to an inpatient setting (e.g., inpatient clinic, hospital, rehabilitation facility) or an outpatient setting with frequent, regular monitoring (e.g., outpatient clinic that is visited daily to receive dose and monitoring). Monitoring includes monitoring of QT interval. Methods for monitoring of QT interval are well-known in the art, for example by ECG.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0087">In one embodiment, a patient receiving a maintenance or therapeutic dose of noribogaine is not monitored in a clinical setting. In one embodiment, a patient receiving a maintenance or therapeutic dose of noribogaine is monitored periodically, for example daily, weekly, monthly, or occasionally.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0088">In one embodiment, the therapeutic dose provides an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL, said concentration being sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate opioid addiction while resulting in prolongation of the patient's QT interval of less than a threshold, for example about 50 ms.</p>

      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0148">Noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations above the limit of quantification were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using model-independent methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were the observed values. Plasma concentration data in the post-distribution phase of the plasma concentration-time plot were fitted using linear regression to the formula ln C=ln Coât.Kel, where Co was the zero-time intercept of the extrapolated terminal phase and Kel was the terminal elimination rate constant. The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was determined using the formula t<sub>1/2</sub>=0.693/Kel. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last determined concentration-time point (tf) in the post distribution phase was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The area under the curve from the last concentration-time point in the post distribution phase (Ctf) to time infinity was calculated from AUC<sub>t-â</sub>=Ctf/Kel. The concentration used for Ctf was the last determined value above the LLOQ at the time point. The total AUC<sub>0-â</sub> was obtained by adding AUC<sub>tf </sub>and AUC<sub>t-â</sub>. Noribogaine apparent clearance (CL/F) was determined using the formula CL/F=Dose/AUC<sub>0-â</sub>Ã1000, and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was determined using the formula Vd/F=(CL/F)/Kel. Total urine noribogaine was the sum of both analytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0149">Summary statistics (means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation) were determined for each dose group for safety laboratory test data, ECG and pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacodynamic variables. Categorical variables were analysed using counts and percentages. Dose-proportionality of AUC and Cmax was assessed using linear regression. The effect of dose on pharmacodynamic parameter values over time was assessed using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons (with Tukey-Kramer adjustment) between each dose group to the placebo were conducted at each time point using the least squares estimates obtained from the ANOVA, using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS ver 6.0).</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0151">Noribogaine was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations occurring 2-3 hours after oral dosing. Fluctuations in individual distribution-phase concentration-time profiles may suggest the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation (see highlighted individual 4-8 hour profiles in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, insert). Both Cmax and AUC increased linearly with dose (Table 1, upper panel). Mean half-life estimates of 28-50 hours were observed across dose groups for noribogaine. Volume of distribution was extensive (1417-3086 L across dose groups).</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0152">Mean plasma noribogaine glucuronide concentration-time plots for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose group are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and mean pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 1, lower panel. Noribogaine glucuronide was detected in all subjects by 0.75 hours, with peak concentrations occurring 3-4 hours after noribogaine dosing. Mean half-life of 21-23 hours was estimated for plasma noribogaine glucuronide. The proportion of noribogaine glucuronide Cmax and AUC relative to noribogaine was 3-4% for both dose groups. Total urine noribogaine elimination was 1.16 mg and 0.82 mg for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively, representing 3.9% and 1.4% of the doses administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0153">The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base from a single dose of 3 mg noribogaine free base under fasting conditions were plotted.

      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0162">Safety and tolerability of noribogaine were tested in the group of volunteers from Example 1. Cold pressor testing was conducted in 1Â° C. water according to the method of Mitchell et al. (<i>J Pain </i>5:233-237, 2004) pre-dose, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 216 hours post-dosing. Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, recording of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG telemetry from â2 h to 6 h after dosing, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) up to 216 hours post-dosing.</p>

      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0163">A total of thirteen adverse events were reported by seven participants (Table 2). Six adverse events were reported by three participants in the placebo group, five adverse events were reported by two subjects in the 3 mg dose group, and one adverse event was reported by single subjects in the 10 mg and 30 mg dose groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were headache (four reports) and epistaxis (two reports). All adverse events were of mild-moderate intensity, and all resolved prior to study completion. There were no changes in vital signs or safety laboratory tests of note. In particular, there were no changes in oximetry or capnography, or changes in respiratory rate. There were no QTcF values &gt;500 msec at any time. One subject dosed with 10 mg noribogaine had a single increase in QTcF of &gt;60 msec at 24 hours post-dosing.</p>

      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0164">This example is to illustrate that noribogaine can be administered at a therapeutic dosing while maintaining an acceptable QT interval. While the therapy employed is directed to opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the results show that a therapeutic window can be established for noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0165">The efficacy of noribogaine in humans was evaluated in opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients had been receiving methadone treatment as the opioid substitution therapy, but were transferred to morphine treatment prior to noribogaine administration. This was done to avoid negative noribogaine-methadone interactions that are not observed between noribogaine and morphine. See U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,157, filed Mar. 14, 2014 and Ser. No. 14/346,655, filed Mar. 21, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0166">Three cohorts of nine (9) subjects (6 administered noribogaine and 3 administered placebo in each cohort) were evaluated for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Cohort 1 received a single dose of 60 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 2 received a single dose of 120 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 3 received a single dose of 180 mg noribogaine or placebo. Treatment was administered 2 hours after last morphine dose and the time to resumption of morphine (opioid substitution treatment, OST) was determined. Few adverse effects of noribogaine were observed in any of the participants, including no hallucinatory effects. Table 3 shows the reported adverse events for each treatment that were not attributable to withdrawal from opioids. Headaches were frequent in the placebo and 60 mg noribogaine treatment groups, but were attenuated in the 120 mg and 180 mg dose groups.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> indicates the time to resumption of morphine (OST) for patients treated with placebo (circles), 60 mg noribogaine (squares), 120 mg noribogaine (triangles), and 180 mg noribogaine (inverted triangles). Patients receiving a single 120 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids of greater than 20 hours. Patients receiving a single 180 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids similar to that of placebo. This demonstrates that increasing the dose of noribogaine to 180 mg results in a shorter time to resumption of OST than observed in patients receiving 120 mg noribogaine. Time to resumption of OST after treatment with 180 mg was still longer than untreated patients (7 hours, not shown) or those administered 60 mg noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0170">Patients were evaluated based on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) scoring systems over the period of time between administration of noribogaine (or placebo) until resumption of OST. These scales are outlined in Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, World Health Organization, Geneva (2009), Annex 10, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The scales measure the intensity of withdrawal symptoms, based on clinical, subjective, and objective indicia.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0171">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows the COWS scores at time of resumption of OST for each cohort. Box includes values representing 25%-75% quartiles. Diamond=median; crossbar in box=mean; whiskers=values within standard deviation of mid-quartiles. No outliers present. The highly variable COWS scores across and within each cohort indicates that patients were resuming opiates without relation to the intensity of withdrawal. This was also reflected in SOWS and OOWS scores at the time of resumption of OST.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0172">
        <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows the mean change in total COWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the COWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> shows the mean change in total OOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 7B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the OOWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> shows the mean change in total SOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the SOWS total score change from baseline. These data indicate that withdrawal symptoms get worse over time after cessation of OST, and that patients administered placebo experience generally worse withdrawal symptoms over that period. Patients who received 120 mg noribogaine generally experienced fewer withdrawal symptoms than the other patients, regardless of the scale used. Patients administered placebo generally experienced more withdrawal symptoms than patients who were administered noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0173">Patients' QT intervals were evaluated at regular time points throughout the study. <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> shows the average change in QT interval (ÎQTcl, i.e., QT interval prolongation) over the first 24 hours post noribogaine (or placebo) administration. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> shows the estimated correlation between noribogaine concentration and change in QT interval. There is a dose-dependent increase in QT interval prolongation that is correlated with the serum concentration of noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0174">Based on above data, it is believed that the therapeutic window for a single bolus dose of noribogaine is bound at the lower end by 50 mg and at the upper end by less than 180 mg. In particular, the therapeutic serum concentration in vivo appears to be between about 50 ng/mL and about 180 ng/mL.</p>
