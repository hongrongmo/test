      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a water-pollutant separation device, on which a water-pollutant separation and filtration device, an ornamental fish tank water-pollutant separation and filtration system, and a high-density cultivation water-pollutant separation, filtration and oxygen aeration system are based on.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In the field of fish farming, the maintenance of water takes more precedence. The water quality determined by the organic content and dissolved oxygen has a great influence on keeping fish. The organic content in the aquatic water comes from the excretions of the fish and the remained fish food, most of which is remained in the form of particles at the bottom of the fishpond.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the prior art, the mechanism of the filtration system for fish-tank is that internal filtration materials blocks the particles pollutant to purify the water. As time goes on lots of pollutant will accumulate on the filtration materials. This will reduce the water flow rate and the filtration effect, so washing the filtration materials is a time-consuming work. One preferred example for the industrialized fish farming is that a sedimentation tank or a rotating separation module is used for separating and discharging the particles pollutant, and then a biological filtration treatment is applied to purify the water. However, these schemes remain many disadvantages, for instance, the separation effect for the sedimentation tank or a rotating separation module is very low because of the huge force applied to the particles by the strong water flow. To reach an ideal effect, the sedimentation tank or a rotating separation module should be enlarged to a large scale. In this condition, the pollutant discharging and the back flushing need a high quantity of water. So a powerful filtration system and a large quantity of fresh water are needed to maintain the water quality with a high construction cost and a low use ratio.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0066">With the above-mentioned technical proposals, the advantage of the water-pollutant separation process is that:</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0000">1. With a weak water flow and impact force, small particles pollutant is more possible to sediment. Water shunting and water whirling both are most effective ways of gravity sedimenting. The above mentioned water-pollutant separation process combines and takes full advantage of the function of the water shunting and water swirling during the gravity sedimenting of the particles pollutant, generating smooth and swirling water flow to reach a best effect of particles pollutant gravity sedimenting separation. <br /> 2. The first level (or primary level) of particles pollutant gravity sedimenting separation is designed with a downward water flow. In this process, the particles pollutant gravity sedimenting separation is accelerated because of the superposition of the (downward) force that the smooth water flow applies to the particles pollutant and the (downward) gravity of the particles pollutant itself. So most particles pollutant will sediment as long as the gravity is greater than the force of the smooth water flow applied. <br /> 3. The next level of particles pollutant blocking and filtration separation is designed with an upward water flow, during which filtration materials block and filter rare tiny particles pollutant that did not sediment. In this process, the (downward) gravity of the particles pollutant itself weakens the (upward) force that the smooth water flow applies to the particles pollutant. The result is that a tiny (upward) resultant force acts on the tiny particles pollutant and pushes them moving upwards slowly in suspension until sedimented or absorbed to the lower surface of the filtration materials. For example, when a tiny particles pollutant is blocked by brushes, a second and a third . . . more and more tiny particles pollutant will be adhered together. Once the blocked tiny particles pollutant reach to a certain extent, they will sediment together downwards. </p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0068">A basic operating principle and process of this preferred embodiment is given herein below. When the device in a normal working state, the pollutant discharge pipe valve <b>41</b><i>b </i>and the water discharge valve <b>31</b><i>b </i>are turned off, and the bottom-water inlet valve <b>211</b><i>b </i>and the upper-water inlet valve <b>221</b><i>b </i>are turned on. The bottom water of the fish tank goes into the spoiler <b>51</b><i>b </i>through the bottom-water inlet pipe <b>21</b><i>b </i>inside the separation structure <b>5</b><i>b</i>. With the shunting function of the slots <b>52</b><i>b</i>, the cycling water loses impact force and becomes smooth, and then starts whirling to left under the function of the left (or right) biased slots <b>52</b><i>b</i>, gathering most particles pollutant of the bottom water within a central area of the bottom of the bottom-water filtration area. After that, water with remained tiny particles goes upwards slowly through the gap between the bottom-water filtration area and the separation structure <b>5</b><i>b</i>. So tiny particles are sedimented or absorbed when passing through the filtration materials <b>53</b><i>b </i>(brushes), and finally the bottom-cycling-water enters the upper-water filtration area through the opening <b>10</b><i>b </i>to apply a biochemistry filtration. Almost at the same time with the bottom water of the fish tank goes into the water-pollutant separation structure <b>5</b><i>b </i>through the bottom-water inlet pipe <b>21</b><i>b </i>inside the separation structure <b>5</b><i>b</i>, middle-water and upper-water with little particles pollutant goes into the upper-water filtration area through the upper-water inlet pipe <b>22</b><i>b </i>to apply a biochemistry filtration.

      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0069">According to the above description, the ornamental fish tank water-pollutant separation and filtration system according to the present invention has the advantage in that:</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0000">1. The particles pollutant for instance excretions from the fish is separated and discharged at the first time, and after that, water with fewer particles pollutant is applied a biochemistry filtration. Thus, the filtration system now just undertakes 20% to 30% biochemistry filtration task compared to 100% previously. The easy work of filtration now keeps the water clear, makes the fish-tank bright, and brings health to the fish. <br /> 2. Because the particles pollutant is separated and discharged, water entering the filtration system is provided with hardly any particles pollutant to block. Thus, filtration cotton is no longer a necessary for the filtration system to filter the particles pollutant for example excretions from the fish, and the filtration system no longer gets blocking and needs washing due to the accumulating of particles pollutant. <br /> 3. Because the sedimenting happens near the pollutant discharge pipe, the particles pollutant can be easily discharged by turning on the pollutant discharge pipe valve and back-flush valve at any time with less water. Preferably, the water outlet pipe and the water inlet pipe communicated to the fish tank can be controlled by a clock controlling self-acting pollutant discharge valve and an automatic water-adding device. The result is that, the work for water adding and pollutant discharging is so fully automatic that labor is no longer needed for adding water and washing the filtration system, achieving the object of keeping pet-fish so easily and joyfully. </p>

Oxygen is supplied continuously by the oxygen aeration disk <b>38</b><i>c </i>and the oxygen aeration pipe <b>37</b><i>c</i>. The contact time between the water and the oxygen is significantly extended due to the blocking effect of the secondary filtration materials <b>33</b><i>c</i>, thus a high oxygen dissolved cycling water is obtained because of the fully contact and convection. This high oxygen dissolved cycling water can active the biological bacterium to grow and flourish in a short time, during which a large quantity of organic matter is decomposed that doubled the effect of biochemistry filtration. After that, the cycling water from the first part of the secondary filtration tank <b>31</b><i>c </i>enters the second part through the second opening <b>42</b><i>c </i>to apply the biochemistry filtration, and finally return into the fish-pond through the primary water-outlet pipe <b>35</b><i>c </i>and the secondary water-outlet pipe <b>36</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The water entering into the water-pollutant separation structure <b>12</b><i>c </i>can be controlled into a certain velocity to achieve the best water-pollutant separation effect by adjusting the bottom-water inlet valve <b>161</b><i>c </i>and the upper-water inlet valve <b>231</b><i>c</i>. Particles pollutant sedimented within the central area of the bottom of the water-pollutant separation tank <b>11</b><i>c </i>can be easily discharged by turning on the pollutant discharge pipe valve <b>171</b><i>c </i>at any time. Tiny particles pollutant absorbed on the bushes <b>15</b><i>c </i>can be easily discharged out of the water-pollutant separation tank <b>11</b><i>c </i>with back-flush flows from the upper-water inlet pipe <b>23</b><i>c </i>by turning off the bottom-water inlet pipe <b>161</b><i>c </i>at the time of pollutant discharging. Similarly, tiny particles pollutant absorbed on the primary filtration materials <b>22</b><i>c </i>can also be easily discharged out of the water-pollutant separation tank <b>11</b><i>c </i>with back-flush flows from the primary filtration tank by turning off the bottom-water inlet pipe <b>161</b><i>c</i>, the upper-water inlet valve <b>231</b><i>c</i>, and the water pump <b>5</b><i>c </i>at the time of pollutant discharging.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, the high-density cultivation water-pollutant separation, filtration and oxygen aeration system of this embodiment can also have several water-pollutant separation devices <b>1</b><i>c</i>, or several primary filtration device <b>2</b><i>c</i>, or several secondary filtration and oxygen aeration device <b>3</b><i>c </i>cooperating together in parallel to improve the effect of the water-pollutant separation, filtration and oxygen aeration.</p>
