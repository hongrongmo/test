      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates generally to suction cleaners (which are commonly, and will herein be, referred to as vacuum cleaners. More particularly, the invention relates to a dust separator/collector assembly for a vacuum cleaner, which separates dust particles from the suction airflow drawn from whatever is being cleaned, and collects the separated particles for later disposal.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In referring herein to dust, it is to be understood that what is sucked up and entrained in the suction airstream of a vacuum cleaner can typically include particles of a very wide range of sizes, ranging from microns to millimetres, possibly even tens of millimetres. Fibres, including animal and human hair, pieces of fabric or paper, and scraps or even small articles of plastics or other material are also likely to be sucked up. All such things are to be understood as included within the term âdustâ used herein, and whatever system is utilised for dust separation and collection in a vacuum cleaner ought to be able to cope with a wide range of them.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A dust separator/collector in accordance with the invention is one of the so-called âcyclonicâ type, wherein dust is separated from the airflow by the rapid swirling motion of airflow in one or more cyclonic devices. More particularly, the dust separator/collector in accordance with the invention is a multi-cyclonic unit, including a first or primary cyclone of relatively large size, for separating coarse particles of dust and other large items from the airflow, after which the air is passed through a number of smaller cyclone devices connected in parallel with one another, in which high speed rotational airflow is effective to remove smaller dust particles from the airflow. Such âtwo-stageâ multi-cyclone units are well known in vacuum cleaners, and many different physical arrangements of the individual cyclone units have been proposed. Whatever cyclone arrangement is adopted, the generally desirable characteristics thereof which a designer should aim for, in addition to the fundamental requirement of effective dust separation, is that the path for flow of air through the successive cyclonic stages should not be unduly tortuous and introduce inefficiencies and power losses. In addition, since sooner or later it is inevitable that something will become stuck in a cyclone or some other part of the air path, it should be relatively easy for a user to gain access to parts of the air path by partially dismantling the separator/collector assembly. Thereafter, it should be straightforward to reassemble the removed parts when any blockage has been cleared. In addition, it is desirable that, to keep manufacturing costs down as far as possible, a minimum number of components should be utilised, and they should fit together in such a way that losses and separation inefficiencies due to air leakages are avoided as far as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The separator/collector assembly in accordance with the present invention has been devised with the above desiderata in mind.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, we provide a dust separator/collector assembly for a vacuum cleaner, comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">a housing;</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">a first cyclone having an inlet and outlet for suction airflow, and an outlet for separated dust;</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">a plurality of second cyclones, having respective inlets arranged to receive air from the outlet of the first cyclone, and further having air outlets and outlets for separated further dust; wherein the first cyclone is disposed in a lower region of the housing and the second cyclones are disposed in an upper region of the housing; and</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">wherein the first cyclone comprises a generally cylindrical cyclone body having a tangential inlet duct for dust-laden air, at a lower part of the cyclone body, and an upwardly extending outlet for suction airflow leading to the inlets of the second cyclone.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Preferably the body of the first cyclone has an outlet for separated dust at an upper part of the body, which preferably opens into a space in the house surrounding the first cyclone body.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The inlet duct of the first cyclone may extend through said space, from an aperture at the exterior of the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The second cyclones may be circumferentially spaced around the interior of the upper region of the housing, while the airflow from the outlet of the first cyclones to the inlets of the second cyclones may pass through an outlet member extending centrally upwardly within part of the upper region of the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The dust outlets of the second cyclones may discharge into an annular region within the housing, beneath the second cyclones and surrounding a part of the outlet member. Such an annular region may be defined between a partition formation extending transversely of the housing (e.g. moulding integrally with the housing) and a member extending transversely of the housing and supported by the outlet member.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The first cyclone may be supported by the partition member, or the transverse member.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In a separator/collector assembly in accordance with the invention, the path of airflow through it is straightforward, being predominantly upwardly within the housing from the inlet of the first cyclone to the second cyclones without any constricted regions or great changes in direction. Therefore, the requirement for avoiding losses is effectively achieved, and it will be appreciated from the following description that the construction is economical and readily assembled and dismantled as required.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring firstly to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, this shows a vacuum cleaner comprising a body <b>10</b> to which is detachably fitted a dust separator/collector assembly indicated generally at <b>12</b> and described in greater detail hereafter. At one end the body <b>10</b> is provided with respective wheels at each side of the body, one of the wheels being indicated at <b>14</b>. At the other end, the body is fitted with a single castor wheel assembly indicated generally at <b>16</b>. The body <b>10</b> houses an electric motor, a fan or impeller driven by the motor for creating a suction airflow when the motor is operating, one or more filters, possibly a cable reel for storage of an electric power cable, and any other components such as are generally well known in the field of vacuum cleaners. An airflow passage leading to an inlet of the fan or impeller extends from a formation, such as an opening in an abutment surface, which co-operates with an airflow outlet of the separator/collector assembly when it is fitted to the body of the cleaner, so that suction airflow is drawn through the separator/collector assembly from an inlet thereof to the outlet, by way of the hereafter-described components which provide for separation of dust from the suction airflow before it passes through the fan or impeller and is subsequently expelled to the exterior of the cleaner.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Above the castor wheel assembly <b>16</b> the body of the cleaner has a forward-facing fitting <b>18</b> for connection of a one end of a suction hose, whose other end is typically provided with handle to which a cleaning tool or cleaning head may be connected, possibly with the intermediary of a wand assembly. The latter may be telescopically extendible and contractible, or may comprise a number of separate sections which are able to be connected to one another as required to provide the required length of wand. From the fitting <b>18</b> an airflow duct extends to an outlet formation in the body of the cleaner, such formation being indicated at <b>20</b>. The outlet <b>20</b> of the duct faces, and has leakage-resistance sealing engagement with the inlet, described hereafter, to the separator/collector <b>12</b> when fitted to the cleaner.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">When in situ in the cleaner shown in the drawings, the separator/collector assembly lies at an inclination to the vertical of approximately 45Â°, but in the following description references to upper, lower and so forth will be used as if it were vertically oriented. It will be appreciated that in other cleaners the separator/collector assembly may be disposed at a different angle, e.g. at 0Â° to 90Â° to the vertical, although generally at an inclination between 15Â° and 60Â°.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings this shows, in isolation, the separator/collector assembly <b>12</b>. This comprises an external housing <b>22</b> which is a moulding of a transparent rigid plastics material, generally of cylindrical configuration and of a waisted profile, having a minimum external diameter in a region <b>24</b> about one third of the way down from its upper end <b>26</b> to its lower end <b>28</b>, both of which are of larger diameter. From the interior of region <b>24</b>, a housing portion <b>30</b> provides an external passage extending downwardly to the exterior of the lower region <b>28</b> of the housing. The space within the lower part of the housing <b>22</b>, and the lower end of passage <b>32</b> provided by the housing part <b>30</b>, are both closed by a pivotally mounted lower cover <b>34</b> which is held in a closed position, in which it has sealing engagement with the housing parts <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, by a clip or other fastener which can be manually released when the cover <b>34</b> is to be opened, for releasing separated dust from the separator. The upper end of the dust separator/collector assembly is closed by an upper cover <b>36</b> which has a handle <b>38</b> and has an airflow outlet formation <b>40</b> which co-operates with the aforementioned opening in the body leading to the fan of the cleaner.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The separator/collector assembly <b>12</b> is of the cyclonic type, comprising a number of cyclones in which flow of air in a circular motion separates entrained dust from the airflow. In known manner for vacuum cleaners, the airflow passes successively through a first or primary cyclone in which relatively large dust particles are separated from the airflow, the air leaving the primary cyclone subsequently passing through a plurality of smaller secondary cyclones connected, in airflow terms, in parallel with one another to separate any remaining smaller particles of dust from the airflow. Subsequently the airflow from the secondary cyclones passes, by way of a pre-fan filter element, to the source of the cleaner's suction.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In the present case, the components which provide the above-mentioned arrangement of cyclones are most clearly seen in <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and the subsequent figures of drawings. Accommodated within the housing <b>22</b>, there is a first cyclone <b>42</b>, a component <b>60</b> which provides an outlet for airflow from the first cyclone body, a support member <b>70</b> which is generally of annular configuration, and two components <b>80</b>, <b>100</b> which together form the assembly of secondary cyclones. In <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, seals, disposed as described hereafter, are indicated at <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>. The components <b>42</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>80</b>, and <b>100</b> are all mouldings of plastics material, the body of cyclone <b>42</b> being transparent to enable the user to observe its interior.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The first cyclone <b>42</b> comprises a cylindrical body <b>44</b> which is transparent as illustrated but may be translucent or opaque and of any desired colour, closed at its lower end by a wall from which a support formation <b>46</b>, having a cylindrical wall <b>48</b> at its upper end, extends upwardly into the cylindrical body <b>44</b>. At the upper end of the body <b>44</b>, part of its circumference is provided with an opening <b>50</b> which enables separated dust to leave the cyclone body to be accumulated in the space within the housing <b>22</b> surrounding the cyclone body. An air inlet duct <b>52</b> extends tangentially from the lower region of the body <b>44</b>, and when the first cyclone is in situ in the housing <b>22</b> an end <b>54</b> of the inlet duct co-operates with a somewhat rectangular opening <b>56</b> in the housing <b>20</b>. When the separator assembly is fitted to the cleaner, the opening <b>56</b> faces and has sealing engagement with the end of the duct leading from the hose inlet <b>18</b>. Finally, the periphery of the body <b>44</b> at its open upper end is provided with outwardly extending engagement protuberances <b>56</b>, whose function is described hereafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The outlet component <b>60</b> is generally tubular in configuration, with a cylindrical sleeve portion <b>62</b> having an external screw thread <b>64</b>. At the lower end of the portion <b>62</b> there is a radially outwardly extending flange <b>66</b>, followed by a tapering shroud portion <b>68</b> having circumferentially spaced slots for airflow into the interior of the component <b>60</b>. The lowermost end of the shroud portion <b>68</b> is closed by a formation <b>69</b> which, in the assembled separator fits within the cylindrical wall <b>48</b> of the first cyclone body component <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The component <b>70</b> provides an annular partition separating the first cyclone region in the lower part of the housing <b>22</b> from the second cyclone region in the upper part of the housing. The component <b>70</b> is annular in configuration, provided on its external periphery with a stepped formation <b>72</b> for receiving the sealing ring <b>122</b>. Around its central aperture, it has upwardly protruding ribs <b>74</b> and, beneath the component <b>70</b> a downwardly extending annular wall <b>76</b>. The wall <b>76</b> has bayonet fastening formations for co-operating with the formations <b>56</b> on the first cyclone body <b>44</b>, to secure the body <b>44</b> to the component <b>70</b> in the assembled separator.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The components <b>80</b> and <b>100</b> together make up a sub-assembly of secondary cyclones which are arranged in a generally annular array, spaced around the interior of the housing <b>22</b> between its position <b>24</b> of smallest diameter and its upper end region <b>26</b>. The component <b>80</b> affords a plurality of cyclone bodies <b>82</b> spaced circumferentially of one another within the housing <b>22</b>; each cyclone body is frusto-conical in shape with open upper and lower ends. The smaller-diameter lower end of each cyclone body protrudes slightly through a respective aperture in an annular partition formation <b>84</b> disposed transversely of the housing <b>22</b> at its smallest-diameter interior position, so that the smaller-diameter end of the respective cyclones open into an annular space defined between the partition formation <b>84</b> and the component <b>70</b> therebeneath. The external surface of the wall of each cyclone body <b>82</b> is stepped adjacent its lowermost end, to extend through a respective aperture in the seal <b>126</b> which is annular in configuration with multiple such apertures, the seal <b>126</b> being trapped between the steps in the respective cyclone walls and the partition formation <b>84</b>, to ensure effective sealing between the cyclone bodies and the partition. In the space radially inwardly of the cyclone bodies of the component <b>80</b>, there is a cylindrical wall formation <b>86</b> having an internal interrupted screw thread <b>88</b>, for co-operation with the screw thread <b>64</b> on the exterior of the component <b>60</b> and at the upper end of wall formation <b>86</b> there is a radially outwardly extending annular surface <b>89</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The component <b>100</b>, which fits above the component <b>80</b> in the upper end region <b>26</b> of the housing <b>22</b>, affords a number of frusto-conical tubular portions <b>102</b> which extend downwardly into the respective cyclone bodies <b>82</b>, to provide for outflow of air from the respective cyclone bodies. Each of the formations <b>102</b> is crossed by a vane <b>104</b>, to inhibit rotational airflow within the formations <b>102</b>. Radially inwardly of the formations <b>102</b>, the component <b>100</b> has a wall <b>106</b> extending transversely of the housing <b>22</b>, with a downwardly extending protuberance <b>108</b> of concave cone configuration facing the centre of the component <b>60</b>. A space <b>110</b> is defined between the wall <b>106</b> and the surface <b>88</b> of component <b>80</b>, and from this space <b>110</b> respective inlet passages <b>112</b> extend into the cyclone bodies <b>82</b> at a tangent to the latter, so that airflow entering the cyclone bodies rotates to separate dust entrained in the airflow in cyclonic manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Above the wall <b>106</b>, the component <b>100</b> defines a space <b>114</b> which receives outflow air from the respective second cyclone bodies <b>82</b>, and contains a filter element for providing a final filtration stage to ensure that no, or virtually no, particulate matter is contained in the air leaving the separator/collector assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The position of seals <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> in the complete separator/collector assembly is shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. They provide for effective sealing between the components <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>80</b> where they engage one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">To assemble the above-described components in the dust separator/collector assembly, the component <b>80</b> is placed in the housing <b>22</b> with the seal <b>126</b> positioned so that its apertures are received on the stepped lowermost end portions of the respective cyclone bodies <b>82</b>. The lowermost ends of the cyclone bodies protrude slightly through the apertures in the partition formation <b>84</b>, so that the sealing member <b>126</b> is held between the cyclone bodies and the partition formation. The component <b>100</b> is then placed in the upper end of the housing <b>22</b>, with its parts <b>122</b> entering the upper ends of the respective cyclone bodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The components <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> are then placed into the housing <b>22</b> from its lower end, with the component <b>70</b> received on the part <b>62</b> of the component <b>60</b> with seal <b>120</b> interposed between the component <b>70</b> and the flange <b>66</b> of the component <b>60</b>. Sealing ring <b>122</b> is positioned on the stepped peripheral region of component <b>70</b>, and seal <b>124</b> positioned on the end region of part <b>62</b> of component <b>60</b>, beyond the screw threaded portion <b>64</b> thereof. Then, the part <b>62</b> of component <b>60</b> is moved within the wall portion <b>86</b> of component <b>80</b> and the screw threaded parts <b>64</b>, <b>88</b>, engaged with one another. Rotation of component <b>60</b> draws the component <b>70</b> upwardly within the housing <b>22</b> approaching its smallest diameter part, until the components <b>60</b>, <b>70</b> reach their operative position shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, with the sealing elements <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> compressed between the surfaces they contact for effective sealing.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The first cyclone body component <b>42</b> is then placed in the housing <b>22</b>, again from its lower end, with the bayonet fastening formations <b>56</b>, <b>78</b> on the cyclone body and component <b>70</b> engaged with one another by axial and small rotational movement of the component <b>44</b>. It will be appreciated that there are co-operating formations on these components to ensure that they remain in a predetermined alignment relative to the housing <b>22</b>, with the inlet <b>52</b> of the first cyclone facing the aperture <b>56</b> in the housing. The lowermost end part <b>69</b> of the component <b>60</b> fits within the annular wall <b>48</b> of the cyclone body.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Removal of components in the reverse of the above order of assembly enables cleaning of the interior spaces of the separator/collector. In particular removal of the first cyclone body <b>44</b> followed by the component <b>60</b> and then the component <b>70</b> enables cleaning of the annular space in which dust separated by the second cyclones is deposited.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The path of flow of air through the separator/collector assembly above described is as follows, and best seen with reference to <figref>FIG. 5</figref> of the drawings. Dust-laden air from whatever is being cleaned is drawn through the suction hose of the cleaner and through the internal duct for flow of air from the hose fitting <b>18</b> to the formation <b>20</b> in the body of the cleaner, facing the inlet duct <b>52</b> of the first cyclone <b>42</b>. The tangential entry of the duct <b>52</b> to the body <b>44</b> of the first cyclone causes rotational airflow within the cyclone body. Separated coarse particles of dust from that airflow within the first cyclone <b>42</b> leaves the cyclone body <b>44</b> through the opening <b>50</b> at the upper end thereof, to be accumulated in the space within the housing <b>22</b> surrounding the cyclone body. Air from which the coarse dust particles have been removed leaves the first cyclone body by way of the component <b>60</b>, entering the shroud portion <b>68</b> thereof through the circumferentially spaced slots therein, and flowing upwardly through the component <b>60</b> to enter the space between wall <b>106</b> and wall <b>88</b>, flowing radially outwardly in that space. The air enters the second cyclone bodies <b>82</b> through the inlets <b>112</b> thereof, flowing downwardly through the cyclones rotating about the internal surface of the bodies, and causing the majority of any remaining fine dust in the air to be discharged at the open lower ends of the bodies <b>82</b>. Cleaned air flows upwardly in the centre of the cyclones, and out through the formations <b>102</b> to pass through the filter within the component <b>100</b>. Cleaned air passes from the separator/collector assembly by way of the exit <b>40</b> to reach the fan of the cleaner and thereby be expelled to the external atmosphere, by way of a final exhaust filter. Dust separated by the second cyclones enters the annular space between the partition formation <b>84</b> and the component <b>70</b>, and passes downwardly through the passage within the external housing portion <b>30</b> to be accumulated at the lower end of the separator/collector assembly, which is closed by the cover <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">When dust is to be emptied from the separator/collector assembly it is removed from the body of the cleaner and the lower cover <b>34</b> opened. Since the housing <b>22</b> and the first cyclone body <b>44</b> are transparent, the user can see if the quantity of collected dust is sufficient to require emptying, and also can see if any matter has become trapped in any of the parts of the separator/collector assembly. If so, the user is able to remove the first cyclone body <b>44</b>, and if desired the other components as necessary, by a reverse of the assembly procedure above described.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In a possible modification of the above-described construction, the partition formation could, instead of supporting the second cyclones, provide a support directly for the first cyclone and be disposed beneath, and spaced from, a further component which together with the partition formation defines an annular space into which dust from the second cyclones is discharged. Such a further component may be supported on the outlet member <b>60</b>, or carried by, or formed with, the second cyclones.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In further possible modifications, the housing <b>22</b> need not have the waisted configuration illustrated but instead be substantially cylindrical (apart from the necessary draft to enable its moulding of a plastics material). The outlet component <b>60</b> may engage the component <b>80</b> by means other than the illustrated screw thread; for example it may have bayonet engagement or be an interference or snap fit therewith.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">It will be appreciated from the above description that the described separator/collector assembly provides a cost-effective construction in terms of usage of a minimal number of parts, while at the same time being relatively easy for the user to dismantle if required for the purposes of cleaning of any trapped separated dust. At the same time, the path of airflow through the separator/collector assembly is very straightforward, involving a minimum number of changes of direction and no tortuous passages, so that losses due to resistance to airflow in the separator/collector assembly are minimized.</p>
