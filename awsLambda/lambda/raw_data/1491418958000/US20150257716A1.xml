    <summary>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present application relates generally to patient care systems for presenting information to facilitate speed and accuracy of patient medical information. It finds particular application in conjunction with nursing and physician care of a patient and patient monitoring and will described with particular reference thereto. However, it is to be understood that it also finds application in other usage scenarios and is not necessarily limited to the aforementioned application.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In a clinical care unit, patient vital signs and other physiological measurements and assessments are performed on a routine basis. The frequency for checking and measuring patient vital signs varies from patient to patient and may be continuous, every 30 minutes, another time span, a variable time span or the like. A patient's vital signs are often measured using a continuous monitor or a member of the medical staff performs the routine vital sign measurements. Vital signs include blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub>. As vital signs and measurements are taken, the information is entered into the patient's medical file. The results are then made available for review by the caregiver and the patient's physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">During a patient's stay in a clinical care unit, a patient may require differing levels of care. For example, upon being admitted, a patient may require more continuous care and then can be stepped down to less around the clock care. However, one factor in determining whether a patient is ready to step down or to be released, is how stable a patient's vital sign measurements are. In a clinical care unit, a caregiver is typically responsible for a plurality of patients at a given time. The location of vital signs varies from monitor to monitor. Moreover, some monitors allow different amounts of information to be displayed for each patient or to change the amount of information for a given patient. When the amount of information changes, the location of some vital signs and other medical information on the display changes in order to fit more or less information into the assigned display window.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Due to the increasing number of patients there is a need for quicker and easier access to a patient's medical information, particularly easier to read vital signs. It has become not only important that patient vital information is readily available but also that it is displayed in a consistent manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present application provides new and improved methods, which overcome the above-referenced problems and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present application proposes to use a fishbone pattern with specified compartments assigned to specific vital signs to standardize vital sign reporting for easier readability. The use of easy to access and read patient information improves clinical productivity and patient care and facilitates clinician review to determine if the vitals are within normal limits or abnormal.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In accordance with one aspect, a method for displaying a patient's vital sign measurements is provided. A horizontal line with one or more vertical crossing lines is displayed to define four or more compartments. The patient's respiratory rate, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and temperature are each displayed in an assigned one of the compartments. Two divergent lines forming a sideways âVâ are connected with a right hand side of the horizontal line to define another compartment. The patient's blood pressure is displayed in the another defined compartment defined by the two diverging lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect, a patient vital sign monitoring and display system is provided. One or more physiological sensors measure the patient's vital signs. An input/output circuit communicates with a communication network. One or more processors are connected with the sensors, the input/output circuit, and the display device and are configured to control the display device to generate a fishbone diagram defining a plurality of compartments and display patient vital sign measurements each in a consistent compartment of the fishbone diagram.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In accordance with another aspect, a patient vital sign monitoring and display system includes one or more processors. The processors are configured to receive vital sign measurements including a respiration rate measurement, a heart rate measurement, an SpO<sub>2 </sub>measurement, and a temperature measurement. The one or more processors control a display device to generate a fishbone diagram including a horizontal line, a vertical line crossing the horizontal line to define a first display area above the line and to the left of the vertical line, a second display area above the horizontal line and to the right of the vertical line, a third display area below the horizontal line and to the left of the vertical line, and a fourth display area below the horizontal line and to the right of the vertical line. The one or more processors further control the display to display each of the respiration rate measurement, the heart rate measurement, the SpO<sub>2 </sub>measurement, and the temperature measurement, without identifying labels, in an assigned one of the display areas consistently across a patient population.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">One advantage resides in improved readability of patient vital sign information.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Another advantage resides in improved availability of the patient vital sign information.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Another advantage resides in improved clinical workflow.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Another advantage resides in improved patient care.</p>

    <detailed-desc>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The present application is directed to a method and apparatus for displaying and laying out patient's vital sign information on a caregiver display. The present disclosure is inspired by the insight that current displays for reviewing patient vital sign measurements are inconsistently laid out and require significant display space, resulting in slower data interpretation and decreased accuracy of data interpretation by clinical caregivers. Currently, fishbone diagrams are used in reporting lab results. This placement of laboratory results in the diagram is consistent between labs and hospitals resulting in quick and easy to read lab reports. The use of a similar layout for patient vital information will allow faster data interpretation, consistency among data reports, and improved patient care.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present application is further directed to a caregiver display incorporating and displaying the patient's vital sign information in a consistent readable display format.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a consistent and simplified layout for displaying patient vital sign measurements is shown. The layout includes a fishbone diagram <b>10</b>, such as is commonly used in reporting lab results in the medical field, which includes a horizontal line and an intersecting vertical line which subdivides and defines four vital signs compartments. Each compartment contains one vital sign measurement. Extending to the right of the four compartments is a fifth compartment defined by two diverging horizontal lines to form a sideways âVâ. The most commonly used and checked vital signs include respiratory rate <b>16</b>, heart rate <b>18</b>, blood oxygen saturation <b>14</b>, temperature <b>12</b>, and blood pressure <b>20</b>. The rate vital sign measurements (respiration rate and heart rate) are displayed in the top compartments while a patient's blood oxygen saturation and temperature vital sign measurement are displayed in the bottom compartments. By consistently standardizing the location of the vital sign measurements in the fishbone diagram, the labels explaining each value can be eliminated and less space is required to display all vital sign measurement values. A typical heart rate is 70 to 80 beats per minute while a typical respiration rate is 15-16 breaths per minute, therefore, labels are not needed to differentiate between the rate measurements in the top compartments. Additionally, a patient's blood oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and temperature are displayed with the % and Â° labels therefore further reducing the need to label the vital sign measurements. The conventional way for displaying a patient's blood pressure differentiates the blood pressure vital sign measurement from the other vital signs. A patient's blood pressure measurement is displayed to the right of the other vital sign measurements <b>20</b> in the fifth compartment.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a sixth compartment formed by two diverging horizontal lines to form a sideways âVâ is displayed to the left of the other vital sign measurements <b>22</b>. The sixth measurement in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a patient's early detection index or warning score (EWS) or modified early warning score (MEWS), which is calculated from the patient's other vital sign measurements <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. As discussed above, labeling the vital sign measurements is not necessary. However, labels <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> for the rate vital signs can be included.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The fishbone diagram <b>10</b> and the vital signs can be displayed as a unit when other information is added. By maintaining the above discussed relationship between the fishbone diagram and vital sign values, the meaning of the displayed values is clear regardless where the fishbone diagram is placed among the other information. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of a caregiver display with the patient's vital sign measurements included in the fishbone pattern as part of the display. Information about the patient is included in a display <b>30</b>. Each display <b>30</b> includes a patient name <b>34</b> and patient location <b>36</b> in a common location such as the upper left corner. Each display <b>30</b> includes a name of a nurse <b>38</b> currently assigned to the patient and a current location <b>40</b> of the nurse as received by a location unit. Each display <b>30</b> can also include a name of an aide <b>44</b> assigned to the patient and the current location <b>50</b> of the aide as received by the location unit. The use of the consistent and space saving fishbone vital sign display allows additional patient information to be easily read or displayed on the display <b>30</b> unit. Each display can include the early detection index <b>22</b> as calculated by the scoring unit based on the last vital signs at the bottom of the display <b>30</b> or as part of the six compartment fishbone diagram as seen in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Patient vital signs are taken on a routine basis. As such, it is important for the caregiver to quickly understand when the last vital signs were taken and when the next vital sign measurements are to be taken. The display unit includes a time of last completion <b>52</b> and a next scheduled time to be completed <b>54</b>. Completed patient assessments and/or measurements include the values and/or indications of completion. Each completed measurement of the patient vital signs includes a value such as the temperature <b>12</b>, the SpO<sub>2 </sub>level <b>14</b>, the respiration rate <b>16</b>, the heart rate <b>18</b>, the blood pressure <b>20</b>, and the like. The display can also include a glucose level <b>42</b> or other measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In addition to the displayed vital sign values measurements, other information concerning the vital sign measurements can be displayed offering more information about the status of a patient's vital sign measurement. In clinical care, it is important to not only monitor and measure a patient's vital signs but to also monitor whether the measured values are within a normal range for that vital sign. With reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, arrows <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> are displayed next to the vital sign information indicating whether a given value is in or out of range. An arrow pointing upward <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> indicates that the patient's vital sign is higher than the normal range while an arrow pointing down <b>66</b> indicates that the patient's vital sign is lower than the normal range.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The length of the shaft of the arrow and the color of the arrow also offers information concerning the patient's vital sign status. The color of the arrow indicates the severity of the alarm. The system can be programed to alert appropriate clinical care staff that a vital sign is out of range. Multiple levels of alerts and different out of range sensitivities can be programmed depending upon the vital sign and/or the patient. When a vital sign is out range, the arrow head is colored to indicate the severity of the alarm. For example, an infant will have a higher respiratory rate than an adult and the system can be adjusted to reflect whether the vital sign values are out of range accordingly. When a vital sign is only moderately out of range, the arrow head may be one color such as yellow and when a vital sign is significantly out of range, the arrow head may be colored a secondary color such as red. Various other types of color-coding can be included such as color-coding the number values or the background. The length of the arrow shaft is an indication of a worsening condition over time. For example, a yellow arrowhead without a shaft indicates a new alarm. An arrowhead with a shaft indicates that the alarm was tending in a particular direction for a longer period of time. If a patient's heart rate continues to drop out of range, the length of the arrow shaft will continue to lengthen. The longer the shaft of the arrow, the longer the alarm has been out of range.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the method of acquiring patient vital sign information and displaying the information in a consistent manner on the patient display <b>30</b>. In a step S<b>100</b>, patient names and locations are received and associated with a corresponding display. A system identifies and tracks patient assessment and patient vital signs for each patient according to the schedules for each patient in a step S<b>102</b>. For each patient, each assessment and each measurement of a vital sign or other measurement is identified and scheduled. The system creates events for assessment and/or measurements. The system tracks the last completed assessment and/or measurement and the next scheduled assessment and/or measurement. The system visualizes the identified and tracked assessment and measurements grouped for each patient in a consistent format such as a sector. The system includes one or more computer processors or controllers which are programmed or configured to perform these steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The display device <b>30</b> displays the visualization of the vital signs fishbone and other information in a step S<b>104</b>. The visualization defines and lays out the patient vital sign measurements. After taking a patient's vital sign measurement, the information is input into the one or more computer processors to be used to control the display device. In a step S<b>106</b>, the system receives the patient's vital sign measurements. As each vital sign measurement is received, the system classifies each input as the given type of vital sign measurement. The vital signs can be manually measured and input or electronically sensed and input or a combination thereof At step S<b>108</b>, the system checks if more vital signs are needed or entered. If so, the system checks for receipt of additional patient vital sign measurements at S<b>106</b>. If no additional vital signs are received or needed, the system displays the most recent vital signs or other medical information on the display at a step S<b>110</b>. Based upon the classification previously performed by the system at step S<b>106</b>, the one or more processors of the system controls the display to display the fishbone diagram on the display device <b>30</b>. Each vital sign measurement is added to the pre-assigned compartment of the fishbone diagram. If color coding or arrows are to be added, at a step S<b>112</b>, the system controls the display to add the appropriate color coding and arrows based upon user programed range values for each vital sign measurement. At a step S<b>114</b>, the system repeats the method to check if vital signs need to be updated again for a given patient or to begin updating new patient's vital sign measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a patient monitoring system <b>200</b>. A bedside monitor <b>202</b> which houses the display <b>30</b> and one or more processors which are connected with the display <b>30</b>, physiological parameter sensors <b>206</b> connected to a patient <b>226</b> or a user input device <b>208</b>. An input/output circuit <b>210</b> communicates with a communications network <b>212</b> such as one or more of the Internet, Intranet, a local area network, a wide area network, a wireless network, a wired network, a cellular network, a data bus, and the like. It should also be appreciated that the components of the IT infrastructure be located at a central location or at multiple remote locations.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The bedside monitor communicates via the communications network <b>212</b> with a medical records database <b>220</b> which stores the vital signs, medical history, and other patient and medical information from the bedside monitor <b>202</b>. The bedside monitor <b>202</b> can also retrieve medication information from the medical records database <b>220</b>. The display <b>30</b> is sent to the clinician's PDA <b>216</b> and/or to a central display <b>218</b>. The central display <b>218</b> is located in a common area of the hospital such as a nurse's station, on the wall of a ward or unit, or the like and contains the displays <b>30</b> for each of a plurality of patients located in the ward or unit. A nurse or clinician can see all of the patient's vital signs concurrently. Uniformity of the vital signs presentation in the fishbone <b>10</b> facilitates review of the vital signs of the plurality of patients. Optionally, a user input device <b>224</b> is provided to allow a user to manually input patient vital sign information.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">With reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the bedside monitor <b>202</b> includes one or more computer processors <b>230</b> which include a non-transitory computer readable memory <b>232</b> which carries software to control the processor to perform the method of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.
