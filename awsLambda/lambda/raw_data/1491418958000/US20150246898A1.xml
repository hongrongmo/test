      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Living organisms have developed tightly regulated processes that specifically import metals, transport them to intracellular storage sites and ultimately transport them to sites of use. One of the most important functions of metals such as zinc and iron in biological systems is to enable the activity of metalloenzymes. Metalloenzymes are enzymes that incorporate metal ions into the enzyme active site and utilize the metal as a part of the catalytic process. More than one-third of all characterized enzymes are metalloenzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The function of metalloenzymes is highly dependent on the presence of the metal ion in the active site of the enzyme. It is well recognized that agents which bind to and inactivate the active site metal ion dramatically decrease the activity of the enzyme. Nature employs this same strategy to decrease the activity of certain metalloenzymes during periods in which the enzymatic activity is undesirable. For example, the protein TIMP (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases) binds to the zinc ion in the active site of various matrix metalloprotease enzymes and thereby arrests the enzymatic activity. The pharmaceutical industry has used the same strategy in the design of therapeutic agents. For example, the azole antifungal agents fluconazole and voriconazole contain a 1-(1,2,4-triazole) group that binds to the heme iron present in the active site of the target enzyme lanosterol demethylase and thereby inactivates the enzyme. Another example includes the zinc-binding hydroxamic acid group that has been incorporated into most published inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases and histone deacetylases. Another example is the zinc-binding carboxylic acid group that has been incorporated into most published angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the design of clinically safe and effective metalloenzyme inhibitors, use of the most appropriate metal-binding group for the particular target and clinical indication is critical. If a weakly binding metal-binding group is utilized, potency may be suboptimal. On the other hand, if a very tightly binding metal-binding group is utilized, selectivity for the target enzyme versus related metalloenzymes may be suboptimal. The lack of optimal selectivity can be a cause for clinical toxicity due to unintended inhibition of these off-target metalloenzymes. One example of such clinical toxicity is the unintended inhibition of human drug metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 by the currently-available azole antifungal agents such as fluconazole and voriconazole. It is believed that this off-target inhibition is caused primarily by the indiscriminate binding of the currently utilized 1-(1,2,4-triazole) to iron in the active site of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Another example of this is the joint pain that has been observed in many clinical trials of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. This toxicity is considered to be related to inhibition of off-target metalloenzymes due to indiscriminate binding of the hydroxamic acid group to zinc in the off-target active sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Therefore, the search for metal-binding groups that can achieve a better balance of potency and selectivity remains an important goal and would be significant in the realization of therapeutic agents and methods to address currently unmet needs in treating and preventing diseases, disorders and symptoms thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0150">In one aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of any of the formulae herein (e.g., Formula I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0151">In another embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition further comprising an additional therapeutic agent. In a further embodiment, the additional therapeutic agent is an anti-cancer agent, antifungal agent, cardiovascular agent, antiinflammatory agent, chemotherapeutic agent, an anti-angiogenesis agent, cytotoxic agent, an anti-proliferation agent, metabolic disease agent, opthalmologic disease agent, central nervous system (CNS) disease agent, urologic disease agent, or gastrointestinal disease agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0152">In one aspect, the invention provides a kit comprising an effective amount of a compound of any of the formulae herein (e.g., Formula I), in unit dosage form, together with instructions for administering the compound to a subject suffering from or susceptible to a metalloenzyme-mediated disease or disorder, including cancer, solid tumor, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, infectious disease. In other embodiments the disease, disorder or symptom thereof is metabolic disease, ophthalmologic disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease, urologic disease, or gastrointestinal disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0153">The term âpharmaceutically acceptable saltsâ or âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydroiodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge et al., <i>J. Pharm. Sci. </i>1977, 66, 1-19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers known to those of skill in the art are suitable for the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0154">The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0155">In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0156">Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0157">The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, comprising an effective amount of a compound described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In an embodiment, compound is administered to the subject using a pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation, e.g., a pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation that provides sustained delivery of the compound to a subject for at least 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, one week, two weeks, three weeks, or four weeks after the pharmaceutically-acceptable formulation is administered to the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0158">Actual dosage levels and time course of administration of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic (or unacceptably toxic) to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0159">In use, at least one compound according to the present invention is administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount to a subject in need thereof in a pharmaceutical carrier by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intracerebroventricular injection or by oral administration or topical application. In accordance with the present invention, a compound of the invention may be administered alone or in conjunction with a second, different therapeutic. By âin conjunction withâ is meant together, substantially simultaneously or sequentially. In one embodiment, a compound of the invention is administered acutely. The compound of the invention may therefore be administered for a short course of treatment, such as for about 1 day to about 1 week. In another embodiment, the compound of the invention may be administered over a longer period of time to ameliorate chronic disorders, such as, for example, for about one week to several months depending upon the condition to be treated.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0160">By âpharmaceutically effective amountâ as used herein is meant an amount of a compound of the invention, high enough to significantly positively modify the condition to be treated but low enough to avoid serious side effects (at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio), within the scope of sound medical judgment. A pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound of the invention will vary with the particular goal to be achieved, the age and physical condition of the patient being treated, the severity of the underlying disease, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy and the specific compound employed. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention administered to a child or a neonate will be reduced proportionately in accordance with sound medical judgment. The effective amount of a compound of the invention will thus be the minimum amount which will provide the desired effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0161">A decided practical advantage of the present invention is that the compound may be administered in a convenient manner such as by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral or intracerebroventricular injection routes or by topical application, such as in creams or gels. Depending on the route of administration, the active ingredients which comprise a compound of the invention may be required to be coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of enzymes, acids and other natural conditions which may inactivate the compound. In order to administer a compound of the invention by other than parenteral administration, the compound can be coated by, or administered with, a material to prevent inactivation.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0162">The compound may be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Dispersions can also be prepared, for example, in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof, and in oils.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0163">Some examples of substances which can serve as pharmaceutical carriers are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose and cellulose acetates; powdered tragancanth; malt; gelatin; talc; stearic acids; magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oils, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; agar; alginic acids; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and phosphate buffer solution; skim milk powder; as well as other non-toxic compatible substances used in pharmaceutical formulations such as Vitamin C, estrogen and <i>Echinacea, </i>for example. Wetting agents and lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as coloring agents, flavoring agents, lubricants, excipients, tableting agents, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and preservatives, can also be present. Solubilizing agents, including for example, cremaphore and beta-cyclodextrins can also used in the pharmaceutical compositions herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0164">Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the active compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter (or prodrugs thereof) can be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilization processes. The compositions can be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.</p>

The compositions also can contain formulating agents, such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agent. The formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form (e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers) and can contain added preservatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0169">Alternatively, the injectable formulation can be provided in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, including but not limited to sterile pyrogen-free water, buffer, dextrose solution, and the like, before use. To this end, the active compound(s) can be dried by any art-known technique, such as lyophilization, and reconstituted prior to use.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0170">For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0171">For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of, for example, lozenges, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art with, for example, sugars or enteric coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0172">Liquid preparations for oral administration can take the form of, for example, elixirs, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations also can contain buffer salts, preservatives, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0173">Preparations for oral administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound or prodrug, as is well known. For buccal administration, the compositions can take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in a conventional manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0174">For rectal and vaginal routes of administration, the active compound(s) can be formulated as solutions (for retention enemas), suppositories, or ointments containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0175">For nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, fluorocarbons, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator (for example capsules and cartridges comprised of gelatin) can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0176">A specific example of an aqueous suspension formulation suitable for nasal administration using commercially-available nasal spray devices includes the following ingredients: active compound or prodrug (0.5-20 mg/mL); benzalkonium chloride (0.1-0.2 mg/mL); polysorbate 80 (TWEENÂ® 80; 0.5-5 mg/mL); carboxymethylcellulose sodium or microcrystalline cellulose (1-15 mg/mL); phenylethanol (1-4 mg/mL); and dextrose (20-50 mg/mL). The pH of the final suspension can be adjusted to range from about pH 5 to pH 7, with a pH of about pH 5.5 being typical.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0177">For ocular administration, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a solution, emulsion, suspension, and the like, suitable for administration to the eye. A variety of vehicles suitable for administering compounds to the eye are known in the art. Specific non-limiting examples are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,547; U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,934; U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,950; U.S. Pat. No. 5,800,807; U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,445; U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,219; U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,222; U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,841; U.S. Pat. No. 5,077,033; U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,150; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,851, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0178">For prolonged delivery, the active compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a depot preparation for administration by implantation or intramuscular injection. The active ingredient can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt. Alternatively, transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive disc or patch which slowly releases the active compound(s) for percutaneous absorption can be used. To this end, permeation enhancers can be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of the active compound(s). Suitable transdermal patches are described in for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,407,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,352,456; U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,213; U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,168; U.S. Pat. No. 5,290,561; U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,346; U.S. Pat. No. 5,164,189; U.S. Pat. No. 5,163,899; U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,977; U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,240; U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,110; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,921,475, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0179">Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems can be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles that can be used to deliver active compound(s) or prodrug(s). Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) also can be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0180">The pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound(s). The pack can, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied by instructions for administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0181">The active compound(s) or prodrug(s) of the presently disclosed subject matter, or compositions thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example in an amount effective to treat or prevent the particular disease being treated. The compound(s) can be administered therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit or prophylactically to achieve prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient can still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For example, administration of a compound to a patient suffering from an allergy provides therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying allergic response is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the allergy following exposure to the allergen. As another example, therapeutic benefit in the context of asthma includes an improvement in respiration following the onset of an asthmatic attack, or a reduction in the frequency or severity of asthmatic episodes. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0182">For prophylactic administration, the compound can be administered to a patient at risk of developing one of the previously described diseases. A patient at risk of developing a disease can be a patient having characteristics placing the patient in a designated group of at risk patients, as defined by an appropriate medical professional or group. A patient at risk may also be a patient that is commonly or routinely in a setting where development of the underlying disease that may be treated by administration of a metalloenzyme inhibitor according to the invention could occur. In other words, the at risk patient is one who is commonly or routinely exposed to the disease or illness causing conditions or may be acutely exposed for a limited time. Alternatively, prophylactic administration can be applied to avoid the onset of symptoms in a patient diagnosed with the underlying disorder.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0183">The amount of compound administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular indication being treated, the mode of administration, whether the desired benefit is prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular active compound, and the like. Determination of an effective dosage is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0184">Effective dosages can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial dosage for use in animals can be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is at or above an IC<sub>50 </sub>of the particular compound as measured in an in vitro assay, such as the in vitro fungal MIC or minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) and other in vitro assays described in the Examples section. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans. For guidance, see Fingl &amp; Woodbury, âGeneral Principles,â In: <i>Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, </i>Chapter 1, pp. 1-46, 12th edition, McGraw-Hill Professional, and the references cited therein, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0185">Initial dosages also can be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0186">Dosage amounts will typically be in the range of from about 0.0001 or 0.001 or 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, but can be higher or lower, depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the compound, its bioavailability, the mode of administration, and various factors discussed above. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, such as local topical administration, the effective local concentration of active compound(s) cannot be related to plasma concentration. Skilled artisans will be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0187">The compound(s) can be administered once per day, a few or several times per day, or even multiple times per day, depending upon, among other things, the indication being treated and the judgment of the prescribing physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0188">Preferably, the compound(s) will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compound(s) can be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic (or prophylactic) effect is the therapeutic index. Compounds(s) that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>

      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0258">Compounds of the present disclosure were assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of common strains of fungus, <i>T. rubrum </i>using a standardized procedure (CLSI M27-A2).</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0259">Stock solutions of the test compounds and standards were prepared in DMSO at 1,600 Î¼g/mL (<i>T. rubrum</i>). Eleven, serial, one-half dilutions of compounds were prepared in 96-well plates in RPMI+MOPS. The assay concentration ranges were 8-0.001 Î¼g/mL (<i>T. rubrum</i>). Cell suspensions of <i>T. rubrum </i>were prepared and added to each well at concentrations of approximately 3.7Ã10<sup>3 </sup>colony-forming-units per milliliter (cfu/mL). All testing was in duplicate. The inoculated plates were incubated for approximately 96 h at 35Â±1Â° C. At the completion of incubation the wells of each plate were evaluated visually for the presence of fungal growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0260">For voriconazole and the test compounds, the MIC was the concentration at which growth was significantly reduced (about 50% reduction). For voriconazole the MIC was the concentration which reduced T rubrum growth by 50% (per CLSI, M27-A2). For QC purposes <i>C. krusei </i>isolate ATCC 6258 (4.0Ã10<sup>3 </sup>cfu/mL) was included in the VOR assay. This isolate did not exhibit trailing growth against voriconazole, therefore the MIC was the concentration at which growth was completely inhibited.</p>

      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0261">Solutions of each test compound were separately prepared at concentrations of 20000, 6000, 2000, 600, 200, and 60 Î¼M by serial dilution with DMSO:MeCN (50:50 v/v). The individual test compound solutions were then diluted 20-fold with DMSO:MeCN:deionized water (5:5:180 v/v/v) to concentrations of 1000, 300, 100, 30, 10, and 3 Î¼M. Mixtures of isozyme inhibitors (sulfaphenazole, tranylcypromine, and ketoconazole as specific inhibitors of isozymes 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4, respectively) were prepared containing each inhibitor at concentrations of 6000, 2000, 600, 200, 60, 20, 6, and 2 Î¼M by serial dilution with DMSO: ACN (50:50 v/v). The mixed inhibitor solutions were then diluted 20-fold with DMSO:MeCN:deionized water (5:5:180 v/v/v) to concentrations of 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3, and 0.1 Î¼M. The percent of organic solvent attributable to the test compound or inhibitor mixture in the final reaction mixture was 2% v/v.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0262">Pooled human liver microsome suspension (20 mg/mL) was diluted with phosphate buffer to obtain a 5 mg/mL suspension. A solution of NADPH was prepared in phosphate buffer at a concentration of 5 mM. Separate stock solutions of each substrate were prepared in DMSO:MeCN (50:50 v/v), mixed, and diluted in phosphate buffer to obtain a single solution containing each substrate at five times its experimentally determined K<sub>m </sub>concentration. The percent of organic solvent attributable to substrate mixture in the final reaction mixture was 1% v/v.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0263">Substrate solution and microsome suspension were combined in a 1:1 volume ratio, mixed, and distributed to reaction wells of a PCR plate. Individual test compound or combined inhibitor solutions at each concentration were added to the wells and mixed by repetitive aspirate-dispense cycles. For active controls, blank phosphate buffer solution was added in place of test compound solution. Reaction mixtures were allowed to equilibrate at 37Â° C. for approximately two minutes before adding NADPH solution to initiate reaction, followed by pipette mixing of reaction mixture. Ten minutes after addition of NADPH, the reaction mixtures were quenched with cold acetonitrile. The samples were mixed by orbital shaking for approximately one minute and centrifuged at 2900 RCF for ten minutes. A portion of the supernatant was analyzed by gradient reverse-phase HPLC with detection by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0264">Data was fitted to sigmoid dose-response curves and the inhibitory potency of each test compound was determined as its IC<sub>50 </sub>value.</p>

Each stock solution was used to prepare a 2-fold dilution series ranging from 16 to 0.016 Î¼g/mL (total of 11 compound concentrations) in RPMI-1640 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) medium containing 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer and 2% DMSO. A 100 Î¼L aliquot of the dilutions was added to columns 1 (16 Î¼g/mL compound) through 11 (0.016 Î¼g/mL compound) of a 96-well microtiter plate. This format was replicated in a second row of the microtiter plate. Thus, each microtiter plate could include 11 concentrations of four test or control compounds replicated twice. A 100 Î¼L aliquot of RPMI-1640/MOPS/2% DMSO medium was added to column 12 (no compound control) of the microtiter plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0268">A fresh culture of <i>S. tritici </i>was used to prepare a solution of approximately 5Ã10<sup>4 </sup>colony-forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL) in RPMI/MOPS medium without DMSO. A 100 Î¼L aliquot of this solution was added to all 96 wells in the microtiter plate. This results in final concentrations of each test or control compound of 8 Î¼g/mL to 0.008 Î¼g/mL in 200 Î¼L of RPMI/MOPS media containing 1% DMSO and approximately 2.5Ã10<sup>4 </sup>cfu/mL of <i>S. tritici. </i>The assay plates were incubated at 22Â° C. for seven days in the dark without shaking The MIC for each compound was visually determined as the concentration which resulted in 50% reduction in the growth of <i>S. tritici </i>in comparison to the control (column 12).</p>

      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0270">Wheat plants (variety Yuma) were grown from seed in a soil-less peat-based potting mixture (Metromix) until the seedlings had a fully expanded first leaf. Each pot contained 3-8 seedlings. These plants were sprayed until wet with the formulated test compounds. The compounds were formulated at 50 ppm in 10 vol. % acetone plus 90 vol. % Triton X water (deionized water 99.99 wt %+0.01 wt % Triton X100), giving a âformulated test compound.â Formulated test compounds were applied to plants using a turn table sprayer fitted with two opposing air atomization nozzles which delivered approximately 1500 L/ha of spray volume. On the following day, the leaves were inoculated with an aqueous spore suspension of <i>Puccinia recondita tritici </i>and the plants were kept in high humidity overnight to permit spores to germinate and infect the leaf. The plants were then transferred to a greenhouse until disease developed on untreated control plants. Disease severity was evaluated 7-9 days later, depending on the speed of disease development.</p>
