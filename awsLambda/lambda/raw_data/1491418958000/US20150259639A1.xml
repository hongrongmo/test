      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is generally related to vessels, systems and processes useful in fermentation and, in particular, fermentation systems using a gaseous substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">With the ever increasing depletion of fossil fuel deposits, the increasing production of greenhouse gases and recent concerns about climate change, substituting biofuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) for fossil fuels has become an industrial focus. But, biofuels generated to date have their own difficulties and concerns. First generation biofuels are derived from plants (e.g., starch; cane sugar; and corn, rapeseed, soybean, palm, and other vegetable oils), but these fuel crops compete with crops grown for human and animal consumption. The amount of globally available farm land is insufficient to satisfy the increasing needs for both food and fuel. To reduce the demand placed upon food producers for biofuel compatible grains, second generation biofuels using alternative biological material such as cellulose or algae are under development. But, technical difficulties in production, along with the high cost of production, have not made second generation biofuels any more cost-effective or accessible.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Third or next generation biofuels are made using alternative, non-food based, carbon feedstocks. As part of this effort, the use of alternative, non-biological based, feedstocks in the production of higher hydrocarbon compounds including fuels, lubricants, and plastics is gaining ever-increasing momentum. Such feedstocks may include one or more carbon containing compounds or mixtures of carbon containing and non-carbon containing compounds that include, among others, methane and syngas. Methane, for example, is a relatively abundant, naturally occurring and found in many locations throughout the world. Methane is also produced during many biological decay processes, and thus may be captured from waste treatment and landfill facilities. For its relative abundance, methane is a potent greenhouse gas, having 23Ã the relative greenhouse gas contribution of CO<sub>2</sub>. Historically, methane has been viewed as a somewhat valuable byproduct that is difficult to convert to higher value products or to transport to the marketplace from remote or stranded locations such as remote gas fields or off-shore production platforms. Methane from such sources, as well as the methane produced by biological decomposition processes occurring at sewage treatment facilities and landfills, is primarily either vented or flared. The ability to economically and efficiently convert methane and similar carbon containing gases to one or more higher value C<sub>2 </sub>or higher hydrocarbons would permit producers to take advantage of a relatively abundant, non-biologically produced, feedstock while at the same time, providing a significant environmental benefit.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The recent rise in domestic production of methane (from 48 billion cubic feet equivalent per day in 2006 to 65 billion cubic feet equivalent per day in 2012) has driven the cost of natural gas to record lows (from about $14.00/MMBTU in 2006 to about $2.50/MMBTU in 2012). Domestic natural gas is primarily produced by hydraulic fracturing (âfrackingâ), but methane can also be obtained from other sources, such as landfills and sewage. But, methane's volatility makes the transport and/or direct usage of methane as a fuel problematic.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">For these reasons, a strong incentive exists to convert the methane to one or more liquid products, for example motor fuels, to permit easier transport to the point of use or sale. Two main approaches are currently being pursued: liquefaction leading to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and chemical conversion to convert gas-to-liquid (GTL) (Patel, 2005, 7th World Congress of Chemical Engineering, Glasgow, Scotland, UK). The Fischer Tropsch (F-T) process is currently the most prevalent approach for converting large quantities of methane to higher-order hydrocarbons (Patel, 2005). Note that the F-T process takes syngas as an input which is produced from natural gas by steam reforming (syngas can also be sourced from coal gasification, by high temperature reaction with water and oxygen). The F-T process yields petroleum products consistent with today's fuel supply, but suffers from a number of drawbacks, including low yields, poor selectivity (making downstream utilization complex), and requires significant capital expenditure and scale to achieve economical production (Spath and Dayton, December 2003 NRELITP-510-34929). The massive scale required for an F-T plant (generally in excess of two billion dollars in capital cost [Patel, 2005]) also represents a significant limitation due to the large amount of methane feedstock required to offset the enormous capital cost of the F-T process. As methane transportation is prohibitively expensive in most cases, such a plant must be co-located with a steady, reliable, and cost efficient source of methane, usually in the form of a significant methane reservoir or a methane pipeline. An additional cost and scaling factor is the economics of gas-scrubbing technologies (Spath and Dayton, 2003), since F-T catalysts are quite sensitive to common contaminants found in natural gas that pass unaffected through the syngas conversion process.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The requirements for ready access to large volumes of a relatively clean methane containing gas, combined with a massive capital investment, currently limit natural gas based F-T plants to successful and economically viable operation in only a few locations world-wide (Spath and Dayton, 2003). The high minimum processing requirement for a gas-to-liquids process or liquified natural gas plant, combined with the high cost of transport, result in smaller methane sources remaining as âstrandedâ gas deposits. Such stranded gas can include, but is not limited to, natural gas produced at off-shore oil wells, or methane off-gas from landfills. Due to the current absence of efficient small-scale conversion technologies, such stranded gas sources are typically vented to atmosphere or flared, as methane accumulation presents a significant safety risk. Gas-to-liquids facilities using the Fischer-Tropsh process have been in operation semi-continuously since 1938. Several companies are currently investigating introduction of new plants given the current availability and price of methane discussed above. However, despite significant research and development over the last 70+ years, the limitations of Fischer-Tropsch technology prevent broad adoption of commercial gas-to-liquids processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In view of the above limitations, biological fermentation using C<sub>1 </sub>substrates as a carbon source presents an attractive solution to both the current competition between food sources and fermentation for chemicals/fuels, as well as the lack of good options for utilization of natural gas. However, fermentation of gaseous substrates such as methane, CO, or CO<sub>2 </sub>presents significant challenges due to the requirement that the carbon substrate must be transferred from the gas phase to an aqueous phase to allow for uptake and metabolism by the C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganisms in culture. Simultaneously, other gasses such as 0<sub>2 </sub>or H<sub>2 </sub>may also be required to be transferred from the gas phase to allow cellular metabolism to progress (aerobic or anaerobic metabolism, respectively). Waste products (such as CO<sub>2 </sub>in the case of aerobic metabolism) must be removed rapidly from the reactor to allow for efficient microbial growth. Further, the heat generation from metabolism of C<sub>1 </sub>substrates is significant and the system must be cooled continuously to maintain optimal conditions for microbial growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Convective mass transfer from the liquid phase to the vapor phase can be described with a mass transfer coefficient. The flux is equal to the product of the mass transfer coefficient, the surface area, and the concentration difference (Flux=k A ÎC).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The mass transfer coefficient is influenced by a variety of factors including the size of the molecule to be transferred, its solubility in the aqueous phase, and the size of the boundary layer between the phases (typically controlled in fermentation systems by mixing speed and turbulence). The surface area between the gas and liquid phases in most fermentation systems is primarily limited by the bubble size of the input gas. Bubble size can be controlled by introducing the gas through small pores, as well as increasing shear forces to break apart bubbles and prevent coalescence. The concentration difference can be the concentration difference across the gas phase boundary layer, the concentration difference across the liquid phase boundary layer, the concentration difference between the bulk vapor and the vapor which would be in equilibrium with the bulk liquid, or the concentration difference between the bulk liquid and the liquid which would be in equilibrium with the bulk vapor. In most fermentation systems, the concentration difference is controlled by the pressure of the gas phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Conventional fermentation systems (bioreactors) achieve gas mixing by one of two methods: stirring or airlift. Stirred fermentors achieve mixing by means of stirring blades generally placed centrally in a single large fermentor. The stirrer blades generate turbulence and shear in the liquid while gas bubbles are introduced at the bottom of the fermentor, thus impeding the progress of the bubbles as they travel up the fermentor and shearing the gas bubbles to reduce the tendency of the bubbles to coalesce within the fermentor. The advantage of this type of fermentor is the fast, relatively homogeneous mixing and gas bubble dispersion that is possible due to the high speed of the mixing blades. However, this type of fermentor can be difficult to scale-up, as the energy requirements to obtain the same rate of mixing and mass transport can be prohibitive as the volume increases. Further, the vigorous mixing implies a significant heating of the fermentation liquid, and the use of a single large fermentor limits the surface area available for heat exchange cooling.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Airlift fermentors avoid mechanical stirrers by incorporating a flow path for the liquid. Airlift fermentors have a downflow and an upflow section which are interconnected at both ends; these sections can either be separate units (referred to as a loop fermentor), or concentric (airlift fermentor). In either case, gasses are supplied at the bottom of the upflow section through a bubble-generating apparatus. The bubbles mix with the liquid, reducing the density of the liquid and causing the gas-liquid mixture to rise through the upflow section. The rising mixture displaces liquid at the top of the reactor, which travels down the downflow section to replace the liquid at the bottom, establishing a circular flow in the fermentor. In order to obtain a long residence time for the gas bubbles in the liquid, airlift fermentors are generally tall and have a limited transverse cross-sectional area. This implies that the gas must be supplied at a relatively high pressure to overcome hydrostatic pressure formed by the column of liquid present in the fermentor. In addition, the bubble size increases significantly throughout the fermentor as the pressure decreases with height. The increasing bubble diameter proportionately reduces the rate of mass transfer between the gas bubbles and the liquid phase by reducing the ratio of gas bubble volume (proportionate to the cube of the gas bubble radius) to gas bubble area (proportionate to the square of the gas bubble area) through which mass transfer may occur. Flow rates and shear forces in airlift fermentors are significantly lower than in stirred tank fermentors, which also tend to increase bubble coalescence and reduce the efficiency of cooling the fermentor. Finally, separation of the unused and waste gases from the mixture exiting the upflow portion of the fermentor prior to the return of the liquid to the downflow section can be challenging.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, structures, standard vessel design details, detailed design parameters of available components such as liquid or gas distributors, pumps, turbines, and similar, details concerning the design and construction of American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) pressure vessels, control system theory, specific steps in one or more fermentation processes, and the like have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the embodiments. Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the specification and claims which follow, the word âcompriseâ and variations thereof, such as, âcomprisesâ and âcomprisingâ are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense, that is, as âincluding, but not limited to.â Further, headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not interpret the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Reference throughout this specification to âone embodimentâ or âan embodimentâ means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of the phrases âin one embodimentâ or âin an embodimentâ in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Also, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. It should also be noted that the term âorâ is generally employed in its sense including âand/orâ unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Fermentors are generally defined as any vessel in which a fermentation process is carried out. Given the vast number of fermentation processes and the wide variety of fermentable substrates, fermentors can range simple continuous stirred tank reactors found in the alcoholic beverage industry to highly complex, specialized vessels having gas distribution and internal structures tailored to a particular substrate and/or a particular biological species. Fermentors useful in converting carbon containing gases such as methane and syngas (a mixture of CO and H<sub>2</sub>) to longer chain gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons generally disperse a gas substrate containing the C<sub>1 </sub>carbon compound within a liquid media containing one or more nutrients to provide a multi-phase mixture. This multi-phase mixture is fed to one or more microbiological colonies that convert a portion of the C<sub>1 </sub>carbon compound(s) in the gas substrate to more preferred, longer chain, C<sub>2 </sub>or higher compounds. The substrate composition, nutrients, and microbiological organisms comprising the colony (i.e., the biomass within the fermentor) can be variously adjusted or tailored to provide a desired final matrix of C<sub>2 </sub>or higher compounds which may be present as a liquid, gas, or intracellular material.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">From a mass transfer perspective, gas substrate fermentors present a unique challenge in that the substrate is trapped within a gas bubble and in order for microbiological uptake of the substrate to occur, the gas substrate must first pass from the gas bubble to the microbiological organisms either directly or indirectly via dissolution in the liquid media. Such fermentation processes are thus frequently limited by the ability of the system to facilitate and/or sustain a desirably high level of mass transfer of the substrate from the gas bubbles to the microbiological organisms within the fermentor. At the least, the rate of mass transfer from the gas bubble to either the surrounding liquid media or to a microbiological organisms is a function of the gas pressure within the gas bubble, the volume to surface area ratio of the gas bubble, and the contact time of the gas bubble with the surrounding liquid or microbiological organisms. Increasing the pressure within the gas bubble or increasing the contact time of the gas bubble with the surrounding liquid or microbiological organisms results in a higher effective mass transfer rate between the substrate and the microbiological organisms. Decreasing the volume to surface area ratio of the gas bubble (i.e., reducing the diameter of the gas bubbles) results in a higher effective mass transfer rate between the gas bubble and the surrounding liquid. An ideal fermentor would therefore have a large number of relatively small diameter gas bubbles at a relatively high pressure that are held in close or intimate contact with the surrounding liquid or microbiological organisms for an extended period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Disclosed herein are a number of fermentation systems, methods, and apparatuses that are capable of providing relatively small diameter, relatively high pressure gas bubbles. Disclosed herein are a number of fermentation systems, methods, and apparatuses capable of providing an extended contact time with the surrounding liquid and/or biological organism(s). Such fermentation systems, methods, and apparatuses can advantageously provide a highly efficient gas substrate fermentation system that has been found particularly useful in converting C<sub>1 </sub>compounds to more preferred gaseous, liquid, and intra-cellular C<sub>2 </sub>and higher compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, the terms âC<sub>1 </sub>substrateâ or âC<sub>1 </sub>compoundâ refers to any carbon containing molecule or composition that lacks a carbon-carbon bond. Sample molecules or compositions include methane, methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid or a salt thereof, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, syngas, methylamines (e.g., monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine), methylthiols, or methylhalogens.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As used herein, the terms âC<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganismâ or âC<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganismâ refers to any microorganism having the ability to use a single carbon (C<sub>1</sub>) substrate as a source of energy or as its sole source of energy and biomass, and may or may not use other carbon substrates (such as sugars and complex carbohydrates) for energy and biomass. For example, a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism may oxidize a C<sub>1 </sub>substrate, such as methane or methanol. C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganisms include bacteria (such as Methanotrophs and Methylotrophs) and yeast. In at least some instances, a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism does not include a photosynthetic microorganism, such as algae. In certain embodiments, the C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism will be an âobligate C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism,â meaning its sole source of energy comprises C<sub>1 </sub>substrates and nothing else.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As used herein, the term âmethylotrophic bacteriaâ refers to any bacteria capable of oxidizing organic compounds that do not contain carbon-carbon bonds. In certain embodiments, a methylotrophic bacterium may be a methanotroph. For example, âmethanotrophic bacteriaâ refers to any methylotrophic bacteria that have the ability to oxidize methane as its primary source of carbon and energy. Exemplary methanotrophic bacteria include <i>Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylocystis, Methylomicrobium</i>, or <i>Methanomonas</i>. In certain other embodiments, the methylotrophic bacterium is an âobligate methylotrophic bacterium,â which refers to bacteria that are limited to the use of C<sub>1 </sub>substrates for the generation of energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As used herein, the term âCO utilizing bacteriumâ refers to a bacterium that naturally possesses the ability to oxidize carbon monoxide (CO) as a source of carbon and energy. Carbon monoxide may be utilized from âsynthesis gasâ or âsyngasâ, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen produced by gasification of any organic feedstock, such as coal, coal oil, natural gas, biomass, and waste organic matter. Carbon monoxide utilizing bacterium does not include bacteria that must be genetically modified for growth on carbon monoxide as its carbon source.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As used herein, the term âsyngasâ refers to a mixture including at least carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). In at least some instances, syngas may also include CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, and other gases in smaller quantities relative to CO and H<sub>2</sub>. Syngas may be prepared using any available process, including but not limited to, a water gas shift or coal gasification process.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As used herein, the term âgrowthâ is defined as any increase in cell mass. This may occur through cell division (replication) and the formation of new cells during âbalanced growth,â or during âunbalanced growthâ when cellular mass increases due to the accumulation of one or more intracellular or intercellular polymers, such as certain lipids. In the latter case, growth may be manifest as an increase in cell size due to the accumulation of a biopolymer within the cell. During âbalanced cell growth,â all of the feedstocks (electron donors and electron acceptors) and all of the nutrients are present in the ratios required to make all of the macromolecular components of a cell. That is, no feedstock or nutrient limits the synthesis of proteins, complex carbohydrate polymers, fats, or nucleic acids. In contrast, during âunbalanced cell growth,â a feedstock or nutrient needed to make one or more of a cell's macromolecules is not present in an amount or ratio required for balanced growth. Accordingly, this feedstock or nutrient becomes limiting and is referred to as a âlimiting nutrient.â</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Some cells may still achieve net growth under unbalanced conditions, but the growth is unbalanced and polymers that can be synthesized in the absence of the limiting feedstock or nutrient will accumulate. These polymers include lipids or intracellular storage products, such as the polydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhdroxyvalerate (PHV), and polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHHx)-glycogen, or secreted materials, such as extracellular polysaccharide. Such oil compositions are useful in the production of bioplastics.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Sample balanced and unbalanced growth conditions may differ in the nitrogen content in the media. For example, nitrogen constitutes about 12% of dry cell weight, which means that 12 mg/L nitrogen must be supplied (along with a feedstock and other nutrients in the required stoichiometric ratios) to grow 100 mg/L dry cell weight. If other feedstock and nutrients are available in the quantities needed to produce 100 mg/L of dry cell weight, but less than 12 mg/L nitrogen is provided, then unbalanced cell growth may occur, with accumulation of polymers that do not contain nitrogen. If nitrogen is subsequently provided, the stored polymer may serve as feedstock for the cell, allowing balanced growth, with replication and production of new cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As used herein, the term âgrowth cycleâ as applied to a cell or microorganism refers to the metabolic cycle through which a cell or microorganism moves in culture conditions. For example, the cycle may include various stages, such as a lag phase, an exponential phase, the end of exponential phase, and a stationary phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As used herein, the term âexponential growthâ, âexponential phase growthâ, âlog phaseâ or âlog phase growthâ refer to the rate at which microorganisms are growing and dividing. For example, during log phase, microorganisms are growing at their maximal rate given their genetic potential, the nature of the medium, and the conditions under which they are grown. Microorganism rate of growth is constant during exponential phase and the microorganism divides and doubles in number at regular intervals. Cells that are âactively growingâ are those that are growing in log phase. In contrast, âstationary phaseâ refers to the point in the growth cycle during which cell growth of a culture slows or even ceases.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As used herein, the term âgrowth-altering environmentâ refers to energy, chemicals, or living things that have the capacity to either inhibit cell growth or kill cells. Inhibitory agents may include mutagens, drugs, antibiotics, UV light, extreme temperature, pH, metabolic byproducts, organic chemicals, inorganic chemicals, bacteria, viruses, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As used herein, the term âhigh growth variantâ refers to a organism, microorganism, bacterium, yeast, or cell capable of growth with a C<sub>1 </sub>substrate, such as methane or methanol, as the sole carbon and energy source and which possesses an exponential phase growth rate that is faster than the parent, reference or wild-type organism, microorganism, bacterium, yeast, or cellâthat is, the high growth variant has a faster doubling time and consequently a high rate of growth and yield of cell mass per gram of C<sub>1 </sub>substrate metabolized as compared to a parent cell (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,689,601).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As used herein, the term âbiofuelâ refers to a fuel at least partially derived from âbiomass.â</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As used herein, the term âbiomassâ refers to a renewable resource having a biological origin.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As used herein, the term âbiorefineryâ refers to a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels from biomass.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">As used herein, the term ârefineryâ refers to an oil refinery, or aspects thereof, at which oil compositions (e.g., biomass, biofuel, or fossil fuels such as crude oil, coal or natural gas) may be processed. Sample processes carried out at such refineries include cracking, transesterification, reforming, distilling, hydroprocessing, isomerization, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As used herein, the terms ârecombinantâ or ânon-naturalâ refers to an organism microorganism, cell, nucleic acid molecule, or vector that has at least one genetic alternation or has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule, or refers to a cell that has been altered such that the expression of an endogenous nucleic acid molecule or gene can be controlled. Recombinant also refers to a cell that is derived from a cell having one or more such modifications. For example, recombinant cells may express genes or other nucleic acid molecules that are not found in identical form within the native cell (i.e., unmodified or wild type cell), or may provide an altered expression pattern of endogenous genes, such genes that may otherwise be over-expressed, under-expressed, minimally expressed, or not expressed at all. In another example, genetic modifications to nucleic acid molecules encoding enzymes or functional fragments thereof can provide biochemical reaction(s) or metabolic pathway capabilities to a recombinant microorganism or cell that is new or altered from its naturally occurring state.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As used herein, the term âheterologousâ nucleic acid molecule, construct or sequence refers to a nucleic acid molecule or portion of a nucleic acid molecule sequence that is not native to a cell in which it is expressed or is a nucleic acid molecule with an altered expression as compared to the native expression levels in similar conditions. For example, a heterologous control sequence (e.g., promoter, enhancer) may be used to regulate expression of a gene or a nucleic acid molecule in a way that is different than the gene or a nucleic acid molecule is normally expressed in nature or culture. Generally, heterologous nucleic acid molecules are not endogenous to the cell or part of the genome in which they are present, and have been added to the cell by conjugation, transformation, transfection, electroporation, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The systems for fermentation of the instant disclosure may include separate units (e.g., processing units or systems that are disposed in close proximity or adjacent to each other, or not), integrated units, or the system itself may be interconnected and integrated. The systems of this disclosure may use at least one gas phase feedstock, including one or more C<sub>1 </sub>compounds, oxygen, and/or hydrogen. In certain embodiments, the fermentation system uses a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism (e.g., a methanotroph such as <i>Methylosinus trichosporium </i>OB3b, <i>Methylococcus capsulatus </i>Bath, <i>Methylomonas </i>sp. 16a, <i>Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum </i>20Z, or high growth variants or combinations thereof) as the primary microorganism in the fermentation culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">A variety of culture methodologies may be used for the microorganism, bacteria and yeast described herein. For example, C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganisms, such as methanotroph or methylotroph bacteria, may be grown by batch culture and continuous culture methodologies. Generally cells in log phase are often responsible for the bulk production of a product or intermediate of interest in some systems, whereas stationary or post-exponential phase production can be obtained in other systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">A classical batch culturing method is a closed system in which the media composition is set when the culture is started and is not altered during the culture process. That is, media is inoculated at the beginning of the culturing process with one or more microorganisms of choice and then are allowed to grow without adding anything to the system. As used herein, a âbatchâ culture is in reference to not changing the amount of a particular carbon source initially added, whereas control of factors such as pH and oxygen concentration can be monitored and altered during the culture. In batch systems, metabolite and biomass compositions of the system change constantly up to the time the culture is terminated. Within batch cultures, cells (e.g., bacteria such as methylotrophs) will generally move from a static lag phase to a high growth logarithmic phase to a stationary phase where growth rate is reduced or stopped (and will eventually lead to cell death if conditions do change).</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">A fed-batch system is a variation on the standard batch system in which a carbon substrate of interest is added in increments as the culture progresses. Fed-batch systems are useful when cell metabolism is likely to be inhibited by catabolite repression and when it is desirable to have limited amounts of substrate in the media. Since it is difficult to measure actual substrate concentration in fed-batch systems, an estimate is made based on changes of measurable factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and the partial pressure of waste gases. Batch and fed-batch culturing methods are common and known in the art (see, e.g., Thomas D. Brock, Biotechnology: A Textbook of Industrial Microbiology, 2nd Ed. (1989) Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, M A; Deshpande, 1992, Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 36:227).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Continuous cultures are âopenâ systems in the sense that defined culture media is continuously added to a bioreactor while an equal amount of used (âconditionedâ) media is removed simultaneously for processing. Continuous cultures generally maintain the cells at a constant high, liquid phase density where cells are primarily in logarithmic growth phase. Alternatively, continuous culture may be practiced with immobilized cells (e.g., biofilm) where carbon and nutrients are continuously added and valuable products, byproducts, and waste products are continuously removed from the cell mass. Cell immobilization may be achieved with a wide range of solid supports composed of natural materials, synthetic materials, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Continuous or semi-continuous culture allows for the modulation of one or more factors that affect cell growth or end product concentration. For example, one method may maintain a limited nutrient at a fixed rate (e.g., carbon source, nitrogen) and allow all other parameters to change over time. In other embodiments, several factors affecting growth may be continuously altered while cell concentration, as measured by media turbidity, is kept constant. The goal of a continuous culture system is to maintain steady state growth conditions while balancing cell loss due to media being drawn off against the cell growth rate. Methods of modulating nutrients and growth factors for continuous culture processes and techniques for maximizing the rate of product formation are well known in the art (see Brock, 1992).</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In certain embodiments, culture media includes a carbon substrate as a source of energy for a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism. Suitable substrates include C<sub>1 </sub>substrates, such as methane, methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid (formate), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methylated amines (methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, etc.), methylated thiols, or methyl halogens (bromomethane, chloromethane, iodomethane, dichloromethane, etc.). In certain embodiments, culture media may comprise a single C<sub>1 </sub>substrate as the sole carbon source for a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism, or may comprise a mixture of two or more C<sub>1 </sub>substrates (mixed C<sub>1 </sub>substrate composition) as multiple carbon sources for a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Additionally, some C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing organisms are known to utilize non-C<sub>1 </sub>substrates, such as sugar, glucosamine or a variety of amino acids for metabolic activity. For example, some <i>Candida </i>species can metabolize alanine or oleic acid (Sulter et al., Arch. Microbiol. 153:485-489, 1990). <i>Methylobacterium extorquens </i>AM1 is capable of growth on a limited number of C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, and C<sub>4 </sub>substrates (Van Dien et al., Microbiol. 149:601-609, 2003). Alternatively, a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism may be a recombinant variant having the ability to utilize alternative carbon substrates. Hence, it is contemplated that a carbon source in culture media may comprise a mixture of carbon substrates, with single and multi-carbon compounds, depending on the C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing microorganism selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the instant disclosure provides a method for making fuel, comprising converting biomass from a culture primarily comprising a C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganism into an oil composition and refining the oil composition into a fuel. In certain embodiments, the C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganism is an obligate C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganism, such as an obligate methanotroph or methylotroph. In further embodiments, the C<sub>1 </sub>metabolizing non-photosynthetic microorganism is a recombinant microorganism comprising a heterologous polynucleotide encoding a fatty acid producing enzyme, a formaldehyde assimilation enzyme, or a combination thereof.

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an example fermentor <b>100</b> including a number of hollow fluid conduits <b>102</b> (only one shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> for clarity) disposed within an interior space <b>106</b> formed by a vessel <b>108</b>. The vessel <b>108</b> can include one or more walls <b>110</b>, a bottom <b>124</b> and an optional top <b>126</b> that partially or completely encloses the hollow fluid conduit <b>102</b>, the vessel <b>108</b>, or both. At least a portion of the space existent between the number of hollow fluid conduits <b>102</b> and the vessel <b>108</b> provides one or more downward flow paths <b>114</b> through which a downward flow <b>116</b> may occur. At least a portion of the space existent within each of the number of hollow fluid conduits <b>102</b> provides one or more upward flow paths <b>118</b> through which an upward flow <b>120</b> may occur. One or more liquid distributors <b>130</b> may be disposed in, on, or about the vessel <b>108</b> to introduce one or more liquids to the downward flow path <b>114</b>. One or more gas distributors <b>132</b> may be disposed in, on, or about the vessel <b>108</b> to introduce one or more gases or gas substrates to the downward flow path <b>114</b>. The positioning of the hollow fluid conduit <b>102</b> within the vessel <b>108</b> advantageously allows for a more accurate and a more consistent scaling than either loop or airlift fermentor designs, since the volume of the fermentor <b>100</b> is scaled based upon the radius or cross-sectional profile rather than length.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The addition of one or more substrate gases via the one or more gas distributors <b>132</b> in some instances, promotes the formation of finely divided substrate gas bubbles to the liquid within the downward flow path <b>114</b>. The combination of the liquid and the finely divided, dispersed gas or gas substrate bubbles creates a multi-phase mixture having a generally a downward flow <b>116</b> in the downward flow path <b>114</b>. The downward flow <b>116</b> includes a significant number of entrained gas or substrate gas bubbles dispersed within the multi-phase mixture liquid. The difference in density between the gas bubbles and the liquid in the multi-phase mixture causes the gas or gas substrate bubbles to tend to rise upward. However, by maintaining the superficial velocity of the downward flow <b>116</b> in the downward flow path <b>114</b> at a rate greater than the gas bubble rise rate, gas substrate bubbles present in the multiphase mixture in the downward flow path <b>114</b> will travel at a reduced velocity in a generally downward direction. The net velocity of the gas substrate bubbles in the downward flow path <b>114</b> is the superficial velocity of the multiphase fluid in the downward flow path <b>114</b> minus the rise rate of the gas substrate bubbles. Since the gas substrate bubbles travel through the downward flow path <b>114</b> at a velocity less than the comparable rise rate in an airlift fermentor, contact time between the gas substrate bubbles and microbiological organisms existent within the downward flow path <b>114</b> is advantageously increased over airlift type fermentors. Although only one liquid distributor <b>130</b> and one gas distributor <b>132</b> are shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> for clarity, any number of additional liquid distributors, gas distributors, or combinations thereof may be added at regular or irregular intervals within the downward flow path <b>114</b>.</p>

In one instance, the multi-phase mixture in the downward flow path <b>114</b> can enter the hollow fluid conduit <b>102</b> via a gap between the hollow fluid conduit and the bottom <b>124</b> of the vessel <b>108</b>. In at least some instances, the bottom <b>124</b> of the vessel <b>108</b> can be shaped, formed, or configured to promote the accumulation of biological material (i.e., âbiosolidsâ or âbiomassâ) at a desired location within the vessel <b>108</b>. For example, the bottom <b>124</b> can be conically shaped, dished, or sloped such that biomass falling to the bottom of the fermentor <b>100</b> preferentially collects in one or more predetermined locations. In such instances, each of the number of hollow fluid conduits <b>102</b> may have different lengths in order to maintain a defined desired or preferred gap or spacing between the inlet of each of the number of hollow fluid conduits <b>102</b> and the bottom <b>124</b> of the vessel <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Having entered the upward flow path <b>118</b>, the multi-phase mixture creates an upward flow <b>120</b> therein. Both the fluid and the gas bubbles in the upward flow path <b>118</b> will travel in a generally upward direction.

In some instances, uncontrolled thermal energy increases can result in the death of all or a portion of the microbiological organisms within the fermenter.

Such gases can include a single gas or a combination of gases capable of supporting or providing sustenance or nutrients to the biological organisms within the fermentor <b>100</b>. In at least some instances, such gases may include one or more inert gases, for example nitrogen. In at least some instances, a plurality of gases, a plurality of substrate gases, or some combination thereof may be introduced separately to the downward flow path <b>114</b> to advantageously reduce or even preclude the formation of explosive gas mixtures outside of the fermentor <b>100</b>. For example, where an inflammable C<sub>1 </sub>compound (e.g., methane) is used to provide at least a portion of a gaseous substrate for the biological organisms within the fermentor <b>100</b> and where air is used to provide oxygen to the biological organisms within the fermentor <b>100</b>, the gas containing the inflammable C<sub>1 </sub>compound may be introduced using a first gas distributor <b>132</b><i>a </i>and the air introduced using a second, physically distinct or separate, gas distributor <b>132</b><i>b </i>to avoid mixing of the C<sub>1 </sub>compound and the air outside of the fermentor <b>100</b>. The introduction of one or more liquids and one or more gases to the downward flow path <b>114</b> creates a downward flow <b>116</b> of a multi-phase fluid within the downward flow path <b>114</b>.

Such systems advantageously introduce one or more liquid media containing one or more nutrients and one or more gaseous substrates in a downward flow path <b>114</b> to provide a multi-phase mixture having an overall downward flow <b>116</b> therein. The fluid velocity of the multi-phase mixture within the downward flowpath <b>114</b> is sufficient to cause the gas substrate bubbles present in the multi-phase mixture to flow in a downward direction. However, the tendency for the gaseous substrate bubbles to rise within the multi-phase mixture advantageously extends the residence time of the gaseous substrate bubbles within the downward flow path <b>114</b>, thereby enhancing mass transfer and subsequent microbiological uptake of the gaseous substrate in the downward flow path. After passing through the downward flow path <b>114</b>, the multi-phase mixture enters the upward flow <b>118</b> path where additional mass transfer and microbiological uptake may occur. The multi-phase mixture is removed from the fermentor and optionally pressure reduced and separated to provide one or more desired materials. The method commences at <b>702</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">At <b>704</b> the gaseous substrate is dispersed within the liquid media to form the multi-phase mixture.

In some instances, gaseous substrate may be dispersed at multiple points within the downward flow path <b>114</b>, upward flow path <b>118</b>, or both and the gaseous substrate at each dispersion point may have the same or a different temperature, pressure, composition, or combinations thereof. The ability to vary physical or compositional properties of the gaseous substrate at different locations within the fermentor advantageously permits the tailoring of the gaseous substrate not only to the specific microbiological species present in the fermentor, but also to the specific location of the microbiological species within the fermentor based on the dispersion point of the gaseous substrate within the fermentor.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">At <b>706</b> the multi-phase mixture provides a downward flow <b>116</b> within the downward flow path <b>114</b>.

The multi-phase mixture will have a superficial fluid velocity within the downward flow path <b>114</b> of âYâ feet per second. By maintaining the superficial fluid velocity of the multi-phase mixture above the gas bubble rise rate (i.e., Y&gt;X), the substrate gas bubbles will flow downward rather than upward in the downward flow path <b>114</b>. By adjusting or otherwise controlling the flow rate of the multi-phase mixture in the downward flow path <b>114</b> to a velocity that only slightly exceeds the gas substrate bubble rise rate, the residence time of the gas bubbles in the downward flow path <b>114</b> can be increased. Such an increase in residence time in the downward flow path <b>114</b> can advantageously improve mass transfer and microbiological uptake of the gas substrate <b>204</b> by the microbiological organisms present in the downward flow path <b>114</b>. In some instances, the velocity of the multi-phase mixture in the downward flow path <b>114</b> can be measured and controlled.
