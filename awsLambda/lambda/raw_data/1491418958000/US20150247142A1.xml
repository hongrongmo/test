      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention provides compositions and methods for modulation of small non-coding RNAs, including miRNA. In particular, this invention relates to antisense compounds, particularly antisense compounds having chemically modified nucleosides arranged in patterns which in some embodiments, enhance the ability of the antisense compounds to hybridize with or sterically occlude small non-coding RNA targets, particularly miRNAs.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately 21-24 nucleotides in length, these are also known as âmatureâ miRNA), non-coding RNA molecules encoded in the genomes of plants and animals. These highly conserved, endogenously expressed RNAs are believed to regulate the expression of genes by binding to the 3â²-untranslated regions (3â²-UTR) of specific mRNAs. MiRNAs may act as key regulators of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell death (apoptosis), metabolism, and cell differentiation. On a larger scale, miRNA expression has been implicated in early development, brain development and disease progression (such as cancers and viral infections). There is speculation that in higher eukaryotes, the role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression could be as important as that of transcription factors. More than 200 different miRNAs have been identified in plants and animals (Ambros et al., Curr. Biol., 2003, 13, 807-818). Mature miRNAs appear to originate from long endogenous primary miRNA transcripts (also known as pri-miRNAs, pri-mirs, pri-miRs or pri-pre-miRNAs) that are often hundreds of nucleotides in length (Lee, et al., EMBO J., 2002, 21(17), 4663-4670).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Functional analyses of miRNAs have revealed that these small non-coding RNAs contribute to different physiological processes in animals, including developmental timing, organogenesis, differentiation, patterning, embryogenesis, growth control and programmed cell death. Examples of particular processes in which miRNAs participate include stem cell differentiation, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and exocytosis (reviewed by Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, Development, 2005, 132, 4653-4662).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">MiRNAs are thought to exercise post-transcriptional control in most eukaryotic organisms and have been detected in plants and animals as well as certain viruses. A large number of miRNAs have been identified from several species (see for example PCT Publication WO 03/029459 and Published US Patent Applications 20050222399, 20050227934, 20050059005 and 20050221293, each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety) and many more have been bioinformatically predicted. Many of these miRNA are conserved across species, but species specific miRNA have also been identified (Pillai, RNA, 2005, 11, 1753-1761).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Consequently, there is a need for agents that regulate gene expression via the mechanisms mediated by small non-coding RNAs. Compounds that can increase or decrease gene expression or activity by modulating the levels of miRNA in a cell with greater activity than unmodified oligonucleotides are therefore desirable.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention therefore provides enchanced chemically modified antisense compounds which are useful for modulating the levels, activity, or function of miRNAs. One having skill in the art, once armed with this disclosure will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify compounds, compositions and methods for these uses.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Antisense compounds have been widely used to target coding genes, for the purposes of elucidating gene function, and additionally for therapeutic applications. Antisense compounds typically have chemically modified nucleosides arranged in patterns that elicit target cleavage by cellular enzymes such as RNase H or by enzymes of cellular complexes such as RISC. Alternatively, antisense compounds have chemically modified nucleosides arranged in patterns that promote steric hinderance (or steric occlusion) of the target RNA (e.g. for modulating splicing). The same chemically modified motifs used to target mRNA have not been found to be particularly effective when targeting small non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs. Antisense compounds which contain uniform modifications have been shown to be active in inhibiting the activity of small non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs, but there exists a need to find antisense compounds with enhanced activity to inhibit small non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs, compared to the uniformly modified antisense compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">It has been found that the use of chemically modified nucleosides in an antisense compound can affect the ability of the antisense compound to bind to, and modulate, and target small non-coding RNA, such as miRNA. It has further been discovered that the arrangement of chemically modified nucleosides in an antisense compound also affects the ability of the antisense compound to bind to, and modulate, a targeted small non-coding RNA such as miRNA. The present invention provides antisense compounds with enhanced activity for use in the modulation of small non-coding RNA such as miRNA. Further provided are methods for enhancing the activity of an otherwise uniformly modified antisense compound by incorporating nucleotides comprising a second, distinct chemical modification. Such enhanced activity is particularly useful for modulation of small non-coding RNA such as miRNA in vivo. In a prefered embodiment, the small non-coding RNA to be modulated with the compounds of the instant invention are miRNA, but the compounds may be useful to modulate the activity of other small non-coding RNA as well. In one embodiment the antisense compounds comprise a plurality of substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleotides (e.g. 2â²-O-Methyl or 2â²-methoxyethoxy) and a plurality of bicyclic modified nucleotides (e.g. LNAâ¢ or ENAâ¢). In a further embodiment antisense compounds which are uniformly modified with substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleotides are enhanced by replacing a plurality of the substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleotides with nucleotides containing a bicyclic sugar moiety. In a further embodiment, at least 25% of the internucleoside linkages are modified to resist nuclease cleavage (e.g. phosphorothioate modified internucleoside linkages). In another embodiment, at least 50% of the internucleoside linkages are modified to resist nuclease cleavage.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The present invention provides antisense compounds which are capable of hybridizing with small non-coding RNA and modulating the activity of the small non-coding RNA. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the small non-coding RNA is a miRNA. In certain embodiments of the invention the antisense compounds are antisense oligonucleotides, which may comprise naturally occurring nucleosides or chemically modified nucleosides. In some embodiments, the antisense compounds comprise modified sugar moieties, modified internucleoside linkages, or modified nucleobase moieties. For convenience, the antisense compounds of the invention are herein described as being capable of modulating the activity of miRNA, but one of skill in the art, upon review of the instant disclosure, will understand that the compounds of the instant invention will also be useful for modulating other small non-coding RNA as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">These antisense compounds may be further modified to impart characteristics such as, without limitation, improved pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties, binding affinity, stability, charge, localization or uptake.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As used herein, the term âsmall non-coding RNAâ is used to encompass, without limitation, a polynucleotide molecule ranging from about 17 to about 450 nucleosides in length, which can be endogenously transcribed or produced exogenously (chemically or synthetically), but is not translated into a protein. Examples of small non-coding RNAs include, but are not limited to, primary miRNA transcripts (also known as pri-pre-miRNAs, pri-mirs, pri-miRs and pri-miRNAs, which range from around 70 nucleosides to about 450 nucleosides in length and often taking the form of a hairpin structure); pre-miRNAs (also known as pre-mirs, pre-miRs and foldback miRNA precursors, which range from around 50 nucleosides to around 110 nucleosides in length); miRNAs (also known as microRNAs, Mirs, miRs, mirs, and mature miRNAs, and generally refer either to double-stranded intermediate molecules, or to single-stranded miRNAs, which may comprise a bulged structure upon hybridization with a partially complementary target nucleic acid molecule), which range from about 19 to about 24 nucleosides in length; or mimics of pri-miRNAs, pre-miRNAs or miRNAs. For convenience, the antisense compounds of the invention are herein described as being capable of modulating the activity of miRNA, but one of skill in the art, upon review of the instant disclosure, will understand that the compounds of the instant invention will also be useful against other small non-coding RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As used herein, the term âmiRNA precursorâ is used to encompass any longer nucleic acid sequence from which a miRNA is derived and may include, without limitation, primary RNA transcripts, pri-miRNAs, and pre-miRNAs.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the context of the present invention, âmodulation of functionâ means an alteration in the function or activity of the small non-coding RNA or an alteration in the function of any cellular component (including nucleic acids and proteins) with which the small non-coding RNA has an association or downstream effect (such as a downstream target regulated by a small non-coding RNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As used herein, the terms âtarget nucleic acid,â âtarget RNA,â âtarget RNA transcriptâ or ânucleic acid targetâ are used to encompass any nucleic acid capable of being targeted including, without limitation, small non-coding RNA. In a one embodiment, the nucleic acids are non-coding sequences including, but not limited to, miRNAs and miRNA precursors. As used herein, âmiRNA nucleic acidâ or âmiRNA targetâ includes pri-miRNA, pre-miRNA, and miRNA (or mature miRNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In the context of the present invention, âmodulationâ and âmodulation of expressionâ mean either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the level, activity, or expression of a small non-coding RNA. Small non-coding RNAs whose levels can be modulated include miRNA and miRNA precursors. More preferably, the small non-coding RNA subject to modulation is a miRNA. Inhibition is a suitable form of modulation and small non-coding RNA is a suitable target nucleic acid Inhibition of miRNA may be detected by a change, typically an increase, in the mRNA or protein level of a miRNA target (e.g., a mRNA representing a protein-coding nucleic acid that is regulated by a miRNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The inhibition of small non-coding RNA level, activity or expression that results from sufficient hybridization of an antisense compound with a small non-coding RNA target nucleic acid is generally referred to as âantisense inhibitionâ of the small non-coding RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In one embodiment, the level, activity or expression of a miRNA nucleic acid is inhibited to a degree that results in a phenotypic change, such as lowered serum cholesterol or reduced hepatic steatosis. âmiRNA nucleic acid levelâ or âmiRNA levelâ indicates the abundance of a miRNA in a sample, such as animal cells or tissues. miRNA level may also indicated the relative abundance of a miRNA in an experimental sample (e.g., tissue from an animal treated with an antisense compound targeted to a miRNA) as compared to a control sample (e.g., tissue from an untreated animal).</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Antisense Compounds</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In the context of the present invention, the term âoligomeric compound(s)â refers to polymeric structures which are capable of hybridizing to at least a region of an RNA molecule, for example, a small non-coding RNA such as a miRNA. Generally, an oligomeric compound is âantisenseâ to a target nucleic acid when, written in the 5â² to 3â² direction, it comprises the reverse complement of the corresponding region of the target nucleic acid. Such oligomeric compounds are known as âantisense compoundsâ, which include, without limitation, oligonucleotides (i.e. antisense oligonucleotides), oligonucleosides, or oligonucleotide analogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In general, an antisense compound comprises a backbone of linked monomeric subunits where each linked monomeric subunit is directly or indirectly attached to a heterocyclic base moiety. The linkages joining the monomeric subunits, the sugar moieties or sugar surrogates, and the heterocyclic base moieties can be independently modified giving rise to a plurality of motifs for the resulting antisense compounds including hemimers, gapmers, alternating, uniformly modified, and positionally modified.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Modified antisense compounds are often preferred over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target, increased stability in the presence of nucleases and increased ability to modulate the function of a miRNA. As used herein, the term âmodificationâ includes substitution and/or any change from a starting or natural base, nucleoside or nucleotide. Modifications to antisense compounds encompass substitutions or changes to internucleoside linkages, sugar moieties, or base moieties, such as those described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Antisense compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined or otherwise prepared to be circular and may also include branching. Separate antisense compounds can hybridize to form double stranded compounds that can be blunt-ended or may include overhangs on one or both termini.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention are 15 to 30 nucleosides in length, i.e. 15 to 30 linked or contiguous nucleosides. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the invention embodies antisense compounds of 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleosides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention are 17 to 25 nucleosides in length, as exemplified herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention are 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 nucleosides in length, or alternatively the antisense compounds of the invention range from 19 to 24 nucleosides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention are 21, 22, or 23 nucleosides in length, or alternatively the antisense compounds of the invention range from 21 to 23 nucleosides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, the term âaboutâ means Â±5% of the variable thereafter.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Hybridization</heading>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">âComplementary,â as used herein, refers to the capacity for hybridization of two nucleobases. Conversely, a position is considered ânon-complementaryâ when nucleobases are not capable of hybridizing. An antisense compound and a target nucleic acid are âfully complementaryâ to each other when each nucleobase of the antisense compound is complementary to an equal number of nucleobases at corresponding positions in the target nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The antisense compound and the target nucleic acid are âessentially fully complementaryâ to each other when the degree of precise permits stable and specific binding between the antisense compound and a target nucleic acid, so that the antisense compound inhibits the level, activity or expression of a target nucleic acid. Antisense compounds having one or two non-complementary nucleobases with respect to a miRNA may be considered essentially fully complementary. The term âsufficiently complementaryâ may be used in place of âessentially fully complementary.â.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the context of this invention, âhybridizationâ means the pairing of nucleobases of a first nucleic acid molecule with corresponding nucleobases of a second nucleic acid molecule. For example, an antisense compound hybridizes to a target nucleic acid (e.g. a miRNA nucleic acid target) when the nucleobases of the antisense compound pair with corresponding nucleobases of the target nucleic acid. In the context of the present invention, the mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between corresponding nucleobases. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases that pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">It is understood in the art that the nucleobase sequence of the antisense compound need not be fully complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. Moreover, an antisense compound may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization (e.g., a bulge, a loop structure or a hairpin structure). In some embodiments there are ânon-complementaryâ positions, also known as âmismatchesâ, between the antisense compound and the target nucleic acid, and such non-complementary positions may be tolerated between an antisense compound and the target nucleic acid provided that the antisense compound remains specifically hybridizable to the target nucleic acid. A ânon-complementary nucleobaseâ means a nucleobase that is unable to undergo precise base pairing with a nucleobase at a corresponding position in a target nucleic acid. As used herein, the terms ânon-complementaryâ and âmismatchâ are interchangable. Up to 3 non-complementary nucleobases are often tolerated in an antisense compound without causing a significant decrease in the ability of the antisense compound to modulate the activity, level or function of a miRNA In a preferred embodiment, the antisense compound contains 0, 1 or 2 non-complementary nucleobases with respect to a miRNA target nucleic acid. Non-complementary nucleobases may be contiguous (i.e. linked) or non-contiguous. In a more preferred embodiment, the antisense compound contains at most 1 non-complementary nucleobase with respect to a miRNA target nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely by those having ordinary skill in the art, and may be accomplished using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">âTargetingâ an antisense compound to a particular small non-coding nucleic acid molecule, including a miRNA nucleic acid, in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a miRNA target nucleic acid whose levels, expression or function is to be modulated.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one target segment within a miRNA target nucleic acid for the interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of levels, expression or function of the miRNA, will result. As used herein, a âtarget segmentâ means a sequence of a miRNA nucleic acid to which one or more antisense compounds are complementary. Within the context of the present invention, the term âtarget siteâ is defined as a sequence of a miRNA nucleic acid target to which an antisense compound is complementary. In some embodiments, when a single antisense compound is complementary to a target segment, a target segment and target site will be represented by the same nucleobase sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Target sites and target segments may also be found in an miRNA gene from which a pri-miRNA is derived, which may be found as a solitary transcript, or it may be found within a 5â² untranslated region (5â²UTR), within in an intron, or within a 3â² untranslated region (3â²UTR) of a gene.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Antisense Compound Modifications</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As is known in the art, a nucleoside is a base-sugar combination. The base (or nucleobase) portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are purines and pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to the 2â², 3â² or 5â² hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. Within the unmodified oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the internucleoside linkages of the oligonucleotide. The unmodified internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3â² to 5â² phosphodiester linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the context of this invention, the term âoligonucleotideâ refers generally to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and may be used to refer to unmodified oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide analogs. The term âunmodified oligonucleotideâ refers generally to oligonucleotides composed of naturally occuring nucleobases, sugars, and covalent internucleoside linkages. The term âoligonucleotide analogâ refers to oligonucleotides that have one or more non-naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars, and/or internucleoside linkages. Such non-naturally occurring oligonucleotides are often selected over naturally occurring forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for other oligonucleotides or nucleic acid targets, increased stability in the presence of nucleases, or increased inhibitory activity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Modified Internucleoside Linkages</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Specific examples of antisense compounds useful in this invention include oligonucleotides containing modified, i.e. non-naturally occurring, internucleoside linkages. Such non-naturally internucleoside linkages are often selected over naturally occurring forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for other oligonucleotides or nucleic acid targets and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. Antisense compounds of the invention can have one or more modified internucleoside linkages.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">One suitable phosphorus-containing modified internucleoside linkage is the phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. In a prefered embodiment, the antisense compounds of the present invention include at least one phosphorothioate linkage or a plurality of phosphorothioate linkages. In some embodiments at least 50% of the internucleotide linkages in the antisense compound are phosphorothioate linkages. A number of other modified oligonucleotide backbones (internucleoside linkages) are known in the art and may be useful in the context of this invention. One having ordinary skill in the art can readily prepare phosphorus-containing internucleoside linkages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Modified Sugar Moieties</heading>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Antisense compounds of the invention may also contain one or more modified or substituted sugar moieties. The base moieties (natural, modified or a combination thereof) are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target. Sugar modifications may impart nuclease stability, binding affinity or some other beneficial biological property to the antisense compounds. Representative modified sugars include sugars having substituent groups at one or more of their 2â² positions and sugars having a linkage between any two other atoms in the sugar. Of the large number of sugar modifications known in the art, sugars modified at the 2â² position and those which have a bridge between any 2 atoms of the sugar (such that the sugar is bicyclic) are particularly useful in this invention. Examples of sugar modifications useful in this invention include, but are not limited to compounds comprising a sugar substituent group selected from: O-, S-, or N-alkyl; or O-alkyl-O-alkyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl may be substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkyl or C<sub>2 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alkenyl and alkynyl. Particularly suitable are: 2â²-methoxyethoxy (also known as 2â²-O-methoxyethyl, 2â²-MOE (2â²-OCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>), 2â²-O-methyl (2â²-OâCH<sub>3</sub>), LNAâ¢ (a bicyclic sugar moiety having a 4â²-CH<sub>2</sub>âO-2â² bridge) and ENAâ¢ (4â²-(âCH<sub>2</sub>â)<sub>2</sub>âO-2â²).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">One modification that imparts increased nuclease resitance and a very high binding affinity to nucleosides is the 2â²-MOE side chain (Baker et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 11944-12000). One of the immediate advantages of the 2â²-MOE substitution is the improvement in binding affinity and nuclease resistance compared with similar 2â² modifications such as O-methyl, O-propyl, and O-aminopropyl. Antisense compounds having 2â²-MOE substituted sugars have been shown to be effective antisense inhibitors of gene expression for in vivo use (Martin, P., Helv. Chim. Acta, 1995, 78, 486-504; Altmann et al., Chimia, 1996, 50, 168-176; Altmann et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1996, 24, 630-637; and Altmann et al., Nucleosides Nucleotides, 1997, 16, 917-926). Relative to DNA, the oligonucleotides having the 2â²-MOE modification displayed improved RNA affinity and higher nuclease resistance. Antisense compounds having one or more 2â²-MOE modifications are capable of inhibiting miRNA activity in vitro and in vivo (Esau et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2004, 279, 52361-52365; U.S. Application Publication No. 2005/0261218).</p>

The bridge can be in the beta-D or alpha-L conformation. Bicyclic modifications imparts to an antisense compound greatly increased affinity for a nucleic acid target. Furthermore, nucleosides having bicyclic sugar modifications can act cooperatively with DNA and RNA in chimeric antisense compounds to enhance the affinity of a chimeric antisense compound for a nucleic acid target. Bicyclic sugar moieties can be represented by the formula 4â²-(CH<sub>2</sub>)n-X-2â², where X can be, for example, O or S. What is known in the art as LNAâ¢ is a bicyclic sugar moiety having a 4â²-CH<sub>2</sub>âO-2â² bridge (i.e. X is O and n is 1). The alpha-L nucleoside has also been reported wherein the linkage is above the ring and the heterocyclic base is in the alpha rather than the beta-conformation (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: Application 2003/0087230). The xylo analog has also been prepared (see U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: 2003/0082807). Another bicyclic sugar moiety is ENAâ¢, which refers to a sugar moiety having a 4â²-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>âO-2â² bridge (i.e. X is O and n is 2). In general, LNAâ¢ refers to the above compound when n=1, and ENAâ¢ refers to the above compound when n=2 (Kaneko et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: US 2002/0147332, Singh et al., Chem.

However the term âlocked nucleic acidâ can also be used in a more general sense to describe any bicyclic sugar moiety that has a âlockedâ conformation. Antisense compounds incorporating LNAâ¢ and ENAâ¢ analogs display very high duplex thermal stabilities with complementary DNA and RNA (Tm=+3 to +10 C), stability towards 3â²-exonucleolytic degradation and good solubility properties.</p>

As a consequence of the introduction of such regions, the regions having the original sugar moiety are from 1 to about 8 nucleosides in length. In other words, regions having a particular sugar moiety are separated by regions having different sugar moieties. Regions comprised of sugar-modified nucleosides may have the same sugar modification; alternatively, the modified regions may vary such that one region has a different sugar modification than another region. Positionally modified motifs are not determined by the nucleobase sequence or the location or types of internucleoside linkages.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The present invention includes antisense compounds having a positionally modified motif characterized by regions of substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified sugar moieties which are separated by regions of bicyclic modified sugar moieties. Preferred substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified sugar moieties include 2â²-O-methyl and 2â²-MOE. Preferred bicyclic sugar moieties include LNAâ¢ and ENAâ¢. The regions of substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified sugar moieties may be 2 to 7 nucleosides in length, and the regions of bicyclic modified sugar moieties may be 1 or 2 nucleosides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In one embodiment, antisense compounds of the invention are characterized by regions of two substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleosides separated by regions of one bicyclic modified nucleoside, such that, beginning at the 5â²-terminus, the antisense compounds have a substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleoside at every first and second position, and a bicyclic modified nucleoside at every third position. Such a motif is described by the formula 5â²-(A-A-B)n(-A)nn-3â², wherein A is a first sugar moiety, B is a second sugar moiety, n is 6 to 7 and nn is 0 to 2. In some embodiments, A is 2â²-MOE and B is LNAâ¢. In further embodiments, A is 2â²-O-methyl and B is LNAâ¢. In other embodiments, A is 2â²-MOE and B is ENAâ¢. In additional embodiments, A is 2â²-O-methyl and B is ENAâ¢. In some embodiments, when such a motif would yield a bicyclic nucleoside at the 3â²-terminus of the antisense compound (e.g., in an antisense compound 21 nucleosides in length), a substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl nucleoside is incorporated in place of a bicyclic modified nucleoside. For example, if n is 7, and nn is zero, a substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified nucleoside, such as 2â²-MOE or 2â²-O-methyl would be utilized at the 3â²-terminal position in place of a bicyclic modified nucleoside, such as LNAâ¢ or ENAâ¢.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Positionally modified motifs having less regular patterns are also included in the present invention. For example, the majority of the substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified regions may be 2 nucleosides in length, and a minority of substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified regions may be 1 nucleoside in length. Likewise, the majority of the bicyclic modified regions may be 1 nucleoside in length, and a minority of the bicyclic modified regions may be 2 nucleosides in length. One non-limiting example of such an antisense compound includes a positionally modified motif as described in the preceding paragraph, having two substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified regions 2 nucleosides in length, all remaining substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl modified regions two nucleosides in length, 2 bicyclic modified region 2 nucleosides in length, and all remaining bicyclic modified regions 1 nucleoside in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As used in the present invention the term âalternating motifâ is meant to include a contiguous sequence of alternating nucleosides, each nucleoside having a different sugar moiety (though each alternating nucleoside may have the same sugar moiety), for essentially the entire length of the antisense compound. The pattern of alternation can be described by the formula: 5â²-A(B-A)n(-B)nn-3â² where A and B are nucleosides differentiated by having at least different sugar moieties, nn is 0 or 1 and n is from about 7 to about 11. This permits antisense compounds from 17 to 24 nucleosides in length. This length range is not meant to be limiting as longer and shorter antisense compounds are also amenable to the present invention. This formula also allows for even and odd lengths for alternating antisense compounds wherein the 5â²- and 3â²-terminal nucleosides comprise the same (odd) or different (even) sugar moieties.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Each of the A and B nucleosides has a sugar moiety selected from substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides, bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides, Î²-D-ribonucleosides or Î²-D-deoxyribonucleosides (such 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides may include 2â²-MOE, and 2â²-OâCH<sub>3</sub>, among others and such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides may include LNAâ¢ or ENAâ¢, among others). In some embodiments, A is 2â²-MOE and B is LNAâ¢. In further embodiments, A is 2â²-O-methyl and B is LNAâ¢. In other embodiments, A is 2â²-MOE and B is ENAâ¢. In additional embodiments, A is 2â²-O-methyl and B is ENAâ¢. The alternating motif is independent from the nucleobase sequence and the internucleoside linkages. The internucleoside linkage can vary at each position or at particular selected positions or can be uniform or alternating throughout the antisense compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">As used in the present invention the term âgapped motifâ or âgapmerâ is meant to include an antisense compound having an internal region (also referred to as a âgapâ or âgap segmentâ) positioned between two external regions (also referred to as âwingâ or âwing segmentâ). The regions are differentiated by the types of sugar moieties comprising each distinct region. The types of sugar moieties that are used to differentiate the regions of a gapmer include substitued or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides, bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides, Î²-D-ribonucleosides or Î²-D-deoxyribonucleosides (such 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides may include 2â²-MOE, and 2â²-OâCH<sub>3</sub>, among others and such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides may include LNAâ¢ or ENAâ¢, among others). In general, each distinct region in a gapmer has uniformly modified sugar moieties.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Gapped motifs or gapmers are further defined as being either âsymmetricâ or âasymmetricâ. A gapmer wherein the nucleosides of the first wing have the same sugar modifications as the nucleosides of the second wing is termed a symmetric gapped antisense compound. Symmetric gapmers can have, for example, an internal region comprising a first type of sugar moiety, and external regions each comprising a second type of sugar moiety, wherein at least one sugar moiety is a modified sugar moiety.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Gapmers as used in the present invention include wings that independently have from 1 to 7 nucleosides. The present invention therefore includes gapmers wherein each wing independently comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 nucleosides. The number of nucleosides in each wing can be the same or different. In one embodiment, the internal or gap region comprises from 17 to 21 nucleosides, which is understood to include 17, 18, 19, 20, or 21 nucleosides.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As used in the present invention the term âhemimer motifâ is meant to include a sequence of nucleosides that have uniform sugar moieties (identical sugars, modified or unmodified) and wherein one of the 5â²-end or the 3â²-end has a sequence of from 2 to 12 nucleosides that are sugar modified nucleosides that are different from the other nucleosides in the hemimer modified antisense compound. An example of a typical hemimer is an antisense compound comprising a sequence of substitued or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides, bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides, Î²-D-ribonucleosides or Î²-D-deoxyribonucleosides (such 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides may include 2â²-MOE, and 2â²-OâCH<sub>3</sub>, among others and such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides may include LNAâ¢ or ENAâ¢, among others) at one terminus and a sequence of nucleosides with a different sugar moiety (such as a substitued or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides, bicyclic sugar modified nucleoside) at the other terminus. One hemimer motif includes a sequence of substitued or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides at one terminus, followed or preceded by a sequence of 2 to 12 of bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides. In one embodiment, the bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides comprise less than 13 contiguous nucleosides within the antisense compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">As used in the present invention the term âblockmer motifâ is meant to include a sequence of nucleosides that have uniform sugars (identical sugars, modified or unmodified) that is internally interrupted by a block of sugar modified nucleosides that are uniformly modified and wherein the modification is different from the other nucleosides. More generally, antisense compounds having a blockmer motif comprise a sequence of substitued or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl sugar modified nucleosides having one internal block of from 2 to 6, or from 2 to 4, bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides. The internal block region can be at any position within the antisense compound as long as it is not at one of the termini, which would then make it a hemimer</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Antisense compounds having motifs selected from uniform, positionally modified, alternating, gapped, hemimer or blockmer may further comprise internucleoside linkage modifications or nucleobase modifications, such as those described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">âChimeric antisense compoundsâ or âchimeras,â in the context of this invention, are antisense compounds that at least 2 chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide or nucleoside in the case of a nucleic acid based antisense compound. Accordingly, antisense compounds having a motif selected from positionally modified, gapmer, alternating, hemimer, or blockmer are considered chimeric antisense compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Chimeric antisense compounds typically contain at least one region modified so as to confer increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid, and/or increased inhibitory activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">In one aspect, the present invention is directed to antisense compounds that are designed to have enhanced properties compared to uniformly modified antisense compounds. One method to design optimized or enhanced antisense compounds involves each nucleoside of the selected sequence being scrutinized for possible enhancing modifications. One modification would be the replacement of one or more substituted or unsubstituted 2â²-O-alkyl nucleosides with bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides. Such replacement can enhance the activity of the antisense compound relative to the uniformly modified antisense compound. The sequence can be further divided into regions and the nucleosides of each region evaluated for enhancing modifications that can be the result of a chimeric configuration. Consideration is also given to the 5â² and 3â²-termini as there are often advantageous modifications that can be made to one or more of the terminal nucleosides. The antisense compounds of the present invention may include at least one 5â²-modified phosphate group on a single strand or on at least one 5â²-position of a double-stranded sequence or sequences. Other modifications considered are internucleoside linkages, conjugate groups, substitute sugars or bases, substitution of one or more nucleosides with nucleoside mimetics and any other modification that can enhance the desired property of the antisense compound.</p>

      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0139">A miR-21 luciferase sensor construct was engineered using pGL3-MCS2 (Promega). Day1: Hela cells (ATCC) were seeded in T-170 flasks (BD Falcon) at 3.5*10<sup>6 </sup>cells/flask. Hela cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with High Glucose (Invitrogen). Day 2: Each flask of Hela cells was transfected with Mug luciferase sensor construct engineered to contain the full 22 nucleobase sequence complementary to the mature miR-21 sequence. Each flask was also transfected with 0.5 ug of a phRL sensor plasmid (Promega) expressing Renilla to be used in normalization. Hela cells were transfected using 20 ul Lipofectamine 2000/flask (Invitrogen). After 4 hours of transfection, cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Hela cells were plated at 40 k/well in 24 well plates (BD Falcon) and left overnight. Day 3: Hela cells were transfected with antisense compounds (also referred to as âASOâ for antisense oligonucleotides) using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) at 2.5 ul Lipofectin/100 nM ASO/ml Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen) for 4 hours. After ASO transfection, Hela cells were refed with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium with High Glucose (Invitrogen). Day 4: Hela cells are passively lysed and luciferase activity measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0140">Effects of 2â²-Sugar Substitutions on Antisense Compound Activity</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0141">In a one assay, the effect of sugar modifications on activity of an antisense compound targeted to a miRNA was determined Hela cells were treated with anti-miR-21 antisense compounds with uniform 2â²-MOE or 2â²-O-methyl sugar modifications. Also tested was a positionally modified antisense compound, having 2â²-MOE sugar modifications separated by a single LNAâ¢ modification at every third position [i.e. (A-A-B)n(A-A)nn, where A is 2â²-MOE, B is LNAâ¢, n is 7 and nn is 1]. Each of these compounds had phosphorothioate linkages throughout the compound. Among these antisense compounds with phosphorothioate (PS) backbones, the 2â²-MOE uniformly modified and the 2â²-O-methyl uniformly modified antisense compounds exhibited approximately equal antisense inhibition of miR-21. The introduction of LNAâ¢ sugar modifications into a 2â²-MOE uniformly modified background enhanced the ability of the antisense compound to inhibit miR-21 activity. Thus, it was demonstrated that the introduction of a bicyclic sugar moiety into an otherwise uniformly modified background enhanced the ability of an antisense compound to inhibit a miRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0142">Effect of Phosphodiester Backbone on Anti-miRNA Activity</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0143">Also evaluated in the luciferase sensor assay were uniform 2â²-MOE and uniform 2â²-O-methyl antisense compounds having unmodified, phosphodiester (PO) internucleoside linkages. The 2â²-MOE uniformly modified, PO compound exhibited greater anti-miR-21 activity compared to the PS version of the same compound. However, changing the backbone of the 2â²-O-methyl uniformly modified antisense compound to PO yielded no increase in anti-miR-21 activity.</p>

      <heading id="h-00035-en" level="1">Antisense Inhibition miRNA Activity In Vivo Using Enhanced Antisense Compounds</heading>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0144">The antisense compounds of the invention modulate the activity or function of the small non-coding RNAs to which they are targeted. In this example, antisense compounds targeted to miR-122a are illustrated; however, the modifications in the antisense compounds of the invention are not limited to those antisense compounds that modulate miR-122a.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0145">Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were treated with antisense compounds targeting miR-122a, or received saline as a control treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0146">One of the antisense compounds tested included a 2â²-MOE uniformly modified antisense compound fully complementary to miR-122a. Also tested in vivo was a positionally modified antisense compound fully complementary to miR-122a having the motif (A-A-B)7(-A-A)1 where A is 2â²-MOE and B is LNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0147">Mice were administered 25 mg/kg doses of antisense compound intraperitoneally, for a total of 6 doses. Following the end of the treatment period, RNA was isolated from liver and the levels of a miR-122a target mRNA, ALDOA, were measured using Taqman real-time PCR. Relative to saline-treated animals, treatment with the 2â²-MOE uniformly modified compound resulted in ALDO A mRNA levels approximately 4 times those in saline-treated animals. Treatment with the positionally modified compound resulted in ALDO A mRNA levels approximately 5 times those observed in saline-treated animals. Thus, incorporation of a bicyclic sugar moiety into an otherwise uniformly modified background enhanced the ability of an antisense compound to inhibit miR-122a activity in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0148">Plasma levels of total cholesterol were also monitored using methods known in the art (for example, via Olympus AU400e automated clinical chemistry analyzer, Melville, N.Y.). Reductions in total cholesterol were observed in mice treated with either the 2â²-MOE uniformly modified antisense compound or the positionally modified antisense compound having a plurality of 2â²-MOE modified nucleosides and a plurality of LNAâ¢ modified nucleosides.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0149">Additional analyses that are performed in such in vivo studies included histological analysis of liver sections, to evaluate changes in morphology. Histological analysis of liver is carried out via routine procedures known in the art. Briefly, liver is fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. 4-mm sections are cut and mounted on glass slides. After dehydration, the sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Morphological analysis may also include evaluation of hepatic steatosis, using oil Red O staining procedures known in the art.</p>
