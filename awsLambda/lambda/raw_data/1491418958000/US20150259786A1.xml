    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Electronic devices, such as optoelectronic devices, can be fabricated using organic materials, particularly using thin-film processing techniques. Such organic optoelectronic devices can be volumetrically compact because of their relatively thin and planar structure, along with providing enhanced power efficiency and enhanced visual performance, such as compared to other display technologies. In certain examples, such devices can be mechanically flexible (e.g., foldable or bendable), or optically transparent, unlike competing technologies. Applications for an organic optoelectronic device can include general illumination, use as a backlight illumination source, or use as a pixel light source or other element in an electroluminescent display, for example. One class of organic optoelectronic devices includes organic light emitting diode (OLED) devices, which can generate light using electroluminescent emissive organic materials such as small molecules, polymers, fluorescent, or phosphorescent materials, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In one approach, OLED devices can be fabricated in part via vacuum deposition of a series of organic thin films onto a substrate using the technique of thermal evaporation. However, vacuum processing in this manner is relatively: (1) complex, generally involving a large vacuum chamber and pumping subsystem to maintain such vacuum; (2) wasteful of the organic raw material, as a large fraction of the material in such a system is generally deposited onto the walls and fixtures of the interior, such that more material is generally wasted than deposited onto the substrate; and (3) difficult to maintain, such as involving frequently stopping the operation of the vacuum deposition tool to open and clean the walls and fixtures of built-up waste material. Furthermore, in OLED applications it can be desirable to deposit the organic films in a pattern.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In another approach, a blanket coating can be deposited over the substrate and photolithography can be considered for achieving desired patterning. But, in various applications and for OLED materials in particular, such photolithography processes can damage the deposited organic film or the underlying organic films. A so-called shadowmask can be used to pattern the deposited layer directly when using a vacuum deposition technique. The shadowmask in such cases comprises a physical stencil, often manufactured as a metal sheet with cut-outs for the deposition regions. The shadowmask is generally placed in proximity to or in contact with, and aligned to, the substrate prior to deposition, kept in place during deposition, and then removed after deposition. Such direct-patterning via shadowmask adds substantial complexity to vacuum-based deposition techniques, generally involving additional mechanisms and fixturing to handle and position the mask precisely relative to the substrate, further increasing the material waste (due to the waste from material deposited onto the shadowmask), and further increasing the need for maintenance to continuously clean and replace the shadowmasks themselves. Shadowmask techniques also generally involve relatively thin masks to achieve the pixel scale patterning required for display applications, and such thin masks are mechanically unstable over large areas, limiting the maximum size of substrate that can be processed. Improving scalability remains a major challenge for OLED manufacturing, so such limitations on scalability can be significant.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The organic materials used in OLED devices are also generally highly sensitive to exposure to various ambient materials, such as oxygen, ozone, or water. For example, organic materials used in various internal layers of an OLED device, such as including an electron injection or transport layer, a hole injection or transport layer, a blocking layer, or an emission layer, for example, can be subject to a variety of degradation mechanisms. Such degradation can be driven at least in part by incorporation of chemically or electrically/optically active contaminants into the device structure, either within the bulk material of each film or at the interfaces between layers in the overall device stack. Over time chemically active contaminants can trigger a chemical reaction in the film that degrades the film material. Such chemical reactions can occur simply as a function of time, absent any other triggers, or can be triggered by ambient optical energy or injected electrical energy, for example. Electrically or optically active contaminants can create parasitic electrical or optical pathways for the electrical or optical energy introduced or generated in the device during operation. Such pathways can result in suppression of light output, or generation of incorrect light output (e.g., light output of the wrong spectrum.) The degradation or loss may manifest as failure of an individual OLED display elements, âblackâ spotting in portions of an array of OLED elements, visible artifacts or loss of electrical or optical efficiency, or unwanted deviation in color rendering accuracy, contrast, or brightness in various affected regions of the array of OLED elements.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">Overview</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">One or more layers of an OLED device can be fabricated (e.g., deposited or patterned) using a printing technique. For example, an organic material, such as for example a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an emissive material, an electron transport material, a hole blocking material, or an electron injection material can be dissolved or otherwise suspended in a carrier fluid (e.g., a solvent), and a layer of an OLED device including the organic material can be formed by ink-jet printing and subsequent evaporation of the carrier fluid to provide a patterned layer. For example, an organic material, such as an organic thin film encapsulation material, can be inkjet printed in a pattern onto a substrate as a liquid mixture of organic compounds, the patterned organic layer coating at least a portion of a light-emitting device fabricated upon the substrate and subsequently solidified by a curing process, such by UV illumination so as to induce a cross linking reaction, thereby forming a patterned solid layer. In another approach, a solid-phase organic material can be vaporized thermally for deposition onto a substrate through a jet. In yet another approach, organic material can be dissolved or otherwise suspended in a carrier liquid, and a layer of OLED device including the organic material can be formed by dispensing a continuous stream on fluid from a nozzle onto a substrate to form a line (so-called ânozzle printingâ or ânozzle jetâ) and subsequent evaporation of the carrier to provide a line patterned layer. Such approaches can generally be referred to as organic âprintingâ techniques, such as can be performed using a printing system.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that printing techniques and other processing operations can be carried out using systems having enclosures configured to provide a controlled environment, such as including an atmosphere comprising a gas that is minimally reactive or non-reactive with one or more species deposited upon or comprising a substrate being processed, such gas having a specified purity level. Such a purity level can also include controlled maximum impurity concentrations of other species, such as oxygen or water, such as to prevent degradation of OLED devices during fabrication or to inhibit or suppress defects. Particulate controls can also be provided, such as to maintain a specified particulate level within the controlled environment. The arrangement of enclosures can include respective modules having individually-maintained controlled environments, or one or more of the modules can share a controlled environment with other modules. Facilities such as gas purification, temperature control, solvent abatement, or particulate control can be shared between modules or can be provided in a dedicated manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">OLED devices being fabricated, such as substrates including many OLED devices, can be transferred to other fabrication equipment such as using one or more of a loading module (e.g., a âload-lockâ), a transfer module including a handler, or using techniques such as an inert or otherwise non-reactive gas curtain and gate arrangement. In this manner, transfer of a respective substrate being fabricated can occur without substantially altering an environment of the enclosed modules or without requiring purging of the enclosed modules. For example, the environment of the enclosed modules can be controlled, such as to provide an environment having less than 100 parts-per-million of oxygen and less than 100 parts-per-million of water vapor. The present inventors have also recognized that use of a load-locked arrangement can allow for controlled-atmosphere-containing line elements to be integrated with other fabrication processes such as open-air or vacuum processes, without substantially altering the controlled (e.g., non-reactive and particulate controlled) environment within a respective module, or without requiring time-consuming purging of the non-reactive gas volumes in each enclosed module.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present inventors have also recognized, among other things, that a problem can exist where active regions of a substrate are not supported continuously and uniformly can exhibit non-uniformities or visible defects during or after processing. For example, the substrate can be supported by a mechanical chuck that employs vacuum or mechanical clamping to hold the substrate in place during processing. In one approach when processing substrates, lift pins can be used in center regions of the substrate so as to raise or lower the substrate with respect to the chuck so as to facilitate loading and unloading. In the case of vacuum chucks, vacuum holes or grooves in the center regions of the substrates are generally used to hold the substrate down in place. In such an approach, holes or grooves are therefore present in the center region of the chuck when such generally-available support techniques are used and such holes or grooves can represent regions of non-uniform support. Without being bound by theory, such defects are believed to be associated with, for example, a non-uniform thermal profile or non-uniform electrostatic field profile across the surface of the substrate or on a surface opposite a coating or film layer being deposited or treated. The present inventors have recognized that various specialized uniform support techniques can be used to achieve uniform, defect free coatings such as including avoiding non-uniform support in areas of the substrate upon or opposite such active regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">For example, the present inventors have recognized, among other things, that the substrate can be uniformly supported at least in part using a gas cushion, such as during one or more of a printing operation or other processing such as before or during ultraviolet treatment in a curing module. Use of such a gas cushion can enhance uniformity of a coating or film layer on the substrate, such as by reducing or minimizing mura or other visible defects. In this manner, for example, an organic thin film encapsulation layer can be printed and treated, such as using support techniques including a gas cushion upon or opposite active regions of the substrate where light emitting devices are located. In addition, or instead, the substrate can be uniformly supported by one or more of uniform physical contact within the active regions or by non-uniform physical contact outside of the active regionâfor example, a vacuum chuck can be configured such that all of the vacuum grooves and holes and lift pin holes are confined to be outside of the active regions. Alternatively, the substrate can be uniformly supported by uniform physical contact within those active regions for which the coating uniformity must be maintained at a high level and supported by non-uniform physical contact outside of the active region or within those active regions for which the coating uniformity need not be maintained at a high level (e.g. for use as test devices or in lower graded products). Alternatively (or additionally), the use of vacuum grooves and holes can be avoided by retaining the substrate using a distributed vacuum region thereby avoiding or reducing discontinuities in the thermal and electrical characteristics of the structure supporting the substrate in one or more active regions, at least with respect to the vacuum retention mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In an example, a coating system for providing a coating on a substrate can include an enclosed printing system configured to deposit a patterned organic layer on a substrate, the patterned organic layer coating at least a portion of a light-emitting device fabricated upon the substrate, an enclosed curing module including an ultraviolet treatment region configured to accommodate a substrate and configured to provide an ultraviolet treatment to the patterned organic layer, and an enclosed substrate transfer module configured to receive the substrate from an atmospheric environment different from an environment of one or more of the enclosed printing system or the enclosed curing module. The patterned organic layer can occupy a deposition region of the substrate on a first side of the substrate; and the enclosed curing module can be configured to uniformly support the substrate in the ultraviolet treatment region using a gas cushion, the gas cushion provided to a second side of the substrate opposite the first side, the gas cushion established between the substrate and a chuck.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In an example, a technique, such as a method, can include transferring a substrate from an inorganic thin film encapsulation system to a transfer module of an organic thin film encapsulation system, transferring the substrate to an enclosed printing system, the enclosed printing system configured to deposit a patterned organic layer in a deposition region on a first side of the substrate, the patterned organic layer coating at least a portion of a light-emitting device fabricated upon the substrate, uniformly supporting the substrate in the enclosed printing system using a first gas cushion provided to a second side of the substrate opposite the deposition region, printing monomer over the deposition region of the substrate using the enclosed printing system, transferring the substrate from the enclosed printing system to the transfer module, transferring the substrate from the transfer module to an enclosed curing module, uniformly supporting the substrate in the enclosed curing module using a second gas cushion provided to the second side of the substrate opposite the first side, and treating the monomer film layer in the enclosed curing module to provide a mura-free polymerized organic layer in the deposition region.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In an example, a technique, such as a method, can include transferring a substrate from an inorganic thin film encapsulation system to a transfer module of an organic thin film encapsulation system, transferring the substrate to an enclosed printing system, the enclosed printing system configured to deposit a patterned organic layer in a deposition region on a first side of the substrate, the patterned organic layer coating at least a portion of a light-emitting device fabricated upon the substrate, uniformly supporting the substrate in the enclosed printing system using a first uniform support provided to a second side of the substrate opposite the deposition region, printing monomer over the deposition region of the substrate using the enclosed printing system, transferring the substrate from the enclosed printing system to the transfer module, transferring the substrate from the transfer module to an enclosed curing module, uniformly supporting the substrate in the enclosed curing module using a second uniform support provided to the second side of the substrate opposite the first side, and treating the monomer film layer in the enclosed curing module to provide a mura-free polymerized organic layer in the deposition region. One or more of the first or second uniform support regions can include a distributed vacuum region in physical contact with the substrate or a gas cushion.</p>

The first and second processing environments can include controlled environments at or near atmospheric pressure and established to remain below specified limits of limits of particulate contamination level, water vapor content, and oxygen content.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The systems and techniques described herein can be used in support of manufacturing a range of different electronic device configurations, such as including one or more optoelectronic devices. For example, a flat panel display device can be fabricated at least in part using systems or techniques described herein. Such a flat panel display device can include an organic light emitting diode (OLED) flat panel display. Several OLED flat panel displays can be processed on a substrate (or âmotherâ glass). Use of the word âsubstrateâ or the phrase âsubstrate being fabricatedâ refers generally to an assembly in-process that can include an OLED device. The examples herein need not be restricted to a particular panel geometry or size. For example, such systems and techniques can be used in support of fabrication of display devices on substrates having a generation 2 (âGen 2â) size, such as having a rectangular geometry including dimensions of about 37 centimeters (cm) by about 47 cm. The systems described herein can also be used for somewhat larger substrate geometries, such as in support of fabrication of display devices on substrates having a generation 3.5 (âGen 3.5â) substrate size, such as having a rectangular geometry including dimensions of about 61 centimeters (cm) by about 72 cm. The systems described herein can also be used for even larger substrate geometries, such as in support of fabrication of display devices on substrates having a substrate size corresponding to âGen 5.5,â having dimensions of about 130 cmÃ150 cm, or a âGen 7â or âGen 7.5â substrate, having dimensions of about 195 cmÃ225 cm. For example, a Gen 7 or Gen 7.5 substrate can be singulated (e.g., cut or otherwise separated) into eight 42 inch (diagonal dimension) or six 47 inch (diagonal dimension) flat panel displays. A âGen 8â substrate can include dimensions of about 216Ã246 cm. A âGen 8.5â substrate can include dimensions of about 220 cmÃ250 cm, and can be singulated to provide six 55 inch or eight 46 inch flat panels per substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Dimensions beyond Gen 8.5 can be supported using systems and techniques described herein. For example, a âGen 10â substrate having dimensions of about 285 cmÃ305 cm, or beyond, can be fabricated at least in part using systems and techniques described herein. The panel sizes described herein, while generally applicable to glass substrates, can applied to substrates of any material suitable for use in display device fabrication, and in particular OLED display fabrication that can include forming one or more layers using printing techniques. For example, a variety of glass substrate materials can be used, as well as a variety of polymeric substrate materials, for example, polyimide.</p>

For example, the system <b>1000</b>A can be used to form an organic thin film encapsulation layer (OTFEL) upon a substrate containing one or more electronic devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Similar to other examples described herein, the system <b>1000</b>A can include a printing system <b>2000</b> (e.g., to âprintâ or otherwise deposit a film encapsulation layer onto a substrate). The system <b>1000</b>A can include a transfer module <b>1400</b>. One or more processing modules such as a processing module <b>1300</b> can be coupled to the transfer module <b>1400</b>. As in other examples described herein, each of the printing system <b>2000</b>, the transfer module <b>1400</b>, and processing module <b>1300</b> can be enclosed, such as to provide a controlled environment at about atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure (e.g., a nitrogen environment having a specified maximum level of one or more impurity species). Substrates can be transferred to or from the system <b>1000</b>A such as using a loading module <b>1100</b>. In this manner, respective controlled environments in one or more other portions of the system <b>1000</b>A can be maintained without contamination or without requiring purging of an entirety of such controlled environments during transfer of a substrate into or out of the system <b>1000</b>A. The processing module <b>1300</b> can be configured to perform one or a variety of processing operations, such as one or more of a holding operation, a curing operation (e.g., using heat or exposure to ultraviolet radiation to treat a substrate, for example), a buffering operation, or one or more other operations.</p>

The system <b>1000</b>A of <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> can operate in aggregate in a cluster or in-line mode. For example, in a cluster mode, substrates can be loaded and unloaded from loading module <b>1100</b>. For example, in an in-line mode, substrates can be loaded into the left side of printing system <b>2000</b> and unloaded from loading module <b>1100</b>.</p>

The system <b>1000</b>A can include a loading module <b>1100</b> for transfer of one or more substrates into or out of a controlled environment within one or more portions of the system <b>1000</b>A, such as using a handler located in a transfer module <b>1400</b>.</p>

Substrates to be processed can be queued or can be held to provide a specified holding duration to allow flowing or dispersal of an organic material deposited upon the substrate by the printing system <b>2000</b>. For example, one or more of a first module <b>1200</b>, a second module <b>1300</b>, or a third module <b>8500</b> can be used for holding one or more substrates before printing or after printing. The configuration of the one or more modules <b>1200</b>, <b>1300</b>, or <b>8500</b> can be specified at least in part using information about the substrate panel size.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As an illustrative example, for a configuration for organic encapsulation layer (OEL) fabrication for a Gen 3.5 substrate geometry or a Â¼ Gen 5 substrate geometry, the first module <b>1200</b> can be used as an encapsulation layer holding module and a curing module, such as providing uniform support for the substrate using one or more of the techniques described elsewhere herein (e.g., using a gas cushion or otherwise uniformly supporting the substrate using uniform physical contact inside the âactiveâ regions where light emitting devices are formed on the substrate). The inventors have recognized, among other things, that uniform support techniques described below including gas floatation (or alternatively uniform physical contact inside the âactiveâ regions) during one or more of printing, holding, or curing operations can suppress or inhibit formation of visible non-uniformities (e.g., mura) in an OEL fabrication process.</p>

In another example, such as for a larger substrate geometry, the third processing module <b>8500</b> can be configured to provide a reorientation module, the first processing module <b>1200</b> can be configured to provide an encapsulation curing module, and the second processing module <b>1300</b> can be configured as a holding or buffering module having one or more environmentally-controlled regions. Other configurations can be used, such as shown illustratively in the examples of <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> or <b>2</b>B, such as can be used with large panel geometries or to enhance throughput.</p>

In addition to simply holding substrates for the purpose of substrate flow management, such as holding a substrate for a period of time until another module is ready to receive it or providing a place to hold defective or damaged substrates until they can be removed, a holding or buffer module can also be used to hold substrates for a period of time as a part of a functional process flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">For example, after a printing operation, the substrate can be held for in a holding module, such as to provide a specified duration for dispersal or flowing of an organic material printed upon the substrate, such as during a process for forming an organic encapsulation layer. Such a holding operation can have a specified duration. In another example, the substrate can be held (e.g., for a specified duration), in a curing module, such as before enabling ultraviolet or heat treatment of the substrate. Such timed holding operation can be performed to allow the substrate to evolve from one state to another. For example, after a printing operation in which a liquid material is deposited onto the substrate and prior to a curing operation to form a solid film, a timed holding operation having a specified duration may be used to allow the liquid to flow, settle, dry, or any combination of the three prior to fixing the film via a curing operation, such as a curing operation including thermal treatment or optical treatment.</p>

Such a vacuum drying module can provide for the drying (at pressures below ambient pressures) of a liquid material, such as can be deposited onto the substrate via printing. In an example, the system <b>1000</b>B can include both a holding module providing various functions as described above and a separate vacuum drying module.

Such a controlled processing environment can be established to remain below specified limits of one or more of particulate contamination level, water vapor content, oxygen content, and organic vapor content. For example, the controlled processing environment can include nitrogen or another gas or mixture of gases specified for minimal or no reactivity with a species deposited on a substrate being processed using the system <b>1000</b>B. As described in other examples below, such a controlled processing environment can be established at least in part using a gas purification system include within or coupled to various portions of the system <b>1000</b>B (e.g., as shown in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, <figref>FIG. 18A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 18B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 19B</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 19C</figref>).

The first or second loading modules <b>1100</b>A or <b>1100</b>B can be fixed or removable, such as directly coupling the system <b>1000</b>B to other apparatus in a manufacturing line, or even providing a removable assembly that can be transported to or from other apparatus.

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">For example, the first loading module <b>1100</b>A or second loading module <b>1100</b>B can be coupled to a vacuum source, or a purge source, or both, and can be configured for independently sealing the interface port to system <b>1000</b>B and the interface port to the prior or next environment (which could be the ambient environment or a controlled environment associated with another enclosed processing module). In this manner, the first or second loading modules <b>1100</b>A or <b>1100</b>B can internally seal itself and transition the internal environment of the loading modules <b>1100</b>A or <b>1100</b>B between one that is not compatible with system <b>1000</b>B to one that is compatible with system <b>1000</b>B (e.g., a controlled environment at about atmospheric pressure or above atmospheric pressure that when exposed to system <b>1000</b>B via the interface port would substantially maintain the quality of the controlled environment in system <b>1000</b>B). Similarly, the first loading module <b>1100</b>A or second loading module <b>1100</b>B can be used to transfer the substrate to an environment suitable for other processing (e.g., a second environment at or near atmospheric pressure but having a different composition than the controlled environment, or a vacuum environment). In this manner, the first or second loading modules <b>1100</b>A or <b>1100</b>B can provide a transfer conduit between the controlled environment of the system <b>1000</b>B and other apparatus.</p>

For example, an internal region of one or more of the first or second loading modules can be at least partially evacuated or purged in order to avoid contamination in a manner exceeding the specified limits of particulate contamination level, water vapor content, oxygen content, ozone content, and organic vapor content of the controlled processing environment within an enclosed region defined by other portions of the system <b>1000</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Similarly, after processing by the system <b>1000</b>B, a substrate being processed can be placed in the first or second loading modules <b>1100</b>A or <b>1100</b>B.

The handler can include a robotic assembly having various degrees of freedom, such as to manipulate a substrate using an end effector. Such an end effector can include a tray or frame configured to support the substrate by gravity, or the end effector can securely grasp, clamp, or otherwise retain the substrate, such as to allow reorientation of the substrate from a face-up or face-down configuration to one or more other configurations. Other end effector configurations can be used, such as including pneumatic or vacuum-operated features to either actuate portions of the end effector or otherwise retain the substrate.

Such layers can include one or more of an electron injection or transport layer, a hole injection or transport layer, a blocking layer, or an emission layer, for example. Such materials can provide one or more electrically functional layers.

        <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> illustrate techniques, such as methods, that can include forming an organic thin-film encapsulation layer (OTFEL) of a light emitting device (e.g., an OEL of an OLED device). In the example <b>4100</b> of <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, at <b>4200</b>, as substrate can be transferred from an inorganic thin film encapsulation system to a transfer chamber of an organic thin film encapsulation (OTFE) system, such as a system as shown and described in relation to other examples herein. The substrate can be transferred from an environment different from a controlled environment of the transfer module, such as using loading module (e.g., âload lockâ). At <b>4300</b>, the substrate can be transferred to an enclosed printing system, such as at least in part using a handler robot located within the transfer module or within the enclosed printing system. At <b>4400</b>, the substrate can be uniformly supported in the printing system, such as using techniques and apparatus to reduce or inhibit formation of visible defects or âmuraâ during printing operations or other operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">For example, such support can include a chuck configuration (e.g., a planar chuck or tray) such as configured to provide uniform physical contact in areas of the substrate upon or opposite regions of the substrate where active devices such as light emitting electronic devices have been formed. This, however, can present a variety of challenges because generally-available chucks generally provide holes in central regions of the substrate through which lift pins can raise and lower the substrate, so as to facilitate loading and unloading operations. These holes can represent regions of non-uniform physical contact with the substrate. In the example of a vacuum chuck, there can also be grooves or holes through which the vacuum suction is provided that holds the substrate in place, and generally some of such groove or hole features are located in the central region of the substrate to achieve desired hold-down performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that a support chuck (or other portion of the system supporting the substrate), can be configured so as to position chuck features to minimize or eliminate their impact on the target coating pattern. In an example, the chuck can further provide non-uniform physical contact to certain areas of the substrate upon or opposite regions of the substrate outside where active devices such as light emitting electronic devices have been formed, or where active devices such as light emitting devices have been formed but which do not have a strict uniformity requirementâfor example, devices that will only be used for testing or which are manufactured and sold as second grade product. In this example, light emitting electronic devices are used as just one illustrative example, but the same support structure configurations can be applied to any active electronic, optical, or optoelectronic devices, wherein the active region can represent a region within which the devices being encapsulated are located.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The approach mentioned above to physically supporting the substrate in non-active areas has the benefit of being simple and relatively low cost, it does suffer from a drawback that in most instances such an approach includes portions of the center region of the substrate that are restricted from use for top quality uniform coatings, thereby reducing an effective productivity of the system. The present inventors have also recognized that such a drawback can be addressed by using a distributed vacuum region instead of individual vacuum grooves or holes, such as a continuous porous medium through which vacuum suction is provided. Remaining holes in the chuck associated with the lift pins can be restricted to one or more of a periphery of the substrate or a periphery of active regions (including regions opposite a surface defining a periphery of the substrate or a periphery of active regions of the substrate).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Alternatively, for example, the present inventors have also recognized, among other things, that the substrate can be uniformly supported at least in part using a gas cushion, such as during one or more of a printing operation or other processing such as before or during ultraviolet treatment in a curing module. Use of such a gas cushion can enhance uniformity of a coating or film layer on the substrate. For example, by floating the substrate above a physical substrate support surface, the substrate sees a uniform gas in all of the supported regions and is relatively less sensitive to the presence of holes for lift pins or other localized features that may be present on physical substrate support surface. In such a floating support example, lift pins in the center region of the substrate can be incorporated into the support mechanism without affecting film uniformity in those areas because the substrate is not in physical contact with extended or retracted lift pins and is supported by a gas cushion in the center region during processing such as printing, holding, or curing. In addition, or instead, the substrate can be further uniformly supported or retained by physical contact restricted to regions outside such active regions, such as in one or more of the substrate periphery or a periphery between active regions. In this way, all of the substrate area can offer a highly uniform coating and can be used productively, except, potentially, for an exclusion zone at the substrate edge where the substrate is physically contacted so as to constraint or hold it in place in the floatation plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">At <b>4500</b>, an organic material such as a monomer can be printed in a target deposition region of the substrate, such as including a monomer to form an organic encapsulation layer. The phrase âdeposition regionâ generally refers to the region where the organic encapsulation layer is being formed. At <b>4600</b>, the substrate can be transferred from the printing system to the transfer module. In an example, the substrate is retained in the enclosed printing system for a specified holding duration after printing to allow flowing or dispersal of an organic material deposited upon the substrate by the printing system. At <b>4700</b>, the substrate can be transferred from the transfer module to a curing module.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">At <b>4800</b>, the substrate can be supported in the curing system, such as uniformly supported in one or more specified regions. The manner of supporting the substrate can be similar to or different from the substrate support technique used during the printing operation at <b>4500</b>. However, generally, the substrate support can again provide uniform support, such as via uniform physical contact (e.g., a vacuum chuck such as providing a distributed vacuum region) or gas floatation, within those active areas to be uniformly coated, during printing, curing, or holding operations (e.g., during which a material flows or disperses prior to curing). For example, a chuck configured to support the substrate at least in part using a gas cushion. The curing module can be configured to treat the printed organic material at <b>4900</b>, such as to provide a mura-free OTFE layer. For example, the curing module can be configured to provide optical treatment, such as an ultraviolet light treatment, to a printed monomer layer to polymerize or otherwise cure the monomer layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">
        <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates another example <b>4150</b>, such as for providing a mura-free OTFE layer. At <b>4200</b>, as in the example of <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, a substrate can be transferred from an ITFE system to a transfer chamber of an OTFE system. At <b>4350</b>, the substrate can be transferred to a substrate support system of a printing system, such as to provide uniform support of the substrate at least in one or more active regions of the substrate. Such a substrate support system can include apparatus or techniques as mentioned above to help suppress or inhibit mura formation during one or more operations such as printing or holding (e.g., prior to curing so as to facilitate the dispersal or flow of the deposited material). For example, the substrate support system can include a floatation table configuration, such as having various floatation control zones including one or more of a pneumatically-supplied gas cushion, or a combination of pneumatic and at least partial vacuum supplied regions to provide a gas cushion supporting the substrate. In another example, a distributed vacuum region can be used such as to provide uniform support of the substrate at least in one or more active regions of the substrate. At <b>4550</b>, a monomer can be printed over a target deposition region.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">At <b>4600</b>, the substrate can be transferred from the printing system to the transfer chamber, such as using a handler located in the transfer chamber, as mentioned above in relation to <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. At <b>4750</b>, the substrate can be transferred from the transfer chamber to a substrate support system of an OTFE curing module. The substrate support system can include a chuck configured to support the substrate in a manner that can suppress or inhibit mura formation during one or more of a holding operation or curing operation. For example, as described in other examples, the substrate can be held for a specified duration after printing and before treatment by the curing module, such as before ultraviolet treatment. At <b>4950</b>, the monomer layer can be cured such as using an ultraviolet treatment provided by the curing module, such as to provide a mura-free OTFE layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The substrate support techniques mentioned in relation to <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are generally referred to in the context of the curing module or printing system. However, such techniques can also be used such as in relation to an end effector configuration for a handler robot configured to manipulate the substrate. For example, a handler robot can include an end effector configuration such as to provide support for a substrate while avoiding non-uniform direct physical contact with active regions on a first side of the substrate, or corresponding portions of a second side of the substrate opposite the first side.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates generally an example of a diagram illustrating a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system that can be used in manufacturing a light emitting device. The example of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can include apparatus or can include using techniques that can be combined other examples herein, such as those described above (e.g., to provide an organic encapsulation layer fabrication system or other system for performing processing of substrates, such as substrates including one or more OLED devices). The system of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can include an enclosure having a controlled environment, such as a non-reactive gas environment, such as including a transfer module <b>1400</b>. The transfer module can include a handler <b>1411</b>, such as coupled to an end effector <b>1422</b> to manipulate one or more substrates such as a first substrate <b>4000</b>A, second substrate <b>4000</b>B, or third substrate <b>4000</b>C. As an illustrative example, the system can include a curing module <b>2302</b>. The curing module can also be used for providing holding of substrates, such as to facilitate an evolution of a substrate from one processing state to another (e.g., for dispersal or flowing of the deposited material), or to provide buffering for queuing of substrates. Additionally, or alternatively, other processing modules can providing holding or buffering capabilities. The environmentally-controlled regions can include one or more of a specified gas purity, temperature, or particulate level.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">Gas within various regions of the example of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can be circulated laterally across a surface of a substrate such as to provide a substantially laminar flow profile. Additionally, or instead, one or more fan filter units (FFUs) such as an FFU <b>1500</b> can provide a top-down flow profile, such as recovering gas through one or more ducts such as a duct <b>5201</b>. As in other examples, a temperature controller <b>5650</b> can be coupled to one or more other portions of the system, such as to a heat exchanger located on or within the FFU <b>1500</b>. In this manner, a temperature within the transfer module <b>1400</b> (or other portions of the system) can be controlled. The system can include or can be coupled to a gas purification system, such as including a gas controller <b>5600</b> configured to monitor or control a gas purity level of the controlled environment. The modules such as a holding module or the curing module <b>2302</b> can include separate gas purification loops, or such modules can share a controlled environment and purification facilities with the transfer module <b>1400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">The curing module <b>2302</b> can include one or more lamps such as an ultraviolet lamp. Such lamps can be located within the curing module <b>2302</b>, or outside the chamber such as optically coupled to the chamber through a quartz (or other UV-transparent) window.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Generally, one or more of the substrates in the thermally-controlled regions can be supported by a chuck configuration such as including a plate, frame, or tray. As mentioned in other examples herein, such a plate, frame, or tray can include one or more retractable lift pins (e.g., a pin <b>2324</b>). As in other examples, the one or more retractable pins or other mechanical support features can be located in regions at the perimeter or between display devices on the substrate. Similarly, a vacuum chuck can support the substrate. A vacuum chuck can be outfitted with vacuum ports and a vacuum supply, which can be turned on and off controllably, so as to provide vacuum suction to the backside of substrate during a processing operation to improve the stability of the substrate or the thermal contact between the substrate and the chuck during that processing operation. In various examples, instead of vacuum chuck, a non-vacuum chuck can be provided and the substrate can be held in place either primarily by gravity and friction, or primarily by mechanical clamping. Substrates can be placed or removed from various positions, such as using an end effector <b>1422</b> of a handler <b>1411</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">One or more pins such as a lift pin can be used to elevate the substrate for access by the end effector, as described further below. As mentioned above, the curing module <b>2302</b> can also be used to facilitate the dispersal or flow of the film layer deposited on the substrate, such as to achieve a more planar and uniform coating (e.g., an OEL layer printed using a printing module), such as using one or more of gravity, rotation of the substrate, or using one or more vacuum ports to further planarize the substrate during one or more of the holding, material flowing or dispersing, or curing operation. However, the present inventors have recognized that using a vacuum chuck having large ports during one or more of holding, material flowing or dispersal or ultraviolet treatment can lead to unwanted visible defects or âmura.â The configuration shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can help to facilitate production of an organic thin film encapsulant layer while inhibiting or suppressing mura formation.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">As mentioned in examples elsewhere herein, a source of ultraviolet emission can be used such as to treat one or more layers deposited on a substrate being fabricated. For example, ultraviolet emission can be used to polymerize or otherwise treat an organic layer deposited on the substrate, such as for use in one or more processes related to manufacturing a flat panel display assembly, such as including an OLED display assembly. Similar to aspects of other examples described herein, the system of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can include one or more enclosed regions (e.g., âcellsâ or chambers) such as first region <b>2301</b>A, a second region <b>2301</b>B, and an âNthâ region <b>2301</b>N. For example, three regions can be included (e.g., as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>), and in another example, other numbers of regions can be included. The regions can be oriented in a âstackedâ configuration along a vertical axis of the system, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In an illustrative example, such as after deposition of an organic layer on a substrate, a material flowing or dispersal operation can be performed, such as to improve the planarization or uniformity of a coating. A duration of the material flowing or dispersal operation can generally be greater than a duration of an ultraviolet treatment operation. Accordingly, in one approach, respective holding modules can be used, such as separate from the curing module <b>2302</b> and arranged in a stacked configuration with each region configured to house a substrate as shown in <figref>FIG. 21A</figref> or <b>21</b>B. In this approach, the material flowing or dispersal operation can proceed without restricting access or otherwise tying up a separate ultraviolet treatment region. However, as discussed in examples elsewhere herein, multiple ultraviolet sources can be used, such including user lower-cost sources. In this manner, a throughput impact of idling an ultraviolet source need not preclude use of the same âcellâ or region (e.g., <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N) for both a holding operation and ultraviolet treatment operation, because multiple regions are configured to provide ultraviolet treatment, enhancing throughput. Such an approach can also provide redundancy of the ultraviolet sources such that processing can continue even if a particular ultraviolet source fails or is undergoing maintenance. Yet another benefit to such an approach is that the substrate can undergo a material flowing or dispersal operation to disperse or flow a printed organic layer (e.g., to improve planarization or uniformity) and the substrate can be treated, such as receiving an ultraviolet treatment, without requiring movement of the substrate from the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">In the example of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a first ultraviolet source <b>2310</b>A (e.g., an ultraviolet-emitting LED array) can provide ultraviolet emission <b>2328</b> having a specified range of wavelengths to a first substrate <b>4000</b>A. The ultraviolet emission can be coupled to an interior of the enclosed region <b>2310</b>A such as through a window <b>2310</b>A (e.g., a quartz window or an assembly such as including a normalization filter, or other filters or coatings). As in the example of <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, the environment within the region <b>2301</b>A can be controlled and can be isolated from a housing containing the first ultraviolet source <b>2310</b>A. In the second enclosed region <b>2310</b>B, the second substrate <b>4000</b>B can be held for a specified duration, such as for material flowing or dispersal or to await availability of other processes. During the specified holding duration, a second ultraviolet source <b>2310</b>B can be disabled.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">In examples elsewhere herein, a chuck can be used, such as contacting at least a portion of a substrate such as to one or more of convey, support, or retain the substrate. The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that for some operations or material systems, such as in relation to providing for the flowing or dispersing a deposited organic layer, visible defects can be induced in the display regions of the substrate <b>4000</b>A when the substrate is supported in a non-uniform manner. For example, pins, support frames, holes in the chuck associated with retracted lift-pins, or vacuum apertures in the chuck under the substrate <b>4000</b>A can induce visible defects in a finished device as shown illustratively in <figref>FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such defects can result from localized variations in thermal conductivity that can create local gradients in the temperature of the substrate <b>4000</b>A during, for example, a material flowing or dispersal operation or from electrostatic interactions between the substrate <b>4000</b>A and other portions of the system, such as can be influenced by contact between the substrate <b>4000</b>A and other portions of the system. In an example, a specified temperature uniformity can be maintained in a local region of the substrate, for example, such that deviation in temperature adjacent to or within the local region is limited. For example, a significant temperature variation across the substrate can be tolerated but such variation can have a limited gradient such that the temperature does not vary significantly over a small distance along the substrate. In this manner, abrupt changes in visible characteristics of the finished display can be avoided and such gradual changes are less likely to be noticed or even detectable.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">As mentioned elsewhere, in one approach, regions outside the emitting or display region of the substrate can be used to support substrate <b>4000</b>A (e.g., as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 13C</figref>). However, because large portions of the substrate <b>4000</b>A generally do include emitting regions or portions of the actual display region, it can be impractical to support the substrate only at the periphery of such regions because such support induces unacceptable mechanical forces or stresses elsewhere across the substrate <b>4000</b>A, which may either distort or fracture the substrate <b>4000</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Accordingly, the present inventors have also recognized that the substrate <b>4000</b>A can be supported by a chuck <b>2320</b>A, such as during an ultraviolet treatment operation, such as at least in part using a pressurized gas <b>2304</b>A to provide a gas cushion. According to various examples, the substrate <b>4000</b>A can be supported exclusively by a controlled arrangement of the pressurized gas <b>2304</b>A, such as to âfloatâ the substrate <b>4000</b>A. In another example, the substrate <b>4000</b>A can be supported using a uniform vacuum region under active areas of the substrate or otherwise in areas where defects induced by non-uniformities would be deemed unacceptable. Retractable lift pins can be located in regions at the periphery of the substrate, or between active regions such as to facilitate loading or unloading of the substrate, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 15A</figref> or <b>15</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">In another approach, the substrate <b>4000</b>A can be supported by a pressurized gas <b>2304</b>A impinging on a first surface of the substrate <b>4000</b>A, and an opposing force can be provided such as by a mechanical stop <b>2312</b> contacting an opposing face of the substrate <b>4000</b>A or arranged to contact the substrate at one or more locations laterally. Generally, in examples where a gas cushion is used to the support the substrate, the substrate can be supported by a gas cushion provided between a surface of the substrate opposite the surface including the active regions or the organic encapsulation layer, such as in a âface upâ example where the organic encapsulation is on a top surface of the substrate and the gas cushion is provided on a bottom surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">A second chuck <b>2320</b>B can be provided as a portion of the second cell (e.g., the region <b>2301</b>B), and an âNthâ chuck <b>2320</b>N can be provided as a portion of the âNthâ cell (e.g., the region <b>2301</b>N). Similarly, an elevating handler <b>1411</b> (or a handler robot as described in other examples herein) can include a table (or a corresponding end effector <b>1422</b>) including pressurized gas arrangement to support a substrate at least in part using the pressurized gas. A conveyor <b>1430</b>, or other apparatus can also include such a pressurized gas arrangement, such that a substrate (e.g., a substrate <b>4000</b>C) can be conveyed along a path <b>2440</b> from a region <b>2101</b> elsewhere in the system (or external to the system) to a desired cell, such as the region <b>2301</b>N. For example, one or more of the conveyer <b>1430</b>, the effector <b>1422</b>, or the first through âNthâ chucks <b>2320</b>A through <b>2320</b>N can each define a âfloatation zone.â In one or more of the floatation zones, such as in a zone established by the first chuck <b>2320</b>A, an arrangement (e.g., an array) of ports such as a port <b>2306</b>A can be used to establish a gas cushion partially or entirely supporting the substrate <b>4000</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">In examples where the substrate <b>4000</b>A is supported exclusively by the gas cushion, a combination of positive gas pressure and vacuum can be applied through the arrangement of ports. Such a zone having both pressure and vacuum control can effectively provide a fluidic spring between the chuck <b>2320</b>A and a substrate. A combination of positive pressure and vacuum control can provide a fluidic spring with bidirectional stiffness. The gap that exists between the substrate (e.g., substrate <b>4000</b>A) and a surface (e.g., the first chuck <b>2320</b>A) can be referred to as the âfly height,â and such a height can be controlled or otherwise established by controlling the positive pressure and vacuum port states. In this manner, the substrate orientation can be carefully controlled such as for one or more of a holding operation, a material flowing or dispersing operation or an ultraviolet treatment operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Elsewhere, such as where the fly height need not be controlled precisely, pressure-only floatation zones can be provided, such as along the conveyor <b>1430</b> or elsewhere. A âtransitionâ zone can be provided such as where a ratio of pressure to vacuum nozzles or area increases or decreases gradually, such as along the conveyor <b>1430</b>, along the table <b>1422</b>, or elsewhere. In an illustrative example, there can be an essentially uniform height between a pressure-vacuum zone, a transition zone, and a pressure only zone, so that within tolerances, the three zones can lie essentially in one plane. A fly height of a substrate over pressure-only zones elsewhere can be greater than the fly height of a substrate over a pressure-vacuum zone, such as in order to allow enough height so that a substrate will not collide with a floatation table in the pressure-only zones. In an illustrative example, an OLED panel substrate can have a fly height of between about 150 micrometers (Î¼) to about 300Î¼ above pressure-only zones, and then between about 30Î¼ to about 50Î¼ above a pressure-vacuum zone. In an illustrative example, one or more portions of the conveyor <b>1430</b>, the table <b>1422</b>, or the chucks <b>2320</b>A through <b>2320</b>N can include an âair bearingâ assembly provided by NewWayÂ® Air Bearings (Aston, Pa., United States of America). While the examples of gas pressurized support of a substrate are discussed in relation to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, such techniques can be used in addition to or instead of other conveyance or support approaches, such as in relation other system examples described herein, and as discussed in relation to <figref>FIG. 19C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">In an example, mechanical retaining techniques, such as pins or a frame, can be used to restrict lateral translation of a substrate while the substrate is supported by a gas cushion. Such retaining techniques can include using spring loaded structures, such as to reduce the instantaneous forces incident the sides of the substrate while the substrate is being retained; this can be beneficial as a high force impact between a laterally translating substrate and a retaining means can cause substrate chipping or even catastrophic breakage.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Each of the regions <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N can either share one or more gas purification loops or can each be served by a respective gas purification loop. Similarly, one or more FFUs can be located to provide a laminar airflow parallel to a surface of substrate in each of the regions <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N. The regions <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N can each include a valve or gate, such as to isolate the controlled environment of each enclosed region <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N from the transfer module <b>1400</b> or from each other. For example, the ultraviolet sources <b>2310</b>A through <b>2310</b>N need not be housed in enclosures isolated from the interior of the regions <b>2301</b>A through <b>2301</b>N. Accordingly, such as during maintenance, a particular region can have its controlled environment isolated from the rest of the enclosed regions using a valve or gate.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">A temperature within the enclosed transfer module <b>1400</b> or within other portions of the system can be controlled as described extensively in other examples herein, such as using a temperature controller <b>5650</b>. The temperature controller <b>5650</b> can be coupled to the FFU <b>1500</b> or one or more FFUs elsewhere. The temperature controller <b>5650</b> or other techniques can be used such as to control a temperature of gas supplied by one or more of the chucks <b>2320</b>A through <b>2320</b>N, the table <b>1422</b>, or the conveyor <b>1430</b>. As mentioned in relation to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, one or more of the ultraviolet sources <b>2310</b>A through <b>2310</b>N can be cooled using a liquid or circulating gas, such as including one or more cooling loops isolated from other portions of the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates generally an example of a diagram illustrating an ultraviolet treatment system that can be used in manufacturing a light emitting device. The treatment system can be included as a portion of other systems or techniques described herein, such as for use as a curing module (or, e.g., for use as a combination curing and holding module). The ultraviolet treatment system can include an ultraviolet source assembly <b>912</b>, such as configured to couple ultraviolet energy to a surface of a substrate <b>4000</b>. As in other examples, a curing module <b>8314</b> can include a controlled environment, such as provided by one or more gas purification loops and coupled to one or more fan-filter-units (FFUs), such as to provide an environment having a specified maximum level of particulates or reactive contaminants.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The substrate <b>4000</b> can be loaded into the curing module <b>8314</b> or removed from the chamber <b>8314</b> such as using a handler <b>1410</b> and end effector <b>1420</b>, which can access the curing module <b>8314</b> from an adjacent transfer module <b>1400</b>, or through another chamber or assembly such as a load lock. A chuck <b>920</b> can be used to support the substrate <b>4000</b>, such as using physical contact and vacuum to hold the substrate in place or using a gas cushion arrangement as mentioned in other examples. One or more lift pins can be used, such as to elevate the substrate <b>4000</b> so that the substrate <b>4000</b> can be manipulated by the end effector <b>1420</b>, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 15A</figref> or <b>15</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">An array of ultraviolet sources, such as sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N, can provide ultraviolet energy, such as including a wavelength selected from the range of about 350 nanometers to about 400 nanometers. For example, a wavelength of about 385 nanometers or about 395 nanometers can be used. The sources can include a variety of configurations, such as using relatively small number of high-power sources as shown in the example of <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, or using an array of relatively lower-power sources, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. The sources can include generally-available ultraviolet emitters, such as ultraviolet-emitting light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) or one or more mercury-based devices, such as one or more mercury arc sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">In an example, a substrate or housing <b>918</b> of the ultraviolet source assembly <b>912</b> can be liquid or air-cooled. For example, a plenum <b>914</b> can be provided, such as having one or more blowers such as a blower <b>915</b> to force air across or through a portion of the ultraviolet source assembly <b>912</b>. Such a cooling loop can be separated from the controlled environment within the curing module <b>8314</b> or the transfer module <b>1400</b>, for example. The environment surrounding the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can include the curing module <b>8314</b> controlled environment, or the environment surrounding the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can form a separate enclosure, such as having a window <b>916</b> to allow ultraviolet energy to pass from the source enclosure to the curing module <b>8314</b>. In this manner, maintenance of the source enclosure need not disturb the controlled environment within the curing module <b>8314</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">As discussed in the examples below, the window <b>916</b> need not be uniformly transmissive. For example, the window can include or can be coupled to optics to converge, diverge, or collimate the ultraviolet energy. In another example, the window <b>916</b> can include transmission characteristics that vary in a specified manner over the area of the window, such as to invert or otherwise compensate for a non-uniform power density of delivered ultraviolet energy in the plane of the substrate <b>4000</b>, such as within a specified region of the substrate. In the example of <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the window and the ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N are shown as arranged in a planar configuration, but other configurations are possible, such as a cylindrical, parabolic, or spherical configuration. In an example the ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can be used to treat one or more organic material layers to encapsulate an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device being fabricated as a portion of the substrate <b>4000</b>. Such treatment generally includes providing a specified dose of ultraviolet energy within a specified range of wavelengths, and having a specified uniformity over a specified area of the substrate <b>4000</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">A treatment process can generally be established in terms of a desired dose or dose-range of ultraviolet exposure, such as specified in terms of energy per unit area (e.g., Joules per square centimeter). Dose can be calculated such as by multiplying incident power density by exposure duration. A trade-off can exist between intensity (e.g., incident power) and exposure duration. For example, a relatively high-power source can be used and a desired UV dose can be achieved using a relatively short exposure duration, which beneficially shortens processing time. However, such high-power UV irradiation may damage or degrade other portions of the display assembly, so a limit can exist as to the power density provided at the substrate by the ultraviolet source such as to avoid such damage or degradation.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">As mentioned above, a uniformity of delivered ultraviolet energy can also be controlled, such as to avoid variation in organic encapsulation layer characteristics over a surface of the substrate <b>4000</b>. In one example, such a uniformity can be specified in terms of incident power or delivered UV dose, such as having a value of no more than 20% variation from highest to lowest incident power or dose over a specified curing area of the substrate <b>4000</b>, or having no more than 50% variation from highest to lowest incident power or dose over the specified curing area of the substrate <b>4000</b>, or having no more than 10% variation from highest to lowest incident power or dose over the specified curing area of the substrate <b>4000</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Various UV source configurations can be used for the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N. For example, a linear array or âbarâ source can be used as shown in the configuration <b>8315</b> of <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>. Such a bar configuration can include a precision reflector, such as to focus or collimate the ultraviolet energy in a direction towards the substrate <b>4000</b>. In another example, such a bar configuration can include one or more of a diffuser or transmissive filter, such as discussed in relation to other examples herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">A two-dimensional array configuration can be used, such as shown illustratively in the configurations <b>8316</b> through <b>8318</b> of <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. A sparse array of high-intensity sources can be used, such as can provide the power density illustrated in the example of <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, such as including one or more reflectors. One or more of these source configurations can be mechanically fixed, or can be scanned across a surface of the substrate. In such examples, either or both the substrate <b>4000</b> or the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can be scanned. For example, the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can be fixed, and the substrate <b>4000</b> can be repositioned, such as to create a relative motion between the substrate <b>4000</b> and the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N to achieve scanning.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> illustrate generally examples illustrating a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system <b>8315</b> that can include a linear array configuration <b>910</b> of ultraviolet sources such as can be used in manufacturing a light emitting device. The linear array <b>910</b> can be scanned in at least one axis to sweep a beam of ultraviolet emission <b>922</b> across a specified region of the substrate <b>4000</b>, such as in a region where a monomer has been deposited and is to be cured or otherwise treated with ultraviolet light. Such scanning can be achieved through either or both of repositioning the substrate <b>4000</b> or the linear array <b>910</b>, such as during ultraviolet treatment. A window <b>916</b> can be used, such as when the linear array <b>910</b> is located in an enclosure separate from a chamber <b>8314</b> housing the substrate <b>4000</b>. Such a window <b>916</b> can include or can be coupled to one or more of optics or a filter, such as discussed below in relation to <figref>FIG. 12</figref> or other examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">The linear array <b>910</b> can offer an advantage of fewer ultraviolet sources (e.g., about 5 to about 10 LED sources, in an illustrative example). But, such a linear area <b>910</b> may result in additional system complexity where mechanical scanning is used to provide exposure to all of the specified curing area of the substrate <b>4000</b>. Mechanical scanning can be simplified in part by specifying that the linear array <b>910</b> is at least as wide or as a long as one axis of the substrate, so that scanning is used only in the orthogonal axis (e.g., such axis as shown by arrows in <figref>FIGS. 7A and 8A</figref>). In this manner, an entire width or length of the substrate <b>4000</b> can be treated with UV radiation while scanning the linear array <b>910</b> âgantryâ only in a single axis, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>. The linear array <b>910</b> can include a precision reflector configuration, as mentioned above. As an illustrative example, a high-power UV LED light bar supplying light at or near 395 nm wavelength is available from Phoseon Technology (Hillsboro, Oreg., USA), such as including a reflector configuration to enhance uniformity of a field illuminated by the linear array <b>910</b>. In addition or instead of such a precision reflector, one or more of a filter or diffuser can be used, such as statically configured nearby the window <b>916</b> or included as a portion of the window <b>916</b>. In another example, one or more of a filter or diffuser can be included as a portion of the linear array <b>910</b> assembly, such as mechanically scanned as a portion of the linear array <b>910</b>. In an example, the power density supplied by the linear UV source is between 20 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 400 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">The present inventors have also recognized that a uniformity of ultraviolet illumination can be compromised by degradation or failure of one or more ultraviolet sources. In the illustrations of <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, an optical sensor <b>917</b> such as an ultraviolet-sensitive photometer can be used to monitor the health of the linear array <b>910</b>. For example, the optical sensor <b>917</b> can be mechanically scanned in an axis parallel to the linear array <b>910</b> so that information can be obtained regarding the state of one or more optical sources included along the linear array <b>910</b>. In another example, the optical sensor <b>917</b> can include multiple sensors placed along an axis parallel to the linear array <b>910</b>, such as obviating a need for mechanical scanning of the optical sensor <b>917</b>. Other configurations of optical sensors can be used, such as mentioned in relation to other examples below. As in other examples discussed herein, one or more apertures can be provided in the chamber <b>8314</b>, such as to provide a mounting location for a fan or fan filter unit, or to provide a location for an inlet or outlet of a non-reactive gas to be used within the chamber <b>8314</b>, such as to facilitate coupling of a duct to the chamber <b>8314</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">A linear array <b>910</b> source height from an upward-facing portion of the substrate <b>4000</b> can be represented by âH,â a relative velocity between the optical energy emitted by the array <b>910</b> and the substrate can be represented by âV.â The velocity can be established by moving one or more of the array <b>910</b> relative to the substrate <b>4000</b> (e.g., scanning the array mechanically) or the substrate <b>4000</b> relative to the array, such as by either floating the substrate on a cushion of gas or by moving a chuck <b>920</b> supporting the substrate. An illuminated width can be represented by âW,â with such a width increasing as H increases and decreasing as H decreases. For dose modeling, a width of the array <b>910</b> can be multiplied by the illuminated width W to estimate an area of the substrate <b>4000</b> irradiated by the array <b>910</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Generally, in view of the large scale of substrates <b>4000</b> that can be accommodated by the examples described herein, throughput is a consideration. Accordingly, one objective can be to provide an ultraviolet dose in a manner that the appropriate dose is delivered in a short or minimum amount of time, which can also reduce likelihood of damaging other portions of the substrate <b>4000</b> either through reducing or minimizing exposure to energy from the source, or merely through reducing or minimizing the time during which the substrate is being processed. However, a tradeoff can exist between various processing parameters such that the velocity, dose of energy, and source height H are generally not arbitrarily established.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates generally an example of a diagram illustrating a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system that can include a two-dimensional array configuration <b>8316</b> of ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N, such as can be used as a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system for treating a specified area of a substrate <b>4000</b>. By contrast with the illustrative examples described in relation to <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, a dense two-dimensional array of low-power ultraviolet sources can be used. Such low-power sources can include low-power UV LEDs, which are generally more cost effective and reliable than mercury arc devices. Such low-power UV LEDs can also be used for large substrate <b>4000</b> geometries (e.g., exceeding 1 meter by 1 meter), such as where high-power UV LEDs would become cost prohibitive due to the large numbers of devices generally used to cover the large substrate <b>4000</b> area.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">The dense array of hundreds of individual emitters can provide enhanced uniformity of delivered power at the substrate <b>4000</b> surface, as compared to other approaches. Remaining non-uniformity can be addressed such as using a diffuser plate or other filter or optics between the array <b>8316</b> and the substrate <b>4000</b>. As in the example of <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> or <b>8</b>B, degradation or failure of one or more of the ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N can result in a non-uniform ultraviolet exposure field. Such a non-uniform field can lead to visible defects or unwanted variations in one or more layers of the substrate <b>4000</b>. Accordingly, one or more optical sensors <b>917</b>A through <b>917</b>N (e.g., photometric sensors) can be used to sense such degradation or failure. As shown in the illustration of <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, each of the optical sensors <b>917</b>A through <b>917</b>N can, but need not, be aligned to provide a 1:1 correspondence to an optical source in a particular row or column and a corresponding optical sensor position, so that a failure of an individual optical source can be detected. In another approach, a spatially-averaged or spatially-cumulative specified intensity can be used as a go/no criterion, and fewer sensors can be used. A failure of an individual optical source can reduce an average intensity or a cumulative intensity detected at one or more of the optical sensors, such as triggering repair or replacement of the optical source array or otherwise halting further processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">For example, one or more of the array <b>8316</b> of ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N or the optical sensors <b>917</b>A can be mechanically scanned, such as to sample the output of the ultraviolet sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N. In the event of a detected degradation or failure, further processing can be halted until the array <b>8316</b> is repaired or replaced. In an example, the array <b>8316</b> can include redundant sources amongst the sources <b>910</b>A through <b>910</b>N. In the event of degradation or failure, use of a combination of one or more defective sources can be suppressed, and a combination of other redundant ultraviolet sources can be used instead.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> illustrates generally an example of a two-dimensional array configuration <b>8317</b> of UV LED sources <b>1710</b>A through <b>1710</b>N, such as can be used as a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system for treating a specified area of a substrate <b>4000</b>. The two-dimensional array <b>8317</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref> can eliminate use of precision reflectors, since such an array generally provides UV radiation in the desired direction without use of large reflectors. Use of low-power UV LEDs can also allow precision control of intensity (through duty cycle modulation or current modulation) and exposure duration, such as allowing duration control to a precision of about 20 milliseconds. A substrate <b>1718</b> of the array <b>8317</b> can include a heat-sink material, such as to assist in coupling heat away from the individual sources <b>1710</b>A through <b>1710</b>N in the array <b>8317</b>. The substrate <b>1718</b> can include or can be coupled to a structural support frame. The individual sources <b>1710</b>A through <b>1710</b>N can each include a lens structure, such as to provide a converging, diverging, or collimated ultraviolet beam for each of the individual sources <b>1710</b>A through <b>1710</b>N.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">
        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> illustrates generally an example of a housing configuration <b>8318</b> for an array of ultraviolet sources, such as can be included as a portion of an ultraviolet treatment system. The housing can include forced air circulation, such as using one or more fans as indicated by apertures <b>1815</b>A through <b>1815</b>D. An array of UV LEDs, such as a UV LED <b>1810</b>A, can be included within a housing <b>1812</b>. One or more alignment or support posts can be included, such as one or more of posts <b>1824</b>A through <b>1824</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">
        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> illustrates generally an illustrative example of an intensity plot <b>1900</b> showing a non-uniformity of delivered ultraviolet energy corresponding to a known distance from the UV sources and the substrate. Such an intensity plot can be used to establish an inverse or normalization filter configuration. In one approach, such as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, a small number of fixed high-power lamps can be used along with a reflector, such as illuminating a desired curing area of the substrate <b>4000</b>. However, while mechanically simple, such an approach can have drawbacks.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">For example, in the illustrative example of <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, four high-power LEDs are used to illuminate an area of about 0.650 meters by about 0.725 meters. Such an approach can provide areas of relatively higher incident power, such as an area <b>1902</b>, along with areas of relatively lower incident power, such as in the center of the plot <b>1900</b>. Uniformity can be enhanced by increasing a density of sources, but at the cost of using a greater number of individual high-power LEDs. The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that information about an intensity map such as shown in the plot <b>1900</b> can be used to establish an inverting filter to provide a uniform intensity or power distribution over a desired cure area while still using a sparse array or relatively small number of UV sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">For example, the plot <b>1900</b> can be normalized to a least intense region and then the plot <b>1900</b> can be inverted. The inverted representation can be used to establish a transmissive filter whereby the least intense regions of the plot <b>1900</b> have the least, less, or no filtering as compared to other regions, and the more intense regions are filtered to reduce transmission of energy through the filter proportionally in those more intense regions and thereby level out their transmission to a value similar to the least intense regions. In this manner, a uniform area illumination can be achieved on the substrate. Such inversion and transmission need not be continuously varying, and in some examples all areas can be filtered to some extent. In an example, a transmissive filter can include a half-tone or other dithering pattern of opaque material (e.g., an array of dots or other regions) such as to provide a range of transmitted intensities across a surface of the filter corresponding to the inverted intensity pattern of a UV source.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">The transmissive filter can be included as a portion of a window as discussed in other examples, or can be coupled to a window. For example, an absorbing coating can be patterned on a flexible film or on a rigid medium such as glass or quartz. In an illustrative example, the transmissive filter is coupled to a quartz window or a transparent support plate at a specified location between the substrate <b>4000</b> and UV sources. In another illustrative example, the transmissive filter is patterned on a film and structurally supported by a frame at a specified location between the substrate <b>4000</b> and the UV sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">In another approach (or in combination with the transmissive filter approach described above), a diffuser can be used to provide a more uniform illumination field. A diffuser can be more efficient than a transmissive filter having optically opaque regions. This inefficiency of a transmissive filter can occur because brighter regions in the illumination field (e.g., âhotspotsâ) are generally reflected or absorbed (e.g., blocked) by the transmissive filter, such as to achieve uniformity of illumination of the substrate. By contrast, a diffuser can assist in providing more uniform illumination by redirection of propagating light using one or more of refraction, diffraction, or scattering, such as comprising a translucent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">For example, the window region <b>916</b> in one or more of <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, or other examples herein, can include a diffuser such as including a plate or film similar to the examples discussed above in relation to the transmissive filter. For example, a diffuser can include a holographically-imprinted plate or film. Such a diffuser can be used in examples where the UV light source is static (e.g., an array source as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 11</figref>). Such a diffuser can also be used in examples where the UV light source is mechanically scanned relative to the substrate or vice versa (e.g., <figref>FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, or <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>). Examples of diffusers can include one or more light management films such as can be obtained from WaveFront Technology, Inc. (Paramount, Calif., United States of America), such as can include a micro-diffuser including a holographically recorded surface relief microstructure. Other diffuser technologies can be used, such as can include bead structures or prismatic structures, for example. In another example, a homogenizing diffuser can be used, such as available from Luminit, LLC (Torrance, Calif., United States of America).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">Such a diffuser arrangement can provide a more space-efficient UV exposure apparatus, such as by eliminating large reflectors and compressing a distance between individual UV sources (e.g., LEDs) and the substrate, as compared to approaches where the UV sources are mounted with a large separation from the substrate, and large reflectors are used to assist in collimating or otherwise providing a more uniform illumination field. In an illustrative example, a diffuser can provide a transmissive efficiency of greater than 80 percent, or greater than 90 percent, such as to provide UV illumination having a field uniformity of better than 15% (e.g, having a uniformity that does not vary more than 15% in intensity from a lowest intensity portion of the specified region defining the field to a highest intensity portion of the specified region defining the field).</p>

        <figref>FIG. 13A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 13B</figref> illustrate generally illustrative examples of a chuck configuration <b>2420</b>A that includes ports or grooves in contact with a substrate <b>4006</b>A in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, such as during one or more of a deposition, holding, material flow or dispersal, or cure process, and corresponding visible non-uniformities (e.g., âmuraâ) in a layer of the substrate in <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>. In the example of <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, the chuck <b>2420</b>A can include one or more of a groove <b>4008</b> (e.g., coupled to a vacuum or included for another purpose), a retracted lift pin <b>4016</b>, a large vacuum port <b>4014</b>, a vacuum groove <b>4012</b>, or one or more other features. In an illustrative example, the chuck <b>2420</b>A can be used to retain a substrate <b>4006</b>A during processing, such as during deposition of an organic thin film encapsulant, or during other operations such as providing for the flow or dispersal of a deposited encapsulant layer (e.g., to achieve a more uniform or planar coating), or during thermal or ultraviolet treatment of such an encapsulant layer. In <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, a resulting layer uniformity on the substrate <b>4006</b>A can exhibit visible defects such as a defect <b>4018</b> corresponding to the groove <b>4016</b>, a defect <b>4026</b> corresponding to the retracted lift pin <b>4016</b>, a defect <b>4022</b> corresponding to the vacuum groove <b>4012</b>, and a defect <b>4024</b> corresponding to the vacuum port <b>4014</b>. Such defects can manifest as rainbow-colored interference patterns that having varying color uniformity creating visible outlines of the shapes shown in <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, or shadows where display brightness or color rendering or not consistent in such regions. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such variations can be caused at least in part by variations in the thermal environment in contact with the substrate <b>2420</b>A, even if such variations occur in relation to features contacting a side of the substrate (e.g., a back side) opposite the deposition side. As discussed above, the present inventors have recognized, among other things, that such mura can be suppressed or inhibited using various s uniform support techniques such as described below and elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">The use of uniform support techniques to suppress mura can also beneficially reduce other sources of degradation such as particulate contamination. Such degradation can be driven at least in part by incorporation of chemically or electrically/optically contaminants into the device structure, either within the bulk material of each film or at the interfaces between layers in the overall device stack. Over time chemically active contaminants can trigger a chemical reaction in the film that degrades the film material. Such chemical reactions can occur simply as a function of time, absent any other triggers, or can be triggered by ambient optical energy or injected electrical energy, for example. Electrically or optically active contaminants can create parasitic electrical or optical pathways for the electrical or optical energy introduced or generated in the device during operation. Such pathways can result in suppression of light output, or generation of incorrect light output (e.g., light output of the wrong spectrum.) The degradation or loss may manifest as failure of an individual OLED display elements, âblackâ spotting in portions of an array of OLED elements, visible artifacts or loss of electrical or optical efficiency, or unwanted deviation in color rendering accuracy, contrast, or brightness in various affected regions of the array of OLED elements.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, <figref>FIG. 14B</figref>, <figref>FIG. 14C</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 14D</figref> include illustrative examples depicting various regions of a substrate, and corresponding fixtures such as a chuck or end effector that can include one or more pressurized gas ports, vacuum ports, or vacuum regions. As mentioned elsewhere, a substrate <b>4000</b> can include a glass material or one or more other materials. Generally, for production of flat panel displays, the substrate <b>4000</b> can include either a single large display or two or more smaller displays that can be singulated from the substrate <b>4000</b>. In the illustrative example of <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, four display regions <b>4002</b>A, <b>4002</b>B, <b>4002</b>C, and <b>4002</b>D are shown. These can be referred to as âactiveâ regions or âemitting regions,â for example. Use of the term âactiveâ in this example does not somehow imply that such regions are actually optically emissive during processing, but instead refers to regions that can include devices configured to emit light or regions that otherwise form an emissive or transmissive portion of a display that is visible to an end user. Generally, visible defects in the regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D will be deemed unacceptable by end users, and accordingly various techniques can be used such as to enhance a visible uniformity of the regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D. Other variations in panel configuration of the substrate <b>4000</b> are possible. For example, a substrate <b>4000</b> can include a single display or array of OLED devices. In other examples, the substrate <b>4000</b> can be divided up into two, four, or eight regions, such as establishing corresponding perimeters for support, or such as having corresponding distributed porous media regions as mentioned in other examples herein. For other manufacturing examples in which other optical, electrical, or optoelectronic devices are on the substrate and being coated, the definition of âactiveâ can be adjusted to suitably encompass the regions corresponding to those devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">In an example where the substrate <b>4000</b> is supported by direct physical contact, support can be uniform within each of the display regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D and can be non-uniform within the region <b>4004</b>, extending around the periphery of the substrate <b>4000</b> as a whole and extends into the interior spaces between each of the display regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D. Such a region <b>4004</b> can be referred to as a âkeep outâ area, indicating that emitting or active elements of the display should be kept clear of such non-uniform support regions (or vice versa). For example, one or more âlift pinsâ can be located in an area as shown illustratively in <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, such as in a first region <b>2124</b>A, a second region <b>2124</b>B (e.g., in a location between display regions <b>4002</b>A and <b>4002</b>B), and an âNthâ region <b>2124</b>N, and after the substrate is lowered onto the chuck and such lift pins are therefore in the retracted position, the hole into which the lift pin is retracted will represent a gap region in the physical support of the substrate. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more of the locations in the array can instead include a vacuum port, such as to retain the substrate in place and hold it flat and in level physical contact with the chuck surface. For example, one or more lift pins can be used to raise or lower the substrate relative to a chuck before or after processing, and one or more vacuum ports can be used to retain the substrate during processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">As in other examples, the substrate can be supported by a cushion of gas. For example, in <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, the chuck may comprise a continuous array of small pressure apertures, or a continuous porous plate, providing a continuous flow of pressurized gas on which the substrate can float. Holes can still be provided in the chuck surface, such as <b>2124</b>A and <b>2124</b>B, for example, for lift pins (which when retracted sit below the chuck surface), but because the substrate floats above the chuck surface, the presence of mura or non-uniformity in the coated over such holes can be reduced or eliminated. In this way, even the interior regions in between regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D may be utilized as active regions, improve productivity and enabling the manufacture of a larger continuous active device. As in yet other examples, a combination of pressurized gas ports and vacuum ports can be used, such as shown in the illustrative example of <figref>FIGS. 14B through 14D</figref>. For example, in the top view of <figref>FIG. 14B</figref> or the side view of <figref>FIG. 14C</figref>, the substrate <b>4000</b> can be retained such as by one or more vacuum ports (e.g., circular ports, or slots, for example) such as in the regions <b>2124</b>A through <b>2124</b>N as shown in region <b>4004</b> of <figref>FIG. 14B</figref>. Such a region <b>4004</b> can again include a periphery of a substrate <b>4000</b>. In an illustrative example, physical contact between the substrate <b>4000</b> and any fixtures can generally be restricted to such a periphery region <b>4004</b> during certain processing operations, such as during one or more of a deposition operation (e.g., printing of a material on substrate <b>4000</b>), a holding operation, a material flow or dispersal operation, or a heat or ultraviolet treatment operation. Such operations can be included as at least a portion of a thin film encapsulation (TFE) process, where the substrate <b>4000</b> may be susceptible to creation of imperfections or visible defects</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">Such a region <b>4004</b> can, for example, extend inward from the edges of the substrate by 100 millimeters or 200 millimeters. Elsewhere, the substrate can be supported at least in part in the region <b>4002</b> using one or more pressurized gas ports <b>2106</b>A through <b>2106</b>N. Such a combination of vacuum ports and pressurized gas ports can avoid imparting undue stress on a large substrate <b>4000</b> because the substrate can be supported physically in the periphery region <b>4004</b>, and supported at least in part by pressurized gas in the central region <b>4002</b>. In this manner, it does not matter whether the substrate <b>4000</b> includes a single large display being fabricated, or several smaller displays. Therefore, a common fixture <b>2120</b> configuration can be used for a variety of different display configurations because such a fixture <b>2120</b> can restrict contact to the peripheral region <b>4004</b> of the substrate <b>4000</b> while supporting the substrate <b>4000</b> elsewhere (e.g., centrally) with pressurized gas. In an example where the fixture <b>2120</b> serves as a chuck, one or more of the regions <b>2124</b>A through <b>2124</b>N can include a lift pin instead of a vacuum port, or in addition to a vacuum port, such as to lift the substrate <b>4000</b> to allow clearance under the substrate for manipulation by a handler. In addition, a flow of pressurized gas can be modulated at one or more of the gas ports <b>2106</b>A through <b>2106</b>N, such as to assist in supporting or lifting the substrate for or during manipulation. In another approach, the combination of gas ports <b>2106</b>A through <b>2106</b>N can be used to assist in âfloatingâ the substrate for conveyance to other equipment, as mentioned in other examples.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 14D</figref> illustrates generally that the combination of pressurized gas and vacuum ports need not be restricted to a static chuck configuration as shown in <figref>FIG. 14B</figref>. For example, an end effector of a handler can include a combination of pressurized gas ports <b>2106</b>A through <b>2106</b>N, and vacuum ports in the regions <b>2124</b>A through <b>2124</b>N. The side view of <figref>FIG. 14C</figref> can also describe a side view of one of the âtinesâ of the forked end effector configuration shown in <figref>FIG. 14D</figref>. Such an end effector can be used to manipulate the substrate <b>4000</b> without physically contacting the substrate <b>4000</b> in regions other than the region <b>4004</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">Alternatively, or in addition to the examples above, a distributed vacuum region can be established such as aligned with one or more of the regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D or <b>4002</b> of <figref>FIGS. 14A through 14C</figref>, such as shown and discussed in the illustrative examples of <figref>FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, to assist in retaining and maintaining a planar configuration of the substrate <b>4000</b>. As discussed below, such a distributed vacuum region can include using a porous material such as a carbon or ceramic material, sintered glass, or some other material such as can include a pore size of less than 1 micrometer or even less than 0.5 micrometers in diameter. Such a small pore size can suppress formation of visible mura that would otherwise be present if large vacuum ports were used in the regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D, such as discussed in relation to <figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, above, and elsewhere herein. In another example, such as mentioned in relation to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a gas cushion established by a pressurized gas can be used at least in part to support the substrate such as within the display regions <b>4002</b>A through <b>4002</b>D, such as to avoid formation of visible defects during a holding, a material flow or dispersal operation or an ultraviolet treatment operation, or during other production processes. Such an example is illustrated generally in <figref>FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 15A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 15B</figref> illustrate generally illustrative examples of a chuck configuration that can include a combination of one or more mechanical support pins and one or more vacuum regions. Similar to the example of <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, and other examples discussed elsewhere herein, a chuck <b>2220</b> can include one or more mechanical support pins (e.g., including an extended lift pin <b>2224</b>A). The mechanical support pins can include an extended configuration and a retracted configuration, such as actuated pneumatically, hydraulically, or electrically. As discussed in relation to <figref>FIG. 14A</figref> and elsewhere, the mechanical support pins can be located in regions other than the active areas of one or more displays, in the case that substrate is supported via physical contact (whereas in contrast, one of the benefits of using a floatation support mechanism is the ability to achieve mura free coatings even over lift pin holes). In the example of <figref>FIG. 15A</figref>, the mechanical support pins, including the extended lift pin <b>2224</b>A, can illustrate generally an extended configuration, such as displacing a substrate <b>4000</b> vertically. Such a configuration can allow a gap under the substrate <b>4000</b>, such as to accommodate manipulation of the substrate by one or more end effectors, such as forked end effector <b>1420</b>. The end effector <b>1420</b> can include grooves, slots, other features, or can otherwise be sized and shaped to avoid interference with one or more of the mechanical support pins when the pins are in the extended configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">After the substrate <b>4000</b> is manipulated into place, the one or more mechanical support pins can be retracted, such as to a location flush or below flush with a surface of the chuck <b>2220</b>, such as shown in <figref>FIG. 15B</figref>, including a retracted lift pin <b>2224</b>B. In some examples, the substrate <b>4000</b> can be further processed without further retention or anchoring. However, during certain operations, such as during one or more of deposition, a holding operation, a material flow/dispersing operation, or other treatment (e.g., ultraviolet treatment) of an organic encapsulation layer (or other layers) on the substrate <b>4000</b>, one or more of vacuum ports or distributed vacuum regions can be used, such as to assist in maintaining the substrate in a planar configuration. For example, one or more distributed (e.g., porous) vacuum regions can be included as a portion of the chuck <b>2220</b>, such as including regions <b>2206</b>A, <b>2206</b>B, <b>2206</b>C, and <b>2206</b>D. Unlike larger vacuum ports, or mechanical support pins, such regions <b>2206</b>A through <b>2206</b>D can be located directly below portions of the substrate <b>4000</b> where âactiveâ or âemittingâ regions are being fabricated. Such distributed vacuum regions can reduce or suppress formation of visible defects in one or more layers being deposited or otherwise formed on the substrate <b>4000</b>, because such distributed vacuum regions avoid the abrupt changes in thermal characteristics (e.g., thermal conductivity) presented by other types of structures, such as discussed above in relation to <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the use of the chuck structures shown herein, such as a distributed vacuum region provided by a porous medium, can also enhance uniformity of a coating or film layer deposited on the substrate <b>4000</b> such as providing a uniform electrostatic coupling or field between the substrate <b>4000</b> and the porous regions <b>2206</b>A, <b>2206</b>B, <b>2206</b>C, and <b>2206</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">As mentioned above, in one approach mechanical features such as lift pins or vacuum ports can be confined to a region peripheral to active or emitting areas of individual displays included in the substrate <b>4006</b>A. However, such an approach can have disadvantages. For example, if processing equipment is to be used for multiple substrate shapes, sizes, and display configurations, tool change-outs of the chuck <b>2420</b>A might be necessary depending on an arrangement of âkeep outâ regions. <figref>FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, by contrast with <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, illustrate generally examples of a chuck <b>2420</b>B configuration that includes ports configured to establish a pressurized gas cushion to support a substrate <b>4006</b>B in <figref>FIG. 16A</figref>, such as during one or more of a deposition, a holding operation, a material dispersing or flowing operation, or cure process, and a corresponding uniformity in the resulting substrate in <figref>FIG. 16B</figref>. In this approach, because the substrate <b>4006</b>B is not required to contact thermally-non-uniform features of the chuck <b>2420</b>B during various processes, a substrate <b>4006</b>B as shown in <figref>FIG. 16B</figref> can avoid the large and highly-visible mura produced by the features shown <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>. Different port configurations can be used, such as having a first port density in the region <b>2406</b>A, and a second port density in the region <b>2406</b>B. As mentioned in other examples herein, a fly height, âhâ can be established such as by using a combination of vacuum and pressurized gas ports, such as in the arrays of the regions <b>2406</b>A and <b>2406</b>B. For example, in each row of ports, the ports can alternate between being assigned as a vacuum port or a pressurized gas port. In this manner, precise control of the height, h, can be established and the substrate <b>4006</b>B can be stabilized in the z-dimension with respect to the chuck surface. As in other examples herein, a combination of mechanical anchoring and pressurized gas can also be used. For example, lateral motion of the substrate <b>4006</b>B (e.g., in a direction parallel a surface of the chuck) can be limited, such as by using one or more lateral stops or bumpers.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 16C and 16D</figref>, by contrast with <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, illustrate generally examples of a chuck configuration that includes a porous medium <b>1906</b>, such as to establish a distributed vacuum (in <figref>FIG. 16C</figref>) or distributed pressure during one or more of a deposition, a holding operation, a material dispersing or flowing operation, or curing process, such as providing uniformity in the resulting substrate as shown in <figref>FIG. 16E</figref>. As mentioned in relation to other examples herein, a porous medium <b>1906</b> âplateâ such as coupled to or included as a portion of a chuck <b>2420</b>C can provide a âdistributedâ vacuum to securely hold the substrate <b>4006</b>C during processing, or a pressurized gas cushion to support the substrate <b>4006</b>C, such as without using large apertures as shown in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, and providing a substrate <b>4006</b>C as shown in <figref>FIG. 16E</figref> having reduced or minimize the formation of mura or other visible defects. As mentioned in relation to other examples herein, a porous medium <b>1906</b> âplateâ such as coupled to or included as portion of a chuck <b>2420</b>C can provide a âdistributedâ pressure to uniformly float the substrate <b>4006</b>C during processing, such as without using individual apertures as shown in <figref>FIG. 16A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">A porous medium <b>1906</b> as mentioned in relation to <figref>FIG. 15A</figref>, <b>16</b>C, <b>16</b>D, or similar distributed pressure or vacuum regions as mentioned elsewhere herein, can be obtained such as from Nano TEM Co., Ltd. (Niigata, Japan), such as having physical dimensions specified to occupy an entirety of the substrate <b>4006</b>C, or specified regions of the substrate such as display regions or regions outside display regions. Such a porous medium can include a pore size specified to provide a desired vacuum holding force over a specified area, while reducing or eliminating mura or other visible defect formation such as during holding, curing, or material dispersal or flowing operations. As mentioned above, without being bound by theory it is believed that use of a porous medium can enhance uniformity of a coating or film layer on the substrate <b>4006</b>C, such as by reducing or minimizing mura or other visible defects associated with non-uniform thermal profile or electrostatic field profiled across the surface of the substrate, or on a surface opposite the coating or film layer. Alternatively, a porous medium can be coupled to a pneumatic supply, such as to provide a gas cushion, or various porous media regions can be coupled to a pneumatic supply and a vacuum supply, respectively, to provide a gas cushion having a controlled âfly height,â such as in one or more specified zones as mentioned in <figref>FIG. 19C</figref>. When such porous medium is utilized to provide a distributed vacuum to hold down the substrate on the chuck surface, the presence of holes for lift pins can still provide non-uniformity and can therefore include placement of such holes so as to avoid impacting the active regions of the substrate. When such porous medium is used to provide a distributed pressure supply to float the substrate above the chuck surface, the presence of holes for lift pins (e.g., for retracted lift pins) need not cause non-uniformity, therefore making a greater portion of the substrate area available for the active regions.</p>

For example, each module can include one or more gas purification loops, fan filter units, or temperature controllers. A controlled environment in a respective module can be contiguous (e.g., fluidically coupled) to an adjacent module, or the modules can include controlled environments that can be isolated from one another, such as for enhanced control of gas purity, temperature, particulate levels, or maintenance of a particular module.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 17</figref> illustrates generally a schematic representation of a gas purification scheme that can be used in relation to portions or entireties of one or more other examples described herein, such as to establish or maintain an controlled environment in an enclosure housing fabrication equipment used in manufacturing a light emitting device (e.g., an OLED device). For example, a gas enclosure system <b>502</b> can include a gas enclosure assembly <b>100</b> (e.g., an enclosure having a controlled environment), a gas purification loop <b>130</b> in fluid communication with the gas enclosure assembly <b>100</b>, and a thermal regulation system <b>140</b> (e.g., as can be referred to as a temperature controller in other examples herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">The system <b>502</b> can include a pressurized gas recirculation system <b>300</b>, which can supply gas for operating various devices, such as a substrate flotation table or other pressurized-gas devices, such as for an OLED printing system. The pressurized gas recirculation system <b>300</b> can include or use a compressor, a blower, or both. Additionally, the gas enclosure system <b>502</b> can have a circulation and filtration system internal to gas enclosure system <b>502</b> (e.g., one or more fan filter units (FFUs) as described in other examples herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">One or more ducts or baffles can separate non-reactive gas circulated through the gas purification loop <b>130</b> from the non-reactive gas that is otherwise filtered and circulated internally for various embodiments of a gas enclosure assembly. For example, the gas purification loop <b>130</b> can include an outlet line <b>131</b> from the gas enclosure assembly <b>100</b>. A solvent removal component <b>132</b> can be provided, for solvent abatement, and gas to be purified can be routed from the solvent removal component <b>132</b> to a gas purification system <b>134</b>. Gas purified of solvent and other reactive gas species, such as one or more of ozone, oxygen, and water vapor, can be circulated back to the gas enclosure assembly <b>100</b>, such as through an inlet line <b>133</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">The gas purification loop <b>130</b> can include appropriate conduits and connections such as to interface with monitoring or control devices. For example, ozone, oxygen, water vapor, or solvent vapor sensors can be included. A gas circulating unit, such as a fan, blower, or other arrangement, can be separately provided or integrated, for example, in gas purification system <b>134</b>, such as to circulate gas through the gas purification loop <b>130</b>. In the illustration of <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, the solvent removal component <b>132</b> and gas purification system <b>134</b> are shown as separate units.

In an example, the solvent removal component <b>132</b> can include a solvent trapping system based on adsorbing solvent vapor from a gas passing through the solvent removal component <b>132</b>. For example, a bed or beds of a sorbent, such as activated charcoal, molecular sieves, or the like, can effectively remove a wide variety of organic solvent vapors. In another example, a cold trap technology can be used to remove solvent vapors as a portion of the solvent removal component <b>132</b>. Sensors, such as ozone, oxygen, water vapor and solvent vapor sensors, can be used to monitor the removal of such species from gas continuously circulating through a gas enclosure system, such as gas enclosure system <b>502</b>. For example, information obtained from such sensors or other devices can indicate when sorbent, such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, or the like, have reached capacity or have otherwise become less effective, so that the bed or beds of sorbent can be regenerated or replaced, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">Regeneration of a molecular sieve can involve heating the molecular sieve, contacting the molecular sieve with a forming gas, a combination thereof, or the like. For example, molecular sieves configured to trap various species, including ozone, oxygen, water vapor, or solvents, can be regenerated by heating and exposure to a forming gas. In an illustrative example, such a forming gas can include hydrogen, for example, a forming gas comprising about 96% nitrogen and about 4% hydrogen, with said percentages being by volume or by weight. Physical regeneration of activated charcoal can be done using a procedure of heating under a controlled environment.</p>

The gas purification system <b>134</b> can be used to purify one or more gases in gas enclosure system <b>502</b>, for example, to purify the entire gas atmosphere within a gas enclosure assembly. As mention above, in order to circulate gas through gas purification loop <b>130</b>, the gas purification system <b>134</b> can have a gas circulating unit, such as a fan or blower, for example. A gas purification system can be selected or configured depending on the volume of the enclosure, which can define a volumetric flow rate for moving a non-reactive gas through a gas purification system. In an illustrative example, a gas enclosure system having a gas enclosure assembly can include a volume of about 4 cubic meters and a gas purification system that can move about 84 cubic meters per hour can be used. In another illustrative example, a gas enclosure system having a gas enclosure assembly can include a volume of about 10 cubic meters and a gas purification system that can move about 155 cubic meters per hour can be used. In yet another illustrative example, a gas enclosure assembly having a volume of between about 52 to about 114 cubic meters, more than one gas purification system can be used.</p>

For example, the gas purification system <b>134</b> can comprise one or more molecular sieves, such as at least a first molecular sieve and a second molecular sieve, such that, when one of the molecular sieves becomes saturated with impurities, or otherwise is deemed not to be operating efficiently enough, the system can switch to the other molecular sieve while regenerating the saturated or non-efficient molecular sieve. A control unit can be provided for determining the operational efficiency of each molecular sieve, for switching between operation of different molecular sieves, for regenerating one or more molecular sieves, or for a combination thereof. As previously mentioned, molecular sieves can be regenerated and reused.</p>

An at least one fluid chiller <b>142</b> can be provided for cooling the gas atmosphere within gas enclosure system <b>502</b>. For example, the fluid chiller <b>142</b> can deliver cooled fluid to heat exchangers within the enclosure, where gas can be passed over a filtration system internal the enclosure. At least one fluid chiller can also be provided with gas enclosure system <b>502</b> to cool heat evolving from an apparatus enclosed within gas enclosure system <b>502</b>. In an illustrative example, a fluid chiller can also be provided for gas enclosure system <b>502</b> to cool heat evolving from an OLED printing system. The thermal regulation system <b>140</b> can include heat-exchange or Peltier devices and can have various cooling capacities.

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">Various examples described herein include enclosed modules that can be environmentally-controlled. Enclosure assemblies and corresponding support equipment can be referred to as a âgas enclosure systemâ and such enclosure assemblies can be constructed in a contoured fashion that reduces or minimizes an internal volume of a gas enclosure assembly, and at the same time provides a working volume for accommodating various footprints of OLED fabrication system components, such as the deposition (e.g., printing), holding, loading, or treatment modules described herein. For example, a contoured gas enclosure assembly according to the present teachings can have a gas enclosure volume of between about 6 m<sup>3 </sup>to about 95 m<sup>3 </sup>for various examples of a gas enclosure assembly of the present teachings covering, for example, substrate sizes from Gen 3.5 to Gen 10. Various examples of a contoured gas enclosure assembly according to the present teachings can have a gas enclosure volume of, for example, but not limited by, of between about 15 m<sup>3 </sup>to about 30 m<sup>3</sup>, which might be useful for OLED printing of, for example, Gen 5.5 to Gen 8.5 substrate sizes or other substrate sizes. Various examples of an auxiliary enclosure can be constructed as a section of gas enclosure assembly and readily integrated with gas circulation and filtration, as well as purification components to form a gas enclosure system that can sustain a controlled, substantially low-particle environment for processes requiring such an environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0170">As shown in <figref>FIG. 18A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, various examples of a gas enclosure system can include a pressurized non-reactive gas recirculation system. Various examples of a pressurized gas recirculation loop can utilize a compressor, a blower and combinations thereof. According to the present teachings, several engineering challenges were addressed in order to provide for various examples of a pressurized gas recirculation system in a gas enclosure system. First, under typical operation of a gas enclosure system without a pressurized non-reactive gas recirculation system, a gas enclosure system can be maintained at a slightly positive internal pressure (e.g., above atmospheric pressure) relative to an external pressure in order to safeguard against outside gas or air from entering the interior should any leaks develop in a gas enclosure system. For example, under typical operation, for various examples of a gas enclosure system of the present teachings, the interior of a gas enclosure system can be maintained at a pressure relative to the surrounding atmosphere external to the enclosure system, for example, of at least 2 mbarg, for example, at a pressure of at least 4 mbarg, at a pressure of at least 6 mbarg, at a pressure of at least 8 mbarg, or at a higher pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0171">Maintaining a pressurized gas recirculation system within a gas enclosure system can be challenging, as it presents a dynamic and ongoing balancing act regarding maintaining a slight positive internal pressure of a gas enclosure system, while at the same time continuously introducing pressurized gas into a gas enclosure system. Further, variable demand of various devices and apparatuses can create an irregular pressure profile for various gas enclosure assemblies and systems of the present teachings.

In the case of holding for the purpose of evolving the substrate, for example, the substrate can be held so as to allow for a liquid to settle or flow. A temperature of the substrate during such evolution can be controlled through the controlled application of temperature controlled gas flow across the substrate surface, such as laminar flow, which can be provided to flow across the plane of the substrate, as indicated in <figref>FIG. 21B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">In general, the holding module temperature need not be the same as the temperature of the environment in or surrounding the other system modules, for example, the printing module or the substrate handling module. In another example, the substrate can rest on a cushion of temperature-controlled gas (similar to other examples described herein, such as where the substrate is supported using a floating cushion of gas for one or more of printing, holding, or curing operations such a curing operation including ultraviolet treatment).</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">In the case of drying a substrate in a processing module <b>1200</b>, the controlled environment can provide for continuous removal of evaporated vapors via a vapor trap or gas recirculation and purification system, and the dying process can be further controlled through the controlled application of gas flow across the substrate surface, such as laminar flow, which can be provided to flow across the plane of the substrate, as indicated in <figref>FIG. 21B</figref>. In an example, the processing module <b>1200</b> includes a drying module, and other portions of a system can be configured to at least partially evacuate or purge an atmosphere within the drying module to facilitate a drying operation, such as after a printing operation.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 22A</figref> illustrates generally a portion of a system, such as including a transfer module coupled to other chambers or modules, that can be used in manufacturing an electronic device (e.g., an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device). <figref>FIG. 22B</figref> illustrates generally a handler configuration that can be used, such as for manipulating a substrate within the module shown in <figref>FIG. 12A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">As in the example of <figref>FIG. 20A</figref>, the transfer module <b>1400</b>B can include one or more fan filter units (FFUs), such as <b>1500</b>A through <b>1500</b>N (e.g., <b>14</b> FFUs). <figref>FIG. 22B</figref> illustrates generally a handler <b>2732</b> configuration that can be used, such as for manipulating a substrate <b>4000</b> within the module <b>1400</b>B shown in <figref>FIG. 21A</figref>. By contrast with the handler <b>1410</b>A of the transfer module <b>1400</b>A of <figref>FIG. 21A</figref>, the hander <b>1410</b>B of <figref>FIG. 22B</figref> illustrates generally that a track <b>2734</b> or rail configuration can be used, such as to provide linear translation of the handler <b>2732</b> in an axis. In this manner, a broad range of other chambers or modules can be coupled to the transfer module <b>1400</b>B, such as in a clustered configuration, without requiring that each other module or chamber be coupled in a manner radiating out from a single point. As in the example of <figref>FIG. 20C</figref>, one or more ducts can be located in portions of the transfer module <b>1400</b>B in a region outside the race-track shaped range of motion of the handler <b>1410</b>B. For example, such locations can be used to provide return ducts to bring a gas (e.g., nitrogen) from a lower portion of the transfer module <b>1400</b>B upwards to a plenum above the FFU array as shown in other examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0196">An end effector of the handlers shown in <figref>FIG. 20C</figref> or <b>22</b>B can include a uniform substrate support system similar to the various examples of chuck and end effector configurations described elsewhere herein, such as to facilitate formation of a mura-free organic encapsulation layer.</p>
