      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a miniature garden and, more particularly, to a decorative miniature garden plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A miniature garden is a small garden with accessories arranged in pots or containers. When a miniature garden is created, soil and stones are needed in order to make a base for the garden. Therefore, current miniature gardens are messy and the pot becomes heavy. Also, to create a well structured miniature garden, the maker must have talent, patience, and an extended period of time. Most individuals do not have the ability or the time to prepare the miniature garden.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">As can be seen, there is a need for a quick and easy way to create a miniature garden.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one aspect of the present invention, a miniature garden apparatus comprises: a plate comprising an upper surface, a lower surface, and an outer perimeter forming an edge, wherein at least one opening is formed through the plate and is sized to receive a plant within; and at least one decoration formed on the upper surface of the plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another aspect of the present invention, a miniature garden kit comprises: a plate comprising an upper surface, a lower surface, and an outer perimeter forming an edge, wherein at least one opening is formed through the plate; a container comprising a bottom, and a sidewall having an inner surface and an outer surface, wherein the plate is sized it fit within the container so that the edge of the plate rests against the inner surface, and a gap is formed between the plate and the bottom; and at least one pot comprising a bottom and a sidewall comprising an upper rim, wherein the pot is sized to fit within the gap underneath the opening of the plate.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention, since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention includes a plate that is used with plants in a pot in order to create a decorative miniature garden. The decorative plate of the present invention fits into standard pots, and eliminates the need for soil and stones. The plates include openings in which plants may fit through. The plate may be made of various materials, such as but not limited to, ceramic, which includes glazing and firing in a kiln. A square, rectangular, round or oval, etc. shape is created with one or more holes for plants or flowers. No assembly is required except for the addition of plants or flowers. The result is a light weight, attractive and clean miniature garden.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Different plate designs may be created for different seasons and personal celebrations. For example, the plates may include a Christmas theme, a wedding theme, a golf theme, a Halloween theme, a Thanksgiving theme, an Easter theme and the like. Additionally, the present invention may be used as a table centerpiece with floral bouquets. The hole in the plate offers the flexibility of adding lighting. An instant fairy garden with a Christmas scene may be enhanced by lighting.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the present invention includes a decorative miniature garden apparatus and kit <b>10</b>. The decorative miniature garden <b>10</b> of the present invention may at least include a plate <b>14</b> having an upper surface, a lower surface, and an outer perimeter forming an edge. An opening <b>20</b> is formed through the plate <b>14</b> and is sized to receive a plant <b>46</b> within. The upper surface of the plate <b>14</b> may include at least one decoration. A plant <b>46</b> may be placed within a container <b>12</b> and the plate <b>14</b> may be placed within the container <b>12</b> so that the plant <b>46</b> is protruding through the opening <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The container <b>12</b> of the present invention includes a bottom, and a sidewall having an inner surface and an outer surface. The plate <b>14</b> is sized to fit within the container <b>12</b> so that the edge of the plate <b>14</b> rests against the inner surface, and a gap is formed between the plate <b>14</b> and the bottom. The container <b>12</b> may be circular, rectangular or square shaped. The plate <b>14</b> may correspond with the container, and thereby be circular, rectangular or square shaped to fit properly within the container <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The present invention may further include a plant pot <b>22</b>. The plant pot <b>22</b> may be sized to fit within the opening of the plate <b>14</b>. Further, the plant pot is disposed in between the plate <b>14</b> and the bottom of the container <b>12</b> so that the plant <b>46</b> may protrude from the opening. The pot <b>22</b> includes a bottom and a sidewall forming an upper rim. In certain embodiments, the upper rim of the pot <b>22</b> may fit within the opening of the plate <b>14</b>. The present invention may further include a plurality of pots <b>22</b>. In such embodiments, the plate <b>14</b> may include a plurality of openings to receive the plants <b>46</b> within each of the pots <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The at least one decoration <b>16</b> of the present invention may include a plurality of decorations <b>16</b> formed on the upper surface of the plate <b>14</b>. For example, the decorations <b>16</b> may include but is not limited to, a replication of at least one of soil, water, stones, sidewalks, pathways, plants, mushrooms, and sand. The decorations <b>16</b> may be painted or sculpted into the upper surface. The present invention may further include decorative accessories <b>18</b>. For example, when the plate <b>14</b> mimics a golf course scene, the present invention may include miniature replica golf carts and golf clubs. Further, for Christmas settings, the decorative accessories <b>18</b> may include sleighs, and reindeer. Each of the plates <b>14</b> may be made with decorations <b>16</b> based on certain themes and optionally corresponding accessories <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The present invention may come in a kit <b>10</b>. For example, the kit <b>10</b> may include the plate <b>14</b> with decorations <b>16</b>, the corresponding container <b>12</b>, and a plant pot <b>22</b> sized to fit between the plate <b>14</b> and the container bottom. Further, if there is more than one opening <b>22</b> through the plate <b>14</b>, the kit <b>10</b> may come with more than one plant pot <b>22</b>. Further, in alternate embodiments, the kit <b>10</b> may include different accessories <b>18</b> to place on the plate <b>14</b> after the present invention has been put together.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">A method of assembling the present invention may include the following. A user may fill the pot <b>22</b> with dirt and a plant <b>46</b>. The pot <b>22</b> and plant <b>46</b> may be placed within the container <b>12</b>, resting on the bottom of the container <b>12</b>. The plate <b>14</b> may be placed within the container <b>12</b> so that the opening <b>22</b> aligns with the pot <b>22</b> and plant <b>46</b>. The accessories <b>18</b> may be placed or attached to the plate <b>14</b> and the miniature garden is complete.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
