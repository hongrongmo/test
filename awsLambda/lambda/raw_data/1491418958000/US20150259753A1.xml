      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to compositions and methods for identifying soybean plants that are tolerant, have improved tolerance or are susceptible to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection (the causative agent of sudden death syndrome), where the methods use molecular genetic markers to identify, select and/or construct disease-tolerant plants. The invention also relates to soybean plants that display tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection that are generated by the methods of the invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Soybean, a legume, has become the world's primary source of seed oil and seed protein. In addition, its utilization is being expanded to the industrial, manufacturing and pharmaceutical sectors. Soybean productivity is a vital agricultural and economic consideration. Unfortunately, soybean is host to one of the widest ranges of infectious pathogens of all crops. More than a hundred different pathogens are known to affect soybean plants, some of which pose significant economic threats. Improving soybean disease tolerance to these many pathogens is crucial to preventing yield losses.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="2">
        <i>Fusarium Solani </i>f. sp <i>Glycines </i>and Sudden Death Syndrome</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">One of the most destructive fungal diseases of soybean [<i>Glycine max </i>(L.) Merr.] is sudden death syndrome (SDS). See, Wrather et al. (1996) âSoybean Disease loss estimates for the top ten producing countries during 1994<i>,â Plant Dis. </i>81:107-110, and Wrather et al. (1995) âSoybean disease loss estimates for southern United States, 1974 to 1994<i>,â Plant Dis. </i>79:1076-1079. This disease is caused by a pathogenic fungal infection of <i>Fusarium solani </i>(e.g., <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>glycines </i>and/or <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>phaseoli</i>, two closely related, or possibly congenic <i>Fusarium solani </i>species). This pathogen enters the roots and crowns of the plant and grows through the plant's vascular system, eventually causing foliar scorch, sudden wilting and death of the plant during the growing season. See, Gibson (1994) âSoybean varietal response to sudden death syndrome,â pp 20-40 in D. Wilkinson (ed.) Proc. Twenty-Fourth Soybean Seed Res. Conf. Chicago Ill. for Am Seed Trade Assoc., Washington D.C.; and Rupe et al. (1991) <i>Plant Dis. </i>75:47-50).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A common method of protecting soybean plants from SDS uses the selection of SDS tolerant plants, such as those found in the cultivars âForrestâ (Hartwig and Epps (1973) âRegistration of Forrest Soybeanâ <i>Crop Sci. </i>13:287) âPyramidâ (Myers et al. (1988) <i>Crop Sci </i>28:375-376) and âEssex.â During marker assisted selection (MAS), plant breeders select for specific tolerance loci in an attempt to produce plants that are tolerant to infection, or that limit the extent of the infection. For example, a Forrest allele of the genomic region on linkage group G and an Essex allele of a portion of the genomic region on linkage group C2 are each associated with decreased disease index measurements for SDS (Nijiti et al. (1998) âResistance to Soybean Sudden Death Syndrome and Root Colonization by <i>Fusarium solani </i>f. sp. <i>glycine </i>in Near Isogenic Lines.â <i>Crop Sci. </i>38:472-477; Chang et al. (1996) âtwo additional loci underlying durable field resistance to sudden death syndrome (SDS)â <i>Crop Sci </i>36:1684-1688. Linkage groups A2, B and G have been identified as underlying resistance traits in Pyramid. Field resistance to SDS is incomplete, with, for example, Forrest (but not Essex) being resistant to colonization of plant taproot by <i>F. solani</i>, while Essex is more resistant to development of foliar SDS symptoms. See also, Nijiti et al. (1997) âRate reducing resistance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>phaseoli </i>underlies field resistance to soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS) <i>Crop Sci. </i>37:132-138 and Gibson et al. (1994) supra.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A common method of protecting soybean plants from <i>Fusarium solani </i>SDS utilizes the selection of specific resistance genes. Plant breeders manipulate specific resistance genes in an attempt to produce plants that are resistant to infection, or limit the extent of the infection. Unfortunately, as breeders evolve increasingly resistant strains, the host range of the pathogen similarly evolves to adapt to the changing genetic constitution of the host. Thus, resistant soybean strains produced by plant breeders are effective only for a finite period and eventually fail.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">An alternative approach is to identify plants that show tolerance to a particular pathogen. Tolerance can be described as the relative ability of a plant to survive infection without showing severe symptoms such as death, stunting, loss of vigor or yield loss. Tolerance includes any mechanism other than whole-plant immunity or resistance that reduces the expression of symptoms indicative of infection. Infected plants that exhibit tolerance will yield nearly as well as uninfected plants and also prevent the evolution of host-adapted pathogenic <i>Fusarium solani </i>races capable of reducing soybean yield in previously resistant plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The development of molecular genetic markers has facilitated mapping and selection of agriculturally important traits in soybean. Markers tightly linked to disease tolerance genes are an asset in the rapid identification of tolerant soybean lines on the basis of genotype by the use of marker assisted selection (MAS). Introgressing disease tolerance genes into a desired cultivar would also be facilitated by using suitable DNA markers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">Molecular Markers and Marker Assisted Selection</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A genetic map is a graphical representation of a genome (or a portion of a genome such as a single chromosome) where the distances between landmarks on the chromosome are measured by the recombination frequencies between the landmarks. A genetic landmark can be any of a variety of known polymorphic markers, for example but not limited to, molecular markers such as SSR markers, RFLP markers, or SNP markers. Furthermore, SSR markers can be derived from genomic or expressed nucleic acids (e.g., ESTs). The nature of these physical landmarks and the methods used to detect them vary, but all of these markers are physically distinguishable from each other (as well as from the plurality of alleles of any one particular marker) on the basis of polynucleotide length and/or sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Although specific DNA sequences which encode proteins are generally well-conserved across a species, other regions of DNA (typically non-coding) tend to accumulate polymorphism, and therefore, can be variable between individuals of the same species. Such regions provide the basis for numerous molecular genetic markers. In general, any differentially inherited polymorphic trait (including nucleic acid polymorphism) that segregates among progeny is a potential marker. The genomic variability can be of any origin, for example, insertions, deletions, duplications, repetitive elements, point mutations, recombination events, or the presence and sequence of transposable elements. A large number of soybean molecular markers are known in the art, and are published or available from various sources, such as the SOYBASE internet resource. Similarly, numerous methods for detecting molecular markers are also well-established.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The primary motivation for developing molecular marker technologies from the point of view of plant breeders has been the possibility to increase breeding efficiency through marker assisted selection (MAS). A molecular marker allele that demonstrates linkage disequilibrium with a desired phenotypic trait (e.g., a quantitative trait locus, or QTL, such as resistance to a particular disease) provides a useful tool for the selection of a desired trait in a plant population. The key components to the implementation of this approach are: (i) the creation of a dense genetic map of molecular markers, (ii) the detection of QTL based on statistical associations between marker and phenotypic variability, (iii) the definition of a set of desirable marker alleles based on the results of the QTL analysis, and (iv) the use and/or extrapolation of this information to the current set of breeding germplasm to enable marker-based selection decisions to be made.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The availability of integrated linkage maps of the soybean genome containing increasing densities of public soybean markers has facilitated soybean genetic mapping and MAS. See, e.g., Cregan et al. (1999) âAn Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean Genomeâ <i>Crop Sci. </i>39:1464-1490; Song et al., âA New Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean,â Theor. Appl. Genet., 109:122-128 (2004); Diwan and Cregan (1997) âAutomated sizing of fluorescent-labeled simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to assay genetic variation in Soybean,â <i>Theor. Appl. Genet., </i>95:220-225; the Soybase resources on the world wide web at soybase.org, including the Shoemaker Lab Home Page and other resources that can be accessed through Soybase; and see the Soybean Genomics and Improvements Laboratory (SGIL) on the world wide web, and see especially the Cregan Lab web site.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Two types of markers are frequently used in marker assisted selection protocols, namely simple sequence repeat (SSR, also known as microsatellite) markers, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The term SSR refers generally to any type of molecular heterogeneity that results in length variability, and most typically is a short (up to several hundred base pairs) segment of DNA that consists of multiple tandem repeats of a two or three base-pair sequence. These repeated sequences result in highly polymorphic DNA regions of variable length due to poor replication fidelity, e.g., caused by polymerase slippage. SSRs appear to be randomly dispersed through the genome and are generally flanked by conserved regions. SSR markers can also be derived from RNA sequences (in the form of a cDNA, a partial cDNA or an EST) as well as genomic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The characteristics of SSR heterogeneity make them well suited for use as molecular genetic markers; namely, SSR genomic variability is inherited, is multiallelic, codominant and is reproducibly detectable. The proliferation of increasingly sophisticated amplification-based detection techniques (e.g., PCR-based) provides a variety of sensitive methods for the detection of nucleotide sequence heterogeneity. Primers (or other types of probes) are designed to hybridize to conserved regions that flank the SSR domain, resulting in the amplification of the variable SSR region. The different sized amplicons generated from an SSR region have characteristic and reproducible sizes. The different sized SSR amplicons observed from two homologous chromosomes in an individual, or from different individuals in the plant population are generally termed âmarker alleles.â As long as there exists at least two SSR alleles that produce PCR products with at least two different sizes, the SSRs can be employed as a marker.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Soybean markers that rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are also well known in the art. Various techniques have been developed for the detection of SNPs, including allele specific hybridization (ASH; see, e.g., Coryell et al., (1999) âAllele specific hybridization markers for soybean,â <i>Theor. Appl. Genet., </i>98:690-696). Additional types of molecular markers are also widely used, including but not limited to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and SSR markers derived from EST sequences, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isozyme markers. A wide range of protocols are known to one of skill in the art for detecting this variability, and these protocols are frequently specific for the type of polymorphism they are designed to detect. For example, PCR amplification, single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and self-sustained sequence replication (3SR; see Chan and Fox, âNASBA and other transcription-based amplification methods for research and diagnostic microbiology,â Reviews in Medical Microbiology 10:185-196 (1999)).</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Linkage of one molecular marker to another molecular marker is measured as a recombination frequency. In general, the closer two loci (e.g., two SSR markers) are on the genetic map, the closer they lie to each other on the physical map. A relative genetic distance (determined by crossing over frequencies, measured in centimorgans; cM) is generally proportional to the physical distance (measured in base pairs, e.g., kilobase pairs [kb] or megabasepairs [Mbp]) that two linked loci are separated from each other on a chromosome. A lack of precise proportionality between cM and physical distance can result from variation in recombination frequencies for different chromosomal regions, e.g., some chromosomal regions are recombinational âhot spots,â while others regions do not show any recombination, or only demonstrate rare recombination events. In general, the closer one marker is to another marker, whether measured in terms of recombination or physical distance, the more strongly they are linked. In some aspects, the closer a molecular marker is to a gene that encodes a polypeptide that imparts a particular phenotype (disease tolerance), whether measured in terms of recombination or physical distance, the better that marker serves to tag the desired phenotypic trait.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Genetic mapping variability can also be observed between different populations of the same crop species, including soybean. In spite of this variability in the genetic map that may occur between populations, genetic map and marker information derived from one population generally remains useful across multiple populations in identification of plants with desired traits, counter-selection of plants with undesirable traits and in guiding MAS.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">QTL Mapping</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">It is the goal of the plant breeder to select plants and enrich the plant population for individuals that have desired traits, for example, pathogen tolerance, leading ultimately to increased agricultural productivity. It has been recognized for quite some time that specific chromosomal loci (or intervals) can be mapped in an organism's genome that correlate with particular quantitative phenotypes. Such loci are termed quantitative trait loci, or QTL. The plant breeder can advantageously use molecular markers to identify desired individuals by identifying marker alleles that show a statistically significant probability of co-segregation with a desired phenotype (e.g., pathogenic infection tolerance), manifested as linkage disequilibrium. By identifying a molecular marker or clusters of molecular markers that co-segregate with a quantitative trait, the breeder is thus identifying a QTL. By identifying and selecting a marker allele (or desired alleles from multiple markers) that associates with the desired phenotype, the plant breeder is able to rapidly select a desired phenotype by selecting for the proper molecular marker allele (a process called marker-assisted selection, or MAS). The more molecular markers that are placed on the genetic map, the more potentially useful that map becomes for conducting MAS.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Multiple experimental paradigms have been developed to identify and analyze QTL (see, e.g., Jansen (1996) Trends Plant Sci 1:89). The majority of published reports on QTL mapping in crop species have been based on the use of the bi-parental cross (Lynch and Walsh (1997) <i>Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits</i>, Sinauer Associates, Sunderland). Typically, these paradigms involve crossing one or more parental pairs, which can be, for example, a single pair derived from two inbred strains, or multiple related or unrelated parents of different inbred strains or lines, which each exhibit different characteristics relative to the phenotypic trait of interest. Typically, this experimental protocol involves deriving 100 to 300 segregating progeny from a single cross of two divergent inbred lines (e.g., selected to maximize phenotypic and molecular marker differences between the lines). The parents and segregating progeny are genotyped for multiple marker loci and evaluated for one to several quantitative traits (e.g., disease resistance). QTL are then identified as significant statistical associations between genotypic values and phenotypic variability among the segregating progeny. The strength of this experimental protocol comes from the utilization of the inbred cross, because the resulting F1 parents all have the same linkage phase. Thus, after selfing of the F1 plants, all segregating progeny (F2) are informative and linkage disequilibrium is maximized, the linkage phase is known, there are only two QTL alleles, and, except for backcross progeny, the frequency of each QTL allele is 0.5.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Numerous statistical methods for determining whether markers are genetically linked to a QTL (or to another marker) are known to those of skill in the art and include, e.g., standard linear models, such as ANOVA or regression mapping (Haley and Knott (1992) Heredity 69:315), maximum likelihood methods such as expectation-maximization algorithms, (e.g., Lander and Botstein (1989) âMapping Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits using RFLP linkage maps,â Genetics 121:185-199; Jansen (1992) âA general mixture model for mapping quantitative trait loci by using molecular markers,â Theor. Appl. Genet., 85:252-260; Jansen (1993) âMaximum likelihood in a generalized linear finite mixture model by using the EM algorithm,â Biometrics 49:227-231; Jansen (1994) âMapping of quantitative trait loci by using genetic markers: an overview of biometrical models,â In J. W. van Ooijen and J. Jansen (eds.), <i>Biometrics in Plant breeding: applications of molecular markers</i>, pp. 116-124, CPRO-DLO Netherlands; Jansen (1996) âA general Monte Carlo method for mapping multiple quantitative trait loci,â Genetics 142:305-311; and Jansen and Stam (1994) âHigh Resolution of quantitative trait into multiple loci via interval mapping,â Genetics 136:1447-1455). Exemplary statistical methods include single point marker analysis, interval mapping (Lander and Botstein (1989) Genetics 121:185), composite interval mapping, penalized regression analysis, complex pedigree analysis, MCMC analysis, MQM analysis (Jansen (1994) Genetics 138:871), HAPLO-IM+analysis, HAPLO-MQM analysis, and HAPLO-MQM+analysis, Bayesian MCMC, ridge regression, identity-by-descent analysis, Haseman-Elston regression, any of which are suitable in the context of the present invention. In addition, additional details regarding alternative statistical methods applicable to complex breeding populations which can be used to identify and localize QTLs are described in: U.S. Ser. No. 09/216,089 by Beavis et al. âQTL MAPPING IN PLANT BREEDING POPULATIONSâ and PCT/US00/34971 by Jansen et al. âMQM MAPPING USING HAPLOTYPED PUTATIVE QTLS ALLELES: A SIMPLE APPROACH FOR MAPPING QTLS IN PLANT BREEDING POPULATIONS.â Any of these approaches are computationally intensive and are usually performed with the assistance of a computer based system and specialized software. Appropriate statistical packages are available from a variety of public and commercial sources, and are known to those of skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">There is a need in the art for improved soybean strains that are tolerant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infections, such as <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>glycines </i>infections. There is a need in the art for methods that identify soybean plants or populations (germplasm) that display tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. What is needed in the art is to identify molecular genetic markers that are linked to <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance loci (e.g., tolerance QTL) in order to facilitate MAS, and also to facilitate gene discovery and cloning of gene alleles that impart <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance. Such markers can be used to select individual plants and plant populations that show favorable marker alleles in soybean populations and then employed to select the tolerant phenotype, or alternatively, be used to counterselect plants or plant populations that show a <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection susceptibility phenotype. The present invention provides these and other advantages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Compositions and methods for identifying soybean plants or germplasm with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection are provided. Methods of making soybean plants or germplasm that are tolerant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, e.g., through introgression of desired tolerance marker alleles and/or by transgenic production methods, as well as plants and germplasm made by these methods, are also provided. Systems and kits for selecting tolerant plants and germplasm are also a feature of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">
        <i>Fusarium solani </i>is a major disease of soybean, causing severe losses in soybean viability and overall yield. <i>Fusarium solani </i>resistant soybean cultivars have been produced in an attempt to reduce these losses. However, the strong selective pressures that resistant soybean impose on <i>Fusarium solani </i>cause relatively rapid loss of the resistance phenotype. In contrast, tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, in which the plant survives and produces high yields, despite a productive <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, is an alternate strategy to combat losses due to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Pathogen tolerance provides advantages over pathogen resistance. Selection for pathogen tolerance in the plant is less likely to result in the evolution of destructive races of <i>Fusarium solani </i>that combat and overcome the tolerance traits, leading to a host/pathogen relationship that more resembles commensalism as opposed to parasitism.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The identification and selection of soybean plants that show tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>sudden death syndrome using MAS can provide an effective and environmentally friendly approach to overcoming losses caused by this disease. The present invention provides a number of soybean marker loci and QTL chromosome intervals that demonstrate statistically significant co-segregation with <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance. Detection of these QTL markers or additional loci linked to the QTL markers can be used in marker-assisted soybean breeding programs to produce tolerant plants, or plants with improved tolerance.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In some aspects, the invention provides methods for identifying a first soybean plant or germplasm (e.g., a line or variety) that has tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. In the methods, at least one allele of one or more marker locus (e.g., a plurality of marker loci) that is associated with the tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility are detected in the first soybean plant or germplasm. The marker loci can be selected from the loci provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, including: SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255, as well as any other marker that is closely linked to these QTL markers (e.g., within about 10 cM of these loci). The invention also provides chromosomal QTL intervals that correlate with <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance. These intervals are located on linkage groups A1, D1b and N. Any marker located within these intervals also finds use as a marker for <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance. These intervals include:</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">(ii) SATT282 and SATT506 (LG-D1b); and</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N).</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">A plurality of maker loci can be selected in the same plant. Which QTL markers are selected in combination is not particularly limited. The QTL markers used in combinations can be any of the markers listed in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, any other marker that is closely linked to the markers in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (e.g., the closely linked markers as determined from <figref>FIG. 4</figref> and <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, or determined from the SOYBASE resource), or any marker within the QTL intervals described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The markers that are linked to the QTL markers of the invention (e.g., those markers provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) are closely linked, for example, within about 10 cM from the QTL markers. In desirable embodiments, the linked locus displays a genetic recombination distance of 9 centiMorgans, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.75, 0.5 or 0.25, or less from the QTL marker. In some embodiments, the closely linked locus is selected from the list of marker loci determined from <figref>FIG. 4</figref> or <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In some embodiments, preferred QTL markers are selected from SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, the germplasm is a soybean line or variety. In some aspects, the tolerance or improved tolerance is a non-race specific tolerance or a non-race specific improved tolerance. In some aspects, the tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility of a soybean plant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection can be quantitated using any suitable means, for example, by assaying soybean infection in a field where <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection occurs naturally. In some aspects, the <i>Fusarium solani </i>is <i>Fusarium solani </i>f. sp. <i>glycines</i>. In other aspects, the tolerance or improved tolerance is a non-race specific tolerance or a non-race specific improved tolerance.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Any of a variety of techniques can be used to identify a marker allele. It is not intended that the method of allele detection be limited in any way. Methods for allele detection typically include molecular identification methods such as amplification and detection of the marker amplicon. For example, an allelic form of a polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR), or of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be detected, e.g., by an amplification based technology. In these and other amplification based detection methods, the marker locus or a portion of the marker locus is amplified (e.g., via PCR, LCR or transcription using a nucleic acid isolated from a soybean plant of interest as a template) and the resulting amplified marker amplicon is detected. In one example of such an approach, an amplification primer or amplification primer pair is admixed with genomic nucleic acid isolated from the first soybean plant or germplasm, wherein the primer or primer pair is complementary or partially complementary to at least a portion of the marker locus, and is capable of initiating DNA polymerization by a DNA polymerase using the soybean genomic nucleic acid as a template. The primer or primer pair (e.g., a primer pair provided in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) is extended in a DNA polymerization reaction having a DNA polymerase and a template genomic nucleic acid to generate at least one amplicon. In any case, data representing the detected allele(s) can be transmitted (e.g., electronically or via infrared, wireless or optical transmission) to a computer or computer readable medium for analysis or storage. In some embodiments, plant RNA is the template for the amplification reaction. In other embodiments, plant genomic DNA is the template for the amplification reaction. In some embodiments, the QTL marker is a SNP type marker, and the detected allele is a SNP allele, and the method of detection is allele specific hybridization (ASH).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, the allele that is detected is a favorable allele that positively correlates with tolerance or improved tolerance. In the case where more than one marker is selected, an allele is selected for each of the markers; thus, two or more alleles are selected. In some embodiments, it can be the case that a marker locus will have more than one advantageous allele, and in that case, either allele can be selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">It will be appreciated that the ability to identify QTL marker loci that correlate with tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility of a soybean plant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection provides a method for selecting plants that have favorable marker loci as well. That is, any plant that is identified as comprising a desired marker locus (e.g., a marker allele that positively correlates with tolerance) can be selected for, while plants that lack the locus, or that have a locus that negatively correlates with tolerance, can be selected against. Thus, in one method, subsequent to identification of a marker locus, the methods include selecting (e.g., isolating) the first soybean plant or germplasm, or selecting a progeny of the first plant or germplasm. In some embodiments, the resulting selected first soybean plant or germplasm can be crossed with a second soybean plant or germplasm (e.g., an elite or exotic soybean, depending on characteristics that are desired in the progeny).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Similarly, in other embodiments, if an allele is correlated with tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, the method can include introgressing the allele into a second soybean plant or germplasm to produce an introgressed soybean plant or germplasm. In some embodiments, the second soybean plant or germplasm will typically display reduced tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection as compared to the first soybean plant or germplasm, while the introgressed soybean plant or germplasm will display an increased tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection as compared to the second plant or germplasm. An introgressed soybean plant or germplasm produced by these methods are also a feature of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In other aspects, various mapping populations are used to determine the linked markers of the invention. In one embodiment, the mapping population used is the population derived from the cross P9362/93B41. In other embodiments, other populations can be used, for example, 93B72/93B68, 94B53/93B72 or 94M80/9492. In other aspects, various software can be used in determining linked marker loci. For example, TASSEL, GENEFLOWâ¢ and MapManager-QTX all find use with the invention. In some embodiments, such as when software is used in the linkage analysis, the detected allele information (i.e., the data) is electronically transmitted or electronically stored, for example, in a computer readable medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In addition to introgressing selected marker alleles into desired genetic backgrounds, transgenic approaches can also be used to produce <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerant soybean plants or germplasm. For example, in some aspects, the invention provides methods of producing a soybean plant having tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, the methods comprising introducing an exogenous nucleic acid into a target soybean plant or progeny thereof, wherein the exogenous nucleic acid is derived from a nucleotide sequence that is linked to at least one favorable allele of one or more marker locus that is associated with tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. In some embodiments, the marker locus can be selected from: SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255, as well as any other marker that is closely linked (e.g., demonstrating not more than 10% recombination frequency) to these QTL markers; and furthermore, any marker locus that is located within the chromosomal QTL intervals including:</p>

      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In some embodiments, preferred QTL markers used in these transgenic plant methods are selected from SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In some embodiments, a plurality of maker loci can be used to construct the transgenic plant. Which QTL markers are used in combination is not particularly limited. The QTL markers used in combinations can be any of the makers listed in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, any other marker that is linked to the markers in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (e.g., the linked markers as determined from <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, or determined from the SOYBASE resource), or any markers selected from the QTL intervals described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, the tolerance or improved tolerance is a non-race specific tolerance or a non-race specific improved tolerance. In some aspects, the <i>Fusarium solani </i>is <i>Fusarium solani </i>f. sp. <i>glycines. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Any of a variety of methods can be used to provide the exogenous nucleic acid to the soybean plant. In one method, the nucleotide sequence is isolated by positional cloning, and is identified by linkage to the favorable allele. The precise composition of the exogenous nucleic acid can vary; in one embodiment, the exogenous nucleic acid corresponds to an open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polypeptide that, when expressed in a soybean plant, results in the soybean plant having tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. The exogenous nucleic acid optionally comprises an expression vector to provide for expression of the exogenous nucleic acid in the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In other aspects, various mapping populations are used to determine the linked markers that find use in constructing the transgenic plant. In one embodiment, the mapping population used is the population derived from the cross P9362/93B41. In other embodiments, other populations can be used. In other aspects, various software and software parameters are used in determining linked marker loci used to construct the transgenic plant. For example, TASSEL, GENEFLOWâ¢ and MapManager-QTX all find use with the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Systems for identifying a soybean plant predicted to have tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection are also a feature of the invention. Typically, the system can include a set of marker primers and/or probes configured to detect at least one favorable allele of one or more marker locus associated with tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, wherein the marker locus or loci are selected from: SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255, as well as any other marker that is closely linked (e.g., demonstrating not more than 10% recombination frequency) to these QTL markers; and furthermore, any marker locus that is located within the chromosomal QTL intervals including:</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0000">In some embodiments, preferred QTL markers used in these transgenic plant methods are selected from SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">Where a system that performs marker detection or correlation is desired, the system can also include a detector that is configured to detect one or more signal outputs from the set of marker probes or primers, or amplicon thereof, thereby identifying the presence or absence of the allele; and/or system instructions that correlate the presence or absence of the favorable allele with the predicted tolerance. The precise configuration of the detector will depend on the type of label used to detect the marker allele. Typical embodiments include light detectors, radioactivity detectors, and the like. Detection of the light emission or other probe label is indicative of the presence or absence of a marker allele. Similarly, the precise form of the instructions can vary depending on the components of the system, e.g., they can be present as system software in one or more integrated unit of the system, or can be present in one or more computers or computer readable media operably coupled to the detector. In one typical embodiment, the system instructions include at least one look-up table that includes a correlation between the presence or absence of the favorable allele and predicted tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, the system can be comprised of separate elements or can be integrated into a single unit for convenient detection of markers alleles and for performing marker-tolerance trait correlations. In some embodiments, the system can also include a sample, for example, genomic DNA, amplified genomic DNA, cDNA, amplified cDNA, RNA, or amplified RNA from soybean or from a selected soybean plant tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">Kits are also a feature of the invention. For example, a kit can include appropriate primers or probes for detecting tolerance associated marker loci and instructions in using the primers or probes for detecting the marker loci and correlating the loci with predicted <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance. The kits can further include packaging materials for packaging the probes, primers or instructions, controls such as control amplification reactions that include probes, primers or template nucleic acids for amplifications, molecular size markers, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">In other aspects, the invention provides nucleic acid compositions that are the novel EST-derived SSR QTL markers of the invention. For example, the invention provides compositions comprising an amplification primer pair capable of initiating DNA polymerization by a DNA polymerase on a soybean nucleic acid template to generate a soybean marker amplicon, where the marker amplicon corresponds to a soybean marker selected from S60602-TB and S60375-TB, and further where the composition comprises a primer pair that is specific for the marker.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. As used in this specification and the appended claims, terms in the singular and the singular forms âa,â âanâ and âthe,â for example, include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âplant,â âthe plantâ or âa plantâ also includes a plurality of plants; also, depending on the context, use of the term âplantâ can also include genetically similar or identical progeny of that plant; use of the term âa nucleic acidâ optionally includes, as a practical matter, many copies of that nucleic acid molecule; similarly, the term âprobeâ optionally (and typically) encompasses many similar or identical probe molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5â² to 3â² orientation. Numeric ranges recited within the specification are inclusive of the numbers defining the range and include each integer or any non-integer fraction within the defined range. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are described herein. In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set out below.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">A âplantâ can be a whole plant, any part thereof, or a cell or tissue culture derived from a plant. Thus, the term âplantâ can refer to any of: whole plants, plant components or organs (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.), plant tissues, seeds, plant cells, and/or progeny of the same. A plant cell is a cell of a plant, taken from a plant, or derived through culture from a cell taken from a plant. Thus, the term âsoybean plantâ includes whole soybean plants, soybean plant cells, soybean plant protoplast, soybean plant cell or soybean tissue culture from which soybean plants can be regenerated, soybean plant calli, soybean plant clumps and soybean plant cells that are intact in soybean plants or parts of soybean plants, such as soybean seeds, soybean pods, soybean flowers, soybean cotyledons, soybean leaves, soybean stems, soybean buds, soybean roots, soybean root tips and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">âGermplasmâ refers to genetic material of or from an individual (e.g., a plant), a group of individuals (e.g., a plant line, variety or family), or a clone derived from a line, variety, species, or culture. The germplasm can be part of an organism or cell, or can be separate from the organism or cell. In general, germplasm provides genetic material with a specific molecular makeup that provides a physical foundation for some or all of the hereditary qualities of an organism or cell culture. As used herein, germplasm includes cells, seed or tissues from which new plants may be grown, or plant parts, such as leafs, stems, pollen, or cells, that can be cultured into a whole plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">The term âalleleâ refers to one of two or more different nucleotide sequences that occur at a specific locus. For example, a first allele can occur on one chromosome, while a second allele occurs on a second homologous chromosome, e.g., as occurs for different chromosomes of a heterozygous individual, or between different homozygous or heterozygous individuals in a population. A âfavorable alleleâ is the allele at a particular locus that confers, or contributes to, an agronomically desirable phenotype, e.g., tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, or alternatively, is an allele that allows the identification of susceptible plants that can be removed from a breeding program or planting. A favorable allele of a marker is a marker allele that segregates with the favorable phenotype, or alternatively, segregates with susceptible plant phenotype, therefore providing the benefit of identifying disease-prone plants. A favorable allelic form of a chromosome segment is a chromosome segment that includes a nucleotide sequence that contributes to superior agronomic performance at one or more genetic loci physically located on the chromosome segment. âAllele frequencyâ refers to the frequency (proportion or percentage) at which an allele is present at a locus within an individual, within a line, or within a population of lines. For example, for an allele âA,â diploid individuals of genotype âAA,â âAa,â or âaaâ have allele frequencies of 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0, respectively. One can estimate the allele frequency within a line by averaging the allele frequencies of a sample of individuals from that line. Similarly, one can calculate the allele frequency within a population of lines by averaging the allele frequencies of lines that make up the population. For a population with a finite number of individuals or lines, an allele frequency can be expressed as a count of individuals or lines (or any other specified grouping) containing the allele.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0060">An allele âpositivelyâ correlates with a trait when it is linked to it and when presence of the allele is an indicator that the desired trait or trait form will occur in a plant comprising the allele. An allele negatively correlates with a trait when it is linked to it and when presence of the allele is an indicator that a desired trait or trait form will not occur in a plant comprising the allele.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0061">An individual is âhomozygousâ if the individual has only one type of allele at a given locus (e.g., a diploid individual has a copy of the same allele at a locus for each of two homologous chromosomes). An individual is âheterozygousâ if more than one allele type is present at a given locus (e.g., a diploid individual with one copy each of two different alleles). The term âhomogeneityâ indicates that members of a group have the same genotype at one or more specific loci. In contrast, the term âheterogeneityâ is used to indicate that individuals within the group differ in genotype at one or more specific loci.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">A âlocusâ is a chromosomal region where a polymorphic nucleic acid, trait determinant, gene or marker is located. Thus, for example, a âgene locusâ is a specific chromosome location in the genome of a species where a specific gene can be found.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">The term âquantitative trait locusâ or âQTLâ refers to a polymorphic genetic locus with at least two alleles that differentially affect the expression of a phenotypic trait in at least one genetic background, e.g., in at least one breeding population or progeny.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0064">The terms âmarker,â âmolecular marker,â âmarker nucleic acid,â and âmarker locusâ refer to a nucleotide sequence or encoded product thereof (e.g., a protein) used as a point of reference when identifying a linked locus. A marker can be derived from genomic nucleotide sequence or from expressed nucleotide sequences (e.g., from a spliced RNA, a cDNA, etc.), or from an encoded polypeptide. The term also refers to nucleic acid sequences complementary to or flanking the marker sequences, such as nucleic acids used as probes or primer pairs capable of amplifying the marker sequence. A âmarker probeâ is a nucleic acid sequence or molecule that can be used to identify the presence of a marker locus, e.g., a nucleic acid probe that is complementary to a marker locus sequence. Alternatively, in some aspects, a marker probe refers to a probe of any type that is able to distinguish (i.e., genotype) the particular allele that is present at a marker locus. Nucleic acids are âcomplementaryâ when they specifically hybridize in solution, e.g., according to Watson-Crick base pairing rules. A âmarker locusâ is a locus that can be used to track the presence of a second linked locus, e.g., a linked locus that encodes or contributes to expression of a phenotypic trait. For example, a marker locus can be used to monitor segregation of alleles at a locus, such as a QTL, that are genetically or physically linked to the marker locus. Thus, a âmarker allele,â alternatively an âallele of a marker locusâ is one of a plurality of polymorphic nucleotide sequences found at a marker locus in a population that is polymorphic for the marker locus. In some aspects, the present invention provides marker loci correlating with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection in soybean. Each of the identified markers is expected to be in close physical and genetic proximity (resulting in physical and/or genetic linkage) to a genetic element, e.g., a QTL, that contributes to tolerance.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">âGenetic markersâ are nucleic acids that are polymorphic in a population and where the alleles of which can be detected and distinguished by one or more analytic methods, e.g., RFLP, AFLP, isozyme, SNP, SSR, and the like. The terms âgenetic markerâ and âmolecular markerâ refer to a genetic locus (a âmarker locusâ) that can be used as a point of reference when identifying a genetically linked locus such as a QTL. Such a marker is also referred to as a QTL marker. The term also refers to nucleic acid sequences complementary to the genomic sequences, such as nucleic acids used as probes.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">Markers corresponding to genetic polymorphisms between members of a population can be detected by methods well-established in the art. These include, e.g., PCR-based sequence specific amplification methods, detection of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), detection of isozyme markers, detection of polynucleotide polymorphisms by allele specific hybridization (ASH), detection of amplified variable sequences of the plant genome, detection of self-sustained sequence replication, detection of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or detection of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). Well established methods are also know for the detection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and SSR markers derived from EST sequences and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">A âgenetic mapâ is a description of genetic linkage relationships among loci on one or more chromosomes (or linkage groups) within a given species, generally depicted in a diagrammatic or tabular form. âGenetic mappingâ is the process of defining the linkage relationships of loci through the use of genetic markers, populations segregating for the markers, and standard genetic principles of recombination frequency. A âgenetic map locationâ is a location on a genetic map relative to surrounding genetic markers on the same linkage group where a specified marker can be found within a given species. In contrast, a physical map of the genome refers to absolute distances (for example, measured in base pairs or isolated and overlapping contiguous genetic fragments, e.g., contigs). A physical map of the genome does not take into account the genetic behavior (e.g., recombination frequencies) between different points on the physical map.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0068">A âgenetic recombination frequencyâ is the frequency of a crossing over event (recombination) between two genetic loci. Recombination frequency can be observed by following the segregation of markers and/or traits following meiosis. A genetic recombination frequency can be expressed in centimorgans (cM), where one cM is the distance between two genetic markers that show a 1% recombination frequency (i.e., a crossing-over event occurs between those two markers once in every 100 cell divisions).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0069">As used herein, the term âlinkageâ is used to describe the degree with which one marker locus is âassociated withâ another marker locus or some other locus (for example, a tolerance locus).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">As used herein, linkage equilibrium describes a situation where two markers independently segregate, i.e., sort among progeny randomly. Markers that show linkage equilibrium are considered unlinked (whether or not they lie on the same chromosome).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">As used herein, linkage disequilibrium describes a situation where two markers segregate in a non-random manner, i.e., have a recombination frequency of less than 50% (and by definition, are separated by less than 50 cM on the same linkage group). Markers that show linkage disequilibrium are considered linked. Linkage occurs when the marker locus and a linked locus are found together in progeny plants more frequently than not together in the progeny plants. As used herein, linkage can be between two markers, or alternatively between a marker and a phenotype. A marker locus can be associated with (linked to) a trait, e.g., a marker locus can be associated with tolerance or improved tolerance to a plant pathogen when the marker locus is in linkage disequilibrium with the tolerance trait. The degree of linkage of a molecular marker to a phenotypic trait (e.g., a QTL) is measured, e.g., as a statistical probability of co-segregation of that molecular marker with the phenotype.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0072">As used herein, the linkage relationship between a molecular marker and a phenotype is given as a âprobabilityâ or âadjusted probability.â The probability value is the statistical likelihood that the particular combination of a phenotype and the presence or absence of a particular marker allele is random. Thus, the lower the probability score, the greater the likelihood that a phenotype and a particular marker will co-segregate. In some aspects, the probability score is considered âsignificantâ or ânonsignificant.â In some embodiments, a probability score of 0.05 (p=0.05, or a 5% probability) of random assortment is considered a significant indication of co-segregation. However, the present invention is not limited to this particular standard, and an acceptable probability can be any probability of less than 50% (p=0.5). For example, a significant probability can be less than 0.25, less than 0.20, less than 0.15, or less than 0.1.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0073">The term âlinkage disequilibriumâ refers to a non-random segregation of genetic loci or traits (or both). In either case, linkage disequilibrium implies that the relevant loci are within sufficient physical proximity along a length of a chromosome so that they segregate together with greater than random (i.e., non-random) frequency (in the case of co-segregating traits, the loci that underlie the traits are in sufficient proximity to each other). Linked loci co-segregate more than 50% of the time, e.g., from about 51% to about 100% of the time. The term âphysically linkedâ is sometimes used to indicate that two loci, e.g., two marker loci, are physically present on the same chromosome.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0074">Advantageously, the two linked loci are located in close proximity such that recombination between homologous chromosome pairs does not occur between the two loci during meiosis with high frequency, e.g., such that linked loci co-segregate at least about 90% of the time, e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.75%, or more of the time.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0075">The phrase âclosely linked,â in the present application, means that recombination between two linked loci occurs with a frequency of equal to or less than about 10% (i.e., are separated on a genetic map by not more than 10 cM). Put another way, the closely linked loci co-segregate at least 90% of the time. Marker loci are especially useful in the present invention when they demonstrate a significant probability of co-segregation (linkage) with a desired trait (e.g., pathogenic tolerance). For example, in some aspects, these markers can be termed linked QTL markers. In other aspects, especially useful molecular markers are those markers that are linked or closely linked to QTL markers.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0076">In some aspects, linkage can be expressed as any desired limit or range. For example, in some embodiments, two linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 50 cM map units. In other embodiments, linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 40 cM. In other embodiments, two linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 30 cM. In other embodiments, two linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 25 cM. In other embodiments, two linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 20 cM. In other embodiments, two linked loci are two loci that are separated by less than 15 cM. In some aspects, it is advantageous to define a bracketed range of linkage, for example, between 10 and 20 cM, or between 10 and 30 cM, or between 10 and 40 cM.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0077">The more closely a marker is linked to a second locus, the better an indicator for the second locus that marker becomes. Thus, in one embodiment, closely linked loci such as a marker locus and a second locus (e.g., a QTL marker) display an inter-locus recombination frequency of 10% or less, preferably about 9% or less, still more preferably about 8% or less, yet more preferably about 7% or less, still more preferably about 6% or less, yet more preferably about 5% or less, still more preferably about 4% or less, yet more preferably about 3% or less, and still more preferably about 2% or less. In highly preferred embodiments, the relevant loci (e.g., a marker locus and a QTL marker) display a recombination a frequency of about 1% or less, e.g., about 0.75% or less, more preferably about 0.5% or less, or yet more preferably about 0.25% or less. Two loci that are localized to the same chromosome, and at such a distance that recombination between the two loci occurs at a frequency of less than 10% (e.g., about 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.75%, 0.5%, 0.25%, or less) are also said to be âproximal toâ each other. In some cases, two different markers can have the same genetic map coordinates. In that case, the two markers are in such close proximity to each other that recombination occurs between them with such low frequency that it is undetectable.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0078">When referring to the relationship between two genetic elements, such as a genetic element contributing to tolerance and a proximal marker, âcouplingâ phase linkage indicates the state where the âfavorableâ allele at the tolerance locus is physically associated on the same chromosome strand as the âfavorableâ allele of the respective linked marker locus. In coupling phase, both favorable alleles are inherited together by progeny that inherit that chromosome strand. In ârepulsionâ phase linkage, the âfavorableâ allele at the locus of interest (e.g., a QTL for tolerance) is physically linked with an âunfavorableâ allele at the proximal marker locus, and the two âfavorableâ alleles are not inherited together (i.e., the two loci are âout of phaseâ with each other).</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0079">As used herein, the terms âchromosome intervalâ or âchromosome segmentâ designate a contiguous linear span of genomic DNA that resides in planta on a single chromosome. The genetic elements or genes located on a single chromosome interval are physically linked. The size of a chromosome interval is not particularly limited.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0080">In some aspects, for example in the context of the present invention, generally the genetic elements located within a single chromosome interval are also genetically linked, typically within a genetic recombination distance of, for example, less than or equal to 20 centimorgan (cM), or alternatively, less than or equal to 10 cM. That is, two genetic elements within a single chromosome interval undergo recombination at a frequency of less than or equal to 20% or 10%</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0081">In one aspect, any marker of the invention is linked (genetically and physically) to any other marker that is at or less than 50 cM distant. In another aspect, any marker of the invention is closely linked (genetically and physically) to any other marker that is in close proximity, e.g., at or less than 10 cM distant. Two closely linked markers on the same chromosome can be positioned 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.75, 0.5 or 0.25 cM or less from each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0082">âToleranceâ or âimproved toleranceâ in a soybean plant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection is an indication that the soybean plant is less affected with respect to yield and/or survivability or other relevant agronomic measures, upon infection by <i>Fusarium solani</i>, than a less tolerant or more âsusceptibleâ plant. Tolerance is a relative term, indicating that the infected plant produces better yield of soybean than another similarly infected more susceptible plant. That is, the infection causes a reduced decrease in soybean survival and/or yield in a tolerant soybean plant, as compared to a susceptible soybean plant. One of skill will appreciate that soybean plant tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection varies widely, and that tolerance also will vary depending on the severity of the infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0083">However, by simple observation, one of skill can determine the relative tolerance or susceptibility of different plants, plant lines or plant families to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection of a given severity, and use that information to compare the relative tolerances of soybean lines across multiple locations and growth seasons. For example, an infection severity system can be established based on foliar scorch, sudden wilting and death of the plant during the growing season. See also, Gibson (1994) âSoybean varietal response to sudden death syndrome,â pp 20-40 in D. Wilkinson (ed.) Proc. Twenty-Fourth Soybean Seed Res. Conf. Chicago Ill. for Am Seed Trade Assoc., Washington D.C.; and Rupe et al. (1991) <i>Plant Dis. </i>75:47-50). In one typical example, plants are assigned tolerance rating of between 9 (highly tolerant, yield and survivability not significantly affected by infection) to 1 (plants are totally necrotic). In one such example scale, 9=No disease; 8=very slight symptoms including virus like crinkling and small chlorotic spots; 7=larger chlorotic spots on less than 20% of the leaves; 6=browning and coalescing of spots; 5=extensive browning and curling of top leaves; 4=leaves dropping, lower leaves browning and curling; 3=top stem dying, lower leaves dropping; 2=middle stem dying; 1=plants are totally necrotic (dried up plant skeletons). This scale is optionally reversed at the discretion of the practitioner, i.e., with 1=to no disease and 9=to totally necrotic plants; see also, Njiti et al. (2003) âRoundup Ready Soybean: Glyphosate Effects on <i>Fusarium solani </i>Root Colonization and Sudden Death Syndromeâ <i>Agron. J. </i>95(5):1140-1145. One of skill will appreciate that other scales for symptoms can also be used if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0084">
        <i>Fusarium solani </i>âtoleranceâ differs from <i>Fusarium solani </i>âresistanceâ in that tolerance is a measure of a soybean plant's ability to survive and yield soybean despite the presence of <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, as opposed to a measure of the soybean plant's ability to resist infection. As used in the art, âtoleranceâ is sometimes referred to as âgeneral resistance,â ârate-reducing resistanceâ or âpartial resistance.â</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">Resistance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>is often ârace-specific.â That is, over time, a population (e.g., a race) of <i>Fusarium solani </i>evolves to overcome a resistance trait in a given line of soybean. Once this occurs, the resistance trait is ârace specificâ in that the resistance trait is no longer effective at resisting infection by the evolved <i>Fusarium solani </i>population (that is, the evolved <i>Fusarium solani </i>population is a âraceâ that is not blocked from achieving a productive infection by the resistance trait). Tolerance, on the other hand, can sometimes be ânon-race specificâ in that populations of <i>Fusarium solani </i>are not necessarily selected to overcome tolerance, because a tolerant soybean plant permits the <i>Fusarium solani </i>pathogen to achieve a productive infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">The term âcrossedâ or âcrossâ in the context of this invention means the fusion of gametes via pollination to produce progeny (e.g., cells, seeds or plants). The term encompasses both sexual crosses (the pollination of one plant by another) and selfing (self-pollination, e.g., when the pollen and ovule are from the same plant).</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">The term âintrogressionâ refers to the transmission of a desired allele of a genetic locus from one genetic background to another. For example, introgression of a desired allele at a specified locus can be transmitted to at least one progeny via a sexual cross between two parents of the same species, where at least one of the parents has the desired allele in its genome. Alternatively, for example, transmission of an allele can occur by recombination between two donor genomes, e.g., in a fused protoplast, where at least one of the donor protoplasts has the desired allele in its genome. The desired allele can be, e.g., a selected allele of a marker, a QTL, a transgene, or the like. In any case, offspring comprising the desired allele can be repeatedly backcrossed to a line having a desired genetic background and selected for the desired allele, to result in the allele becoming fixed in a selected genetic background.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0088">A âlineâ or âstrainâ is a group of individuals of identical parentage that are generally inbred to some degree and that are generally homozygous and homogeneous at most loci (isogenic or near isogenic). A âsublineâ refers to an inbred subset of descendents that are genetically distinct from other similarly inbred subsets descended from the same progenitor. Traditionally, a âsublineâ has been derived by inbreeding the seed from an individual soybean plant selected at the F3 to F5 generation until the residual segregating loci are âfixedâ or homozygous across most or all loci. Commercial soybean varieties (or lines) are typically produced by aggregating (âbulkingâ) the self-pollinated progeny of a single F3 to F5 plant from a controlled cross between 2 genetically different parents. While the variety typically appears uniform, the self-pollinating variety derived from the selected plant eventually (e.g., F8) becomes a mixture of homozygous plants that can vary in genotype at any locus that was heterozygous in the originally selected F3 to F5 plant. In the context of the invention, marker-based sublines, that differ from each other based on qualitative polymorphism at the DNA level at one or more specific marker loci, are derived by genotyping a sample of seed derived from individual self-pollinated progeny derived from a selected F3-F5 plant. The seed sample can be genotyped directly as seed, or as plant tissue grown from such a seed sample. Optionally, seed sharing a common genotype at the specified locus (or loci) are bulked providing a subline that is genetically homogenous at identified loci important for a trait of interest (yield, tolerance, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0089">An âancestral lineâ is a parent line used as a source of genes e.g., for the development of elite lines. An âancestral populationâ is a group of ancestors that have contributed the bulk of the genetic variation that was used to develop elite lines. âDescendantsâ are the progeny of ancestors, and may be separated from their ancestors by many generations of breeding. For example, elite lines are the descendants of their ancestors. A âpedigree structureâ defines the relationship between a descendant and each ancestor that gave rise to that descendant. A pedigree structure can span one or more generations, describing relationships between the descendant and it's parents, grand parents, great-grand parents, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0090">An âelite lineâ or âelite strainâ is an agronomically superior line that has resulted from many cycles of breeding and selection for superior agronomic performance. Numerous elite lines are available and known to those of skill in the art of soybean breeding. An âelite populationâ is an assortment of elite individuals or lines that can be used to represent the state of the art in terms of agronomically superior genotypes of a given crop species, such as soybean. Similarly, an âelite germplasmâ or elite strain of germplasm is an agronomically superior germplasm, typically derived from and/or capable of giving rise to a plant with superior agronomic performance, such as an existing or newly developed elite line of soybean.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0091">In contrast, an âexotic soybean strainâ or an âexotic soybean germplasmâ is a strain or germplasm derived from a soybean not belonging to an available elite soybean line or strain of germplasm. In the context of a cross between two soybean plants or strains of germplasm, an exotic germplasm is not closely related by descent to the elite germplasm with which it is crossed. Most commonly, the exotic germplasm is not derived from any known elite line of soybean, but rather is selected to introduce novel genetic elements (typically novel alleles) into a breeding program.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0092">The term âamplifyingâ in the context of nucleic acid amplification is any process whereby additional copies of a selected nucleic acid (or a transcribed form thereof) are produced. Typical amplification methods include various polymerase based replication methods, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase mediated methods such as the ligase chain reaction (LCR) and RNA polymerase based amplification (e.g., by transcription) methods. An âampliconâ is an amplified nucleic acid, e.g., a nucleic acid that is produced by amplifying a template nucleic acid by any available amplification method (e.g., PCR, LCR, transcription, or the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0093">A âgenomic nucleic acidâ is a nucleic acid that corresponds in sequence to a heritable nucleic acid in a cell. Common examples include nuclear genomic DNA and amplicons thereof. A genomic nucleic acid is, in some cases, different from a spliced RNA, or a corresponding cDNA, in that the spliced RNA or cDNA is processed, e.g., by the splicing machinery, to remove introns. Genomic nucleic acids optionally comprise non-transcribed (e.g., chromosome structural sequences, promoter regions, enhancer regions, etc.) and/or non-translated sequences (e.g., introns), whereas spliced RNA/cDNA typically do not have non-transcribed sequences or introns. A âtemplate nucleic acidâ is a nucleic acid that serves as a template in an amplification reaction (e.g., a polymerase based amplification reaction such as PCR, a ligase mediated amplification reaction such as LCR, a transcription reaction, or the like). A template nucleic acid can be genomic in origin, or alternatively, can be derived from expressed sequences, e.g., a cDNA or an EST.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0094">An âexogenous nucleic acidâ is a nucleic acid that is not native to a specified system (e.g., a germplasm, plant, variety, etc.), with respect to sequence, genomic position, or both. As used herein, the terms âexogenousâ or âheterologousâ as applied to polynucleotides or polypeptides typically refers to molecules that have been artificially supplied to a biological system (e.g., a plant cell, a plant gene, a particular plant species or variety or a plant chromosome under study) and are not native to that particular biological system. The terms can indicate that the relevant material originated from a source other than a naturally occurring source, or can refer to molecules having a non-natural configuration, genetic location or arrangement of parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0095">In contrast, for example, a ânativeâ or âendogenousâ gene is a gene that does not contain nucleic acid elements encoded by sources other than the chromosome or other genetic element on which it is normally found in nature. An endogenous gene, transcript or polypeptide is encoded by its natural chromosomal locus, and not artificially supplied to the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0096">The term ârecombinantâ in reference to a nucleic acid or polypeptide indicates that the material (e.g., a recombinant nucleic acid, gene, polynucleotide, polypeptide, etc.) has been altered by human intervention. Generally, the arrangement of parts of a recombinant molecule is not a native configuration, or the primary sequence of the recombinant polynucleotide or polypeptide has in some way been manipulated. The alteration to yield the recombinant material can be performed on the material within or removed from its natural environment or state. For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid becomes a recombinant nucleic acid if it is altered, or if it is transcribed from DNA which has been altered, by means of human intervention performed within the cell from which it originates. A gene sequence open reading frame is recombinant if that nucleotide sequence has been removed from it natural context and cloned into any type of artificial nucleic acid vector. Protocols and reagents to produce recombinant molecules, especially recombinant nucleic acids, are common and routine in the art. The term recombinant can also refer to an organism that harbors recombinant material, e.g., a plant that comprises a recombinant nucleic acid is considered a recombinant plant. In some embodiments, a recombinant organism is a transgenic organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0097">The term âintroducedâ when referring to translocating a heterologous or exogenous nucleic acid into a cell refers to the incorporation of the nucleic acid into the cell using any methodology. The term encompasses such nucleic acid introduction methods as âtransfection,â âtransformationâ and âtransduction.â</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0098">As used herein, the term âvectorâ is used in reference to polynucleotide or other molecules that transfer nucleic acid segment(s) into a cell. The term âvehicleâ is sometimes used interchangeably with âvector.â A vector optionally comprises parts which mediate vector maintenance and enable its intended use (e.g., sequences necessary for replication, genes imparting drug or antibiotic resistance, a multiple cloning site, operably linked promoter/enhancer elements which enable the expression of a cloned gene, etc.). Vectors are often derived from plasmids, bacteriophages, or plant or animal viruses. A âcloning vectorâ or âshuttle vectorâ or âsubcloning vectorâ contains operably linked parts that facilitate subcloning steps (e.g., a multiple cloning site containing multiple restriction endonuclease sites).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0099">The term âexpression vectorâ as used herein refers to a vector comprising operably linked polynucleotide sequences that facilitate expression of a coding sequence in a particular host organism (e.g., a bacterial expression vector or a plant expression vector). Polynucleotide sequences that facilitate expression in prokaryotes typically include, e.g., a promoter, an operator (optional), and a ribosome binding site, often along with other sequences. Eukaryotic cells can use promoters, enhancers, termination and polyadenylation signals and other sequences that are generally different from those used by prokaryotes.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0100">The term âtransgenic plantâ refers to a plant that comprises within its cells a heterologous polynucleotide. Generally, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant expression cassette. âTransgenicâ is used herein to refer to any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant, the genotype of which has been altered by the presence of heterologous nucleic acid including those transgenic organisms or cells initially so altered, as well as those created by crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic organism or cell. The term âtransgenicâ as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods (e.g., crosses) or by naturally occurring events such as random cross-fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0101">âPositional cloningâ is a cloning procedure in which a target nucleic acid is identified and isolated by its genomic proximity to marker nucleic acid. For example, a genomic nucleic acid clone can include part or all of two more chromosomal regions that are proximal to one another. If a marker can be used to identify the genomic nucleic acid clone from a genomic library, standard methods such as sub-cloning or sequencing can be used to identify and or isolate subsequences of the clone that are located near the marker.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0102">A specified nucleic acid is âderived fromâ a given nucleic acid when it is constructed using the given nucleic acid's sequence, or when the specified nucleic acid is constructed using the given nucleic acid. For example, a cDNA or EST is derived from an expressed mRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0103">The term âgenetic elementâ or âgeneâ refers to a heritable sequence of DNA, i.e., a genomic sequence, with functional significance. The term âgeneâ can also be used to refer to, e.g., a cDNA and/or a mRNA encoded by a genomic sequence, as well as to that genomic sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0104">The term âgenotypeâ is the genetic constitution of an individual (or group of individuals) at one or more genetic loci, as contrasted with the observable trait (the phenotype). Genotype is defined by the allele(s) of one or more known loci that the individual has inherited from its parents. The term genotype can be used to refer to an individual's genetic constitution at a single locus, at multiple loci, or, more generally, the term genotype can be used to refer to an individual's genetic make-up for all the genes in its genome. A âhaplotypeâ is the genotype of an individual at a plurality of genetic loci. Typically, the genetic loci described by a haplotype are physically and genetically linked, i.e., on the same chromosome segment.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0105">The terms âphenotype,â or âphenotypic traitâ or âtraitâ refers to one or more trait of an organism. The phenotype can be observable to the naked eye, or by any other means of evaluation known in the art, e.g., microscopy, biochemical analysis, genomic analysis, an assay for a particular disease resistance, etc. In some cases, a phenotype is directly controlled by a single gene or genetic locus, i.e., a âsingle gene trait.â In other cases, a phenotype is the result of several genes. A âquantitative trait lociâ (QTL) is a genetic domain that is polymorphic and effects a phenotype that can be described in quantitative terms, e.g., height, weight, oil content, days to germination, disease resistance, etc, and, therefore, can be assigned a âphenotypic valueâ which corresponds to a quantitative value for the phenotypic trait. A QTL can act through a single gene mechanism or by a polygenic mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0106">A âmolecular phenotypeâ is a phenotype detectable at the level of a population of (one or more) molecules. Such molecules can be nucleic acids such as genomic DNA or RNA, proteins, or metabolites. For example, a molecular phenotype can be an expression profile for one or more gene products, e.g., at a specific stage of plant development, in response to an environmental condition or stress, etc. Expression profiles are typically evaluated at the level of RNA or protein, e.g., on a nucleic acid array or âchipâ or using antibodies or other binding proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0107">The term âyieldâ refers to the productivity per unit area of a particular plant product of commercial value. For example, yield of soybean is commonly measured in bushels of seed per acre or metric tons of seed per hectare per season. Yield is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. âAgronomics,â âagronomic traits,â and âagronomic performanceâ refer to the traits (and underlying genetic elements) of a given plant variety that contribute to yield over the course of growing season. Individual agronomic traits include emergence vigor, vegetative vigor, stress tolerance, disease resistance or tolerance, herbicide resistance, branching, flowering, seed set, seed size, seed density, standability, threshability and the like. Yield is, therefore, the final culmination of all agronomic traits.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0108">A âsetâ of markers or probes refers to a collection or group of markers or probes, or the data derived therefrom, used for a common purpose, e.g., identifying soybean plants with a desired trait (e.g., tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection). Frequently, data corresponding to the markers or probes, or data derived from their use, is stored in an electronic medium. While each of the members of a set possess utility with respect to the specified purpose, individual markers selected from the set as well as subsets including some, but not all of the markers, are also effective in achieving the specified purpose.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0109">A âlook up tableâ is a table that correlates one form of data to another, or one or more forms of data with a predicted outcome that the data is relevant to. For example, a look up table can include a correlation between allele data and a predicted trait that a plant comprising a given allele is likely to display. These tables can be, and typically are, multidimensional, e.g., taking multiple alleles into account simultaneously, and, optionally, taking other factors into account as well, such as genetic background, e.g., in making a trait prediction.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0110">A âcomputer readable mediumâ is an information storage media that can be accessed by a computer using an available or custom interface. Examples include memory (e.g., ROM or RAM, flash memory, etc.), optical storage media (e.g., CD-ROM), magnetic storage media (computer hard drives, floppy disks, etc.), punch cards, and many others that are commercially available. Information can be transmitted between a system of interest and the computer, or to or from the computer to or from the computer readable medium for storage or access of stored information. This transmission can be an electrical transmission, or can be made by other available methods, such as an IR link, a wireless connection, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0111">âSystem instructionsâ are instruction sets that can be partially or fully executed by the system. Typically, the instruction sets are present as system software.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0117">Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by, e.g., <i>Fusarium solani </i>(e.g., <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>glycines </i>and/or <i>Fusarium solani </i>f.sp <i>phaseoli</i>), is a major disease of soybean, causing severe losses in soybean viability and overall yield. <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerant soybean cultivars have been produced in an attempt to reduce these losses, e.g., the cultivars Forrest, Pyramid and Essex. However, the strong selective pressures that resistant soybean impose on <i>Fusarium solani </i>cause relatively rapid loss of resistance against races of <i>Fusarium solani </i>that evolve to combat resistance traits in the resistant soybean. Accordingly, tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, in which the plant survives, thrives and produces high yields, despite a productive <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, is an alternate strategy to combat losses due to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. An advantage to tolerance, as compared simply to resistance, is that it is less likely to result in races of <i>Fusarium solani </i>that combat the tolerance traits, as the tolerant plants simply support a productive infection while maintaining high yield, regardless of the race of <i>Fusarium solani </i>at issue (tolerance can, therefore, be ânon-race specificâ). Thus, while it is possible that races of <i>Fusarium solani </i>may evolve to take advantage of the tolerance traits in <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerant soybean in some manner, it is clear that the evolutionary pressures on both <i>Fusarium solani </i>and soybean are quite different than with a resistance phenotype. That is, there is not a strong negative selection against <i>Fusarium solani </i>imposed by tolerance, because tolerant soybean plants support a productive <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0118">The identification and selection of soybean plants that show tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection using MAS can provide an effective and environmentally friendly approach to overcoming losses caused by this disease. The present invention provides soybean marker loci that demonstrate statistically significant co-segregation with <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance. Detection of these loci or additional linked loci can be used in marker assisted soybean breeding programs to produce tolerant plants, or plants with improved tolerance. The linked SSR markers identified herein are provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. These markers include SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0119">Each of the SSR-type markers display a plurality of alleles that can be visualized as different sized PCR amplicons, as summarized in the SSR allele dictionary in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The PCR primers that are used to generate the SSR-marker amplicons are provided in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The alleles of SNP-type markers are determined using an allele-specific hybridization protocol, as known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0120">As recognized in the art, any other marker that is linked to a QTL marker (e.g., a disease tolerance marker) also finds use for that same purpose. Examples of additional markers that are linked to the disease tolerance markers recited herein are provided. For example, a linked marker can be determined from the soybean consensus genetic map provided in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Additional closely linked markers are further provided in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. It is not intended, however, that linked markers finding use with the invention be limited to those recited in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> or <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0121">The invention also provides chromosomal QTL intervals that correlate with <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance. These intervals are located on linkage groups B1, G, K and M. Any marker located within these intervals finds use as a marker for <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance. These intervals include:</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0122">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0123">(ii) SATT282 and SATT506 (LG-D1b); and</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0124">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N).</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0125">Methods for identifying soybean plants or germplasm that carry preferred alleles of tolerance marker loci are a feature of the invention. In these methods, any of a variety of marker detection protocols are used to identify marker loci, depending on the type of marker loci. Typical methods for marker detection include amplification and detection of the resulting amplified markers, e.g., by PCR, LCR, transcription based amplification methods, or the like. These include ASH, SSR detection, RFLP analysis and many others.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">Although particular marker alleles can show co-segregation with a disease tolerance or susceptibility phenotype, it is important to note that the marker locus is not necessarily part of the QTL locus responsible for the tolerance or susceptibility. For example, it is not a requirement that the marker polynucleotide sequence be part of a gene that imparts disease resistance (for example, be part of the gene open reading frame). The association between a specific marker allele with the tolerance or susceptibility phenotype is due to the original âcouplingâ linkage phase between the marker allele and the QTL tolerance or susceptibility allele in the ancestral soybean line from which the tolerance or susceptibility allele originated. Eventually, with repeated recombination, crossing over events between the marker and QTL locus can change this orientation. For this reason, the favorable marker allele may change depending on the linkage phase that exists within the tolerant parent used to create segregating populations. This does not change the fact the genetic marker can be used to monitor segregation of the phenotype. It only changes which marker allele is considered favorable in a given segregating population.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0127">Identification of soybean plants or germplasm that include a marker locus or marker loci linked to a tolerance trait or traits provides a basis for performing marker assisted selection of soybean. Soybean plants that comprise favorable markers or favorable alleles are selected for, while soybean plants that comprise markers or alleles that are negatively correlated with tolerance can be selected against. Desired markers and/or alleles can be introgressed into soybean having a desired (e.g., elite or exotic) genetic background to produce an introgressed tolerant soybean plant or germplasm. In some aspects, it is contemplated that a plurality of tolerance markers are sequentially or simultaneous selected and/or introgressed. The combinations of tolerance markers that are selected for in a single plant is not limited, and can include any combination of markers recited in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, any markers linked to the markers recited in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, or any markers located within the QTL intervals defined herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0128">As an alternative to standard breeding methods of introducing traits of interest into soybean (e.g., introgression), transgenic approaches can also be used. In these methods, exogenous nucleic acids that encode traits linked to markers are introduced into target plants or germplasm. For example, a nucleic acid that codes for a tolerance trait is cloned, e.g., via positional cloning and introduced into a target plant or germplasm.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0129">Verification of tolerance can be performed by available tolerance protocols, as discussed in more detail below. For example, such protocols can be found in Li et al. (1998) âChlamydospore formation, production, and nuclear status in <i>Fusarium solani </i>f sp. <i>glycines </i>soybean sudden death syndrome-causing isolates.â <i>Mycologia </i>90:414-421, and Njiti et al. (2003) âRoundup Ready Soybean: Glyphosate Effects on <i>Fusarium solani </i>Root Colonization and Sudden Death Syndrome.â <i>Agron. J. </i>95(5): 1140-1145. Tolerance assays are useful to verify that the tolerance trait still segregates with the marker in any particular plant or population, and, of course, to measure the degree of tolerance improvement achieved by introgressing or recombinantly introducing the trait into a desired background.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0130">Systems, including automated systems for selecting plants that comprise a marker of interest and/or for correlating presence of the marker with tolerance are also a feature of the invention. These systems can include probes relevant to marker locus detection, detectors for detecting labels on the probes, appropriate fluid handling elements and temperature controllers that mix probes and templates and/or amplify templates, and systems instructions that correlate label detection to the presence of a particular marker locus or allele.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0131">Kits are also a feature of the invention. For example, a kit can include appropriate primers or probes for detecting tolerance associated marker loci and instructions in using the primers or probes for detecting the marker loci and correlating the loci with predicted <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance. The kits can further include packaging materials for packaging the probes, primers or instructions, controls such as control amplification reactions that include probes, primers or template nucleic acids for amplifications, molecular size markers, or the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Tolerance Markers and Favorable Alleles</heading>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0132">In traditional linkage analysis, no direct knowledge of the physical relationship of genes on a chromosome is required. Mendel's first law is that factors of pairs of characters are segregated, meaning that alleles of a diploid trait separate into two gametes and then into different offspring. Classical linkage analysis can be thought of as a statistical description of the relative frequencies of cosegregation of different traits. Linkage analysis is the well characterized descriptive framework of how traits are grouped together based upon the frequency with which they segregate together. That is, if two non-allelic traits are inherited together with a greater than random frequency, they are said to be âlinked.â The frequency with which the traits are inherited together is the primary measure of how tightly the traits are linked, i.e., traits which are inherited together with a higher frequency are more closely linked than traits which are inherited together with lower (but still above random) frequency. Traits are linked because the genes which underlie the traits reside on the same chromosome. The further apart on a chromosome the genes reside, the less likely they are to segregate together, because homologous chromosomes recombine during meiosis. Thus, the further apart on a chromosome the genes reside, the more likely it is that there will be a crossing over event during meiosis that will result in two genes segregating separately into progeny.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0133">A common measure of linkage is the frequency with which traits cosegregate. This can be expressed as a percentage of cosegregation (recombination frequency) or, also commonly, in centiMorgans (cM). The cM is named after the pioneering geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan and is a unit of measure of genetic recombination frequency. One cM is equal to a 1% chance that a trait at one genetic locus will be separated from a trait at another locus due to crossing over in a single generation (meaning the traits segregate together 99% of the time). Because chromosomal distance is approximately proportional to the frequency of crossing over events between traits, there is an approximate physical distance that correlates with recombination frequency. For example, in soybean, 1 cM correlates, on average, to about 400,000 base pairs (400 Kb).</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0134">Marker loci are themselves traits and can be assessed according to standard linkage analysis by tracking the marker loci during segregation. Thus, in the context of the present invention, one cM is equal to a 1% chance that a marker locus will be separated from another locus (which can be any other trait, e.g., another marker locus, or another trait locus that encodes a QTL), due to crossing over in a single generation. The markers herein, as described in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, e.g., SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255, as well as any of the chromosome intervals</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0135">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0136">(ii) SATT282 and SATT506 (LG-D1b); and</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0137">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N),</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0000">have been found to correlate with tolerance, improved tolerance or susceptibility to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection in soybean. This means that the markers are sufficiently proximal to a tolerance trait that they can be used as a predictor for the tolerance trait. This is extremely useful in the context of marker assisted selection (MAS), discussed in more detail herein. In brief, soybean plants or germplasm can be selected for markers or marker alleles that positively correlate with tolerance, without actually raising soybean and measuring for tolerance or improved tolerance (or, contrawise, soybean plants can be selected against if they possess markers that negatively correlate with tolerance or improved tolerance). MAS is a powerful shortcut to selecting for desired phenotypes and for introgressing desired traits into cultivars of soybean (e.g., introgressing desired traits into elite lines). MAS is easily adapted to high throughput molecular analysis methods that can quickly screen large numbers of plant or germplasm genetic material for the markers of interest and is much more cost effective than raising and observing plants for visible traits.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">In some embodiments, the most preferred QTL markers are a subset of the markers provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the most preferred markers can be selected from SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0139">When referring to the relationship between two genetic elements, such as a genetic element contributing to tolerance and a proximal marker, âcouplingâ phase linkage indicates the state where the âfavorableâ allele at the tolerance locus is physically associated on the same chromosome strand as the âfavorableâ allele of the respective linked marker locus. In coupling phase, both favorable alleles are inherited together by progeny that inherit that chromosome strand. In ârepulsionâ phase linkage, the âfavorableâ allele at the locus of interest (e.g., a QTL for tolerance) is physically linked with an âunfavorableâ allele at the proximal marker locus, and the two âfavorableâ alleles are not inherited together (i.e., the two loci are âout of phaseâ with each other).</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0140">A favorable allele of a marker is that allele of the marker that co-segregates with a desired phenotype (e.g., disease tolerance). As used herein, a QTL marker has a minimum of one favorable allele, although it is possible that the marker might have two or more favorable alleles found in the population. Any favorable allele of that marker can be used advantageously for the identification and construction of tolerant soybean lines. Optionally, one, two, three or more favorable allele(s) of different markers are identified in, or introgressed into a plant, and can be selected for or against during MAS. Desirably, plants or germplasm are identified that have at least one such favorable allele that positively correlates with tolerance or improved tolerance.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0141">Alternatively, a marker allele that co-segregates with disease susceptibility also finds use with the invention, since that allele can be used to identify and counter select disease-susceptible plants. Such an allele can be used for exclusionary purposes during breeding to identify alleles that negatively correlate with tolerance, to eliminate susceptible plants or germplasm from subsequent rounds of breeding.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0142">In some embodiments of the invention, a plurality of marker alleles are simultaneously selected for in a single plant or a population of plants. In these methods, plants are selected that contain favorable alleles from more than one tolerance marker, or alternatively, favorable alleles from more than one tolerance marker are introgressed into a desired soybean germplasm. One of skill in the art recognizes that the simultaneous selection of favorable alleles from more than one disease tolerance marker in the same plant is likely to result in an additive (or even synergistic) protective effect for the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0143">One of skill recognizes that the identification of favorable marker alleles is germplasm-specific. The determination of which marker alleles correlate with tolerance (or susceptibility) is determined for the particular germplasm under study. One of skill recognizes that methods for identifying the favorable alleles are routine and well known in the art, and furthermore, that the identification and use of such favorable alleles is well within the scope of the invention. Furthermore still, identification of favorable marker alleles in soybean populations other than the populations used or described herein is well within the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0144">Amplification primers for amplifying SSR-type marker loci are a feature of the invention. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> provides specific primers for marker locus amplification. However, one of skill will immediately recognize that other sequences to either side of the given primers can be used in place of the given primers, so long as the primers can amplify a region that includes the allele to be detected. Further, it will be appreciated that the precise probe to be used for detection can vary, e.g., any probe that can identify the region of a marker amplicon to be detected can be substituted for those examples provided herein. Further, the configuration of the amplification primers and detection probes can, of course, vary. Thus, the invention is not limited to the primers and probes specifically recited herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0145">In some aspects, methods of the invention utilize an amplification step to detect/genotype a marker locus. However, it will be appreciated that amplification is not a requirement for marker detectionâfor example, one can directly detect unamplified genomic DNA simply by performing a Southern blot on a sample of genomic DNA. Procedures for performing Southern blotting, amplification (PCR, LCR, or the like) and many other nucleic acid detection methods are well established and are taught, e.g., in Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular CloningâA Laboratory Manual </i>(3rd Ed.), Vol. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2000 (âSambrookâ); <i>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology</i>, F. M. Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols, a joint venture between Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., (supplemented through 2002) (âAusubelâ)) and <i>PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications </i>(Innis et al. eds) Academic Press Inc. San Diego, Calif. (1990) (Innis). Additional details regarding detection of nucleic acids in plants can also be found, e.g., in <i>Plant Molecular Biology </i>(1993) Croy (ed.) BIOS Scientific Publishers, Inc.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0146">Separate detection probes can also be omitted in amplification/detection methods, e.g., by performing a real time amplification reaction that detects product formation by modification of the relevant amplification primer upon incorporation into a product, incorporation of labeled nucleotides into an amplicon, or by monitoring changes in molecular rotation properties of amplicons as compared to unamplified precursors (e.g., by fluorescence polarization).</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0147">Typically, molecular markers are detected by any established method available in the art, including, without limitation, allele specific hybridization (ASH) or other methods for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) detection, amplified variable sequence detection, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) detection, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detection, self-sustained sequence replication detection, simple sequence repeat (SSR) detection, single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) detection, isozyme markers detection, or the like. While the exemplary markers provided in the figures and tables herein are either SSR or SNP (ASH) markers, any of the aforementioned marker types can be employed in the context of the invention to identify chromosome segments encompassing genetic element that contribute to superior agronomic performance (e.g., tolerance or improved tolerance).</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">QTL Chromosome Intervals</heading>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0148">In some aspects, the invention provides QTL chromosome intervals, where a QTL (or multiple QTLs) that segregate with <i>Fusarium solani </i>disease tolerance are contained in those intervals. A variety of methods well known in the art are available for identifying chromosome intervals (also as described in detail in EXAMPLE 3). The boundaries of such chromosome intervals are drawn to encompass markers that will be linked to one or more QTL. In other words, the chromosome interval is drawn such that any marker that lies within that interval (including the terminal markers that define the boundaries of the interval) can be used as markers for disease tolerance. Each interval comprises at least one QTL, and furthermore, may indeed comprise more than one QTL. Close proximity of multiple QTL in the same interval may obfuscate the correlation of a particular marker with a particular QTL, as one marker may demonstrate linkage to more than one QTL. Conversely, e.g., if two markers in close proximity show co-segregation with the desired phenotypic trait, it is sometimes unclear if each of those markers identifying the same QTL or two different QTL. Regardless, knowledge of how many QTL are in a particular interval is not necessary to make or practice the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0149">The present invention provides soybean chromosome intervals, where the markers within that interval demonstrate co-segregation with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Thus, each of these intervals comprises at least one <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance QTL. These intervals are:</p>

      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0150">Each of the intervals described above shows a clustering of markers that co-segregate with <i>Fusarium solani </i>disease tolerance. This clustering of markers occurs in relatively small domains on the linkage groups, indicating the presence of one or more QTL in those chromosome regions. QTL intervals were drawn to encompass the markers that co-segregate with pathogen tolerance. The intervals are defined by the markers on their termini, where the interval encompasses all the markers that map within the interval as well as the markers that define the termini.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0151">In one case, one of the intervals that was drawn on LG-N by a marker clustering effect (observed in single marker regression analysis) was further independently confirmed by a QTL mapping analysis, as described in detail in EXAMPLE 3. In those experiments, markers within that domain of LG-N show a significant likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) for the presence of one or more QTL responsible for the <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance trait on that region of the chromosome.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Genetic Maps</heading>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0152">As one of skill in the art will recognize, recombination frequencies (and as a result, genetic map positions) in any particular population are not static. The genetic distances separating two markers (or a marker and a QTL) can vary depending on how the map positions are determined. For example, variables such as the parental mapping populations used, the software used in the marker mapping or QTL mapping, and the parameters input by the user of the mapping software can contribute to the QTL/marker genetic map relationships. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to any particular mapping populations, use of any particular software, or any particular set of software parameters to determine linkage of a particular marker or chromosome interval with the <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance phenotype. It is well within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art to extrapolate the novel features described herein to any soybean gene pool or population of interest, and using any particular software and software parameters. Indeed, observations regarding tolerance markers and chromosome intervals in populations in additions to those described herein are readily made using the teaching of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0153">Mapping Populations</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0154">Any suitable soybean strains can be used to generate mapping data or for marker association studies. A large number of commonly used soybean lines (e.g., commercial varieties) and mapping populations are known in the art. Additional strains finding use with the invention are also described in the present disclosure. Useful soybean mapping populations and lines include but are not limited to:</p>

These improved maps can be advantageously used in marker assisted selection, map-based cloning, provide an improved framework for positioning newly identified molecular markers and aid in the identification of QTL chromosome intervals and clusters of advantageously-linked markers.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0159">In some aspects, a consensus map is derived by simply overlaying one map on top of another. In other aspects, various algorithms, e.g., JOINMAPÂ® analysis, allows the combination of genetic mapping data from multiple sources, and reconciles discrepancies between mapping data from the original sources.

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> provides a composite genetic map that incorporates mapping information from various sources. This map was derived using the USDA/Iowa State University mapping population data (as described in Cregan et al., âAn Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean Genomeâ Crop Science 39:1464-1490 (1999); and see references therein) as a framework. Additional markers, as they became known, have been continuously added to that map, including public SSR markers, EST-derived markers, and SNP markers. This map contains approximately 750 soybean markers that are distributed over each of the soybean chromosomes. The markers that are on this map are known in the art (i.e., have been previously described; see, e.g., the SOYBASE on-line resource for extensive listings of these markers and descriptions of the individual markers) or are described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0161">Additional integrated maps are known in the art. See, e.g., Cregan et al., âAn Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean Genomeâ Crop Science 39:1464-1490 (1999); and also International Application No. PCT/US2004/024919 by Sebastian, filed Jul. 27, 2004, entitled âSoybean Plants Having Superior Agronomic Performance and Methods for their Productionâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0162">Song et al. provides another integrated soybean genetic map that incorporates mapping information from five different mapping populations (Song et al., âA New Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean,â Theor. Appl. Genet., 109:122-128 [2004]). This integrated map contains approximately 1,800 soybean markers, including SSR and SNP-type markers, as well as EST markers, RPLP markers, AFLP, RAPD, isozyme and classical markers (e.g., seed coat color). The markers that are on this map are known in the art and have been previously characterized. This information is also available at the website for the Soybean Genomics and Improvement Laboratory (SGIL) at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC). See, specifically, the description of projects in the Cregan Laboratory on that website.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0163">The soybean integrated linkage map provided in Song et al. (2004) is based on the principle described by Stam (1993) âConstruction of integrated genetic linkage maps by means of a new computer package: JoinMap,â The Plant Journal 3(5):739-744; and Van Ooijen and Voorrips (2001) âJoinMap 3.0 software for the calculation of genetic linkage maps,â Plant Research International, Wageningen, the Netherlands. Mapping information from five soybean populations was used in the map integration, and also used to place recently identified SSR markers onto the soybean genome. These mapping populations were MinsoyÃNoir 1 (MN), MinsoyÃArcher (MA), Noir 1ÃArcher (NA), ClarkÃHarosoy (CH) and A81-356022ÃPI468916 (MS). The JOINMAPÂ® analysis resulted in a map with 20 linkage groups containing a total of 1849 markers, including 1015 SSRs, 709 RFLPs, 73 RAPDs, 24 classical traits, six AFLPs, ten isozymes and 12 others. Among the mapped SSR markers were 417 previously uncharacterized SSRs.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0164">Initially, LOD scores and pairwise recombination frequencies between markers were calculated. A LOD of 5.0 was used to create groups in the MS, MA, NA populations and LOD 4.0 in the MN and CH populations. The map of each linkage group was then integrated. Recombination values were converted to genetic distances using the Kosambi mapping function.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Linked Markers</heading>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0165">From the present disclosure and widely recognized in the art, it is clear that any genetic marker that has a significant probability of co-segregation with a phenotypic trait of interest (e.g., in the present case, a pathogen tolerance or improved tolerance trait) can be used as a marker for that trait. As list of useful QTL markers provided by the present invention is provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0166">In addition to the QTL markers noted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, additional markers linked to (showing linkage disequilibrium with) the QTL markers can also be used to predict the tolerance or improved tolerance trait in a soybean plant. In other words, any other marker showing less than 50% recombination frequency (separated by a genetic distance less than 50 cM) with a QTL marker of the invention (e.g., the markers provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) is also a feature of the invention. Any marker that is linked to a QTL marker can also be used advantageously in marker-assisted selection for the particular trait.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0167">Genetic markers that are linked to QTL markers (e.g., QTL markers provided in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) are particularly useful when they are sufficiently proximal (e.g., closely linked) to a given QTL marker so that the genetic marker and the QTL marker display a low recombination frequency. In the present invention, such closely linked markers are a feature of the invention. As defined herein, closely linked markers display a recombination frequency of about 10% or less (the given marker is within 10 cM of the QTL). Put another way, these closely linked loci co-segregate at least 90% of the time. Indeed, the closer a marker is to a QTL marker, the more effective and advantageous that marker becomes as an indicator for the desired trait.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0168">Thus, in other embodiments, closely linked loci such as a QTL marker locus and a second locus display an inter-locus cross-over frequency of about 10% or less, preferably about 9% or less, still more preferably about 8% or less, yet more preferably about 7% or less, still more preferably about 6% or less, yet more preferably about 5% or less, still more preferably about 4% or less, yet more preferably about 3% or less, and still more preferably about 2% or less. In highly preferred embodiments, the relevant loci (e.g., a marker locus and a target locus such as a QTL) display a recombination a frequency of about 1% or less, e.g., about 0.75% or less, more preferably about 0.5% or less, or yet more preferably about 0.25% or less. Thus, the loci are about 10 cM, 9 cM, 8 cM, 7 cM, 6 cM, 5 cM, 4 cM, 3 cM, 2 cM, 1 cM, 0.75 cM, 0.5 cM or 0.25 cM or less apart. Put another way, two loci that are localized to the same chromosome, and at such a distance that recombination between the two loci occurs at a frequency of less than 10% (e.g., about 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.75%, 0.5%, 0.25%, or less) are said to be âproximal toâ each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0169">In some aspects, linked markers (including closely linked markers) of the invention are determined by review of a genetic map, for example, the integrated genetic map shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. For example, it is shown herein that the linkage group D1b marker SATT506 correlates with at least one <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance QTL. Markers that are linked to SATT506 can be determined from the map provided in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. For example, markers on linkage group A1 that are closely linked to SATT506 include:</p>

      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0170">Similarly, linked markers (including closely linked markers) of the invention can be determined by review of any suitable soybean genetic map. For example, the integrated genetic map described in Song et al. (2004) also provides a means to identify linked (including closely linked) markers. See, Song et al., âA New Integrated Genetic Linkage Map of the Soybean,â Theor. Appl. Genet., 109:122-128 (2004); see also the website for the Soybean Genomics and Improvement Laboratory (SGIL) at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), and see specifically the description of projects in the Cregan Laboratory on that website. That genetic map incorporates a variety of genetic markers that are known in the art or alternatively are described in that reference. Detailed descriptions of numerous markers, including many of those described in Song et al. (2004) can be found at the SOYBASE website resource.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0171">For example, according to the Song et al. (2004) integrated genetic map, markers on linkage group A1 that are closely linked to SATT506 include: Sat<sub>â</sub>423, A747<sub>â</sub>1, Sat<sub>â</sub>135, Satt412, Satt141, Satt290, Satt611, Satt604, K011<sub>â</sub>4, Satt506, Satt005, Satt600, L050<sub>â</sub>3, Satt537, Satt579, Satt282, Sat<sub>â</sub>089, Satt189, Satt350, Satt428, Mng137<sub>â</sub>1, Bng047<sub>â</sub>1, Sat<sub>â</sub>169, Satt644 and Satt041.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0172">It is not intended that the determination of linked or closely linked markers be limited to the use of any particular soybean genetic map. Indeed, a large number of soybean genetic maps is available and are well known to one of skill in the art. Another map that finds use with the invention in this respect is the integrated soybean genetic maps found on the SOYBASE website resource. Alternatively still, the determination of linked and closely linked markers can be made by the generation of an experimental dataset and linkage analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0173">It is not intended that the identification of markers that are linked (e.g., within about 50 cM or within about 10 cM) to the <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance QTL markers identified herein be limited to any particular map or methodology. The integrated genetic map provided in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> serves only as example for identifying linked markers. Indeed, linked markers as defined herein can be determined from any genetic map known in the art (an experimental map or an integrated map), or alternatively, can be determined from any new mapping dataset.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0174">It is noted that lists of linked and closely linked markers may vary between maps and methodologies due to various factors. First, the markers that are placed on any two maps may not be identical, and furthermore, some maps may have a greater marker density than another map. Also, the mapping populations, methodologies and algorithms used to construct genetic maps can differ. One of skill in the art recognizes that one genetic map is not necessarily more or less accurate than another, and furthermore, recognizes that any soybean genetic map can be used to determine markers that are linked and closely linked to the QTL markers of the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Techniques for Marker Detection</heading>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0175">The invention provides molecular markers that have a significant probability of co-segregation with QTL that impart a <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance phenotype. These QTL markers find use in marker assisted selection for desired traits (tolerance or improved tolerance), and also have other uses. It is not intended that the invention be limited to any particular method for the detection of these markers.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0176">Markers corresponding to genetic polymorphisms between members of a population can be detected by numerous methods well-established in the art (e.g., PCR-based sequence specific amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), isozyme markers, allele specific hybridization (ASH), amplified variable sequences of the plant genome, self-sustained sequence replication, simple sequence repeat (SSR), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (âRAPDâ) or amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). In one additional embodiment, the presence or absence of a molecular marker is determined simply through nucleotide sequencing of the polymorphic marker region. This method is readily adapted to high throughput analysis as are the other methods noted above, e.g., using available high throughput sequencing methods such as sequencing by hybridization.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0177">In general, the majority of genetic markers rely on one or more property of nucleic acids for their detection. For example, some techniques for detecting genetic markers utilize hybridization of a probe nucleic acid to nucleic acids corresponding to the genetic marker (e.g., amplified nucleic acids produced using genomic soybean DNA as a template). Hybridization formats, including but not limited to solution phase, solid phase, mixed phase, or in situ hybridization assays are useful for allele detection. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993) <i>Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyâHybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes </i>Elsevier, New York, as well as in Sambrook, Berger and Ausubel (herein).</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0178">For example, markers that comprise restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) are detected, e.g., by hybridizing a probe which is typically a sub-fragment (or a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a sub-fragment) of the nucleic acid to be detected to restriction digested genomic DNA. The restriction enzyme is selected to provide restriction fragments of at least two alternative (or polymorphic) lengths in different individuals or populations. Determining one or more restriction enzyme that produces informative fragments for each cross is a simple procedure, well known in the art. After separation by length in an appropriate matrix (e.g., agarose or polyacrylamide) and transfer to a membrane (e.g., nitrocellulose, nylon, etc.), the labeled probe is hybridized under conditions which result in equilibrium binding of the probe to the target followed by removal of excess probe by washing.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0179">Nucleic acid probes to the marker loci can be cloned and/or synthesized. Any suitable label can be used with a probe of the invention. Detectable labels suitable for use with nucleic acid probes include, for example, any composition detectable by spectroscopic, radioisotopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means. Useful labels include biotin for staining with labeled streptavidin conjugate, magnetic beads, fluorescent dyes, radiolabels, enzymes, and colorimetric labels. Other labels include ligands which bind to antibodies labeled with fluorophores, chemiluminescent agents, and enzymes. A probe can also constitute radiolabelled PCR primers that are used to generate a radiolabelled amplicon. Labeling strategies for labeling nucleic acids and corresponding detection strategies can be found, e.g., in Haugland (1996) <i>Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals Sixth Edition </i>by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene Oreg.); or Haugland (2001) <i>Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals Eighth Edition </i>by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene Oreg.) (Available on CD ROM).</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0180">Amplification-Based Detection Methods</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0181">PCR, RT-PCR and LCR are in particularly broad use as amplification and amplification-detection methods for amplifying nucleic acids of interest (e.g., those comprising marker loci), facilitating detection of the markers. Details regarding the use of these and other amplification methods can be found in any of a variety of standard texts, including, e.g., Sambrook, Ausubel, Berger and Croy, herein. Many available biology texts also have extended discussions regarding PCR and related amplification methods. One of skill will appreciate that essentially any RNA can be converted into a double stranded DNA suitable for restriction digestion, PCR expansion and sequencing using reverse transcriptase and a polymerase (âReverse Transcription-PCR, or âRT-PCRâ).

      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0182">Real Time Amplification/Detection Methods</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0183">In one aspect, real time PCR or LCR is performed on the amplification mixtures described herein, e.g., using molecular beacons or TAQMANâ¢ probes. A molecular beacon (MB) is an oligonucleotide or PNA which, under appropriate hybridization conditions, self-hybridizes to form a stem and loop structure. The MB has a label and a quencher at the termini of the oligonucleotide or PNA; thus, under conditions that permit intra-molecular hybridization, the label is typically quenched (or at least altered in its fluorescence) by the quencher. Under conditions where the MB does not display intra-molecular hybridization (e.g., when bound to a target nucleic acid, e.g., to a region of an amplicon during amplification), the MB label is unquenched. Details regarding standard methods of making and using MBs are well established in the literature and MBs are available from a number of commercial reagent sources. See also, e.g., Leone et al. (1995) âMolecular beacon probes combined with amplification by NASBA enable homogenous real-time detection of RNA.â <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>26:2150-2155; Tyagi and Kramer (1996) âMolecular beacons: probes that fluoresce upon hybridizationâ <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>14:303-308; Blok and Kramer (1997) âAmplifiable hybridization probes containing a molecular switchâ <i>Mol Cell Probes </i>11:187-194; Hsuih et al.

Additional details regarding MB construction and use is found in the patent literature, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,517 (Jul. 20, 1999) to Tyagi et al. entitled âDetectably labeled dual conformation oligonucleotide probes, assays and kits;â U.S. Pat. No. 6,150,097 to Tyagi et al. (Nov. 21, 2000) entitled âNucleic acid detection probes having non-FRET fluorescence quenching and kits and assays including such probesâ and U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,130 to Tyagi et al. (Mar. 14, 2000), entitled âWavelength-shifting probes and primers and their use in assays and kits.â</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0184">PCR detection and quantification using dual-labeled fluorogenic oligonucleotide probes, commonly referred to as âTAQMANâ¢â probes, can also be performed according to the present invention. These probes are composed of short (e.g., 20-25 base) oligodeoxynucleotides that are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes. On the 5â² terminus of each probe is a reporter dye, and on the 3â² terminus of each probe a quenching dye is found. The oligonucleotide probe sequence is complementary to an internal target sequence present in a PCR amplicon. When the probe is intact, energy transfer occurs between the two fluorophores and emission from the reporter is quenched by the quencher by FRET. During the extension phase of PCR, the probe is cleaved by 5â² nuclease activity of the polymerase used in the reaction, thereby releasing the reporter from the oligonucleotide-quencher and producing an increase in reporter emission intensity. Accordingly, TAQMANâ¢ probes are oligonucleotides that have a label and a quencher, where the label is released during amplification by the exonuclease action of the polymerase used in amplification. This provides a real time measure of amplification during synthesis. A variety of TAQMANâ¢ reagents are commercially available, e.g., from Applied Biosystems (Division Headquarters in Foster City, Calif.) as well as from a variety of specialty vendors such as Biosearch Technologies (e.g., black hole quencher probes).</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0185">Additional Details Regarding Amplified Variable Sequences, SSR, AFLP ASH, SNPs and Isozyme Markers</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0186">Amplified variable sequences refer to amplified sequences of the plant genome which exhibit high nucleic acid residue variability between members of the same species. All organisms have variable genomic sequences and each organism (with the exception of a clone) has a different set of variable sequences. Once identified, the presence of specific variable sequence can be used to predict phenotypic traits. Preferably, DNA from the plant serves as a template for amplification with primers that flank a variable sequence of DNA. The variable sequence is amplified and then sequenced.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0187">Alternatively, self-sustained sequence replication can be used to identify genetic markers. Self-sustained sequence replication refers to a method of nucleic acid amplification using target nucleic acid sequences which are replicated exponentially in vitro under substantially isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities involved in retroviral replication: (1) reverse transcriptase, (2) Rnase H, and (3) a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Guatelli et al. (1990) <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>87:1874). By mimicking the retroviral strategy of RNA replication by means of cDNA intermediates, this reaction accumulates cDNA and RNA copies of the original target.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0188">Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) can also be used as genetic markers (Vos et al. (1995) <i>Nucl Acids Res </i>23:4407). The phrase âamplified fragment length polymorphismâ refers to selected restriction fragments which are amplified before or after cleavage by a restriction endonuclease. The amplification step allows easier detection of specific restriction fragments. AFLP allows the detection large numbers of polymorphic markers and has been used for genetic mapping of plants (Becker et al. (1995) <i>Mol Gen Genet </i>249:65; and Meksem et al. (1995) <i>Mol Gen Genet </i>249:74).</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0189">Allele-specific hybridization (ASH) can be used to identify the genetic markers of the invention. ASH technology is based on the stable annealing of a short, single-stranded, oligonucleotide probe to a completely complementary single-strand target nucleic acid. Detection is via an isotopic or non-isotopic label attached to the probe.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0190">For each polymorphism, two or more different ASH probes are designed to have identical DNA sequences except at the polymorphic nucleotides. Each probe will have exact homology with one allele sequence so that the range of probes can distinguish all the known alternative allele sequences. Each probe is hybridized to the target DNA. With appropriate probe design and hybridization conditions, a single-base mismatch between the probe and target DNA will prevent hybridization. In this manner, only one of the alternative probes will hybridize to a target sample that is homozygous or homogenous for an allele. Samples that are heterozygous or heterogeneous for two alleles will hybridize to both of two alternative probes.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0191">ASH markers are used as dominant markers where the presence or absence of only one allele is determined from hybridization or lack of hybridization by only one probe. The alternative allele may be inferred from the lack of hybridization. ASH probe and target molecules are optionally RNA or DNA; the target molecules are any length of nucleotides beyond the sequence that is complementary to the probe; the probe is designed to hybridize with either strand of a DNA target; the probe ranges in size to conform to variously stringent hybridization conditions, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0192">PCR allows the target sequence for ASH to be amplified from low concentrations of nucleic acid in relatively small volumes. Otherwise, the target sequence from genomic DNA is digested with a restriction endonuclease and size separated by gel electrophoresis. Hybridizations typically occur with the target sequence bound to the surface of a membrane or, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,613, the ASH probe sequence may be bound to a membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0193">In one embodiment, ASH data are typically obtained by amplifying nucleic acid fragments (amplicons) from genomic DNA using PCR, transferring the amplicon target DNA to a membrane in a dot-blot format, hybridizing a labeled oligonucleotide probe to the amplicon target, and observing the hybridization dots by autoradiography.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0194">Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) are markers that consist of a shared sequence differentiated on the basis of a single nucleotide. Typically, this distinction is detected by differential migration patterns of an amplicon comprising the SNP on e.g., an acrylamide gel. However, alternative modes of detection, such as hybridization, e.g., ASH, or RFLP analysis are also appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0195">Isozyme markers can be employed as genetic markers, e.g., to track markers other than the tolerance markers herein, or to track isozyme markers linked to the markers herein. Isozymes are multiple forms of enzymes that differ from one another in their amino acid, and therefore their nucleic acid sequences. Some isozymes are multimeric enzymes containing slightly different subunits. Other isozymes are either multimeric or monomeric but have been cleaved from the proenzyme at different sites in the amino acid sequence. Isozymes can be characterized and analyzed at the protein level, or alternatively, isozymes which differ at the nucleic acid level can be determined. In such cases any of the nucleic acid based methods described herein can be used to analyze isozyme markers.</p>

It is not intended that the nucleic acid probes of the invention be limited to any particular size. In some embodiments, nucleic acid probe is at least 20 nucleotides in length, or alternatively, at least 50 nucleotides in length, or alternatively, at least 100 nucleotides in length, or alternatively, at least 200 nucleotides in length.</p>

      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0202">In general, synthetic methods for making oligonucleotides, including probes, primers, molecular beacons, PNAs, LNAs (locked nucleic acids), etc., are well known. For example, oligonucleotides can be synthesized chemically according to the solid phase phosphoramidite triester method described by Beaucage and Caruthers (1981), <i>Tetrahedron Letts., </i>22(20):1859-1862, e.g., using a commercially available automated synthesizer, e.g., as described in Needham-VanDevanter et al.

      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="2">Amplification Primers for Marker Detection</heading>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0206">In some preferred embodiments, the molecular markers of the invention are detected using a suitable PCR-based detection method, where the size or sequence of the PCR amplicon is indicative of the absence or presence of the marker (e.g., a particular marker allele). In these types of methods, PCR primers are hybridized to the conserved regions flanking the polymorphic marker region. As used in the art, PCR primers used to amplify a molecular marker are sometimes termed âPCR markersâ or simply âmarkers.â</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0207">It will be appreciated that, although many specific examples of primers are provided herein (see, <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), suitable primers to be used with the invention can be designed using any suitable method. It is not intended that the invention be limited to any particular primer or primer pair. For example, primers can be designed using any suitable software program, such as LASERGENEÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0208">In some embodiments, the primers of the invention are radiolabelled, or labeled by any suitable means (e.g., using a non-radioactive fluorescent tag), to allow for rapid visualization of the different size amplicons following an amplification reaction without any additional labeling step or visualization step. In some embodiments, the primers are not labeled, and the amplicons are visualized following their size resolution, e.g., following agarose gel electrophoresis. In some embodiments, ethidium bromide staining of the PCR amplicons following size resolution allows visualization of the different size amplicons.</p>

      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">Marker Assisted Selection and Breeding of Plants</heading>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0210">A primary motivation for development of molecular markers in crop species is the potential for increased efficiency in plant breeding through marker assisted selection (MAS). Genetic markers are used to identify plants that contain a desired genotype at one or more loci, and that are expected to transfer the desired genotype, along with a desired phenotype to their progeny. Genetic markers can be used to identify plants that contain a desired genotype at one locus, or at several unlinked or linked loci (e.g., a haplotype), and that would be expected to transfer the desired genotype, along with a desired phenotype to their progeny. The present invention provides the means to identify plants, particularly soybean plants, that are tolerant, exhibit improved tolerance or are susceptible to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection by identifying plants having a specified allele at one of those loci, e.g., SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0211">Similarly, by identifying plants lacking the desired marker locus, susceptible or less tolerant plants can be identified, and, e.g., eliminated from subsequent crosses. Similarly, these marker loci can be introgressed into any desired genomic background, germplasm, plant, line, variety, etc., as part of an overall MAS breeding program designed to enhance soybean yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0212">The invention also provides chromosome QTL intervals that find equal use in MAS to select plants that demonstrate <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance or improved tolerance. Similarly, the QTL intervals can also be used to counter-select plants that are susceptible or have reduced tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Any marker that maps within the QTL interval (including the termini of the intervals) finds use with the invention. These intervals are defined by the following pairs of markers that are the interval termini:</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0213">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0214">(ii) SATT282 and SATT506 (LG-D1b); and</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0215">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N),</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0216">In general, MAS uses polymorphic markers that have been identified as having a significant likelihood of co-segregation with a tolerance trait. Such markers are presumed to map near a gene or genes that give the plant its tolerance phenotype, and are considered indicators for the desired trait, and are termed QTL markers. Plants are tested for the presence of a desired allele in the QTL marker. The most preferred markers (or marker alleles) are those that have the strongest association with the tolerance trait.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0217">Linkage analysis is used to determine which polymorphic marker allele demonstrates a statistical likelihood of co-segregation with the tolerance phenotype (thus, a âtolerance marker alleleâ). Following identification of a marker allele for co-segregation with the tolerance phenotype, it is possible to use this marker for rapid, accurate screening of plant lines for the tolerance allele without the need to grow the plants through their life cycle and await phenotypic evaluations, and furthermore, permits genetic selection for the particular tolerance allele even when the molecular identity of the actual tolerance QTL is unknown. Tissue samples can be taken, for example, from the first leaf of the plant and screened with the appropriate molecular marker, and it is rapidly determined which progeny will advance. Linked markers also remove the impact of environmental factors that can often influence phenotypic expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0218">A polymorphic QTL marker locus can be used to select plants that contain the marker allele (or alleles) that correlate with the desired tolerance phenotype, typically called marker-assisted selection (MAS). In brief, a nucleic acid corresponding to the marker nucleic acid allele is detected in a biological sample from a plant to be selected. This detection can take the form of hybridization of a probe nucleic acid to a marker allele or amplicon thereof, e.g., using allele-specific hybridization, Southern analysis, northern analysis, in situ hybridization, hybridization of primers followed by PCR amplification of a region of the marker, or the like. A variety of procedures for detecting markers are described herein, e.g., in the section entitled â<i>TECHNIQUES FOR MARKER DETECTION</i>.â After the presence (or absence) of a particular marker allele in the biological sample is verified, the plant is selected, e.g., used to make progeny plants by selective breeding.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0219">Soybean plant breeders desire combinations of tolerance loci with genes for high yield and other desirable traits to develop improved soybean varieties. Screening large numbers of samples by non-molecular methods (e.g., trait evaluation in soybean plants) can be expensive, time consuming, and unreliable. Use of the polymorphic markers described herein, when genetically-linked to tolerance loci, provide an effective method for selecting resistant varieties in breeding programs. For example, one advantage of marker-assisted selection over field evaluations for tolerance resistance is that MAS can be done at any time of year, regardless of the growing season. Moreover, environmental effects are largely irrelevant to marker-assisted selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0220">When a population is segregating for multiple loci affecting one or multiple traits, e.g., multiple loci involved in tolerance, or multiple loci each involved in tolerance or resistance to different diseases, the efficiency of MAS compared to phenotypic screening becomes even greater, because all of the loci can be evaluated in the lab together from a single sample of DNA. In the present instance, the SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255 markers, as well as any of the chromosome intervals</p>

      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0000">can be assayed simultaneously or sequentially from a single sample or from a plurality of parallel samples.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0224">Another use of MAS in plant breeding is to assist the recovery of the recurrent parent genotype by backcross breeding. Backcross breeding is the process of crossing a progeny back to one of its parents or parent lines. Backcrossing is usually done for the purpose of introgressing one or a few loci from a donor parent (e.g., a parent comprising desirable tolerance marker loci) into an otherwise desirable genetic background from the recurrent parent (e.g., an otherwise high yielding soybean line). The more cycles of backcrossing that are done, the greater the genetic contribution of the recurrent parent to the resulting introgressed variety. This is often necessary, because tolerant plants may be otherwise undesirable, e.g., due to low yield, low fecundity, or the like. In contrast, strains which are the result of intensive breeding programs may have excellent yield, fecundity or the like, merely being deficient in one desired trait such as tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0225">The presence and/or absence of a particular genetic marker or allele, e.g., SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 and SATT255 markers, as well as any of the chromosome intervals</p>

If the nucleic acids from the plant are positive for a desired genetic marker allele, the plant can be self fertilized to create a true breeding line with the same genotype, or it can be crossed with a plant with the same marker or with other desired characteristics to create a sexually crossed hybrid generation.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0229">Introgression of Favorable AllelesâEfficient Backcrossing of Tolerance Markers into Elite Lines</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0230">One application of MAS, in the context of the present invention is to use the tolerance or improved tolerance markers to increase the efficiency of an introgression or backcrossing effort aimed at introducing a tolerance QTL into a desired (typically high yielding) background. In marker assisted backcrossing of specific markers (and associated QTL) from a donor source, e.g., to an elite or exotic genetic background, one selects among backcross progeny for the donor trait and then uses repeated backcrossing to the elite or exotic line to reconstitute as much of the elite/exotic background's genome as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0231">Thus, the markers and methods of the present invention can be utilized to guide marker assisted selection or breeding of soybean varieties with the desired complement (set) of allelic forms of chromosome segments associated with superior agronomic performance (tolerance, along with any other available markers for yield, disease resistance, etc.). Any of the disclosed marker alleles can be introduced into a soybean line via introgression, by traditional breeding (or introduced via transformation, or both) to yield a soybean plant with superior agronomic performance. The number of alleles associated with tolerance that can be introduced or be present in a soybean plant of the present invention ranges from 1 to the number of alleles disclosed herein, each integer of which is incorporated herein as if explicitly recited.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0232">The present invention also extends to a method of making a progeny soybean plant and these progeny soybean plants, per se. The method comprises crossing a first parent soybean plant with a second soybean plant and growing the female soybean plant under plant growth conditions to yield soybean plant progeny. Methods of crossing and growing soybean plants are well within the ability of those of ordinary skill in the art. Such soybean plant progeny can be assayed for alleles associated with tolerance and, thereby, the desired progeny selected. Such progeny plants or seed can be sold commercially for soybean production, used for food, processed to obtain a desired constituent of the soybean, or further utilized in subsequent rounds of breeding. At least one of the first or second soybean plants is a soybean plant of the present invention in that it comprises at least one of the allelic forms of the markers of the present invention, such that the progeny are capable of inheriting the allele.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0233">Often, a method of the present invention is applied to at least one related soybean plant such as from progenitor or descendant lines in the subject soybean plants pedigree such that inheritance of the desired tolerance allele can be traced. The number of generations separating the soybean plants being subject to the methods of the present invention will generally be from 1 to 20, commonly 1 to 5, and typically 1, 2, or 3 generations of separation, and quite often a direct descendant or parent of the soybean plant will be subject to the method (i.e., one generation of separation).</p>

      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0235">Genetic diversity is important for long term genetic gain in any breeding program. With limited diversity, genetic gain will eventually plateau when all of the favorable alleles have been fixed within the elite population. One objective is to incorporate diversity into an elite pool without losing the genetic gain that has already been made and with the minimum possible investment. MAS provide an indication of which genomic regions and which favorable alleles from the original ancestors have been selected for and conserved over time, facilitating efforts to incorporate favorable variation from exotic germplasm sources (parents that are unrelated to the elite gene pool) in the hopes of finding favorable alleles that do not currently exist in the elite gene pool.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0236">For example, the markers of the present invention can be used for MAS in crosses involving elite x exotic soybean lines by subjecting the segregating progeny to MAS to maintain major yield alleles, along with the tolerance marker alleles herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0241">These tolerance clones are first identified by their genetic linkage to markers of the present invention.

      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0242">For example, âpositional gene cloningâ uses the proximity of a tolerance marker to physically define an isolated chromosomal fragment containing a tolerance QTL gene. The isolated chromosomal fragment can be produced by such well known methods as digesting chromosomal DNA with one or more restriction enzymes, or by amplifying a chromosomal region in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or any suitable alternative amplification reaction. The digested or amplified fragment is typically ligated into a vector suitable for replication, and, e.g., expression, of the inserted fragment. Markers that are adjacent to an open reading frame (ORF) associated with a phenotypic trait can hybridize to a DNA clone (e.g., a clone from a genomic DNA library), thereby identifying a clone on which an ORF (or a fragment of an ORF) is located. If the marker is more distant, a fragment containing the open reading frame is identified by successive rounds of screening and isolation of clones which together comprise a contiguous sequence of DNA, a process termed âchromosome walkingâ, resulting in a âcontigâ or âcontig map.â Protocols sufficient to guide one of skill through the isolation of clones associated with linked markers are found in, e.g. Berger, Sambrook and Ausubel, all herein.</p>

Such vectors are, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a phagemid, an <i>agrobacterium</i>, a virus, a naked polynucleotide (linear or circular), or a conjugated polynucleotide. Vectors can be introduced into bacteria, especially for the purpose of propagation and expansion.

A thorough discussion of techniques relevant to bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes and cell culture is found in references enumerated herein and are briefly outlined as follows. Several well-known methods of introducing target nucleic acids into bacterial cells are available, any of which may be used in the present invention. These include: fusion of the recipient cells with bacterial protoplasts containing the DNA, treatment of the cells with liposomes containing the DNA, electroporation, projectile bombardment (biolistics), carbon fiber delivery, and infection with viral vectors (discussed further, below), etc. Bacterial cells can be used to amplify the number of plasmids containing DNA constructs of this invention. The bacteria are grown to log phase and the plasmids within the bacteria can be isolated by a variety of methods known in the art (see, for instance, Sambrook). In addition, a plethora of kits are commercially available for the purification of plasmids from bacteria. For their proper use, follow the manufacturer's instructions (see, for example, EASYPREPâ¢, FLEXIPREPâ¢, both from Pharmacia Biotech; STRATACLEANâ¢, from Stratagene; and, QIAPREPâ¢ from Qiagen). The isolated and purified plasmids are then further manipulated to produce other plasmids, used to transfect plant cells or incorporated into <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>related vectors to infect plants. Typical vectors contain transcription and translation terminators, transcription and translation initiation sequences, and promoters useful for regulation of the expression of the particular target nucleic acid. The vectors optionally comprise generic expression cassettes containing at least one independent terminator sequence, sequences permitting replication of the cassette in eukaryotes, or prokaryotes, or both, (e.g., shuttle vectors) and selection markers for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems.

      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0265">In construction of recombinant expression cassettes of the invention, which include, for example, helper plasmids comprising virulence functions, and plasmids or viruses comprising exogenous DNA sequences such as structural genes, a plant promoter fragment is optionally employed which directs expression of a nucleic acid in any or all tissues of a regenerated plant. Examples of constitutive promoters include the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S transcription initiation region, the 1â²- or 2â²-promoter derived from T-DNA of <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, and other transcription initiation regions from various plant genes known to those of skill. Alternatively, the plant promoter may direct expression of the polynucleotide of the invention in a specific tissue (tissue-specific promoters) or may be otherwise under more precise environmental control (inducible promoters). Examples of tissue-specific promoters under developmental control include promoters that initiate transcription only in certain tissues, such as fruit, seeds or flowers.</p>
      <p id="p-00275-en" num="0266">Any of a number of promoters which direct transcription in plant cells can be suitable. The promoter can be either constitutive or inducible. In addition to the promoters noted above, promoters of bacterial origin that operate in plants include the octopine synthase promoter, the nopaline synthase promoter and other promoters derived from native Ti plasmids. See, Herrara-Estrella et al. (1983), <i>Nature, </i>303:209. Viral promoters include the 35S and 19S RNA promoters of cauliflower mosaic virus. See, Odell et al. (1985) <i>Nature, </i>313:810. Other plant promoters include Kunitz trypsin inhibitor promoter (KTI), SCP1, SUP, UCD3, the ribulose-1,3-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit promoter and the phaseolin promoter. The promoter sequence from the E8 gene and other genes may also be used. The isolation and sequence of the E8 promoter is described in detail in Deikman and Fischer (1988) <i>EMBO J. </i>7:3315. Many other promoters are in current use and can be coupled to an exogenous DNA sequence to direct expression of the nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00276-en" num="0267">If expression of a polypeptide from a cDNA is desired, a polyadenylation region at the 3â²-end of the coding region is typically included. The polyadenylation region can be derived from the natural gene, from a variety of other plant genes, or from, e.g., T-DNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00277-en" num="0268">The vector comprising the sequences (e.g., promoters or coding regions) from genes encoding expression products and transgenes of the invention will typically include a nucleic acid subsequence, a marker gene which confers a selectable, or alternatively, a screenable, phenotype on plant cells. For example, the marker can encode biocide tolerance, particularly antibiotic tolerance, such as tolerance to kanamycin, G418, bleomycin, hygromycin, or herbicide tolerance, such as tolerance to chlorosluforon, or phosphinothricin (the active ingredient in the herbicides bialaphos or Basta).

For example, crop selectivity to specific herbicides can be conferred by engineering genes into crops that encode appropriate herbicide metabolizing enzymes from other organisms, such as microbes. See, Vasil (1996) In: <i>Herbicide</i>-<i>Resistant Crops </i>(Duke, ed.), pp 85-91, CRC Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton) (âVasilâ, 1996).</p>
      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0269">One of skill will recognize that after the recombinant expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic plants and confirmed to be operable, it can be introduced into other plants by sexual crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species to be crossed. In vegetatively propagated crops, mature transgenic plants can be propagated by the taking of cuttings or by tissue culture techniques to produce multiple identical plants. Selection of desirable transgenics is made and new varieties are obtained and propagated vegetatively for commercial use. In seed propagated crops, mature transgenic plants can be self-crossed to produce a homozygous inbred plant. The inbred plant produces seed containing the newly introduced heterologous nucleic acid. These seeds can be grown to produce plants that would produce the selected phenotype. Parts obtained from the regenerated plant, such as flowers, seeds, leaves, branches, fruit, and the like are included in the invention, provided that these parts comprise cells comprising the isolated nucleic acid of the present invention. Progeny and variants, and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the invention, provided that these parts comprise the introduced nucleic acid sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0270">Transgenic or introgressed plants expressing a polynucleotide of the present invention can be screened for transmission of the nucleic acid of the present invention by, for example, standard nucleic acid detection methods or by immunoblot protocols. Expression at the RNA level can be determined to identify and quantitate expression-positive plants. Standard techniques for RNA analysis can be employed and include RT-PCR amplification assays using oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify only heterologous or introgressed RNA templates and solution hybridization assays using marker or linked QTL specific probes. Plants can also be analyzed for protein expression, e.g., by Western immunoblot analysis using antibodies that recognize the encoded polypeptides. In addition, in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry according to standard protocols can be done using heterologous nucleic acid specific polynucleotide probes and antibodies, respectively, to localize sites of expression within transgenic tissue. Generally, a number of transgenic lines are usually screened for the incorporated nucleic acid to identify and select plants with the most appropriate expression profiles.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0271">A preferred embodiment of the invention is a transgenic plant that is homozygous for the added heterologous nucleic acid; e.g., a transgenic plant that contains two added nucleic acid sequence copies, e.g., a gene at the same locus on each chromosome of a homologous chromosome pair. A homozygous transgenic plant can be obtained by sexually mating (self-fertilizing) a heterozygous transgenic plant that contains a single added heterologous nucleic acid, germinating some of the seed produced and analyzing the resulting plants produced for altered expression of a polynucleotide of the present invention relative to a control plant (e.g., a native, non-transgenic plant). Back-crossing to a parental plant and out-crossing with a non-transgenic plant can be used to introgress the heterologous nucleic acid into a selected background (e.g., an elite or exotic soybean line).</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="2">Methods for Identifying <i>Fusarium Solani</i>-Tolerant Soybean Plants</heading>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0272">Experienced plant breeders can recognize tolerant soybean plants in the field, and can select the tolerant individuals or populations for breeding purposes or for propagation. In this context, the plant breeder recognizes âtolerantâ and ânon-tolerant,â or âsusceptibleâ soybean plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0273">Such plant breeding practitioners will appreciate that plant tolerance is a phenotypic spectrum consisting of extremes in tolerance, susceptibility and a continuum of intermediate tolerance phenotypes. Tolerance also varies due to environmental effects and the severity of pathogen infection. Evaluation of phenotypes using reproducible assays and tolerance scoring methods are of value to scientists who seek to identify genetic loci that impart tolerance, conduct marker assisted selection for tolerant population, and for introgression techniques to breed a tolerance trait into an elite soybean line, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0274">Various methods are known in the art for determining (and measuring) the tolerance of a soybean plant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. For example, Njiti et al. (2003) âRoundup Ready Soybean: Glyphosate Effects on <i>Fusarium solani </i>Root Colonization and Sudden Death Syndrome,â <i>Agron. J. </i>95(5):1140-1145 describe a tolerance measurement scale of 1-9, with 1=no disease and 9=total necrosis caused by <i>Fusarium solani</i>. In one preferred scale which is also in use, this numbering scale is reversed, i.e., 9=No disease; 8=very slight symptoms including virus like crinkling and small chlorotic spots; 7=larger chlorotic spots on less than 20% of the leaves; 6=browning and coalescing of spots; 5=extensive browning and curling of top leaves; 4=leaves dropping, lower leaves browning and curling; 3=top stem dying, lower leaves dropping; 2=middle stem dying; 1=plants are totally necrotic (dried up plant skeletons). It will be appreciated that all such scales are relative and that numbering and precise correlation to any scale can be performed at the discretion of the practitioner.</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0275">Typically, individual field tests are monitored for SDS symptoms during the middle to late vegetative stages, but such symptoms typically appear in the early reproductive stage (during flowering and early pod set). Data collection is usually done in 3 or 4 successive scorings about 7 days apart. Scorings continue until worsening symptoms can no longer be quantified or until the symptoms are confounded by other factors such as other diseases, insect pressure, severe weather, or advancing maturity.</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0276">In general, while there is a certain amount of subjectivity to assigning severity measurements for disease caused symptoms, assignment to a given scale as noted above is well within the skill of a practitioner in the field. Measurements can also be averaged across multiple scorers to reduce variation in field measurements. Furthermore, although protocols using artificial inoculation of field nurseries with <i>Fusarium solani </i>can certainly be used in assessing tolerance, it is also typical for tolerance ratings to be based on actual field observations of fortuitous natural disease incidence, with the information corresponding to disease incidence for a cultivar being averaged over many locations and, typically, several years of crop growing.</p>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0277">If there is no disease present, the rating system above is inapplicable, because everything in an uninfected field scores as tolerant. However, if SDS does occur in a specific field location, all of the lines at that location can be scored as noted above. These scores can accumulate over locations and years to show disease tolerance for given cultivars. Thus, older lines can have more years of observation than newer ones etc. However, relative measurements can easily be made using the scoring system noted above. Furthermore, the tolerance ratings can be updated and refined each year based on the previous year's observations in the field. Based on this, SDS scores for a cultivar are relative measurements of tolerance.</p>
      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0278">The experiments described herein (see, Example 1) score soybean tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection using the following scale: 9=no disease symptoms; 8=very slight symptoms including virus like crinkling and small chlorotic spots; 7=larger chlorotic spots on less than 20% of the leaves; 6=browning and coalescing of spots; 5=extensive browning and curling of top leaves; 4=leaves dropping, lower leaves browning and curling; 3=top stem dying, lower leaves dropping; 2=middle stem dying; 1=plants are totally necrotic (dried up plant skeletons).</p>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0279">In assessing linkage of markers to tolerance, either quantitative or qualitative approaches can be used. For example, an actual average rating for each line that is a single number (for each line) from 1 to 9 can be assessed for linkage. This approach is quantitative and uses the scores from lines that have both marker data and SDS scores. In an alternative approach, an âintergroupâ comparison of tolerant versus susceptible lines is used. In this approach, those soybean lines that are considered to be representative of either the tolerant of susceptible classes are used for assessing linkage. A list of tolerant lines is constructed, e.g., having average rating of 6 to 9 on the above scale (when averaged over years and locations). The susceptible lines are those with an average rating of 1 to 4 over years and locations. Only lines that can be reliably placed in the 2 groups are used. Once a line is included in the group, it is treated as an equal in that groupâi.e. the actual quantitative ratings are not used.</p>
      <p id="p-00289-en" num="0280">Lines are scored in field screening based both disease severity and disease incidence compiled into one score. Known susceptible and tolerant lines are placed in the field to verify the intensity and severity of the disease. Plots are scored on a 1 to 9 scale where 1=all plants showing foliar leaf symptoms with severe scorch while 9 equals no plants with foliar symptoms. This data is analyzed over years to develop a final characterization for variety.</p>
      <p id="p-00290-en" num="0281">The method described above can also easily be adapted to test whether plant tolerance is race-specific or non-race specific. For example, a candidate soybean strain can be tested for tolerance to a variety of previously identified <i>Fusarium </i>races, where the virulent races have been shown to infect formerly resistant soybean plants. In this case, a plurality of <i>Fusarium </i>races are used to inoculate the plant cultivars assessed in the assay. If the soybean plants are tolerant to all the <i>Fusarium </i>races tested, or to a subset of the races tested, the soybean strain can be considered to have non-race specific tolerance, or partially non-race specific tolerance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="2">Automated Detection/Correlation Systems of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00291-en" num="0282">In some embodiments, the present invention includes an automated system for detecting markers of the invention and/or correlating the markers with a desired phenotype (e.g., tolerance). Thus, a typical system can include a set of marker probes or primers configured to detect at least one favorable allele of one or more marker locus associated with tolerance or improved tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. These probes or primers are configured to detect the marker alleles noted in the tables and examples herein, e.g., using any available allele detection format, e.g., solid or liquid phase array based detection, microfluidic-based sample detection, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00292-en" num="0283">For example, in one embodiment, the marker locus is SATT300, SATT591, SATT155, SATT266, SATT282, SATT412, SATT506, SATT355, SATT452, S60602-TB, SATT142, SATT181, SATT448, S60375-TB, SATT513, SATT549, SATT660, SATT339 or SATT255, or any combination thereof, as well as any of the chromosome intervals:</p>
      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0284">(i) SATT300 and SATT155 (LG-A1);</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0285">(ii) SATT282 and SATT506 (LG-D1b); and</p>
      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0286">(iii) SATT549 and SATT255 (LG-N),</p>
      <p id="p-00296-en" num="0000">and the probe set is configured to detect the locus.</p>
      <p id="p-00297-en" num="0287">The typical system includes a detector that is configured to detect one or more signal outputs from the set of marker probes or primers, or amplicon thereof, thereby identifying the presence or absence of the allele. A wide variety of signal detection apparatus are available, including photo multiplier tubes, spectrophotometers, CCD arrays, arrays and array scanners, scanning detectors, phototubes and photodiodes, microscope stations, galvo-scans, microfluidic nucleic acid amplification detection appliances and the like. The precise configuration of the detector will depend, in part, on the type of label used to detect the marker allele, as well as the instrumentation that is most conveniently obtained for the user. Detectors that detect fluorescence, phosphorescence, radioactivity, pH, charge, absorbance, luminescence, temperature, magnetism or the like can be used. Typical detector embodiments include light (e.g., fluorescence) detectors or radioactivity detectors. For example, detection of a light emission (e.g., a fluorescence emission) or other probe label is indicative of the presence or absence of a marker allele. Fluorescent detection is especially preferred and is generally used for detection of amplified nucleic acids (however, upstream and/or downstream operations can also be performed on amplicons, which can involve other detection methods). In general, the detector detects one or more label (e.g., light) emission from a probe label, which is indicative of the presence or absence of a marker allele.</p>
      <p id="p-00298-en" num="0288">The detector(s) optionally monitors one or a plurality of signals from an amplification reaction. For example, the detector can monitor optical signals which correspond to âreal timeâ amplification assay results.</p>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0289">System instructions that correlate the presence or absence of the favorable allele with the predicted tolerance are also a feature of the invention. For example, the instructions can include at least one look-up table that includes a correlation between the presence or absence of the favorable alleles and the predicted tolerance or improved tolerance. The precise form of the instructions can vary depending on the components of the system, e.g., they can be present as system software in one or more integrated unit of the system (e.g., a microprocessor, computer or computer readable medium), or can be present in one or more units (e.g., computers or computer readable media) operably coupled to the detector. As noted, in one typical embodiment, the system instructions include at least one look-up table that includes a correlation between the presence or absence of the favorable alleles and predicted tolerance or improved tolerance. The instructions also typically include instructions providing a user interface with the system, e.g., to permit a user to view results of a sample analysis and to input parameters into the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0290">The system typically includes components for storing or transmitting computer readable data representing or designating the alleles detected by the methods of the present invention, e.g., in an automated system. The computer readable media can include cache, main, and storage memory and/or other electronic data storage components (hard drives, floppy drives, storage drives, etc.) for storage of computer code. Data representing alleles detected by the method of the present invention can also be electronically, optically, magnetically o transmitted in a computer data signal embodied in a transmission medium over a network such as an intranet or internet or combinations thereof. The system can also or alternatively transmit data via wireless, IR, or other available transmission alternatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0291">During operation, the system typically comprises a sample that is to be analyzed, such as a plant tissue, or material isolated from the tissue such as genomic DNA, amplified genomic DNA, cDNA, amplified cDNA, RNA, amplified RNA, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0292">The phrase âallele detection/correlation systemâ in the context of this invention refers to a system in which data entering a computer corresponds to physical objects or processes external to the computer, e.g., a marker allele, and a process that, within a computer, causes a physical transformation of the input signals to different output signals. In other words, the input data, e.g., amplification of a particular marker allele is transformed to output data, e.g., the identification of the allelic form of a chromosome segment. The process within the computer is a set of instructions, or âprogram,â by which positive amplification or hybridization signals are recognized by the integrated system and attributed to individual samples as a genotype. Additional programs correlate the identity of individual samples with phenotypic values or marker alleles, e.g., statistical methods. In addition there are numerous e.g., C/C++ programs for computing, Delphi and/or Java programs for GUI interfaces, and productivity tools (e.g., Microsoft EXCELâ¢ and/or SigmaPlot) for charting or creating look up tables of relevant allele-trait correlations. Other useful software tools in the context of the integrated systems of the invention include statistical packages such as SAS, Genstat, Matlab, Mathematica, and S-Plus and genetic modeling packages such as QU-GENE. Furthermore, additional programming languages such as visual basic are also suitably employed in the integrated systems of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0293">For example, tolerance marker allele values assigned to a population of progeny descending from crosses between elite lines are recorded in a computer readable medium, thereby establishing a database corresponding tolerance alleles with unique identifiers for members of the population of progeny. Any file or folder, whether custom-made or commercially available (e.g., from Oracle or Sybase) suitable for recording data in a computer readable medium is acceptable as a database in the context of the present invention. Data regarding genotype for one or more molecular markers, e.g., ASH, SSR, RFLP, RAPD, AFLP, SNP, isozyme markers or other markers as described herein, are similarly recorded in a computer accessible database. Optionally, marker data is obtained using an integrated system that automates one or more aspects of the assay (or assays) used to determine marker(s) genotype. In such a system, input data corresponding to genotypes for molecular markers are relayed from a detector, e.g., an array, a scanner, a CCD, or other detection device directly to files in a computer readable medium accessible to the central processing unit. A set of system instructions (typically embodied in one or more programs) encoding the correlations between tolerance and the alleles of the invention is then executed by the computational device to identify correlations between marker alleles and predicted trait phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0294">Typically, the system also includes a user input device, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, or the like, for, e.g., selecting files, retrieving data, reviewing tables of maker information, etc., and an output device (e.g., a monitor, a printer, etc.) for viewing or recovering the product of the statistical analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0295">Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides an integrated system comprising a computer or computer readable medium comprising set of files and/or a database with at least one data set that corresponds to the marker alleles herein. The system also includes a user interface allowing a user to selectively view one or more of these databases. In addition, standard text manipulation software such as word processing software (e.g., Microsoft WORDâ¢ or Corel WORDPERFECTâ¢) and database or spreadsheet software (e.g., spreadsheet software such as Microsoft EXCELâ¢, Corel QUATTRO PROâ¢, or database programs such as Microsoft ACCESSâ¢ or PARADOXâ¢) can be used in conjunction with a user interface (e.g., a GUI in a standard operating system such as a Windows, Macintosh, Unix or Linux system) to manipulate strings of characters corresponding to the alleles or other features of the database.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0296">The systems optionally include components for sample manipulation, e.g., incorporating robotic devices. For example, a robotic liquid control armature for transferring solutions (e.g., plant cell extracts) from a source to a destination, e.g., from a microtiter plate to an array substrate, is optionally operably linked to the digital computer (or to an additional computer in the integrated system). An input device for entering data to the digital computer to control high throughput liquid transfer by the robotic liquid control armature and, optionally, to control transfer by the armature to the solid support is commonly a feature of the integrated system. Many such automated robotic fluid handling systems are commercially available. For example, a variety of automated systems are available from Caliper Technologies (Hopkinton, Mass.), which utilize various Zymate systems, which typically include, e.g., robotics and fluid handling modules. Similarly, the common ORCAÂ® robot, which is used in a variety of laboratory systems, e.g., for microtiter tray manipulation, is also commercially available, e.g., from Beckman Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, Calif.). As an alternative to conventional robotics, microfluidic systems for performing fluid handling and detection are now widely available, e.g., from Caliper Technologies Corp. (Hopkinton, Mass.) and Agilent technologies (Palo Alto, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0297">Systems for molecular marker analysis of the present invention can, thus, include a digital computer with one or more of high-throughput liquid control software, image analysis software for analyzing data from marker labels, data interpretation software, a robotic liquid control armature for transferring solutions from a source to a destination operably linked to the digital computer, an input device (e.g., a computer keyboard) for entering data to the digital computer to control high throughput liquid transfer by the robotic liquid control armature and, optionally, an image scanner for digitizing label signals from labeled probes hybridized, e.g., to markers on a solid support operably linked to the digital computer. The image scanner interfaces with the image analysis software to provide a measurement of, e.g., nucleic acid probe label intensity upon hybridization to an arrayed sample nucleic acid population (e.g., comprising one or more markers), where the probe label intensity measurement is interpreted by the data interpretation software to show whether, and to what degree, the labeled probe hybridizes to a marker nucleic acid (e.g., an amplified marker allele). The data so derived is then correlated with sample identity, to determine the identity of a plant with a particular genotype(s) for particular markers or alleles, e.g., to facilitate marker assisted selection of soybean plants with favorable allelic forms of chromosome segments involved in agronomic performance (e.g., tolerance or improved tolerance).</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0298">Optical images, e.g., hybridization patterns viewed (and, optionally, recorded) by a camera or other recording device (e.g., a photodiode and data storage device) are optionally further processed in any of the embodiments herein, e.g., by digitizing the image and/or storing and analyzing the image on a computer. A variety of commercially available peripheral equipment and software is available for digitizing, storing and analyzing a digitized video or digitized optical image, e.g., using PC (Intel x86 or pentium chip-compatible DOSâ¢, OS2â¢ WINDOWSâ¢, WINDOWS NTâ¢ or WINDOWS95â¢ based machines), MACINTOSHâ¢, LINUX, or UNIX based (e.g., SUNâ¢ work station) computers.</p>

      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0300">Two independent allele frequency distribution analyses were undertaken to identify soybean genetic marker loci associated with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. By identifying such genetic markers, marker assisted selection (MAS) can be used to improve the efficiency of breeding for improved tolerance of soybean to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection.</p>
      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="2">Soybean Lines and Tolerance Scoring</heading>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0301">The plant varieties used in the analysis were from diverse sources, including elite germplasm, commercially released cultivars and other public lines representing a broad range of germplasm. The lines used in the study had a broad maturity range varying from group 0 to group 6.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0302">Two groups of soybean lines were assembled for each analysis based on their phenotypic extremes in tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infestation, where the plants were sorted into either highly susceptible or highly tolerant varieties. The classifications of tolerant and susceptible were based solely on observations of fortuitous, naturally occurring fields displaying disease incidence in greenhouse and field tests over several years. The degree of plant tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection varied widely, as measured using a scale from one (highly susceptible) to nine (highly tolerant). Generally, a score of two (2) indicated the most susceptible strains, and a score of seven (7) was assigned to the most tolerant lines. A score of one (1) was generally not used, as soybean strains with such extremely high susceptibility were not typically propagated. Tolerance scores of eight (8) and nine (9) were reserved for tolerance levels that are very rare and generally not observed in existing germplasm. If no disease was present in a field, no tolerance scoring was done. However, if a disease did occur in a specific field location, all of the lines in that location were scored. Scores for test strains accumulated over multiple locations and multiple years, and an averaged (e.g., consensus) score was ultimately assigned to each line.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0303">The following scale description was used as a guide in scoring the plants for <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection:</p>

The plants were scored in Streator, Il. At this site, the 93B35 and 93B53 lines were the key susceptibility checks, and 93M11 and 93B68 were key tolerant checks that were of similar RM as the RIL's.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0305">Individual fields showing <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection were monitored for disease symptoms during the reproductive stages, but the majority of scoring was typically done in the R4 and R7 stages. Data collection was typically done in 3 successive scorings about 7 days apart. Scorings continued until worsening symptoms can no longer be quantified or until the symptoms are confounded by other factors such as other diseases, insect pressure, severe weather, or advancing maturity. Scoring was done until leaf senescence at maturity.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0306">In assessing linkage of markers to tolerance, a qualitative âintergroup allele frequency distributionâ comparison approach was used. Using this approach, those soybean lines that were considered to be representative of either the tolerant or susceptible classes were used for assessing linkage. A list of tolerant lines was constructed, where strains having a tolerance score of 6 or greater were considered âtolerant.â Similarly, soybean lines with scores of four or less were collectively considered susceptible. Only lines that could be reliably placed into the two groups were used. Once a line is included in the âtolerantâ or âsusceptibleâ group, it was treated as an equal in that group, i.e., the actual quantitative ratings was not used.</p>

      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0310">An âIntergroup Allele Frequency Distributionâ analysis was conducted using GENEFLOWâ¢ version 7.0 software. An intergroup allele frequency distribution analysis provides a method for finding non-random distributions of alleles between two phenotypic groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0311">During processing, a contingency table of allele frequencies is constructed and from this a G-statistic and probability are calculated (the G statistic is adjusted by using the William's correction factor). The probability value is adjusted to take into account the fact that multiple tests are being done (thus, there is some expected rate of false positives). The adjusted probability is proportional to the probability that the observed allele distribution differences between the two classes would occur by chance alone. The lower that probability value, the greater the likelihood that the <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection phenotype and the marker will co-segregate. A more complete discussion of the derivation of the probability values can be found in the GENEFLOWâ¢ version 7.0 software documentation. See, also, Sokal and Rolf (1981), <i>Biometry: The Principles and Practices of Statistics in Biological Research, </i>2nd ed., San Francisco, W. H. Freeman and Co.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0312">The underlying logic is that markers with significantly different allele distributions between the tolerant and susceptible groups (i.e., non-random distributions) might be associated with the trait and can be used to separate them for purposes of marker assisted selection of soybean lines with previously uncharacterized tolerance or susceptibility to <i>Fusarium solani </i>SDS. The present analysis examined one marker locus at a time and determined if the allele distribution within the tolerant group is significantly different from the allele distribution within the susceptible group. A statistically different allele distribution is an indication that the marker is linked to a locus that is associated with reaction to <i>Sclerotinia </i>stem rot. In this analysis, unadjusted probabilities less than one are considered significant (the marker and the phenotype show linkage disequilibrium), and adjusted probabilities less than approximately 0.05 are considered highly significant. Allele classes represented by less than 5 observations across both groups were not included in the statistical analysis. In this analysis, 509 marker loci had enough observations for analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0313">This analysis compares the plants' phenotypic score with the genotypes at the various loci. This type of intergroup analysis neither generates nor requires any map data. Subsequently, map data (for example, a composite soybean genetic map) is relevant in that multiple significant markers that are also genetically linked can be considered as collaborating evidence that a given chromosomal region is associated with the trait of interest.</p>

      <heading id="h-00029-en" level="1">DISCUSSION</heading>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0316">There are a number of ways to use the information provided in this analysis for the development of improved soybean varieties. One application is to use the associated markers (or more based on a higher probability cutoff value) as candidates for mapping QTL in specific populations that are segregating for plants having tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. In this application, one proceeds with conventional QTL mapping in a segregating population, but focusing on the markers that are associated with <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection tolerance, instead of using markers that span the entire genome. This makes mapping efforts more cost-effective by dramatically reducing lab resources committed to the project. For example, instead of screening segregating populations with a large set of markers that spans the entire genome, one would screen with only those few markers that met some statistical cutoff in the intergroup allele association study. This will not only reduce the cost of mapping but will also eliminate false leads that will undoubtedly occur with a large set of markers. In any given cross, it is likely that only a small subset of the associated markers will actually be correlated with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Once the few relevant markers are identified in any tolerant parent, future marker assisted selection (MAS) efforts can focus on only those markers that are important for that source of tolerance. By pre-selecting lines that have the allele associated with tolerance via MAS, one can eliminate the undesirable susceptible lines and concentrate the expensive field testing resources on lines that have a higher probability of being tolerant to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection.</p>

      <heading id="h-00031-en" level="1">Association Mapping Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0317">An association mapping strategy was undertaken to identify soybean genetic markers associated with tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection, which is the causative agent of soybean sudden death syndrome (SDS). The study was completed twice, generating two independent data sets. By identifying such genetic markers, marker assisted selection (MAS) can be used to improve the efficiency of breeding for improved tolerance of soybean to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Association mapping is known in the art, and is described in various sources, e.g., Jorde (2000), Genome Res., 10:1435-1444; Remington et al. (2001), âStructure of linkage disequilibrium and phenotype associations in the maize genome,â Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:11479-11484; and Weiss and Clark (2002), Trends in Genetics 18:19-24.</p>
      <heading id="h-00032-en" level="2">Association Mapping</heading>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0318">Understanding the extent and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome is a prerequisite for developing efficient association approaches to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) refers to the non-random association of alleles in a collection of individuals. When LD is observed among alleles at linked loci, it is measured as LD decay across a specific region of a chromosome. The extent of the LD is a reflection of the recombinational history of that region. The average rate of LD decay in a genome can help predict the number and density of markers that are required to undertake a genome-wide association study and provides an estimate of the resolution that can be expected.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0319">Association or LD mapping aims to identify significant genotype-phenotype associations. It has been exploited as a powerful tool for fine mapping in outcrossing species such as humans (Corder et al. (1994) âProtective effect of apolipoprotein-E type-2 allele for late-onset Alzheimer-disease,â Nat Genet 7: 180-184; Hastbacka et al., (1992) âLinkage disequilibrium mapping in isolated founder populations: diastrophic dysplasia in Finland,â Nat Genet 2:204-211; Kerem et al., (1989) âIdentification of the cystic fibrosis gene: genetic analysis,â Science 245:1073-1080) and maize (Remington et al., (2001) âStructure of linkage disequilibrium and phenotype associations in the maize genome,â Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98:11479-11484; Thornsberry et al. (2001) âDwarf8 polymorphisms associate with variation in flowering time,â Nat Genet 28:286-289; reviewed by Flint-Garcia et al. (2003) âStructure of linkage disequilibrium in plants,â Annu Rev Plant Biol., 54:357-374), where recombination among heterozygotes is frequent and results in a rapid decay of LD. In inbreeding species where recombination among homozygous genotypes is not genetically detectable, the extent of LD is greater (i.e., larger blocks of linked markers are inherited together) and this dramatically lowers the resolution of association mapping (Wall and Pritchard (2003) âHaplotype blocks and linkage disequilibrium in the human genome,â Nat Rev Genet 4:587-597).</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0320">The recombinational and mutational history of a population is a function of the mating habit, as well as the effective size and age of a population. Large population sizes offer enhanced possibilities for detecting recombination, while older populations are generally associated with higher levels of polymorphism, both of which contribute to observably accelerated rates of LD decay. On the other hand, smaller effective population sizes, i.e., those that have experienced a recent genetic bottleneck, tend to show a slower rate of LD decay, resulting in more extensive haplotype conservation (Flint-Garcia et al. (2003) âStructure of linkage disequilibrium in plants,â Annu Rev Plant Biol., 54:357-374).</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0321">Elite breeding lines provide a valuable starting point for association analyses. Association analyses use quantitative phenotypic scores (e.g., disease tolerance rated from one to nine for each soybean line) in the analysis (as opposed to looking only at tolerant versus resistant allele frequency distributions in intergroup allele distribution types of analysis). The availability of detailed phenotypic performance data collected by breeding programs over multiple years and environments for a large number of elite lines provides a valuable dataset for genetic marker association mapping analyses. This paves the way for a seamless integration between research and application and takes advantage of historically accumulated data sets. However, an understanding of the relationship between polymorphism and recombination is useful in developing appropriate strategies for efficiently extracting maximum information from these resources.</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0322">This type of association analysis neither generates nor requires any map data, but rather, is independent of map position. This analysis compares the plants' phenotypic score with the genotypes at the various loci. Subsequently, any suitable soybean map (for example, a composite map) can optionally be used to help observe distribution of the identified QTL markers and/or QTL marker clustering using previously determined map locations of the markers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00033-en" level="2">Soybean Lines and Phenotypic Scoring</heading>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0323">Soybean lines were phenotypically scored based on their degree of tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection (in contrast to simple categorization of âtolerantâ or âsusceptibleâ). The plant varieties used in the analysis were from diverse sources, including elite germplasm, commercially released cultivars and other public varieties. The collections comprised 205 soybean lines, or alternatively, 177 lines in the two analyses. The lines used in the study had a broad maturity range varying from group 0 to group 6, but typically lines at R3 (2 years from commercial product) or above were used.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0324">The tolerance scoring was based solely on observations in fortuitous, naturally occurring fields displaying disease incidence in multienvironmental field tests over several years. The degree of plant tolerance to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infestation varied widely, as measured using a scale from one (1; highly susceptible) to nine (9; highly tolerant). Generally, a score of two (2) indicated the most susceptible strains, and a score of seven (8) was assigned to the most tolerant lines. A score of one (1) was generally not used, as soybean strains with such extremely high susceptibility were not typically propagated. A tolerance score of nine (9) was reserved for tolerance levels that are very rare and generally not observed in existing germplasm. A description of the scale used as a guide in scoring the plants for <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection is provided in EXAMPLE 1. If no disease was present in a field, no tolerance scoring was done. However, if disease did occur in a specific field location, all of the lines in that location were scored. Tolerance scores for the reference strains accumulated over multiple locations and years, and an averaged (e.g., consensus) score was ultimately assigned to each line. Tolerance scores for the 205 variety collection or the 177 variety collection were collected over a single grow season.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0325">Individual fields showing <i>Fusarium solani </i>infestation were monitored for disease symptoms during the reproductive stages, but were typically scored in the R4 to R7 stages.

The term âlikelihoodâ of âoddsâ is used to describe the relative probability of two or more explanations of the sources of variation in a trait. The probability of these two different explanations (models) can be computed, and most likely model chosen. If model A is 1000 times more probable than model B, then the ratio of the odds are 1000:1 and the logarithm of the odds ratio is 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0341">Both the raw data and the composite score were used in QTL interval mapping. The LRS threshold for raw data and composite score at P=0.05 is 13.2 and 12.9, respectively. A confidence interval was estimated for each QTL by bootstrap resampling. After completing the interval mapping, the program will create multiple resampled datasets, perform interval mapping again with each of these sets, and record the position of the maximum LRS. The positions obtained are then plotted as a histogram overlaying the interval mapping figure.</p>

      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0342">QTL Interval Mapping</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0343">The present study identified various chromosome intervals that correlate with QTL that associate with tolerance/susceptibility to <i>Fusarium solani </i>infection. Two QTL were identified using both raw data and composite scores. These QTL for raw data and composite scores are essentially same. One QTL is in the vicinity of the Rhg1 locus on LG-G. There is a broad support interval of this QTL with multiple peaks, indicating that there might be multiple QTL in this region. This QTL explains 10% of the total variation with a favorable allele from the 93B41 strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0344">Another QTL is identified on LG-L roughly between SATT166 and SATT513. This QTL explains 9% of the total variation with the favorable allele from strain 9362.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0345">Single Marker Regression</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0346">Using single marker regression, there are a number of markers showing association with the tolerance phenotype at a confidence level of P=0.05 or better, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. These markers include clusterings on LG-L and LG-N. There is a concordance of the QTL interval mapping results and the single marker regression results for the markers on LG-L.</p>
      <heading id="h-00043-en" level="1">DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0347">This present study has identified chromosome intervals and individual markers that correlate with <i>Fusarium solani </i>tolerance. Markers that lie within these intervals are useful for use in MAS, as well as other purposes.</p>
