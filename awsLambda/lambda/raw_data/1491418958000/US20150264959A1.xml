      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to frozen products. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to apparatus and method for dispensing shaved frozen products or desserts.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ice and snow based confectionaries have long been eaten as a refreshing delicacy. Within this segment of confectionaries are ice cream, snow cones, slushies and shaved ice. This segment of confectionaries also includes treats shaved from a frozen block, commonly known as âshaved snow.â Conventionally, frozen block machines make the shaved snow type of confection by shaving long ribbons (sometimes described as having a cotton-candy like texture) off of a frozen block of product. These machines typically involve placing a frozen block in a hopper and then, using a manual or motor mechanism, rotate the frozen block against the blade to produce the shaved ribbon of ice. Typically, the frozen blocks of product will include dairy or non-dairy creamer to achieve the desired consistency and may also include one or more flavorings. In some cases, flavorings (or additional flavorings) may be applied to the shaved snow after it is shaved from the frozen block.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, conventional frozen block machines are unable to provide multiple flavors and controlled portion size shaved snow products. Conventional frozen block machines are usually only able to contain and shave one frozen block at a time. Additionally, conventional machines require the operator to load a new frozen block into the shaver every time a different frozen block is desired, for example, for dairy or non-dairy or differing flavors or the like. Further, when flavored blocks are used, the flavored frozen block must be returned to a freezer after the serving is shaved in order to avoid melting and/or comply with food sanitation requirements.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Typically, every time a different frozen block is used it may be necessary to clean the blade and base assembly in order to ensure that there is not a mix of different products. This can be particularly important when dealing with food allergies, such as an allergy to dairy products. Furthermore, cleaning of conventional machines can be an issue, particularly when the frozen blocks contain dairy products.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is, therefore, desirable to provide an apparatus and method for dispensing shaved frozen products which is intended to address at least one of the disadvantages of conventional frozen block machines.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a first aspect, the present disclosure provides an apparatus for dispensing shaved frozen product including: a dispensing area; and a refrigerated area having: a plurality of shaving units; and a platform, operatively connected to each of the plurality of shaving units and configured to allow each shaving unit to rotate.</p>
