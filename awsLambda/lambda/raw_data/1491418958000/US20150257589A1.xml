    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to an electrically operated kitchen appliance with a cooking vessel and a lid for the cooking vessel, wherein the lid can be locked in the closed position against the cooking vessel, wherein the cooking vessel furthermore has a cooking vessel base and a cooking vessel wall extending upwards from the base, wherein the cooking vessel wall transitions into a radially projecting cooking vessel edge, wherein the lid furthermore has a lid edge, which covers the cooking vessel edge in the closed position, wherein the lock is furthermore formed by a locking part acting on the lid.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Kitchen appliances of the type in question are known. In particular in the household sector, they serve to make or prepare dishes, for the purpose of which the cooking vessel, which can be assigned to the kitchen appliance, is designed to accommodate food, for example food to be cooked or fluids. In particular in the case of heatable cooking vessels for kitchen appliances, high pressures are to some extent reached within the vessel, in particular in the course of the cooking process. If a mixer is also assigned to the cooking vessel in particular in the base area, a liquid column might possible act on the base side against the lid, which is attached to the cooking vessel during mixing operation. Said lid must be locked accordingly to the cooking vessel, with said lock being able to accommodate the pressures, which might be created in the cooking vessel, or the forces, which act on the lid, respectively. Solutions, in the case of which the lid can be fixed to the cooking vessel, for example via a bayonet-like twistlock, are known in this context.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A kitchen appliance of the type in question is furthermore known from DE 10210442, for example. A further locking possibility using a hinged section, which acts on the lid, is known from DE 102011051149 A1, for example. Preferably, this is a roller arrangement, which can be rotated about a hinged section longitudinal axis, with said roller-like locking part reaches in particular over the lid edge to secure the same vertically on the top in the lid locked position. The entire content of the afore-mentioned patent applications is hereby included in the disclosure of the instant invention, also for the purpose of including features of these patent applications into claims of the instant invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">With regard to the above-described state of the art, a technical problem of the invention is seen in further improving a kitchen appliance of the type in question, in particular with regard to the lid handling of the mixing vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">According to a first idea of the invention, a possible solution of the task is at hand in the case of a kitchen appliance, which focuses on provision being made for a hinged section, which interacts with the lid edge and which can be operated by an electric motor, for pivoting the lid from a closed position into an open position by means of a motor and for the lid to be capable of being removed from the hinged section by the user non-destructively. As a result of this embodiment, a kitchen appliance having an increased serviceability is specified. In particular the handling of the lid, which spans the cooking vessel during operation, is substantially simplified. A hinged section, which is assigned to the kitchen appliance, for displacing the lid from a closed position into an open position by pivoting and preferably beyond that also from an open position into the closed position, provides the user with the possibility of exposing the interior of the cooking vessel, without hereby grabbing the lid itself. The lid is pivoted in particular from the closed position into an at least largely releasing open position, which releases the interior of the vessel, via the hinged section, this furthermore in particular about a pivot axis, which runs at right angles to the central cooking vessel axis. The controlling of the hinged section, which preferably takes place by means of electric motor, provides for an advantageous handling. A corresponding pivoting of the lid from the one position into the other position can thus preferably be reached by pushing a button, wherein intermediate positions between the closed position and the open position of the lid can also be assumed in a further preferred embodiment. The lid can be removed from the hinged section by the user without tools, further in particular non-destructively in particular in the open position, so as to be able to clean the lid in a very simple manner, for example. If applicable, a common kitchen tool, in particular a tool, which can be used in the context with the kitchen appliance, such as, for example a spatula or the like, which supports the turning over of food to be cooked in the cooking vessel, serves to remove the lid from the hinged section. In preferred embodiment in the assigned position, the lid edge, which is preferably circumferential as a whole, continues to the hinged section so as to cover the hinged section, this in its given geometric outline in the form of an arch. In a preferred embodiment, an undirected assignment of the lid to the hinged section can thus be attained, in particular in the case of a completely circular outline of the lid, in particular of the lid edge. Due to the interaction of hinged section and lid in the area of the lid edge, the lid surface, in particular the central lid area, remains substantially uninfluenced by the hinged section acting on the lid in the preferred embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Further features of the invention are explained below, also in the description of the figures, oftentimes in their preferred assignment to the subject matter of claim <b>1</b> or to the features of further claims. However, they can also be significant in an assignment to only individual features of claim <b>1</b> or of the respective further claim or in each case independently.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Provision is thus made in a further preferred embodiment for the hinged section to act on the lid edge by means of a positive locking or frictional connection for holding the lid, wherein the hinged section can remain at the kitchen appliance after removing the lid. Accordingly, the lid is preferably held on the hinged section so as to be capable of being detached, preferably via the embodiment of a positive locking or frictional connection. In a preferred embodiment, the hinged section itself is part of the kitchen appliance, accordingly remains at the latter even if the lid is removed. In the alternative, the hinged section or at least a partial section of the hinged section can be removed individually or also together with the lid.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The frictional connection is preferably reached by means of a detent or a magnetic adhesion, wherein, in the case of a detent, provision is more preferably made in the hinged section for a detent part, which can escape against spring force and which interacts with a detent recess in the area of the lid edge. The part, which escapes against spring force, can hereby be a separate part. In the alternative, this part is formed by the spring itself, in particular a spring arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The hinged section encompasses a pivot axis, wherein the hinged section is more preferably embodied so as to be elongated in the direction of extension of the pivot axis, thus further in particular so as to be cylindrically elongated.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a further preferred embodiment, the hinged section, which displaces the lid from the closed position into the open position, is simultaneously the locking part of the lid at the cooking vessel or at the kitchen appliance, respectively, in the cooking vessel closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Provision is made in a further preferred embodiment for the geometric axis of the hinged section in its extension to be adapted to a plane, which is spanned by a lid edge. Preferably, the hinged section extends at least partially in a plane, which accommodates the lid edge and/or the vessel edge circumferentially, said plane being oriented at right angles to a vertically oriented vessel axis in preferred embodiment. More preferably, the geometric axis runs horizontally here or at an incline to a horizontal axis, more preferably assuming an acute angle of between 1° and 15° or up to 30°, more preferably running parallel to the plane with a tolerance of preferably between ±0.5° and 30°.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Provision is preferably also made for the geometric axis to be arranged outside of the vessel wall. This geometric axis extends in particular at a radial distance to an outer surface of the vessel wall, more preferably at a radial distance outside of the vessel wall section, which is assigned to the geometric axis by height, so that, in a possible embodiment, preferably at a vertical distance, above and/or below the geometric axis in a vertical projection—with reference to a use position of the vessel—the geometric axis does indeed affect an area of the vessel wall or also permeates it. Provision is more preferably also made for the geometric axis to permeate the vessel wall in the area of the vessel wall section, which is assigned to the axis by height, more preferably such that the geometric axis, viewed across its extension, extends with a partial section through the interior of the vessel, wherein, more preferably, at least a further partial section of the geometric axis extends in corresponding extension by permeating the vessel wall outside the latter.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In a further preferred embodiment, provision is made for a positive locking to be reached in the locked position, wherein at least a partial section of the hinged section overlaps the lid, in particular the lid edge in the manner of a positive locking. In the initial position of the lid, which is not stressed during the operation of the kitchen appliance by means of pressure application or the like from the inside, the section of the hinged section, which interacts with the lid edge, preferably does not act as a frictional connection, even though, in an alternative embodiment, such a frictional connection can be attained in addition to the positive locking as a function of the embodiment of the seal acting between lid and vessel wall or vessel edge, respectively, if applicable. To form the positive locking, in particular the section of the hinged section, which serves to lock, is adapted in form to the lid edge, which is to be overlapped, with regard to a vertical cross section at least in sections.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Provision is preferably also made for the hinged section to be rotatably drivable from the released position into the locked position and vice versa from one or both end areas. Directly acting upon the hinged section, but possibly also acting on a section, which extends the hinged section, for example a drive shaft, which is connected to the hinged section in a form-locking manner, the hinged section can be seized by the user by hand so as to displace it or, as an alternative or combination thereto, it can be driven by means of an electric motor, which is assigned, more preferably provided accordingly in the kitchen appliance. In the event of a rotary drive via an electric motor on the kitchen appliance side, the displacement of the hinged section into the locked position or from the locked position into the released position preferably takes place by pushing a button or the like, more preferably automatically by turning on the kitchen appliance or start-up, respectively, of a heater of the kitchen appliance and/or of a mixer of the kitchen appliance. If provision is furthermore, and preferably, made for a lid detection, a start-up of the kitchen appliance (heater and/or mixer) is possible only if the lid is attached and locked properly. In addition, the geometric axis preferably extends below the vessel edge, more preferably at a vertical distance to an opening plane of the vessel, with said distance preferably corresponding to one-twentieth to one-fifth of the largest diameter in the area of the vessel edge.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The hinged section encompass an overlap section, which, in the locked section, is guided across the lid edge to secure the latter. In this context, it is preferred for at least two overlap sections to set in at the hinged section in circumferential direction of the lid edge at a distance from one another in the locked state. In the locked position, a securing overlapping of the lid or of the lid edge, respectively, at two points, which are spaced apart from one another in circumferential direction, is thus attained. Preferably, each overlap section overlaps the lid edge with a vertical play in the range of a tenth of a millimeter, more preferably with a vertical play of between 0.1 and 1 mm, wherein the play is further chosen such that a vertical movability of the lid is permitted during the operation of the kitchen appliance, without hereby impacting the tightness, which is ensured by means of the preferred radial seal. Due to the vertical play between overlap section and lid edge, which is preferably provided, the overlap section overlaps freely without frictionally engaged or force-locking interaction with the lid edge in the course of the locking displacement of the hinged section as well as in the locked position.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In the locked state, the outermost locking areas of the hinged section are more preferably spaced apart from one another by 1/10 to ½ of the lid diameter, more preferably by ⅛ to ⅓, more preferably by ¼ of the lid diameter or of the mean extension rate of the lid, viewed at right angles to the vertical axis of the cooking vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">It is also preferred for the hinged section to cover the lid edge with a circular arc-like cross section across an area of between 30 and 90° and/or to move towards it, wherein, more preferably, in particular one overlap section is oriented concentrically to the axis of rotation of the hinged section. More preferably, the vessel edge and/or the lid edge also extend at least approximately concentrically to the axis of rotation of the hinged section in a vertical section, more preferably in the assigned position of the vessel and lid, wherein, in particular in response to a corresponding vertical cross section embodiment of the lid edge as a result of the preferably concentric orientation of lid edge and overlap section, the latter more preferably overlaps the lid edge across the entire displacement path at a vertical distance of a few tenth of a millimeter.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">More preferably, the locked position as well as the released position of the hinged section are stop-limited, in particular as a result of the design measures at the hinged section and/or at the partners, which interact with the hinged section, such as cooking vessel and/or lid. In the case of a drive by means of an electric motor, the rotational limitation of the hinged section can further also in particular be formed as a result of the embodiment of the electric motor as actuator, with said actuator allowing only for a rotation-limited displacement of the hinged section. If the stop in the locked position is embodied at the lid, it can simultaneously also serve as detecting means. If a displacement of the hinged section beyond the stop position, in particular by means of an electric motor, is possible, the stop is missing and thus the lid, with the locking path, which is too long, being detected by means of a corresponding sensor system.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In one embodiment, two hinged sections are arranged opposite one another relative to a center axis of the cooking vessel, wherein, as a whole, an at least four-point locking of the lid to the cooking vessel is attained. The axes of the two hinged sections hereby preferably run parallel to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In a further alternative, provision is made for two hinged sections located opposite one another, wherein the axes of the hinged sections draw an acute angle relating to a top view onto the cooking vessel or onto the lid, respectively, thus in particular an acute angle of between 30 and 60°, more preferably approximately 45°. Provision is hereby made for at least four sections, which overlap the lid edge, distributed across the circumference, wherein, in a more preferred embodiment relating to a top view, provision is made opposite an intersection point of the two locking axes for a stationary overlap, from which a preferred 5-point lock of the lid follows accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">It is further preferred for the cooking vessel to be held in vertical direction by means of the hinged section, so as to be able to compensate the required length tolerances between cooking vessel and the housing of the kitchen appliance, which accommodates the cooking vessel, on the underside of the vessel in a specific manner. Provision is made for this purpose for the hinged section to encompass one or a plurality of contact areas for the vessel edge, so that, in a preferred embodiment, the cooking vessel hangs at the hinged section, more preferably at the hinged sections, so as to hang, as it were, this more preferably in the case of a corresponding circumferential setting of the cooking vessel in particular in the lower area, which faces the base of the vessel. Preferably, the contact area is embodied in a spherical head-shaped or convex manner. Relating to a vertical cross section, it is furthermore in particular embodied for supporting the correspondingly form-adapted vessel edge in a positive manner. Relating to the longitudinal extension of the hinged section, this contact area is preferably embodied in the center between the outermost locking areas, so that, after a displacement of the hinged section into the locked position, the overlap sections overlap the lid edge accordingly, viewed in circumferential direction of the lid, spaced apart evenly thereto on both sides of the contact area.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In a further embodiment, the hinged section preferably encompasses two contact areas for the vessel edge, offset across the circumference of the vessel edge, this more preferably in context with a geometric axis, which permeates the vessel wall. More preferably viewed in the direction of extension of the axis, these preferred two contact areas are embodied upstream of and downstream from the permeation locations of the geometric axis through the vessel wall, this more preferably in a point-type manner, furthermore, as is also preferred in the case of only one contact area, in a linear manner. In particular a cleaning of a hinged section, which is embodied in this manner, is further improved through this.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In addition, a total of at least a four-point contact is attained by means of the preferred arrangement of two contact areas, more preferably in the case of the arrangement of two hinged sections, whereby a sufficient stability is attained in a preferred embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Provision is made in a further preferred embodiment for the pivot effect on the lid to occur via an acting part, which is provided in the hinged section and which optionally acts on the lid edge. Preferably, the acting part is adjusted such or can be adjusted such, respectively, that it optionally acts on the lid edge for entraining the lid in the course of the pivoting or releases the lid edge to remove the lid from the hinged section. Provision can hereby be made on the hinged section for only one acting part. Preferably, a plurality, more preferably two acting parts, are assigned to a hinged section, in a preferred embodiment at a distance to one another in the direction of extension of the pivot axis of the hinged section.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Preferably, the acting part is embodied so as to be resilient in pivot direction-direction of rotation of the hinged section, wherein the spring force is more preferably adjusted such that a secure pivot-rotation entrainment of the lid can be attained via the acting part. In a preferred embodiment, the acting part as a whole is thus a spring, more preferably a coil spring, wherein, in the latter case, the coil spring acts on the assigned section of the lid edge via a free spring leg to pivot-entrain the lid.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In preferred embodiment, the acting part, which is embodied so as to be resilient, further in particular a spring arm of an acting part, which is embodied in a resilient manner, can be moved between an acting position, which reaches under the lid, and a lid release position by operating in particular the hinged section by means of an electric motor. In the acting position, the lid is clamped in the area of its lid edge between the acting part or between the acting parts, respectively, and sections of the hinged section, which are stationary relative to the acting parts. In interaction with the hinged section, the acting part or acting parts act on the lid edge in a pinching manner, so to speak. Due to further displacement in particular of the hinged section by means of an electric motor, more preferably beyond a predefined lid open position, the acting part is moved into a lid release position, in which the pinching effect on the lid edge is eliminated. After this, the user can remove the lid from the hinged section in a very simple manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">More preferably, the movement between the acting position and the release position is hereby attained when the acting part moves across the lid edge so as to overlap it. For this purpose, the acting part is preferably acted upon by means of an electric motor in such a manner that, in a preferably stop-limited final pivoting position of the lid and of the hinged section acting thereon, the further rotational impact on the acting part has the result that in particular the section of the acting part, which acts on the lid edge, slips, so that in particular this section loses the position, which reaches under the lid edge and, as is more preferable, assumes a position, which at least partially overlaps the lid edge. The clamping effect in the area of the lid edge is eliminated through this. Due to opposite effect of rotation on the acting part, the clamping acting position can be reached by corresponding overlapping overtraveling towards the lid edge underside, if the lid is inserted into the hinged section again.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As a result of one or also of a plurality of the above-described features, an automatic lid lifting mechanism is created, which, if required, lifts the lid, so as to facilitate the refilling of large-volume ingredients into the cooking vessel, for example. When closing the lid, the lid positioning and thus also the sealing positioning is preferably assumed automatically. During the cooking operation, the direct contact of the user with the lid, which might be hot, is reduced to a minimum, wherein the lid preferably remains at the appliance during the entire food preparation. The lid needs to be removed from the appliance only for intermediate and/or final cleaning. In a preferred embodiment, food residues adhering to the lid can drip back into the cooking vessel in the open state of the lid. As a result of pivoting the lid into an open position, the cooking vessel can also be removed from the appliance and can be assigned to it again at any time. Because it remains on the appliance, the lid does not require any additional storage space; it furthermore does not create any additional contaminations on a storage space. At the same time, the proposed embodiment and impact of the acting part preferably forms an overload protection, thus preferably protects the upright lid against being damaged in response to external influences by overlapping.</p>

      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In particular during operation of the mixer <b>7</b> and/or of the heater <b>8</b>, the vessel <b>6</b> is furthermore closed by means of a lid <b>10</b>. Said lid encompasses a filling opening <b>11</b>, preferably centrally, accommodating the vertical axis x of the vessel <b>6</b>, this more preferably in the case of a layout of the lid <b>10</b>, which, as a whole, substantially has the shape of a circular disc.</p>

In the assigned position, the lid <b>10</b> is supported via the lid edge <b>15</b> thereof on the vessel edge <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Albeit not illustrated, provision is made at the lid <b>10</b> or in the area of the vessel edge <b>13</b> for a seal, in particular for arranging the lid <b>10</b> on the vessel <b>6</b> in a fluid-tight manner. Typically, such a seal consists of a soft plastic material, for example of a thermoplastic elastomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In particular during operation of the kitchen appliance, furthermore in particular during the mixer and/or heating operation, the lid <b>10</b>, which is attached to the vessel <b>6</b>, must be locked, because, if applicable, high forces can be created in the vessel <b>6</b> during operation of the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>, for example due to a comminution process by means of the mixer <b>7</b> and/or by means of a fluid dynamics. For this purpose, the kitchen appliance <b>1</b> encompasses a locking part <b>16</b>, which locks the lid <b>10</b> against the vessel <b>6</b>.

Said overlap is preferably integrally molded in the vertically upper end area of a handle <b>21</b>, which is fastened to the cooking vessel <b>6</b>. The overlap <b>20</b> is preferably designed such that, in the position in which the lid <b>10</b> is put on the vessel edge <b>13</b>, the overlap overlaps the lid edge <b>15</b> at least partially, wherein this overlap <b>20</b> alone does not represent a lock. Said lock is only attained as a result of corresponding rotational displacement of the diametrally opposite locking part <b>16</b>. As a result of this embodiment, a three-point lock of the lid <b>10</b> can be attained.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The locking part <b>16</b>, which is wavelike as a whole, is provided with a cavity <b>22</b>, which, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment, preferably extends approximately across 60% to 70% of the axial length of the locking part <b>16</b>. It is embodied in such a way that a circular arc-like overlap section <b>23</b> appears, in each case assigned to the end areas of the cavity <b>22</b>, viewed in axial direction, with reference to a vertical section, that is, with reference to a section viewed vertically to the axis of rotation y. Said overlap section preferably extends concentrically to the axis of rotation y, wherein, with regard to its radial extension as well as with regard to its extension in circumferential direction, the cavity section, which is covered by the overlap section <b>23</b>, is designed to accommodate the vessel edge <b>13</b> as well as the lid edge of the lid <b>10</b>, which is attached to the cooking vessel <b>6</b>, in a positive manner. The overlap section <b>23</b>, which extends so as to protrude freely with reference to a vertical section, preferably extends in a circular arc-like manner, in the illustrated exemplary embodiment across an area of preferably 80°.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Viewed in direction of extension of the axis of rotation y, the locking areas in the area of the overlap sections <b>23</b>, which appear as a result of the above-described embodiment, are spaced apart from one another by a dimension a, which corresponds approximately to a third of the lid diameter d in the illustrated exemplary embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Further viewed in the direction of extension of the axis of rotation y, a support area <b>24</b> is embodied centrally between the overlap sections <b>23</b>. Said support area is preferably molded in a spherical head-like manner or in a ball-like manner, in particular with reference to a vertical section, comprising a support surface, which runs concentrically to the axis of rotation y and, in corresponding assigned position, thus more preferably concentrically to the course of the cooking vessel edge <b>13</b> and/or of the lid edge <b>15</b> in a vertical section.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the support area <b>24</b>, the cavity is formed in such a way that, in a lid released position, a free vertical lifting or lowering, respectively, of the cooking vessel <b>6</b>, as well as of the lid <b>10</b> can be attained above the support area <b>24</b>. As a result of the embodiment of the lid <b>10</b> in a circular disc-shaped manner as a whole, the lid can be assigned to the vessel edge <b>13</b> in an undirected manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The axis of rotation y of the locking part <b>16</b> preferably extends through the center of the support area <b>24</b>, so as to hold the vessel position as constant as possible in response to a rotation of the locking part <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">To operate the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>, the lid <b>10</b> is initially inserted with a partial section of its lid edge <b>15</b> in the area of the overlap <b>20</b>, whereafter the lid <b>10</b> is placed onto the cooking vessel <b>6</b> as a result of a pivot displacement towards the vessel edge <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As a result of rotation of the locking part <b>16</b>, the overlap sections <b>23</b>, which are distanced to one another in axial direction, are displaced beyond the lid edge <b>15</b>, into an end position, in which the locked state of the lid <b>10</b> is reached when the overlap <b>20</b> is displaced in locked position. Preferably, an axial tensioning of vessel <b>6</b> and lid <b>10</b> is not attained hereby. Instead, it is preferably only ensured that the vessel <b>6</b> and the lid <b>10</b> cannot be separated in the locked state, even by high forces. The tightness is preferably ensured by means of the mentioned radial seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In preferred as well as in illustrated embodiment, the locking part <b>16</b> is supported on the side of the machine housing in the area of both axial ends thereof indirectly via interconnecting an elastically resilient acting part <b>17</b> in each case via a rotary part <b>18</b>. More preferably, an axial end of the locking part <b>16</b> is hereby connected indirectly to an electric motor <b>19</b>, which is arranged in the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>, via the elastically resilient acting part <b>17</b>, which is assigned to this end, and the rotary part <b>18</b>, which is also assigned to this axial end. As illustrated, the arrangement of the electric motor <b>19</b> is preferably chosen such that the axis of rotation thereof coincides with the axis of rotation y of the locking part <b>16</b> at least in an unstressed initial position. In this regard, alternative solutions provide for an arrangement of such an electric motor, for example in the base area of the kitchen appliance, wherein, in this case, provision is made for a translation into the plane of the axis of rotation y, for example by means of a belt drive or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The electric motor <b>19</b> has a shaft end <b>25</b>, which can be rotationally driven via said electric motor. Said shaft end is connected in a torque proof manner to a first rotary part <b>18</b>, which is embodied substantially massively of a hard plastic or metal material and which, more preferably, is supported by a housing section <b>26</b> of the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>, preferably across the entire circumference.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The broadside of the rotary part <b>18</b> located opposite the shaft end <b>25</b> is provided with an axial depression <b>27</b>. The elastically resilient acting part <b>17</b> is accommodated and held in said axial depression, with said elastically resilient acting part <b>17</b> preferably being a helical spring <b>28</b>, more preferably made of a spring steel comprising a leaf spring-like cross section.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">A radially inner end section of the acting part <b>17</b> is connected to the rotary part <b>18</b> in a torque proof manner by permeating a wall section of the assigned rotary part <b>18</b> surrounding the acting part <b>17</b>. In an initial position, the radially outer end section <b>29</b> engages with the lid edge <b>16</b> on the top side.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The end of the locking part <b>16</b> located opposite the end on the drive side is preferably held or supported, respectively, in the same manner. Provision is also made in this area for a spring-like acting part <b>17</b> as well as for a rotary part <b>18</b>, which is connected to the other rotary part <b>18</b> in a torque proof manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">More preferably, the locking part <b>16</b> embodies a hinged section <b>30</b>, which acts on the lid <b>10</b>. In particular in connection with the electric motor <b>19</b>, which acts on this hinged section <b>30</b>, it serves as opening or set-up aid, respectively, for the lid <b>10</b> by an electric motor.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Provision is preferably made in the control panel <b>2</b> for a button <b>31</b> or for a further switch, which, serving an lid opening button, controls the electric motor <b>19</b> such that a lifting of the lid <b>10</b> to release the container interior results through this. This is advantageous, for example, if the adding of larger quantities of ingredients is intended during the cooking process and/or mixing process in the cooking vessel <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">By operating the button <b>31</b>, the shaft end <b>25</b> is initially rotationally displaced further towards lid closed position or lid locked position, respectively, via the electric motor <b>19</b> (this more preferably by simultaneously turning off the mixer drive and/or heater). The two rotary parts <b>18</b> of the pivot or locking part <b>30</b>, <b>16</b>, respectively, are connected to one another in a torque proof manner, whereby the rotation of the electric motor <b>19</b> is transferred to the springs <b>28</b>. Due to the fact that the locking part <b>16</b> or hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, experiences a stop in particular in the upper side of the lid <b>10</b> or of the lid edge <b>19</b>, respectively, which interacts with the overlap sections <b>23</b>, the locking part <b>16</b> or hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, cannot carry out a further rotation. The free end sections <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b>, in contrast, are rotationally displaced further relative to the locking part <b>16</b> or hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, by pressing these end sections <b>29</b> against the surface of the lid edge <b>15</b>. Due to the increase of the spring force, which builds, the end sections <b>29</b> also carry out a lateral escape movement until the lid edge <b>15</b> has been overcome. With reference to a top view according to the illustration in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the end sections <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b> hereby carry out a sliding escape movement in opposite directions. By running over the lid edge <b>15</b>, the end sections <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b> jump, for capturing the lid edge <b>15</b> from below as a result of the spring force released after the overrunning of the lid edge <b>15</b>. In this position, the end sections <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b> form an additional bearing point, wherein, in addition to the contact points in the area of the overlap sections <b>23</b> and the support area <b>24</b>, at least two further contact points are now provided for acting on the lid edge <b>15</b>. In particular the overlap sections <b>23</b>, together with the end sections <b>29</b>, which act against the opposite surface of the lid edge <b>19</b>, act on the lid edge <b>15</b> in a clamping manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The rotation of the shaft end <b>25</b> further towards the locked position takes place for a short period of time, at least until the spring end sections <b>29</b> have slid across the lid edge <b>15</b> and have attached to the underside. In one embodiment, the corresponding control of the electric motor <b>19</b> occurs in a temporally limited manner. In the alternative, the rotation of the shaft end <b>25</b> takes place via a predetermined rotation angle, which ensures the sliding of the spring end sections <b>29</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">A reversal of the direction of rotation of the electric motor <b>19</b>, in response to which the lid <b>10</b> is clamped in the area of its traversing lid edge <b>15</b> between the overlap sections <b>23</b> and the spring end sections <b>29</b> so as to be pivoted open about the axis of rotation y of the pivot part <b>30</b>, after this rotation of the shaft end <b>25</b> further in the locked direction. For this purpose, the user must initially lift the overlap <b>20</b>, preferably manually, for the corresponding first unlocking of the lid <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Via the hinged section <b>30</b>, the lid <b>10</b> can preferably be displaced into a position, in which a lid plane, preferably a sealing plane of the lid <b>10</b>, extends in a vertically oriented plane or draws an acute angle of between 1 and 15 degrees to this plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In this position, the cooking vessel interior is exposed for correspondingly accessing the content. It is also possible in this lid open position to remove the cooking vessel <b>6</b> from the vessel accommodation <b>5</b>, for example for emptying it.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">By operating the button <b>31</b> again, in the alternative by operating a further button, the lid <b>10</b> can be pivoted back into the cooking vessel locked position, after which the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>, in particular the mixer <b>7</b> in the cooking vessel <b>6</b> and/or the heater <b>8</b> can be put into operation, by reestablishing the lock in the area of the overlap <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The lid open position illustrated in an exemplary manner in <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is preferably stop-limited, more preferably because the locking part <b>16</b> or the hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, stops at a housing section of the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>. In the event that the lid <b>10</b> is to be removed for cleaning thereof, for example, the electric motor <b>19</b> rotates the shaft end <b>25</b> beyond the stop position of the locking part <b>16</b> or hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, for a corresponding relative displacement in particular of the end sections <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b> relative to the lid edge <b>15</b>. The spring end sections <b>29</b> slide accordingly beyond the base side of the lid edge <b>15</b>, so as to run over the lid edge <b>15</b> again and so as to attach to the lid edge upper side again thereafter according to the initial position.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In a further preferred embodiment, the lid unlocking takes place in the lid attached position on the cooking vessel <b>6</b> or on the cooking vessel edge <b>13</b>, respectively, this more preferably in the locked position of the overlap <b>20</b>. By corresponding rotational displacement via the electric motor <b>19</b>, the respective end section <b>29</b> of the springs <b>28</b> is initially also acted upon such that said end section slides across the lid edge <b>15</b> and jumps to the lid edge upper side. By further rotating the shaft end <b>25</b> towards a lid open position, the locking part <b>16</b> or the hinged section <b>30</b>, respectively, is now also displaced into the lid unlocked position according to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, whereafter the lid <b>10</b> can be removed from the cooking vessel <b>6</b> after lifting the overlap <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As a result of the proposed solution, the lid <b>10</b>, which might have heated up during the cooking process, does not need to be touched directly by the user. Instead, both the locking and unlocking as well as placement or depositing, respectively, of the lid on the vessel edge <b>13</b> are controlled via electric motor via the kitchen appliance <b>1</b>. Possible food remnants or liquids adhering to the lid <b>10</b> drip back into the cooking vessel <b>6</b> in the open state of the lid <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The bearing zones formed due to the attachment of the spring end sections <b>29</b> to the lid edge on the base side simultaneously form an overload protection, in particular in the lid open position, so that, in the upright position, the lid <b>10</b> is protected by overlapping against breaking caused by external influences.</p>
