The lanthanide is preferably holmium, erbium, thulium or ytterbium, most preferably erbium. Also, methods of making the aforementioned alloys are disclosed. The superalloys, which have commercially-suitable hardness at temperatures above about 220Â° C., include nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates and optionally nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Er precipitates and nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>(Zr,Er) precipitates that create a high-strength alloy capable of withstanding intense heat conditions. These nanoscale precipitates have a L1<sub>2</sub>-structure in Î±-Al(f.c.c.) matrix, an average diameter of less than about 20 nanometers (ânmâ), preferably less than about 10 nm, and more preferably about 4-6 nm and a high number density, which for example, is larger than about 10<sup>21 </sup>m<sup>â3</sup>, of the nanoscale precipitates. The formation of the high number density of nanoscale precipitates is thought to be due to the addition of inoculant, such as a Group 3A, 4A, and 5A metal or metalloid. Additionally, methods for increasing the diffusivity of Zr in Al are disclosed.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present application relates to certain aluminum alloys. More particularly, aluminum alloys are described that exhibit improved properties at elevated temperatures.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Aluminum alloys as a class are some of the most versatile engineering and construction materials available. For example, aluminum alloys are light in comparison to steel or copper and have high strength to weight ratios. Additionally, aluminum alloys resist corrosion, are up to three times more thermally conductive than steel, and can be easily fabricated into various forms. However, current commercial light-weight age-hardenable aluminum alloys are not useable above about 220Â° C. (428Â° F.) because the strengthening precipitates they contain dissolve, coarsen or transform to undesirable phases. Although aluminum-scandium alloys have been developed that can withstand higher temperatures, they are typically very expensive due to the costs associated with the use of scandium. Thus, there is a need for commercially viable uncladded aluminum alloys that have good processability characteristics and can be used in applications that are exposed to higher temperatures (e.g. 300-450Â° C. or 572-842Â° F.), such as automotive brake rotors or engine components. Cast iron, which is about three times heavier than aluminum, or titanium alloys, which are much more expensive than aluminum alloys, are commonly used for these high temperature, high stress applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Other potential applications for such aluminum superalloys include engine components such as pistons, where car manufacturers presently are limited to aluminum components that operate at a maximum temperature of about 220Â° C., therefore reducing engine efficiency, increasing emissions, and inflating the cost and mass of the cooling system. Another application is for aircraft engine structural components, such as the auxiliary power unit (APU) located in the tails of airplanes. APU frames, mounting brackets, and exhaust ducting currently use expensive titanium alloys due to the high-temperature environment of about 300Â° C. (572Â° F.), which could be replaced by lighter, much less expensive high-temperature aluminum alloys that are disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">An inventive alloy, described herein in various embodiments, comprises aluminum, zirconium, and at least one inoculant, such as a Group 3A, 4A, and 5A metal or metalloid, and include one or more types of nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates. An alloy also can include aluminum, zirconium, a lanthanide series metal such as erbium and at least one inoculant, such as Group 3A, 4A, and 5A metals and metalloids. Such an alloy can have one or more nanoscale high number density precipitates such as Al<sub>3</sub>Zr, Al<sub>3</sub>Er, and Al<sub>3</sub>(Zr,Er) precipitates. The inventive alloy exhibits good strength, hardness, creep resistance and aging resistance at elevated temperatures and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity at all temperatures, while being less expensive than Sc-bearing aluminum alloys.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">This application is directed to, inter alia, aluminum-zirconium and aluminum-zirconium-lanthanide superalloys that can be used in high temperature, high stress and a variety of other applications.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">It should be understood that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the present invention, which has multiple embodiments, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated. It should be further understood that the title of this section of this application (âDetailed Description of the Inventionâ) relates to a requirement of the United States Patent Office, and should not be found to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Novel aluminum based superalloys are disclosed. The alloys comprise aluminum, zirconium and at least one inoculant, and include nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates. Also disclosed are alloys that comprise aluminum, zirconium, a lanthanide preferably holmium, erbium, thulium or ytterbium, most preferably erbium, and at least one inoculant, and include nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates, nanoscale Al<sub>3 </sub>lanthanide precipitates, and Al<sub>3</sub>(Zr,lanthanide) precipitates. These superalloys are readily processable and have high heat resistance, especially at about 300-450Â° C. (572-842Â° F.). Further, a method for increasing the diffusivity of zirconium in aluminum by using a Group 3A, Group 4A or Group 5A metal or metalloid as an inoculant is disclosed. Also, a method for decreasing the precipitate diameter of Al<sub>3</sub>Zr(L1<sub>2</sub>) precipitates by the use of an inoculant is described. Inoculants such as Group 3A, 4A, and 5A metals or metalloids are provided in sufficient amounts to provide for the formation of the high number density of nanoscale precipitates, and includes the amounts described in the Examples and Figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">A contemplated aluminum alloy also can be essentially scandium-free (meaning that scandium (Sc) is present in a range of less than about 0.04 at. % to about 0.00 at. % of the alloy), while displaying the same or improved mechanical properties at ambient and elevated temperatures when compared to scandium-containing aluminum alloys. The conventional wisdom is that the elimination of Sc in the alloy is unlikely to succeed, because, for example, no other elements possess the same thermodynamic and kinetic properties as Sc in the Î±-Al matrix, including eutectic (rather than peritectic) solidification, relatively high solubility in solid aluminum near the melting point, said solubility decreasing to near zero values at about 200Â° C. (392Â° F.), ability to create coherent and semi-coherent Al<sub>3</sub>X precipitates, wherein X is a metal, having (L1<sub>2 </sub>structure) with high resistance to shearing, with low coarsening rate tendency and with a small lattice parameter mismatch with Al, diffusivities small enough to prevent coarsening, but fast enough to permit homogenization, high corrosion and oxidation resistance after dissolution, low density, sufficiently low melting point to allow for rapid dissolution in liquid aluminum. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, diffusivity of zirconium in aluminum is two to three orders of magnitude slower than Sc. Because of this small diffusivity, dilute AlâZr alloys cannot be strengthened by a high number density of nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr(L1<sub>2</sub>) precipitates during aging at low temperatures where the chemical driving force for nucleation is very high.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b>A show that for the binary Al-0.06 Zr and Al-0.1 Zr, precipitation occurs at high temperatures (the peak hardness is at about 500Â° C.), leading to relatively low peak microhardness. This is because Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates, which are responsible for the microhardness increase, form with relatively large sizes of 20 nm to 200 nm, because the supersaturation is smaller and diffusion is faster at the higher temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">It is thus desirable to add an inoculant that shifts the temperature of precipitation to lower temperatures by increasing the diffusivity of Zr in Al, thus increasing the supersaturation of Zr in Al. In such alloys, aging at a temperature of about 200Â° C. (392Â° F.) to about 400Â° C. (752Â° F.) creates smaller precipitates with higher volume fractions, which are thus more effective strengtheners. Zirconium, however, diffuses very slowly in that range of temperature, and thus does not nucleate small precipitates, with diameters smaller than 20 nm, in aluminum. During artificial aging at a higher temperatures of about 400Â° C. (752Â° F.) to about 600Â° C. (1112Â° F.), or during cooling to a solid mass from a melt, Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates can be formed, but with relatively large diameters of about 20 nm to about 200 nm Therefore, an aluminum alloy, containing only zirconium typically is unsatisfactory in forming a high-strength alloy.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">It has been discovered that the presence of one or more of the following elements: tin, indium, and antimony, in an aluminum-zirconium alloy can create a high-strength alloy. Silicon also can be used in conjunction with one or more of these elements. It is believed that atoms of tin, indium, and antimony bind with zirconium atoms to provide for faster diffusion of zirconium in aluminum. Thereafter, smaller Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates can be created during artificial aging at lower temperatures, of about 300Â° C. (572Â° F.) to about 400Â° C. (752Â° F.), as compared to AlâZr alloys free of an inoculant. These nanoscale precipitates form and have average diameters that are less than about 20 nm and preferably less than about 10 nm, and more preferably about 4-6 nm. An example is shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, a 3-D atom-probe tomographic reconstruction of the Al-0.1 Zr-0.02 Sn at. %, after homogenization at 640Â° C. (1184Â° F.) for 24 hours, then being aged at 400Â° C. (752Â° F.) for 72 hours, showing the Al<sub>3</sub>Zr nano-precipitates with an average diameter of about 8-12 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Therefore, an aluminum alloy comprising zirconium with one or more of the following inoculants, tin, indium and antimony, and optionally also including silicon, which will create a higher-strength alloy than without inoculants is disclosed.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">It also has been discovered that the addition of erbium in an aluminum-zirconium alloy, further comprising one or more of the following elements, tin, indium and antimony, and optionally also including silicon, can create a high number density of Al<sub>3</sub>Er precipitates during artificial aging at a lower temperature of about 200Â° C. (572Â° F.) to about 350Â° C. (662Â° F.). These alloys also precipitate Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates at temperatures of about 350Â° C. (662Â° F.) to about 550Â° C. (1022Â° F.), like those alloys without Er, as well as Al<sub>3</sub>(Zr,Er) precipitates. The nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Er precipitates, nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates, and nanoscale Al<sub>3</sub>(Zr,Er) precipitates create a combined matrix that displays an improvement in strength compared to an Al<sub>3</sub>Zr alloy with no addition of erbium.</p>

Master alloys, including 99.99 wt. % pure Al, Al-5.0 Zr wt. %, 99.99 wt. % pure Sn, and 99.99 wt. % pure In, were melted in alumina crucibles in air. The melt was held for 60 minutes at 800Â° C., stirred vigorously, and then cast into a graphite mold, which was optionally preheated to 200Â° C. The mold was placed on an ice-cooled copper platen during solidification to enhance directional solidification and decrease formation of shrinkage cavities. The alloy's chemical composition was measured by direct-current plasma atomic-emission spectroscopy (DCP-AES).</p>

In the Al-0.1 Zr control alloy, microhardness commences to increase at 400Â° C., peaking at about 500Â° C. with a peak-microhardness of 367+14 MPa. The microhardness peak is due to formation of Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates, which areârelatively large in diameter (&gt;20 nm). The microhardness continuously decreases beyond aging temperature of 500Â° C. due to precipitates both coarsening and dissolving back into the matrix.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0088">In the Al-0.1 Zr-0.01 Sn alloy, microhardness commences to increase at 150Â° C., peaking at about 225Â° C. for the first time with a microhardness of 287Â±6 MPa. It then decreases at higher temperatures, but increases again at 375Â° C., peaking at about 475Â° C. for the second time with a microhardness of 451Â±17 MPa. The microhardness continuously decreases beyond an aging temperature of 475Â° C. Al-0.1 Zr-0.02 Sn behaves similarly to the Al-0.1 Zr-0.01 Sn alloy, except that its first microhardness peak is at a lower temperature of 200Â° C. with a higher value of 357Â±9 MPa, and its second microhardness peak is at a lower temperature of 425Â° C. and a higher value of 493Â±22 MPa. It is noted that the first peak-microhardness value of Al-0.1 Zr-0.02 Sn, occurring at 200Â° C. is the same as the peak-microhardness value of Al-0.1 Zr alloy, occurring at 500Â° C. It is also noted that the addition of 0.01-0.02 at. % of Sn improves peak-microhardness of Al-0.1 Zr from 367 to 451 and 493 MPa, respectively, while decreasing peak temperature. The larger obtained peak-microhardness values in Sn-containing alloys are believed to be due to the formation of smaller nanoscale precipitates with diameters smaller than 10 nm With the same precipitate volume fraction, a distribution of smaller precipitates proved more effective in strengthening the alloy as compared to an alloy composed of coarser precipitates.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0089">The temporal evolution of the electrical conductivity of Alloys 1-3 are shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>. The electrical conductivity of the Al-0.1 Zr alloy is 31.24Â±0.13 MS/m in the homogenized state. It commences to increase at 425Â° C., peaking at 475Â° C. with the value 34.03Â±0.06 MS/m, which is 58.7% of the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS). The increase in electrical conductivity is due to precipitation of the Al<sub>3</sub>Zr phase, which removes Zr solute atoms from the Al matrix. The conductivity decreases continuously at higher temperatures, as Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates dissolve and Zr atoms dissolve in the Al matrix. The electrical conductivity evolves temporally for Al-0.1 Zr-0.01 Sn and Al-0.1 Zr-0.02 Sn, which are similar to Al-0.1 Zr alloy, except that their electrical conductivity values commence to increase at lower temperatures, 400Â° C. and 375Â° C., respectively. They also peak at lower temperatures, both at 450Â° C., and at larger values of 34.38Â±0.06 MS/m (59.3% IACS) and 34.31Â±0.06 MS/m (59.2% IACS for Al-0.1 Zr-0.01 Sn and Al-0.1 Zr-0.02 Sn alloy, respectively.</p>

In the Al-0.06 Zr alloy, the microhardness commences to increase at 400Â° C., peaking at about 490Â° C. with a peak-microhardness of 290 MPa. The microhardness peaks, again, due to formation of Al<sub>3</sub>Zr precipitates. In the Al-0.06 Zr-0.02 In alloy, the microhardness commences to increase below 150Â° C., peaking at about 150Â° C. for the first time with a microhardness of 321Â±12 MPa, which is greater than the peak for the Al-0.06 Zr alloy. It then decreases at higher temperatures, but increases again at 400Â° C., peaking at 475Â° C. for a second time with the microhardness of 323Â±10 MPa, which is again greater than the peak microhardness for the Al-0.06 Zr alloy. The microhardness decreases continuously beyond the aging temperature of 475Â° C. The electrical conductivity of the Al-0.06 Zr alloy is 31.9 MS/m in the as-cast state. It commences to increase at 425Â° C., peaking at 475Â° C. with a value of 34.25 MS/m (59.1% IACS). The electrical conductivity of the Al-0.06 Zr-0.02 In alloy is 33.17Â±0.09 MS/m at the homogenized state. It increases slightly below 150Â° C., saturates at higher temperatures, increases again at 425Â° C., peaks at 475Â° C. with the value 34.00Â±0.05 MS/m (58.6% IACS).</p>

The microhardness values decrease continuously above an aging temperature of 475Â° C. due to both precipitation coarsening and dissolution of the precipitates. In the Al-0.1 Zr-0.04 Er-0.01 Sn alloy, the microhardness values commence to increase at very low temperatures, possibly lower than 150Â° C., peaking at 200Â° C. for the first time with a microhardness of 331Â±8 MPa.
