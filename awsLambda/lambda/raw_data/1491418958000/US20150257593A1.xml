    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A vertical grill comprises a back chimney within the housing having an inlet and an outlet. The inlet is in the form of one or more first openings in the back frame member, and the outlet being a second opening which is higher than the inlet. A first air intake located in at least one of the grill's panels. A removable tray module comprises a slide positioned at an incline between the front and back sides, configured to direct fats and break away solids to the front side of the tray. At least one channel is covered by the slide and configured for air flow. An external receptacle is positioned at the front side of the tray, wherein the slide leads into the receptacle so that fats and break away solids may be channeled into the external receptacle after traveling downwards along the incline of the slide.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates to cooking appliances for use in domestic and commercial kitchens. The invention relates particularly to electric grills that can be used to cook food in a way that removes fat from the food that is cooked. In particular the invention relates to a vertical electric grill and a removable slide and tray module for directing fats and breakaway solids from the inside of the grill to the tray's exterior receptacle for safe storage and cooling during the cooking process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Obesity together with heart disease has been linked to high consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol found in most meat products. The American Heart Association (“AHA”) has recommended that individuals should, in order to reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer, reduce their daily intake of saturated fats and cholesterol.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Grills in which the radiant cooking elements and grilling space have been arranged vertically are particularly well adapted to cook the food on both sides simultaneously and to remove fats from meat that is being cooked. As the food is suspended between the cooking elements gravity and pressure of a holding clasp act to separate liquefied fats and oils from the food such that the liquefied fats and oils drip out of and away from the food being cooked. Vertical grills have been recommended by heart physicians as a suitable device to help patients and the public reduce their intake of saturated fats that would otherwise be ingested with conventionally cooked meats.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, there were problems associated with prior art vertical grills. The prior art vertical grills used an internal drip tray to collect and retain combustible fats, oils, and waste solids that fall from the food being grilled between two radiant cooking elements. Unfortunately, the prior art vertical grills with an internal drip tray are prone to fire flare-ups and smoke.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As a result, if the internal drip tray is not cleaned thoroughly before each use to ensure there are no combustible fats or solids present in the tray, there is a propensity for the contents of the tray to combust. Further, with a view to combating this propensity for combustion, users were advised to add a small quantity of cold water to the internal drip tray before each use to reduce the volatility of the liquefied fats and oils that accumulate in the tray during cooking</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The danger of ignition resulting in fire or smoke was exacerbated by the fact that the drip tray in the prior art vertical grills was concealed within the body of the grill, where it was difficult for the user to observe the contents of the tray without first removing the drip tray from the prior art vertical grill. This would frequently result in users powering on the exposed electric grilling elements situated directly above the combustible contents of the drip tray without prior knowledge of the drip trays contents or the danger of fire and smoke these contents presented. Unaware that the prior art vertical grill's drip tray contained flammable fats and waste, many users would not take steps to remove and clean the tray before reinserting it into the grill with a quantity of cold water as instructed by the safety provisions that accompanied the grill.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In order to diminish of fire risk, some prior art vertical grill designs employ an internal drip tray that features a fire suppressing perforated metal cover. However, this design has its drawbacks. First, the perforated cover actually makes it more likely that a user of the device will forget to empty the contents of the drip tray as the retained fats and solid spoils are substantially obscured by the internal drip tray cover. In such a case where the internal drip tray is hidden from view within the body of the vertical grill, dangerous reserves of retained fats and oils can easily go unobserved. Further, the use of a perforated metal fire suppressing shield results in solid spoils and embers from above, coming to rest on the protective fire shield. These solids sometimes block the perforations resulting in an accumulation of fats and oils on the shield's surface. This may result in smoldering embers and ignited fats entering into the internal cavities of the device, and/or cause the fats in the drip tray to ignite despite the presence of the fire suppressing shield. It is a common complaint by users of the vertical grill that a blocked or inappropriately prepared internal drip tray can permit smoldering embers to activate kitchen fire alarms. Furthermore, by covering or compressing the combustible contents of the drip tray with a metal shield, ignition of its contents can cause the tray to explode.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to improve on the design of prior art vertical grills and/or to substantially ameliorate some of the shortcomings of the prior art vertical grills.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention relates to a removable slide and drip tray module with external receptacle for use in a grill. The drip tray of the present invention includes a slide which guides the separated hot, liquified fats and breakaway solids (all of which form a group which will be herein called “discarded waste”) generated by the grilling of the food to the external collection receptacle positioned at the lowest point of the module for cooling and disposal outside the body of the grill. The drip tray includes one or more channels configured for enabling passage of air therethrough and enabling the airflow to contact the slide. In this manner, the discarded waste of the grilled food is cooled while they are located inside the grill and as they slide toward the external receptacle. In this manner, the risk of fire inside the grill is reduced. This also removes the need for an internal drip tray and hence it is unnecessary to add cold water to a drip tray in close proximity to the grills electric cooking elements or in any event to position a drip tray within the body of the grill or furthermore to apply a fire suppressant shield thereto. Thus the dangers and preliminary steps necessary for use of and the need for an internal drip tray are eliminated.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">From time-to-time, the present invention is described herein in terms of example environments. Description in terms of these environments is provided to allow the various features and embodiments of the invention to be portrayed in the context of an exemplary application. After reading this description, it will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art how the invention can be implemented in different and alternative environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, applications, published applications and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in applications, published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this document prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">An aspect of some embodiments of the present invention is directed toward an external drip tray for a vertical grill. Before describing the details of the tray of the present invention, a vertical grill will be described</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of a grease tray assembly generally designated as numeral <b>1</b>. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a right side view of the tray assembly and <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of the tray assembly. The tray assembly is configured to catch the discarded waste dripping from food inside the vertical grill during cooking and to channel the discarded waste (fats, grease and break away solids) from inside the grill to an external receptacle component <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref> and <b>8</b>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a top view of a slide <b>2</b> which is part of the tray of the present invention; <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of the slide <b>2</b>. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is an isometric drawing of slide <b>2</b>. <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a sectional view of the grease tray assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The grease tray assembly <b>1</b> includes a top plate/slide <b>2</b> and a bottom tray <b>3</b>. The slide <b>2</b> covers the bottom tray <b>3</b>. The bottom tray <b>3</b> may be a one piece molded plastic base. Optionally, the bottom tray <b>3</b> is made of a fireproof material. The slide <b>2</b> is inclined downward toward the external receptacle component <b>7</b>, so as to lead the discarded waste to the external receptacle component. In a non-limiting example, the inclination of the slide <b>2</b> is approximately 15 degrees. For a common grill, the inside of which reaches temperatures of 400 to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, the inclination angle in the present invention can be low since the cooling effect of the panel <b>2</b> enables to discarded waste to slowly travel along the panel without reaching flashpoint temperatures (the flash point temperature being the temperature above which the discarded waste catches fire or smokes). Having a low inclination is particularly advantageous for keeping the profile of the vertical grill low. A higher temperature within the vertical grill would require the inclination angle to be increased to accelerate the draining of the discarded waste to the outside tray receptacle before flash point temperature is reached.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The slide <b>2</b> includes lateral side surfaces <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and a middle surface <b>6</b> located between the side surfaces. The side surface <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are slanted toward the middle of slide <b>2</b> to drain grease from the sides to the middle surface <b>6</b>. At the front of bottom molded tray <b>3</b> is an external receptacle component <b>7</b>. The external receptacle component <b>7</b> may be removably attached to the tray. Optionally, a tray handle <b>8</b> is located on the front of the external receptacle component <b>7</b>, to ease the tray's insertion to and removal from the grill.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">There is an air intake opening <b>9</b> on at least one side of the tray to supply cooling air to the tray module. To retain the slide <b>2</b> on the bottom tray <b>3</b>, the slide <b>2</b> includes at least one slot (optionally two slots <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>) on at least one lateral side of the slide <b>2</b>. The slot(s) is (are) configured for mating with corresponding holding button(s) <b>13</b>. Optionally, an identical slot/button arrangement is provided for each of the two lateral sides of the tray assembly. The slot/button arrangement enables the slide <b>2</b> to be removably joined to bottom molded tray <b>3</b>, so that the slide <b>2</b> can be easily removed for cleaning.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>8</b>, and <b>20</b>, there is provided an isometric drawing illustrating a bottom tray <b>3</b> with the top metal slide <b>2</b> removed. Lateral ends <b>14</b> along with ribs <b>16</b> support the slide <b>2</b> and maintain a gap between the floor of the bottom tray and slide <b>2</b>. In this manner, floor members <b>25</b>, in conjunction with the slide <b>2</b>, provide air tunnels <b>18</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>) under slide <b>2</b>. Cool air comes in through end opening <b>9</b> then flows up through apertures <b>12</b> in the floor members and on in direction of air flow arrow <b>29</b>, through the tunnels to the back of the tray. The cool air cools the slide <b>2</b> and thus keeps the discarded waste below flash point temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Optionally, the slide <b>2</b> is made of a heat conductive material to enable heat exchange between the air flowing below the slide and the discarded waste sliding on the slide <b>2</b>, thus facilitating the cooling of the discarded waste. In a variant, referring to <figref>FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, the slide <b>2</b> is made of metal, and the tray assembly <b>1</b> comprises magnets at least one magnet <b>105</b> attached at least one lateral end <b>14</b> for securing the metal slide to the tray assembly <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>14</b>, a vertical grill assembly <b>30</b> of the present invention is shown. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a front cross section, <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a lateral cross section and <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a top view of the vertical grill.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The vertical grill assembly includes a back chimney <b>39</b> bounded by a back frame <b>38</b> and a back cover <b>40</b>. Optionally, the vertical grill includes a front chimney <b>60</b> bounded by a front frame member <b>57</b> and a front cover. In either chimney, a chimney effect causes air be drawn into the chimney's bottom, rise up through the chimney, and exit the vertical grill assembly via an exit vent located at the top of the vertical grill assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Looking at <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, it can be seen that the back frame member <b>38</b> includes a plurality of openings (<b>33</b>-<b>37</b>). These openings enable passage of air from the tray to be back chimney <b>39</b>. Optionally, a front opening is provided between the lowermost point of the grill's front cover and the uppermost point of the grease tray, to enable passage of air <b>41</b> from outside. A first portion of the air <b>41</b> rises through the front chimney <b>60</b>. A second portion of the air travels along the top surface of the slide <b>2</b> and enters the back chimney <b>39</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the tray <b>1</b> rests against the back frame member <b>38</b>. The slide <b>2</b> divides the opening <b>35</b> in half. The air traveling through the tunnel <b>18</b> enters the back chimney <b>39</b> via the lower half of opening <b>35</b>. A chimney effect drafts this air to the top of the grill and ejects the air outward. Correspondingly, along the top side of slide <b>2</b>, the air flows in direction of arrow <b>41</b> into the top half of the opening <b>35</b> and upward through the back chimney <b>39</b>. Thus, the discarded waste are cooled by the air entering though the bottom opening <b>9</b> (by heat exchange with via the slide <b>2</b>) and by air entering though the vertical grill's front opening (by direct contact between the air and the discarded waste). The air entering though the tray's bottom opening <b>9</b> flows into the grill via a side opening, and/or a bottom opening, and/or or a front opening on the grill, which is (are) at least partially aligned with the bottom opening <b>9</b>. This cooling effect lowers the risk of fire.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In a non-limiting example shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, the vertical grill includes a cooking basket <b>50</b> for cooking food in the middle of the grill, surrounded by four Cal Rods <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> &amp; <b>54</b> which generate heat. Removable heat shields <b>55</b> &amp; <b>56</b> are installed behind the Cal Rods, so that the Cal Rods are located between a corresponding removable shield and the cooking basket <b>50</b>. Optionally, the removable heat shields are concave, in order to reflect heat back to the food basket. The vertical grill assembly includes an inner metal frame comprising a back frame member <b>38</b>, front metal frame member <b>57</b>, left end frame <b>58</b> and right end frame member (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">
        <figref>FIGS. 11-13</figref> illustrate removable side heat shields located inside the vertical grill. A removable heat shield optionally includes surfaces <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>, which are inclined downward to catch the discarded waste dripping and/or dropping from the cooking basket <b>50</b> and drains the discarded waste to the tray assembly <b>1</b>. This allows the cooking basket to be wider than the grease tray. In the back inner frame wall <b>38</b> of the vertical grill are openings <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. These openings permit air flow from inside the grill assembly to the space <b>39</b> between the outside back cover <b>40</b> and the back inner frame wall <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In a variant, referring to <figref>FIGS. 17-19</figref>, the vertical grill with external drip tray module <b>1</b> has an opening <b>115</b> in the back of the tray and corresponding similarly shaped vent holes <b>110</b> for aligning with the opening <b>115</b> of the tray in the inner and outer walls of the grill. The opening <b>110</b> together with the vent holes <b>115</b> provide additional cooling airflow through the vertical grill with external drip tray module <b>1</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, the region between the vent holes <b>110</b> and is separated from the back chimney by a wall <b>120</b>. This separation prevents air entering the vertical grill via the vent holes <b>110</b> from traveling within the back chimney. In this manner, air entering via the vent holes <b>110</b> continues through the vent hole <b>115</b>, external drip tray module <b>1</b> and follows the path in the air tunnels <b>18</b> to cool the top slide <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention is presented, in which the top slide <b>2</b> of the drip tray module includes elongated side panels <b>130</b>. <figref>FIG. 21</figref> is an isometric view of a top plate/slide with elongated side panels, according to some embodiments of the present invention. <figref>FIG. 22</figref> is a right side view of the grease tray assembly illustrating air flow via a gap between the floor members of the bottom tray and the plate or slide which has elongated side panels.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Similarly to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, each side panel <b>130</b> of top plate <b>2</b> includes one or more slots (e.g., the slots <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>) configured for mating with corresponding holding buttons <b>13</b> located on the side of the bottom tray. Because the side panels are elongated, a gap <b>125</b> is formed on the front of the tray assembly <b>1</b>, between the top plate <b>2</b> and the bottom tray when the top plate is joined to the bottom tray. In this manner, air may enter tray assembly via the gap <b>125</b>, travel in the region between the top plate and the bottom tray to cool the top plate <b>2</b>, and enter the back chimney, before being expelled via the air exits.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">It should be noted that in the example of <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, four air intakes are shown, for drawing outside air to cool the top plate <b>2</b>: (i) the front opening above the plate <b>2</b>, (ii) the bottom opening <b>9</b> of the bottom tray, (iii) the intake formed by the openings <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, and (iv) the gap <b>125</b>. The present invention extends to all embodiments in which any one of these intakes is present, to embodiments in which any subset of these intakes is present, and to the embodiments in which all four intakes are present.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> are perspective drawings illustrating a grill of the present invention, in which the base is receded with respect to the front panel.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In some embodiments of the present invention, the grill <b>200</b> includes a plurality of legs <b>202</b> joined to the bottom of the grill and keeping the grill elevated with respect to a surface upon which the grill is located. In the non-limiting example of <figref>FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the four legs are present.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In the embodiments of <figref>FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, the grill <b>200</b> includes a bottom panel <b>204</b> which is receded with respect to the front panel <b>206</b>. The receded bottom panel <b>204</b> is configured for coming into contact with the extension <b>152</b> of the tray module <b>1</b> and for stopping the tray module <b>1</b>. As will be later explained, the grill <b>200</b>, when the tray module <b>1</b> of <figref>FIGS. 23-25</figref> is inserted into the grill <b>200</b>, air may flow from under the external receptacle component <b>7</b> to the apertures <b>156</b>, and along the path between the floor members <b>25</b> and the tray, to cool down the tray.</p>
