    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film. More specifically, the present invention can be suitably used in an automotive steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Various flat steel sheets represented by the automotive steel sheet are formed into desired shapes through press forming or the like, and then, subjected to painting performed thereon.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A plate-like steel sheet to be subjected to press forming is coated with rust preventive oil and delivered to a customer in the state of a steel material packed into a coil shape, a sheet shape, or the like. In a pressing process, a so-called press-cleaning oil to dilute the rust preventive oil is added to the steel sheet delivered to the customer, and the steel sheet is press-formed. Then, the press-formed steel sheet is subjected to painting in a painting process.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In a degreasing step of the painting process, the steel sheet to which the above oil content adheres is subjected to an alkali cleaning to remove the oil content. However, in a case where the oil content remains, the remaining oil content repels paint, and thus, the appearance of the painting deteriorates, or the adhesion property between the paint film and the steel material becomes poor in many cases. That is, in the pressing of the steel sheet, it is preferable for the surface state of the steel sheet to be excellent in lubricity, but if the surface of the pressed steel sheet is not cleaned in the degreasing step, this leads to a defect in subsequent steps.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As another method of giving lubricity to the surface of the steel sheet, a method for providing a film of polyethylene oxide (PEO) having an average molecular weight of 50,000 to 5,000,000 on the surface of an aluminum alloy sheet has been proposed (Patent Literature 1). In addition, a method for improving the level of lubrication has been proposed (Patent Literature 2). In the method, a first layer which contains polyethylene oxide (PEO) having a weight average molecular weight of 50,000 to 500,000 and in which the adhesion amount of the PEO is 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and a second layer which contains lubricating oil having a kinematic viscosity of 7 mm<sup>2</sup>/s to 32 mm<sup>2</sup>/s (at 40Â°C) and in which the adhesion amount of the lubricating oil is 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 3.0 g/m<sup>2</sup> are provided on the surface of a steel sheet in this order.</p>

    <heading id="h-00005-en">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
    <heading id="h-00006-en">TECHNICAL PROBLEMS</heading>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In recent years, with a rise in awareness with respect to aesthetics of products, press forming of a steel sheet into a more complex shape has been increased, and thus, a steel sheet which is more excellent in lubricity at the time of press forming has been demanded. In particular, in the case of a galvanized steel sheet, the zinc on the surface of the steel sheet is soft, and thus, agglutination of the zinc with a mold at the time of pressing easily occurs, and if the lubricity is not sufficient, so-called galling or seizing is easily generated.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">As a result of the examination of the lubricity of the conventional steel sheet coated with lubricating oil and the aluminum alloy sheet having the PEO film described in <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="JP8323286A"><text>JP 8-323286 A</text></patcit> (Patent Literature 1), the present inventors found that the levels of lubricity of the conventional steel sheet and the aluminum alloy sheet described in Patent Literature 1 do not reach the level of lubricity currently required. In contrast, as a result of the examination of the lubricity of the steel sheet having the lubricating film described in <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="JP2012121954A"><text>JP 2012-121954 A</text></patcit> (Patent Literature 2), it was confirmed that, in a so-called dry environment, the level of lubricity thereof satisfies the level currently required.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">However, according to the further examination by the present inventors, it was confirmed that, although the steel sheet having the lubricating film described in Patent Literature 2 has no problem with respect to the formability by the pressing and is excellent in lubricity in a so-called dry environment, when the steel sheet is retained in a wet environment, the lubricity thereof deteriorates, and some of a film component and a material component adheres onto the steel sheet as a black adhering substance. As a result of the qualitative analysis of the adhering substance conducted by the present inventors, an organic component and an inorganic component were detected in the adhering substance, and it became clear that the inorganic component is a part of the surface of the steel sheet scraped away therefrom due to abrasion or wear. The present inventors consider that since the lubricating film described in Patent Literature 2 is a film excellent in removability, the first layer swells in a wet atmosphere, and the first layer and the second layer are not drawn in a mold from an introduction portion thereof, thereby the lubricity is decreased.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The plate-like steel materials are transported to a customer in the state of being packed in a shape such as a coil shape, a sheet shape, or the like. These steel materials have many opportunities to come into contact with the outside air at the time of transportation. In particular, since the steel materials are largely exported to overseas by ships, at the time of transporting to the destinations for export, or at the time of storing in the destinations for export, the steel materials experience a rainfall, a snowfall, a rainy season (a pluvial period), or the like. Therefore, these steel materials have many opportunities to be allowed to stand in a wet environment, and accordingly, improvement measures against the decrease of the lubricity at the time of being retained in a wet environment as seen in the steel sheet with a lubricating film described in Patent Literature 2 are essential.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film which is excellent in lubricity in a dry environment, does not exhibit deterioration of the lubricity even after being retained in a wet environment, can be properly subjected to pressing, and can be easily removed in an alkali-degreasing step after the pressing.</p>

    <heading id="h-00011-en">[Steel sheet having lubricating film]</heading>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Hereinafter, a steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film of the present invention will be described.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The steel sheet of the present invention is characterized in that the steel sheet has a laminated-type lubricating film, and a first layer of the lubricating film contains, at a predetermined ratio, polyethylene oxide having a predetermined molecular weight and a copolymer obtained by polymerizing predetermined monomers. Since the first layer contains the polyethylene oxide, excellent lubricity is ensured. In addition, since the first layer includes the predetermined copolymer, the durability of the lubricating film itself can be improved, the scraping and peeling of the lubricating film at the time of processing of the steel sheet are more suppressed, and as a result, the excellent lubricity is maintained. In particular, in a wet environment, swelling of the first layer is more suppressed due to the presence of the copolymer, and the excellent lubricity is maintained even in a wet environment.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">
      <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing an embodiment of the steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film according to the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a steel sheet having an alkali-soluble lubricating film (hereafter also referred to simply as "steel sheet with a lubricating film") 10 includes a steel sheet 12 and a lubricating film 14. The lubricating film 14 has a laminated structure composed of a first layer 16 containing polyethylene oxide and a copolymer having a predetermined repeating unit, and a second layer 18 formed of an oil layer containing an oil component.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">More specifically, the steel sheet with a lubricating film 10 according to the present invention has the first layer 16 that contains (A) polyethylene oxide having a weight average molecular weight of 50,000 to 500,000 and (B) a copolymer of (X) a styrene-based hydrocarbon compound or an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 or more carbon atoms and (Y) either or both of a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxylic anhydride group and a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxy group, which are copolymerizable with (X); and the second layer 18 that is provided on the first layer 16 and is formed of an oil layer containing an oil component having a kinematic viscosity of 3 mm<sup>2</sup>/s to 32 mm<sup>2</sup>/s (40Â°C). Here, in the first layer, some or all of the carboxylic anhydride groups or the carboxy groups contained in (B) may be ammonia-modified, imidized, or blocked by an alcohol, and the ratio of the weight of (B) with respect to the total weight of (A) and (B) is greater than 5% by weight but less than 50% by weight. In the steel sheet with a lubricating film 10, the total adhesion amount of (A) and (B) is 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 1.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and the adhesion amount of the oil layer is 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 3.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The steel sheet with a lubricating film having the above laminated structure satisfies the level of lubricity currently required; even when being retained in a wet environment, the lubricity and press-formability thereof compares favorably with those in a dry environment; and it is possible to easily remove the lubricating film from the steel sheet in a degreasing step after the forming.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Hereinafter, the steel sheet 12 and the lubricating film 14 will be described in detail.</p>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">&lt;Steel sheet 12&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The steel sheet 12 used in the present invention is not particularly limited. Sheets of metal materials including iron, iron-based alloy, aluminum, aluminum-based alloy, copper and copper-based alloy, as well as plated such sheets are mentioned as a usable metal sheet. Among others, a zinc coated steel sheet is preferred. As described above, the press forming of the zinc coated steel sheet is technically more difficult than the press forming of other steel sheets. Therefore, if the zinc coated steel sheet is provided with the lubricating film of the present invention, the highest effect can be expected.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The zinc coated steel sheet is exemplified by a galvanized steel sheet, a zinc-nickel coated steel sheet, a zinc-iron coated steel sheet, a zinc-chromium coated steel sheet, a zinc-aluminum coated steel sheet, a zinc-titanium coated steel sheet, a zinc-magnesium coated steel sheet, a zinc-manganese coated steel sheet, a zinc-aluminum-magnesium coated steel sheet, and a zinc-aluminum-magnesium-silicon coated steel sheet.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In addition, as the zinc coated steel sheet, a zinc coated steel sheet of which the coating layer contains cobalt, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel, titanium, chromium, aluminum, manganese, iron, magnesium, lead, bismuth, antimony, tin, copper, cadmium, arsenic, or the like as a small amount of a different metal element or impurities; or has an inorganic substance such as silica, alumina, titania, or the like dispersed therein may also be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Furthermore, as the zinc coated steel sheet, a multilayer coated steel sheet obtained by combining the above-described zinc coating with another type of coating (for example, iron coating, iron-phosphorous coating, nickel coating, cobalt coating, or the like) can also be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">A coating method is not particularly limited, and a known method, for example, such as an electroplating method, a hot-dip coating method, an evaporation coating method, a dispersion coating method, a vacuum coating method, or the like, can be used.</p>
    <heading id="h-00013-en">&lt;Lubricating film 14&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The lubricating film 14 that is provided on the steel sheet 12 has the first layer 16 containing polyethylene oxide and the copolymer which will be described later (hereafter also referred to simply as "the first layer 16"), and the second layer 18 containing an oil component (hereafter also referred to simply as "the second layer 18").</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">By having such a laminated structure, the lubricating film 14 exhibits more excellent lubricity than that of the aluminum alloy sheet having the PEO film described in Patent Literature 1, and in a wet environment, the lubricating film 14 exhibits more excellent lubricity than that of the steel sheet with a lubricating film described in Patent Literature 2. In addition, while the first layer 16 disposed on the base material side (steel sheet side) can be more easily peeled off from the steel sheet in the degreasing step, the swelling thereof is suppressed even in a wet atmosphere, and the lubricity is maintained. That is, even when being retained in a wet atmosphere, in pressing or the like in which lubricity is required, the first layer and the second layer promptly enter the inside of a mold and continue to maintain an effect of sufficiently preventing the metal contact between the mold and the surface of the steel sheet.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Hereinafter, the first layer 16 and the second layer 18 will be described.</p>
    <heading id="h-00014-en">&lt;First layer 16&gt;</heading>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The first layer 16 constituting a lower layer of the lubricating film 14 has polyethylene oxide having a predetermined weight average molecular weight and a copolymer produced from predetermined compounds.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Hereinafter, first, the polyethylene oxide will be described in detail, and then, the copolymer will be described in detail.</p>
    <heading id="h-00015-en">(Polyethylene oxide)</heading>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The weight average molecular weight of polyethylene oxide (PEO) used is 50,000 to 500,000. When the weight average molecular weight is within the above-described range, the lubricating film exhibits excellent lubricity and excellent removability, and especially, from the viewpoint of excellent effects, the weight average molecular weight is preferably 60,000 to 400,000, and more preferably 70,000 to 300,000.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">When the weight average molecular weight is less than 50,000, the lubricating film does not exhibit sufficient lubricity. When the weight average molecular weight is greater than 500,000, not only that it is no longer possible to further improve lubricity, but also the viscosity of the aqueous solution is extremely increased, and thus, usability at the time of forming a lubricating film becomes remarkably poor.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The weight average molecular weight can be measured by a GPC measurement (gel permeation chromatography) in which tetrahydrofuran is used as an eluent and polyethylene glycol is used as a standard sample.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The polyethylene oxide used may be synthesized by a known method, or may be a commercially available product (for example, manufactured by Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd.) or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Polyethylene oxide is an ethylene glycol addition polymer, and has a three-dimensionally continuous helical structure in a single direction. In general, an ethylene glycol addition polymer having a high molecular weight is called polyethylene oxide (in general, weight average molecular weight of 50,000 or greater), and an ethylene glycol addition polymer having a low molecular weight is called polyethylene glycol (in general, weight average molecular weight of less than 50,000). Polyethylene oxide has the same basic structure as polyethylene glycol and has similar chemical properties to those of polyethylene glycol, but the physical properties thereof are significantly different from those of polyethylene glycol.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">When the weight average molecular weight of polyethylene oxide is 50,000 to 500,000 as described above, the full length per molecule is estimated to be about 0.3 Âµm to 3 Âµm. In a case where such molecules having a large molecular size constitute a thin film, it is presumed that the molecules in the film are arranged in directions in a plane parallel to the surface of the steel sheet.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Therefore, when stress is applied to the film in a vertical direction, destruction of the film is prevented by strong covalent bonds. In addition, when stress is applied thereto in a direction in the plane, the molecules are moved due to destruction of hydrogen bonds between the molecules, and thus, the deformation following performance of the film is ensured with respect to the deformation of the substrate. Furthermore, it is considered that the toughness of the film is expressed due to the high melting point and high viscosity resulting from the high molecular weight.</p>
    <heading id="h-00016-en">(Copolymer)</heading>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The first layer 16 constituting the lower layer of the lubricating film 14 contains a copolymer of (X) a styrene-based hydrocarbon compound or an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 or more carbon atoms and (Y) either or both of a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxylic anhydride group and a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxy group which are copolymerizable with (X), in which copolymer some or all of the carboxylic anhydride groups and the carboxy groups may be ammonia-modified, imidized, or blocked by an alcohol (hereafter also referred to simply as "copolymer").</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The weight average molecular weight of the copolymer used is not particularly limited, and it is preferably 4,000 to 400,000. When the weight average molecular weight is within the above-described range, the lubricating film exhibits more excellent lubricity and more excellent removability.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The weight average molecular weight can be measured by a GPC measurement (gel permeation chromatography) in which tetrahydrofuran is used as an eluent and polyethylene glycol is used as a standard sample.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As a monomer used to form the copolymer, (X) a styrene-based hydrocarbon compound or an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 or more carbon atoms can be mentioned, and the type of the monomer is not particularly limited.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Examples of the styrene-based hydrocarbon compound include styrene(vinylbenzene), Î±-methylstyrene(isopropenylbenzene), Î²-methylstyrene(1-propenylbenzene), 4-methylstyrene(4-vinyl-1-methylbenzene), and 2,3-dimethylstyrene(1-ethenyl-2,3-dimethylbenzene).</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 or more carbon atoms is preferably an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and more preferably an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 to 8 carbon atoms, and examples thereof include propylene, Î±-butylene (1-butene), cis-Î²-butylene (cis-2-butene), trans-Î²-butylene (trans-2-butene), isobutylene (2-methylpropene), 1-pentene, cis-2-pentene, trans-2-pentene, and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As another monomer used to form the copolymer, (Y) either or both of a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxylic anhydride group and a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxy group which are copolymerizable with (X) can be mentioned, and the type of the monomer or monomers is not particularly limited.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxylic anhydride group is preferably a compound obtained by intramolecular dehydration of two carboxy groups of a vinyl compound having two or more carboxy groups in one molecule, and examples thereof include maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Examples of the above vinyl compound having carboxy groups include maleic acid, fumaric acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, mesaconic acid, trans-aconitic acid, cis-aconitic acid, and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Here, the polymerizable unsaturated compound is a compound having a polymerizable unsaturated group, and the polymerizable unsaturated group refers to a group having a polymerizable double bond (for example, &gt;C=C&lt;).</p>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The copolymer may be any one of a random copolymer, an alternating copolymer, and a block copolymer.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In addition, some or all of the carboxylic anhydride groups or the carboxy groups contained in the copolymer may be ammonia-modified, imidized, or blocked by an alcohol. More specifically, some or all of the carboxylic anhydride groups contained in the copolymer may be imidized, or some or all of the carboxy groups contained therein may be ammonia-modified or blocked by an alcohol.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Here, the ammonia modification means that a carboxylic anhydride group or a carboxy group is allowed to react with ammonia to modify the carboxylic anhydride group or the carboxy group.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In addition, the imidization means that a carboxylic anhydride group or a carboxy group is made to be an amido group, and by a dehydration reaction or the like of the remaining carboxyl group with the amido group, an imide bond is generated.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Furthermore, the blocking by an alcohol means that a carboxylic anhydride group or a carboxy group is allowed to react with the hydroxy group in the alcohol to generate an ester group.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Here, the blocking by an alcohol is preferably performed by an alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. However, this is to keep the boiling point of the alcohol at the level of the drying temperature when the first layer is dried and film-formed on the steel sheet, and accordingly, in an environment in which the temperature when the first layer is dried and film-formed exceeds the boiling point of the alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the number of carbon atoms of the alcohol is not limited to this range. The alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms is preferably an alkyl alcohol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and examples thereof include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutyl alcohol, tert-butyl alcohol, and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">For example, in a case where carboxylic anhydride groups derived from maleic anhydride are contained in the copolymer, the ammonia modification or the imidization may be performed at any modification rate with respect to carboxylic acid. In many cases, the modification rate by alcohol is about 50% at most. The imidization may be modification of a monomer itself to be copolymerized, or may be modification after the monomer is copolymerized to a copolymer, and the modification rate thereof is also arbitrary. It is preferable that greater than 0 mol% and 50 mol% or less of the carboxylic anhydride groups derived from maleic anhydride are ammonia-modified or imidized.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In addition, in a case where the carboxylic anhydride groups derived from maleic anhydride are contained in the copolymer, in the blocking by an alcohol, greater than 0 mol% and 50 mol% or less of the carboxy groups obtained by ring-opening the carboxylic anhydride groups (hydrolysis) are preferably blocked by an alcohol. The blocking by an alcohol can also be referred to as esterification by an alcohol. The total blocking rate may be adjusted by mixing those having different blocking rates.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Furthermore, in a case where carboxylic anhydride groups derived from maleic acid are contained in the copolymer, in the ammonia-modification, imidization, or blocking by an alcohol, greater than 0 mol% and 50 mol% or less of the carboxy groups derived from maleic acid may be ammonia-modified, imidized, or blocked by an alcohol.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">If some of the carboxylic anhydride groups and the carboxy groups are ammonia-modified, imidized, or blocked by an alcohol, water-solubilization can be easily performed with respect to the preparation of a coating treatment liquid, and thus, it is advantageous for the preparation of chemicals.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">For the above (B), (X) a styrene-based hydrocarbon compound or an olefin-based hydrocarbon compound having 3 or more carbon atoms is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of styrene, isobutylene, and propylene (first monomer), and (Y) either or both of a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxylic anhydride group and a polymerizable unsaturated compound having a carboxy group is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of maleic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride, and itaconic acid (second monomer).</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The usage ratio of the first monomer to the second monomer (the first monomer/the second monomer) is not particularly limited. However, it is preferably 1/9 to 9/1, more preferably 2/8 to 8/2, and still more preferably 5/5 to 8/2. When the usage ratio, or weight ratio, is less than 1/9, workability is poor, that is, the film is easily broken at the time of press forming due to insufficient hardness of the film, and thus, it is not preferable. In contrast, when the weight ratio is greater than 9/1, the peelability of the film is decreased, and thus, it is not preferable.</p>
