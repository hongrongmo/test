      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. <i>Current Medicinal Chemistry </i>(2007) 14:2214-2234).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (e.g., PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3â²-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation. The class I PI3Ks (p110Î±, p110Î², p110Î´, and p110Î³) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The PI3Ks are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The delta (Î´) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K-Î´ is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K-Î´ is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PI3K-Î´ is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K-Î³, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Unlike PI3K-Î´, the beta (Î²) isoform of class I PI3K appears to be ubiquitously expressed. PI3K-Î² has been implicated primarily in various types of cancer including PTEN-negative cancer (Edgar et al. <i>Cancer Research </i>(2010) 70(3):1164-1172), and HER2-overexpressing cancer such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Described herein are compounds capable of selectively inhibiting certain isoform(s) of class I PI3K without substantially affecting the activity of the remaining isoforms of the same class. For example, non-limiting examples of inhibitors capable of selectively inhibiting PI3K-Î´ and/or PI3K-Î³, but without substantially affecting the activity of PI3K-Î² are disclosed. Such inhibitors can be effective in ameliorating disease conditions associated with PI3K-Î´/Î³ activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0088">While specific embodiments have been discussed, the specification is illustrative only and not restrictive. Many variations of this disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of this specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0089">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this specification pertains.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0090">As used in the specification and claims, the singular form âaâ, âanâ and âtheâ includes plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0091">As used herein, âagentâ or âbiologically active agentâ or âsecond active agentâ refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecules, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, an antibody fragment, a vitamin, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound, and metabolites thereof. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0092">The term âagonistâ as used herein refers to a compound or agent having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein or polypeptide, such as increasing the activity or expression of the target protein or polypeptide. Accordingly, the term âagonistâ is defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein or polypeptide. While some agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds and/or agents that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target protein or polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0093">The terms âantagonistâ and âinhibitorâ are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound or agent having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein or polypeptide, such as by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein or polypeptide. Accordingly, the terms âantagonistâ and âinhibitorâ are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein or polypeptide. While some antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein or polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein or polypeptide are also specifically included within this definition. Non-limiting examples of biological activity inhibited by an antagonist include those associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0094">An âanti-cancer agentâ, âanti-tumor agentâ or âchemotherapeutic agentâ refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. âChemotherapyâ means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0095">The term âcell proliferationâ refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0096">The term âco-administration,â âadministered in combination with,â and their grammatical equivalents, as used herein, encompasses administration of two or more agents to subject so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the subject at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0097">The term âeffective amountâ or âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to that amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including, but not limited to, disease treatment, as illustrated below. The therapeutically effective amount can vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on, for example, the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other agents, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0098">As used herein, the terms âtreatmentâ, âtreatingâ, âpalliatingâ and âamelioratingâ are used interchangeably herein. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including, but not limited to, therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient can still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0099">A âtherapeutic effect,â as that term is used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0100">âSignal transductionâ is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A âmodulatorâ of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator can augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0101">The term âselective inhibitionâ or âselectively inhibitâ as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target. For example, a compound that selectively inhibits one isoform of PI3K over another isoform of PI3K has an activity of at least 2Ã against a first isoform relative to the compound's activity against the second isoform (e.g., at least about 3Ã, 5Ã, 10Ã, 20Ã, 50Ã, or 100Ã).</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0102">âRadiation therapyâ means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as, but not limited to, alpha-particle emitting radionuclides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e., beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g., strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP), or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0103">âSubjectâ to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited to, humans (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g., infant, child, adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middle-aged adult or senior adult)) and/or other primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys); mammals, including commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs; and/or birds, including commercially relevant birds such as chickens, ducks, geese, quail, and/or turkeys.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0104">The term âin vivoâ refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0105">The term âin vitroâ refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay conducted outside of a subject. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells, alive or dead, are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0106">As used herein, âpharmaceutically acceptable estersâ include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl, and cycloalkyl esters of acidic groups, including, but not limited to, carboxylic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphinic acids, sulfonic acids, sulfonic acids and boronic acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0107">As used herein, âpharmaceutically acceptable enol ethersâ include, but are not limited to, derivatives of formula âCâC(OR) where R can be selected from alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl and cycloalkyl. Pharmaceutically acceptable enol esters include, but are not limited to, derivatives of formula âCâC(OC(O)R) where R can be selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, aralkyl and cycloalkyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0108">As used herein, a âpharmaceutically acceptable formâ of a disclosed compound includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives of disclosed compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0109">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. As used herein, the term âpharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in <i>J. Pharmaceutical Sciences </i>(1977) 66:1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, besylate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. In some embodiments, organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0110">Pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N<sup>+</sup>(C<sub>1-4</sub>alkyl)<sup>4</sup>- salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0111">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a âsolvateâ (e.g., a hydrate). As used herein, the term âsolvateâ refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water, the solvate is a âhydrateâ. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes that, for example, can include 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules. It will be understood that the term âcompoundâ as used herein encompasses the compound and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0112">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a prodrug. As used herein, the term âprodrugâ refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis (e.g., hydrolysis in blood). In certain cases, a prodrug has improved physical and/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmaceutically and/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., <i>Design of Prodrugs </i>(1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., âPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,â <i>A.C.S. Symposium Series</i>, Vol. 14, and in <i>Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design</i>, ed. Edward B.

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0113">The term âprodrugâ is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. Other examples of prodrugs include compounds that comprise âNO, âNO<sub>2</sub>, âONO, or âONO<sub>2 </sub>moieties. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well-known methods, such as those described in <i>Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery, </i>172-178, 949-982 (Manfred E.

      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0120">âEnantiomersâ are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A mixture of a pair of enantiomers in any proportion can be known as a âracemicâ mixture. The term â(Â±)â is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. âDiastereoisomersâ are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is an enantiomer, the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (â) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry at each asymmetric atom, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically substantially pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers can be prepared, for example, using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques.</p>

These terms refer to compositions in which the percent by weight of one enantiomer is greater than the amount of that one enantiomer in a control mixture of the racemic composition (e.g., greater than 1:1 by weight). For example, an enantiomerically enriched preparation of the S enantiomer, means a preparation of the compound having greater than about 50% by weight of the S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer, such as at least about 75% by weight, further such as at least about 80% by weight. In some embodiments, the enrichment can be much greater than about 80% by weight, providing a âsubstantially enantiomerically enriched,â âsubstantially enantiomerically pureâ or a âsubstantially non-racemicâ preparation, which refers to preparations of compositions which have at least about 85% by weight of one enantiomer relative to other enantiomer, such as at least about 90% by weight, and further such as at least 95% by weight.

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0129">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a tautomer. As used herein, the term âtautomerâ is a type of isomer that includes two or more interconvertable compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency (e.g., a single bond to a double bond, a triple bond to a single bond, or vice versa). âTautomerizationâ includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. âPrototropic tautomerizationâ or âproton-shift tautomerizationâ involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g., in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. Tautomerizations (i.e., the reaction providing a tautomeric pair) can be catalyzed by acid or base, or can occur without the action or presence of an external agent. Exemplary tautomerizations include, but are not limited to, keto-to-enol; amide-to-imide; lactam-to-lactim; enamine-to-imine; and enamine-to-(a different) enamine tautomerizations. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers.</p>

      <p id="p-00536-en" num="0411">In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds as disclosed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form thereof (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives), and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients carriers, including inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition described herein includes a second active agent such as an additional therapeutic agent, (e.g., a chemotherapeutic).</p>
      <p id="p-00537-en" num="0412">1. Formulations</p>
      <p id="p-00538-en" num="0413">Pharmaceutical compositions can be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets (e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption), capsules, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue, and intraduodenal routes; parenteral administration, including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin; intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream, stent or foam; sublingually; ocularly; pulmonarily; local delivery by catheter or stent; intrathecally, or nasally.</p>
      <p id="p-00539-en" num="0414">Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which can be employed in pharmaceutical compositions include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.</p>
      <p id="p-00540-en" num="0415">These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, lubricants, and/or antioxidants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the compounds described herein can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It can also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00541-en" num="0416">Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound described herein and/or the chemotherapeutic with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound as disclosed herein with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.</p>

      <p id="p-00550-en" num="0425">1A. Formulations for Oral Administration</p>
      <p id="p-00551-en" num="0426">In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing a compound as disclosed herein, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a disclosed compound; optionally (ii) an effective amount of one or more second agents; and (iii) one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00552-en" num="0427">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.</p>
      <p id="p-00553-en" num="0428">The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.</p>
      <p id="p-00554-en" num="0429">An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. In some embodiments, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00555-en" num="0430">Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00556-en" num="0431">Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00557-en" num="0432">Disintegrants can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00558-en" num="0433">Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00559-en" num="0434">When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, for example, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00560-en" num="0435">The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00561-en" num="0436">Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00562-en" num="0437">A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least about 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (âHLBâ value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.</p>
      <p id="p-00563-en" num="0438">Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00564-en" num="0439">Within the aforementioned group, ionic surfactants include, by way of example: lecithins, lysolecithin, phospholipids, lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00565-en" num="0440">Ionic surfactants can be the ionized forms of lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylserine, PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine, PVP-phosphatidylethanolamine, lactylic esters of fatty acids, stearoyl-2-lactylate, stearoyl lactylate, succinylated monoglycerides, mono/diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono/diglycerides, citric acid esters of mono/diglycerides, cholylsarcosine, caproate, caprylate, caprate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, oleate, ricinoleate, linoleate, linolenate, stearate, lauryl sulfate, teracecyl sulfate, docusate, lauroyl carnitines, palmitoyl carnitines, myristoyl carnitines, and salts and mixtures thereof.</p>

Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; 5,639,480; 5,733,566; 5,739,108; 5,891,474; 5,922,356; 5,972,891; 5,980,945; 5,993,855; 6,045,830; 6,087,324; 6,113,943; 6,197,350; 6,248,363; 6,264,970; 6,267,981; 6,376,461; 6,419,961; 6,589,548; 6,613,358; 6,699,500 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active agents using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions provided encompass single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.</p>
      <p id="p-00603-en" num="0478">All controlled release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. In some embodiments, the use of a controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the disease, disorder, or condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased subject compliance. In addition, controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00604-en" num="0479">In some embodiments, controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of a compound as disclosed herein that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of the compound in the body, the compound should be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active agent can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00605-en" num="0480">In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (see, Sefton, <i>CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. </i>14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., <i>Surgery </i>88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med. </i>321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill, i.e., thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, <i>Medical Applications of Controlled Release, </i>115-138 (vol. 2, 1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer, <i>Science </i>249:1527-1533 (1990). The one or more active agents can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The one or more active agents then diffuse through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active agent in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the needs of the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00606-en" num="0481">2. Dosage</p>
      <p id="p-00607-en" num="0482">A compound described herein can be delivered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds described herein and/or one or more additional therapeutic agents such as a chemotherapeutic, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In some instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent are administered in separate pharmaceutical compositions and can (e.g., because of different physical and/or chemical characteristics) be administered by different routes (e.g., one therapeutic is administered orally, while the other is administered intravenously). In other instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent can be administered separately, but via the same route (e.g., both orally or both intravenously). In still other instances, the compound described herein and the additional therapeutic agent can be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00608-en" num="0483">The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including, for example, the activity of the particular compound employed, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.</p>
      <p id="p-00609-en" num="0484">In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound described herein and/or a chemotherapeutic will be that amount of the compound which, in some embodiments, can be the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, doses of the compounds described herein for a patient, when used for the indicated effects, will range from about 0.0001 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per day, or about 0.0001 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.001 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.01 mg to 1000 mg, or about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg per day, or about about 1 mg to 50 mg per day, or about 5 mg to 40 mg. An exemplary dosage is about 10 to 30 mg per day. In some embodiments, for a 70 kg human, a suitable dose would be about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, such as about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g., by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.</p>
      <p id="p-00610-en" num="0485">In some embodiments, the compounds can be administered daily, every other day, three times a week, twice a week, weekly, or bi-weekly. The dosing schedule can include a âdrug holiday,â i.e., the drug can be administered for two weeks on, one week off, or three weeks on, one week off, or four weeks on, one week off, etc., or continuously, without a drug holiday. The compounds can be administered orally, intravenously, intraperitoneally, topically, transdermally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intranasally, sublingually, or by any other route.</p>
      <p id="p-00611-en" num="0486">In some embodiments, a compound as provided herein is administered in multiple doses. Dosing can be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing can be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment, a compound as disclosed herein and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment, the administration of a compound as provided herein and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment, the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00612-en" num="0487">Administration of the pharmaceutical compositions as disclosed herein can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent as disclosed herein is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00613-en" num="0488">Since the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with other treatments (such as additional chemotherapeutics, radiation or surgery), the doses of each agent or therapy can be lower than the corresponding dose for single-agent therapy. The dose for single-agent therapy can range from, for example, about 0.0001 to about 200 mg, or about 0.001 to about 100 mg, or about 0.01 to about 100 mg, or about 0.1 to about 100 mg, or about 1 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.</p>
      <p id="p-00614-en" num="0489">When a compound provided herein, is administered in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound provided herein unit dose forms of the agent and the compound provided herein can be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00615-en" num="0490">3. Kits</p>
      <p id="p-00616-en" num="0491">In some embodiments, provided herein are kits. The kits can include a compound or pharmaceutical composition as described herein, in suitable packaging, and written material that can include instructions for use, discussion of clinical studies, listing of side effects, and the like. Such kits can also include information, such as scientific literature references, package insert materials, clinical trial results, and/or summaries of these and the like, which indicate or establish the activities and/or advantages of the pharmaceutical composition, and/or which describe dosing, administration, side effects, drug interactions, or other information useful to the health care provider. Such information can be based on the results of various studies, for example, studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials.</p>
      <p id="p-00617-en" num="0492">In some embodiments, a memory aid is provided with the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows âFirst Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . etc. . . . Second Week, Monday, Tuesday, . . . â etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A âdaily doseâ can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.</p>
      <p id="p-00618-en" num="0493">The kit can further contain another agent. In some embodiments, the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as separate pharmaceutical compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments, the compound as disclosed herein and the agent are provided as a single pharmaceutical composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use (e.g., measuring cup for liquid preparations, foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air, and the like) are known in the art and can be included in the kit. In other embodiments, kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active agents. Examples of such devices include, but are not limited to, syringes, drip bags, patches, and inhalers. Kits described herein can be provided, marketed and/or promoted to health providers, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, formulary officials, and the like. Kits can also, in some embodiments, be marketed directly to the consumer.</p>
      <p id="p-00619-en" num="0494">An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. The strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00620-en" num="0495">Kits can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active agents. For example, if an active agent is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration, the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active agent can be dissolved to form a particulate-free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.</p>
      <p id="p-00621-en" num="0496">The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., about 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Therapeutic Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00622-en" num="0497">Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are members of a conserved family of lipid kinases that regulate numerous cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and metabolism. Several classes of PI3Ks exist in mammalian cells, including Class IA subgroup (e.g., PI3K-Î±, Î², Î´), which are generally activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs); Class IB (e.g., PI3K-Î³), which is activated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), among others. PI3Ks exert their biological activities via a âPI3K-mediated signaling pathwayâ that includes several components that directly and/or indirectly transduce a signal triggered by a PI3K, including the generation of second messenger phosphotidylinositol, 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the plasma membrane, activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling, and generation of further second messengers such as cAMP, DAG, and IP3, all of which leads to an extensive cascade of protein kinase activation (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2001) <i>Annu Rev Biochem. </i>70:535-602). For example, PI3K-Î´ is activated by cellular receptors through interaction between the PI3K regulatory subunit (p85) SH2 domains, or through direct interaction with RAS. PIP3 produced by PI3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with plextrin homology (PH) domain containing enzymes (e.g., PDK-1 and AKT [PKB]). (Fung-Leung WP. (2011) <i>Cell Signal. </i>23(4):603-8). Unlike PI3K-Î´, PI3K-Î³ is not associated with a regulatory subunit of the p85 family, but rather with a regulatory subunit in the p101 family. PI3K-Î³ is associated with GPCRs, and is responsible for the very rapid induction of PIP3. PI3K-Î³ can be also activated by RAS.</p>
      <p id="p-00623-en" num="0498">In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of modulating a PI3K kinase activity (e.g., selectively modulating) by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable form (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, isomers, prodrugs, and isotopically labeled derivatives) thereof, or pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein. Modulation can be inhibition (e.g., reduction) or activation (e.g., enhancement) of kinase activity. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein in solution. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting the kinase activity by contacting a cell, tissue, organ that express the kinase of interest with a compound provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity in a subject by administering into the subject an effective amount of a compound as provided herein. In some embodiments, the kinase activity is inhibited (e.g., reduced) by more than about 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% when contacted with a compound provided herein as compared to the kinase activity without such contact. In some embodiments, provided herein are methods of inhibiting PI3 kinase activity in a subject (including mammals such as humans) by contacting said subject with an amount of a compound as provided herein sufficient to inhibit or reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase in said subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00624-en" num="0499">In some embodiments, the kinase is a lipid kinase or a protein kinase. In some embodiments, the kinase is selected from a PI3 kinase including different isoforms such as PI3 kinase Î±, PI3 kinase Î², PI3 kinase Î³, PI3 kinase Î´; DNA-PK; mTor; Abl, VEGFR, Ephrin receptor B4 (EphB4); TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE2); FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3); Platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); RET; ATM; ATR; hSmg-1; Hck; Src; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); KIT; Inulsin Receptor (IR); and IGFR.</p>
      <p id="p-00625-en" num="0500">As used herein, a âPI3K-mediated disorderâ refers to a disease or condition involving aberrant PI3K-mediated signaling pathway. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K-Î´ or PI3K-Î³ mediated disorder in a subject, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments, provided herein is a method for inhibiting at least one of PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³, the method comprising contacting a cell expressing PI3K in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of the compound or composition provided herein. PI3Ks have been associated with a wide range of conditions, including immunity, cancer and thrombosis (reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck, B. et al. (2010) <i>Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology</i>, DOI 10.1007/82<sub>â</sub>2010<sub>â</sub>65). For example, Class I PI3Ks, particularly PI3K-Î³ and PI3K-Î´ isoforms, are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity; thus, these PI3Ks are believed to be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies (reviewed in Harris, S J et al.

PI3K-Î´ is an important mediator of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, and is upstream of AKT, calcium flux, PLCÎ³, MAP kinase, P70S6k, and FOXO3a activation. PI3K-Î´ is also important in IL4R, S1P, and CXCR5 signaling, and has been shown to modulate responses to toll-like receptors 4 and 9 Inhibitors of PI3K-Î´ have shown the importance of PI3K-Î´ in B-cell development (Marginal zone and B1 cells), B-cell activation, chemotaxis, migration and homing to lymphoid tissue, and in the control of immunoglobulin class switching leading to the production of IgE.

      <p id="p-00628-en" num="0503">In T-cells, PI3K-Î´ has been demonstrated to have a role in T-cell receptor and cytokine signaling, and is upstream of AKT, PLCÎ³, and GSK3b. In PI3K-Î´ deletion or kinase-dead knock-in mice, or in inhibitor studies, T-cell defects including proliferation, activation, and differentiation have been observed, leading to reduced T helper cell 2 (TH2) response, memory T-cell specific defects (DTH reduction), defects in antigen dependent cellular trafficking, and defects in chemotaxis/migration to chemokines (e.g., S1P, CCR7, CD62L).

      <p id="p-00629-en" num="0504">In neutrophils, PI3K-Î´ along with PI3K-Î³, and PI3K-Î², contribute to the responses to immune complexes, FCÎ³RII signaling, including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor (FMLP) or complement component C5a (C5a) in a PI3K-Î³ dependent manner, followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K-Î´ dependent, and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K-Î´, PI3K-Î³, and PI3K-Î², and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease (Randis T M et al. (2008) <i>Eur J Immunol. </i>38(5):1215-24; Pinho V, (2007) <i>J Immunol. </i>179(11):7891-8; Sadhu C. et al. (2003) <i>J Immunol. </i>170(5):2647-54; Condliffe A M et al. (2005) <i>Blood </i>106(4):1432-40). It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases, preferential activation of PI3KÎ² may be involved. (Kulkarni et al., <i>Immunology </i>(2011) 4(168) ra23: 1-11). It was also reported that PI3KÎ²-deficient mice were highly protected in an FcÎ³R-dependent model of autoantibody-induced skin blistering and partially protected in an FcÎ³R-dependent model of inflammatory arthritis, whereas combined deficiency of PI3KÎ² and PI3KÎ´ resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis.

The allergen/IgE crosslinking of FCgR1 resulting in cytokine release and degranulation of the mast cells is severely inhibited by treatment with PI3K-Î´ inhibitors, suggesting a role for PI3K-Î´ in allergic disease (Ali K et al. (2004) <i>Nature </i>431(7011):1007-11; Lee K S, et al. (2006) <i>FASEB J. </i>20(3):455-65; Kim M S, et al. (2008) <i>Trends Immunol. </i>29(10):493-501).</p>
      <p id="p-00632-en" num="0507">Natural killer (NK) cells are dependent on both PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ for efficient migration towards chemokines including CXCL10, CCL3, SIP and CXCL12, or in response to LPS in the peritoneum (Guo H, et al. (2008) <i>J Exp Med. </i>205(10):2419-35; Tassi I, et al. (2007) <i>Immunity </i>27(2):214-27; Saudemont A, (2009) <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>106(14):5795-800; Kim N, et al.

      <p id="p-00633-en" num="0508">The roles of PI3K-Î´, PI3K-Î³, and PI3K-Î² in the differentiation, maintenance, and activation of immune cells support a role for these enzymes in inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma, and inflammatory respiratory disease such as COPD. Extensive evidence is available in experimental animal models, or can be evaluated using art-recognized animal models. In an embodiment, described herein is a method of treating inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis) to allergic inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and COPD using a compound described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00634-en" num="0509">For example, inhibitors of PI3K-Î´ and/or -Î³ have been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in several autoimmune animal models for rheumatoid arthritis (Williams, O. et al. (2010) Chem Biol, 17(2):123-34; WO 2009/088986; WO2009/088880; WO 2011/008302). PI3K-Î´ is expressed in the RA synovial tissue (especially in the synovial lining which contains fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and selective PI3K-Î´ inhibitors have been shown to be effective in inhibiting synoviocyte growth and survival (Bartok et al. (2010) <i>Arthritis Rheum </i>62 Suppl 10:362). Several PI3K-Î´ and -Î³ inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate arthritic symptoms (e.g., swelling of joints, reduction of serum-induced collagen levels, reduction of joint pathology and/or inflammation), in art-recognized models for RA, such as collagen-induced arthritis and adjuvant induced arthritis (WO 2009/088986; WO2009/088880; WO 2011/008302).</p>
      <p id="p-00635-en" num="0510">The role of PI3K-Î´ has also been shown in models of T-cell dependent response, including the DTH model. In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, the PI3K-Î³/Î´-double mutant mice are resistant. PI3K-Î´ inhibitors have also been shown to block EAE disease induction and development of TH-17 cells both in vitro and in vivo (Haylock-Jacobs, S. et al. (2011) <i>J. Autoimmunity </i>36(3-4):278-87).</p>
      <p id="p-00636-en" num="0511">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease that at different stages requires memory T-cells, B-cell polyclonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells, and the innate immune response to endogenous damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPS), and the inflammatory responses to immune complexes through the complement system as well as the F<sub>C </sub>receptors. The role of PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ together in these pathways and cell types suggest that blockade with an inhibitor would be effective in these diseases. A role for PI3K in lupus is also predicted by two genetic models of lupus. The deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) leads to a lupus-like phenotype, as does a transgenic activation of Class1A PI3Ks, which includes PI3K-Î´. The deletion of PI3K-Î³ in the transgenically activated class 1A lupus model is protective, and treatment with a PI3K-Î³ selective inhibitor in the murine MLR/lpr model of lupus improves symptoms (Barber, D F et al. (2006) <i>J. Immunol. </i>176(1): 589-93).</p>
      <p id="p-00637-en" num="0512">In allergic disease, PI3K-Î´ has been shown by genetic models and by inhibitor treatment to be essential for mast-cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphalaxis assay (Ali K et al. (2008) <i>J Immunol. </i>180(4):2538-44; Ali K, (2004) <i>Nature </i>431(7011):1007-11). In a pulmonary measure of response to immune complexes (Arthus reaction) a PI3K-Î´ knockout is resistant, showing a defect in macrophage activation and C5a production. Knockout studies and studies with inhibitors for both PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ support a role for both of these enzymes in the ovalbumin induced allergic airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness model (Lee K S et al. (2006) <i>FASEB J. </i>20(3):455-65). Reductions of infiltration of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes as well as TH2 cytokines (IL4, IL5, and IL13) were seen with both PI3K-Î´ specific and dual PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ inhibitors in the Ova induced asthma model (Lee K S et al. (2006) <i>J Allergy Clin Immunol </i>118(2):403-9).</p>
      <p id="p-00638-en" num="0513">PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ inhibition can be used in treating COPD. In the smoked mouse model of COPD, the PI3K-Î´ knockout does not develop smoke induced glucocorticoid resistance, while wild-type and PI3K-Î³ knockout mice do. An inhaled formulation of dual PI3K-Î´ and PI3K-Î³ inhibitor blocked inflammation in a LPS or smoke COPD models as measured by neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance (Doukas J, et al. (2009) <i>J Pharmacol Exp Ther. </i>328(3):758-65).</p>

      <p id="p-00643-en" num="0518">A PI3K-Î´ inhibitor (CAL-101) has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with haematological malignancies, and showed activity in CLL in patients with poor prognostic characteristics. In CLL, inhibition of PI3K-Î´ not only affects tumor cells directly, but it also affects the ability of the tumor cells to interact with their microenvironment. This microenvironment includes contact with and factors from stromal cells, T-cells, nurse like cells, as well as other tumor cells. CAL-101 suppresses the expression of stromal and T-cell derived factors including CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13, as well as the CLL tumor cells' ability to respond to these factors. CAL-101 treatment in CLL patients induces rapid lymph node reduction and redistribution of lymphocytes into the circulation, and affects tonic survival signals through the BCR, leading to reduced cell viability, and an increase in apoptosis. Single agent CAL-101 treatment was also active in mantle cell lymphoma and refractory non Hodgkin's lymphoma (Furman, R R, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Webb, H K, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Meadows, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Kahl, B, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Lannutti B J, et al.

      <p id="p-00644-en" num="0519">PI3K-Î´ inhibitors have shown activity against PI3K-Î´ positive gliomas in vitro (Kashishian A, et al. Poster presented at: The American Association of Cancer Research 102<sup>nd </sup>Annual Meeting; 2011 Apr. 2-6; Orlando, Fla.). PI3K-Î´ is the PI3K isoform that is most commonly activated in tumors where the PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated (Ward S, et al. (2003) <i>Chem Biol. </i>10(3):207-13). In this subset of tumors, treatment with the PI3K-Î´ inhibitor either alone or in combination with a cytotoxic agent can be effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00645-en" num="0520">Another mechanism for PI3K-Î´ inhibitors to have an affect in solid tumors involves the tumor cells' interaction with their micro-environment. PI3K-Î´, PI3K-Î³, and PI3K-Î² are expressed in the immune cells that infiltrate tumors, including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. PI3K-Î´ inhibitors can modify the function of these tumor-associated immune cells and how they respond to signals from the stroma, the tumor, and each other, and in this way affect tumor cells and metastasis (Hoellenriegel, J, et al. 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.).</p>
      <p id="p-00646-en" num="0521">PI3K-Î´ is also expressed in endothelial cells. It has been shown that tumors in mice treated with PI3K-Î´ selective inhibitors are killed more readily by radiation therapy. In this same study, capillary network formation is impaired by the PI3K inhibitor, and it is postulated that this defect contributes to the greater killing with radiation. PI3K-Î´ inhibitors can affect the way in which tumors interact with their microenvironment, including stromal cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells and be therapeutic either on its own or in conjunction with another therapy (Meadows, S A, et al. Paper presented at: 52<sup>nd </sup>Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition; 2010 Dec. 4-7; Orlando, Fla.; Geng L, et al. (2004) <i>Cancer Res. </i>64(14):4893-9).</p>
      <p id="p-00647-en" num="0522">In other embodiments, inhibition of PI3K (such as PI3K-Î´ and/or -Î³) can be used to treat a neuropsychiatric disorder, e.g., an autoimmune brain disorder. Infectious and immune factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, Sydenham's chorea (SC) (Garvey, M. A. et al. (2005) <i>J. Child Neurol. </i>20:424-429), Tourette's syndrome (TS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (Asbahr, F. R. et al. (1998) <i>Am. J. Psychiatry </i>155:1122-1124), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) (Hirschtritt, M. E. et al. (2008) <i>Child Neuropsychol. </i>1:1-16; Peterson, B. S. et al. (2000) <i>Arch. Gen. Psychiatry </i>57:364-372), anorexia nervosa (Sokol, M. S. (2000) <i>J. Child Adolesc. Psychopharmacol. </i>10:133-145; Sokol, M. S. et al. (2002) <i>Am. J. Psychiatry </i>159:1430-1432), depression (Leslie, D. L. et al. (2008) <i>J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry </i>47:1166-1172), and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Hollander, E. et al. (1999) <i>Am. J. Psychiatry </i>156:317-320; Margutti, P. et al. (2006) <i>Curr. Neurovasc. Res. </i>3:149-157). A subset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorders and tic disorders has been grouped as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci (PANDAS). PANDAS disorders provide an example of disorders where the onset and exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms is preceded by a streptococcal infection (Kurlan, R., Kaplan, E. L. (2004) <i>Pediatrics </i>113:883-886; Garvey, M. A. et al. (1998) <i>J. Clin. Neurol. </i>13:413-423). Many of the PANDAS disorders share a common mechanism of action resulting from antibody responses against streptococcal associated epitopes, such as GlcNAc, which produces neurological effects (Kirvan. C. A. et al. (2006) <i>J Neuroimmunol. </i>179:173-179). Autoantibodies recognizing central nervous system (CNS) epitopes are also found in sera of most PANDAS subjects (Yaddanapudi, K. et al. (2010) <i>Mol. Psychiatry </i>15:712-726). Thus, several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with immune and autoimmune components, making them suitable for therapies that include PI3K-Î´ and/or -Î³ inhibition.</p>

For example, one or more PI3K-Î´ and/or -Î³ inhibitors described herein can be used alone or in combination with any suitable therapeutic agent and/or modalities, e.g., dietary supplement, for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

      <p id="p-00697-en" num="0572">In one embodiment, provided herein is a method of treating, preventing and/or managing scleroderma. Scleroderma is a group of diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin and/or other connective tissues. Scleroderma may be localized (e.g., affecting only the skin) or systemic (e.g., affecting other systems such as, e.g., blood vessels and/or internal organs). Common symptoms of scleroderma include Raynaud's phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and skin changes (e.g., swollen fingers and hands, or thickened patches of skin). In some embodiments, the scleroderma is localized, e.g., morphea or linear scleroderma. In some embodiments, the condition is a systemic sclerosis, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis, diffuse systemic sclerosis, or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.</p>
      <p id="p-00698-en" num="0573">Localized scleroderma (localized cutaneous fibrosis) includes morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea is typically characterized by oval-shaped thickened patches of skin that are white in the middle, with a purple border. Linear scleroderma is more common in children. Symptoms of linear scleroderma may appear mostly on one side of the body. In linear scleroderma, bands or streaks of hardened skin may develop on one or both arms or legs or on the forehead. En coup de sabre (frontal linear scleroderma or morphea en coup de sabre) is a type of localized scleroderma typically characterized by linear lesions of the scalp or face.</p>
      <p id="p-00699-en" num="0574">Systemic scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) includes, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis (also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis (also known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis), and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma. CREST stands for the following complications that may accompany limited scleroderma: calcinosis (e.g., of the digits), Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. Typically, limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms, and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement, with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See, e.g., Denton, C. P. et al. (2006), <i>Nature Clinical Practice Rheumatology, </i>2(3):134-143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas in the diffuse subtype, onset of Raynaud's phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension, severe bowel involvement, and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis, lung fibrosis, and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs (e.g., kidneys, esophagus, heart, or lungs). Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.</p>

      <p id="p-00876-en" num="0740">Compound 17 was prepared from compound 2 and 2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-ylboronic acid using the following procedure:</p>
      <p id="p-00877-en" num="0741">Compound 2 (230 umol), boronic acid (690 umol, 3 eq.), sodium carbonate (1.15 mmol, 5 eq.), RuPhos (70 umol, 0.30 eq.), and palladium diacetate (35 umol, 0.15 eq.) were combined in a 2 mL microwave-reaction tube with a stir bar which was sealed with a septum. The atmosphere was purged three times with vacuum, backfilled with dry argon, then 1,4-dioxane (1.6 mL) and water (0.4 mL) were added. The reaction was subjected to microwave heating at 125Â° C. for 3 h; analysis by LC/MS indicated complete consumption of substrate and reaction intermediates. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (ca. 30 mL), treated with silica gel (ca. 1 g) and concentrated; flash chromatography of this residue (on 15 g silica gel, eluting with a MeOH/DCM or ethyl acetate/hexanes gradient as required, approx. 750 mL total eluent) gave the product 17. ESI-MS m/z: 545.00 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00878-en" num="0742">The following compounds were also prepared from compound 2 using the analogous coupling conditions for compound 17 in Example 12:</p>

To this mixture, (S)-tert-butyl 1-(methoxy(methyl)amino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylcarbamate (1.39 g, 6.0 mmol, 1.2 eq) was added quickly. The resulting mixture was allowed to slowly warm to RT (over 1 h) and then stirred at RT for an additional 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0Â° C., quenched with water (5.0 mL), and then acidified with aqueous HCl (5 M) to adjust the pH to 5-6. The mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was suspended in a mixture of MeOH (20 mL) and H<sub>2</sub>O (5.0 mL), concentrated HCl (10.0 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at reflux for 2 h. The mixture was cooled to â5Â° C. and basified with saturated aqueous NH<sub>4</sub>OH to adjust the pH to 8-9. The precipitate was filtered off and the filtrate was extracted with DCM (3Ã20 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (1-10% MeOH-DCM) to afford the product, (S)-3-(1-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)isoquinolin-1(2H)-one 67.</p>

The mixture was diluted with DCM, treated with silica gel (ca. 1 g) and concentrated in vacuo. Purification of this residue by flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with 0-8% MeOH in DCM, gave the 8-pyridazine 92. ES+ m/z=478.9 [M+H]<sup>+</sup>.</p>

      <p id="p-00969-en" num="0827">A PI3-Kinase HTRFÂ® assay kit (cat No. 33-016) purchased from Millipore Corporation was used to screen compounds provided herein. This assay used specific, high affinity binding of the GRP1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to PIP3, the product of a Class 1A or 1B PI3 Kinase acting on its physiological substrate PIP2. During the detection phase of the assay, a complex was generated between the GST-tagged PH domain and biotinylated short chain PIP3. The biotinylated PIP3 and the GST-tagged PH domain recruited fluorophores (Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin and Europium-labeled anti-GST respectively) to form the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) architecture, generating a stable time-resolved FRET signal. The FRET complex was disrupted in a competitive manner by non-biotinylated PIP3, a product formed in the PI3 Kinase assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00970-en" num="0828">PI3 Kinase Î±, Î², Î³ and Î´ activity was assayed using the PI3 Kinase HTRFÂ® assay kit (catalogue No. 33-016) purchased from Millipore Corporation. Purified recombinant PI3KÎ± (catalogue No. 14-602-K), PI3KÎ² (catalogue No. 14-603-K), PI3KÎ³ (catalogue No. 14-558-K) and PI3KÎ´ (catalogue No. 14-604-K) were obtained from Millipore Corporation. Purified recombinant PI3K enzyme was used to catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2 at 10 Î¼M) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in the presence of 10 Î¼M ATP. The assay was carried out in 384-well format and detected using a Perkin Elmer EnVision Xcite Multilabel Reader. Emission ratios were converted into percent inhibitions and imported into GraphPad Prism software. The concentration necessary to achieve inhibition of enzyme activity by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated using concentrations ranging from 20 Î¼M to 0.1 nM (12-point curve). IC<sub>50 </sub>values were determined using a nonlinear regression model available in GraphPad Prism 5.</p>

      <p id="p-00971-en" num="0829">The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 Î¼M stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 Î¼L, containing 5 Î¼M test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 Î¼L is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 24 hours at 37Â° C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 Î¼L of the incubation mixture to 100 Î¼L of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at â20Â° C. until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 Î¼M) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2Ã20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.</p>

      <p id="p-00972-en" num="0830">Class I PI3-Ks can be either purchased (p110Î±/p85Î±, p110Î²/p85Î±, p110Î´/p85Î± from Upstate, and p110Î³ from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). IC<sub>50 </sub>values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 Î¼g/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 Î¼Ci of Î³-32P-ATP to a final concentration of 10 or 100 Î¼M and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 Î¼l 1N HCl followed by 160 Î¼l CHCl<sub>3</sub>:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl<sub>3</sub>. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 Î¼M). For compounds showing significant activity, IC<sub>50 </sub>determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00973-en" num="0831">Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and/or agonists of PI3-Ks including, but not limited to, PI 3-Kinase Î±, Î², Î´, and Î³. An exemplary system is PI 3-Kinase (human) HTRFâ¢ Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtiter plate (e.g., a 384 well microtiter plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20 Î¼l per well. In the first step, each well receives 2 Î¼l of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5 Î¼l of a kinase/PIP2 mixture (diluted in 1Ã reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3 Î¼g/ml kinase and 10 Î¼M PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5 Î¼l of ATP (diluted in 1Ã reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 Î¼M ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 Î¼l of Stop Solution per well and then 5 Î¼l of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC<sub>50</sub>s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.</p>

Mice were gently restrained while 20 Î¼L of solution was applied to the hind foot pads of each mouse. The hind foot pads of the mice were used as they represent an anatomical site that can be easily isolated and immobilized without anesthesia. On day 5, mice were administered a single dose of vehicle, a compound provided herein at 10, 3, 1, or 0.3 mg/kg, or dexamethasone at a dose of 5 mg/kg by oral gavage. Thirty minutes later mice were anaesthetized, and a solution of 0.25% DNFB in a 4:1 acetone/olive oil solution was applied to the left inner and outer ear surface. This application resulted in the induction of swelling to the left ear and under these conditions, all animals responded to this treatment with ear swelling. A vehicle control solution of 4:1 acetone/olive oil was applied to the right inner and outer ear. Twenty four hours later, mice were anaesthetized, and measurements of the left and right ear were taken using a digital micrometer. The difference between the two ears was recorded as the amount of swelling induced by the challenge of DNFB. Drug treatment groups were compared to vehicle control to generate the percent reduction in ear swelling. Dexamethasone is routinely used as a positive control as it has broad anti-inflammatory activity.</p>

The animals are placed in the induction chamber until anesthetized by delivery of 4-5% isoflurane in O<sub>2 </sub>and then held in that state using a nose cone on the procedure table. Maintenance level of isoflurane is at 1-2%. Animals are injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single injection of purified PG-PS 10S Group A, D58 strain (concentration 25 Î¼g/g of bodyweight) suspended in sterile 0.85% saline. Each animal receives a total volume of 500 microliters administered in the lower left quadrant of the abdomen using a 1 milliliter syringe with a 23 gauge needle. Placement of the needle is critical to avoid injecting the PG-PS 10S into either the stomach or caecum. Animals are under continuous observation until fully recovered from anesthesia and moving about the cage. An acute response of a sharp increase in ankle measurement, typically 20% above baseline measurement can peak in 3-5 days post injection. Treatment with test compounds can be PO, SC, IV or IP. Rats are dosed no more than two times in a 24 hour time span. Treatment can begin on day 0 or any day after that through day 30. The animals are weighed on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and beginning again on day 12-30 or until the study is terminated.

      <p id="p-01027-en" num="0885">(a) Acute Allergen Challenge Models</p>
      <p id="p-01028-en" num="0886">Several models are known in the art and any of such models can be used. Although various allergens can be used to induce asthma-like conditions, the principle is consistent throughout the methods. Briefly, asthma-like conditions are induced through multiple systemic administration of the allergen (e.g., ova, house dust mite extracts and cockroach extracts) in the presence of an adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide. Alternatively, an adjuvant-free system can be used, but it usually requires a higher number of exposures to achieve suitable sensitization. Once induced, animals exhibit many key features of clinical asthma such as: elevated levels of IgE; airway inflammation; goblet cell hyperplasia; epithelial hypertrophy; AHR ro specific stimuli; and early and late phase bronchoconstriction. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.</p>
      <p id="p-01029-en" num="0887">(b) Chronic Allergen Challenge Models</p>
      <p id="p-01030-en" num="0888">Chronic allergen challenge models aim to reproduce more of the features of the clinical asthma, such as airway remodeling and persistent AHR, than acute challenge models. While allergens similar to those used in acute allergen challenge models can be used, in chronic allergen challenge models, animals are subjected to repeated exposure of the airways to low levels of allergen for a period of up to 12 weeks. Once induced, animals exhibit key features of human asthma such as: allergen-dependent sensitization; a Th2-dependent allergic inflammation characterized by eosinophillic influx into the airway mucosa; AHR; and airway remodeling as evidenced by goblet cell hyperplasia, epithelial hypertrophy, subepithelial or peribronchiolar fibrosis. Potential efficacy of a compound thus can be assessed by determining whether one or more of these clinical features are reversed or mitigated.</p>

Briefly, female BALB/cBY (donor) and C.B.-17/Prkdc scid/scid (recipient) mice are housed in a specific pathogen-free environment and are used between 6 and 8 weeks of age. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are enriched from BALB/cBy splenocytes using a mouse CD4 enrichment kit.

      <heading id="h-00130-en" level="1">Models for Scleroderma</heading>
      <p id="p-01033-en" num="0891">A compound's efficacy in treating scleroderma can be tested using animal models. An exemplary animal model is a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin (âBLMâ) described, for example, in Yamamoto et al., <i>J Invest Dermatol </i>112: 456-462 (1999), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. This mouse model provides dermal sclerosis that closely resembles systemic sclerosis both histologically and biochemically. The sclerotic changes observed in the model include, but are not limited to: thickened and homogenous collagen bundles and cellular filtrates; gradual increase in number of mast cells; degranulation of mast cells; elevated histamine release; increase in hydroxyproline in skin; presence of anti-nuclear antibody in serum; and strong expression of transforming growth factor Î²-2 mRNA. Therefore, efficacy of a compound in treating scleroderma can be assessed by monitoring the lessening of one or more of these changes.</p>
      <p id="p-01034-en" num="0892">Briefly, the following exemplary procedures can be used to generate the mouse model for scleroderma: Specific pathogen-free, female BALB/C mice and C3H mice of 6 weeks old, weighing about 20 g, are purchased and maintained with food and water ad libitum. BLM is dissolved in PBS at differing concentrations and sterilized with filtration. Aliquots of each concentration of BLM or PBS are injected subcutaneously into the shaved back of the mice daily for 1-4 weeks with a needle. Alternatively, mice are injected every other day.</p>
      <p id="p-01035-en" num="0893">Histolopathological and biochemical changes induced can be assessed using any methods commonly practiced in the field. For example, histopathological changes can be assessed using a standard avidine-biotin peroxidase technique with anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody, anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibody, anti-mouse pan-tissue-fixed macrophage antibody, anti-stem cell factor monoclonal antibody, anti-transforming growth factor-Î² polyclonal antibody, and anti-decorin antibody. Cytokine expression of cellular infiltrates can be assessed by using several anti-cytokine antibodies. Hydroxyproline level can be assessed by hydrolyzing skin pieces with hydrochloric acid, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and colorimetrically assessing the hydrolates at 560 nm with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Pepsin-resistant collagen can be assessed by treating collagen sample extracted from biopsied tissues and analyzing by polyacrylamide stacking gel electrophoresis. Mast cells can be identified by toluidine blue, and cells containing matachromatic granules can be counted under high magnification of a light microscope. Serum levels of various cytokines can be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels of the cytokines can be assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autoantibodies in serum can be detected using 3T3 fibroblasts as the substrate for the screening.</p>

Purified myosin from rabbit skeletal muscle (6.6 mg/ml) is emulsified with an equal amount of Freund's complete adjuvant and 3.3 mg/ml <i>Mycobacterium butyricum</i>. The mice are immunized repeatedly with emulsified rabbit myosin. Once myositis is induced, inflammatory cell filtration and necrotic muscle fiber should be evident in the model. In the muscles of animals, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are mainly located in the perimysum and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are mainly located in the endomysium and surround non-necrotic muscle fibers. TNFÎ±, IFNÎ³ and perforin are up-regulated and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is increased in the muscles.</p>
      <p id="p-01038-en" num="0896">To assess the efficacy of a compound, following administration of the compound through adequate route at specified dose, the mice are killed and muscle tissues are harvested. The muscle tissue is immediately frozen in chilled isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen, and then cryostat sections are prepared. The sections are stained with hematoxylin and eosin for counting of number of infiltrated cells. Three sections from each mouse are prepared and photomicrographs are obtained. For immunohistochemical tests, cryostat sections of muscle are dried and fixed in cold acetone at â20Â° C. The slides are rehydrated in PBS, and then endogeneous peroxide activity is blocked by incubation in 1% hydrogen peroxide. The sections are incubated overnight with rat anti-mouse CD4 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-mouse CD8 monoclonal antibody, rat anti-mouse F4/80 monoclonal antibody or normal rat IgG in antibody diluent. The samples are washed with PBS and incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG pretreated with 5% normal mouse serum. After washing with PBS, the samples are incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. After washing PBS, diaminobenzidine is used for visualization.</p>
