    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method for producing fine powder of raw and processed materials that are used for the products in all sorts of technical fields, such as pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, paint, copiers, solar cells, secondary batteries and recording media. The present invention further relates to the fine powder produced by the present method. The present invention especially relates to a method for producing fine powder having significantly improved dissolvability and mixing uniformity.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The existing candidate compounds for medicines often have a low solubility. The medicines of a low solubility is not absorbed effectively from digestive organs and is increased in dosage and also varied in absorption depending upon individual differences of patients, and thereby becomes difficult in making into a pharmaceutical product in some cases. In addition, particular medicines have a very small percentage of active ingredients in the medicines. In order to expect medical effects from medicines, therefore, it is important to secure the content uniformity of active ingredients in a pharmaceutical preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The fine or impalpable powder has been produced by pulverizing various forms of raw materials such as particulate and powdery materials in smaller size and/or by dispersing aggregated particles in the raw material. As such a method for producing the fine or impalpable powder as mentioned above, a dry pulverization method represented by a jet mill and a hammer mill, and a wet medium pulverization method using a solid medium for pulverization such as a ball mill and a sand mill and a bead mill have been used. In the wet medium pulverization method using a bead mill, a slurry including the raw materials is agitated in a vessel together with a number of beads, each of which is formed by a sphere having a diameter of a few hundred microns to a few millimeters, and the raw materials are pulverized to become a fine or impalpable powder, for example, by a collision of a number of beads moving in the slurry and by a dispersion of secondary aggregated particles. As the beads for pulverization or dispersion, for example, ceramic beads made of hard and chemically stable zirconia, resin beads made of urethane or nylon that can reduce metal contamination or metal beads made of abrasion-resistant stainless steel have been used.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In general, the bead that is used by the wet medium pulverization method for the purpose of pulverization or dispersion is made of the material having a higher degree of hardness than the hardness of the raw material to be pulverized.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The beads are driven by rapidly spinning desks of a wet medium pulverizer, for example, a bead mill, so that the beads gain commensurate momentum to move in the slurry at a proper speed. As a result, the beads strike against an inner wall of the vessel or a rotating shaft of the disks, and thereby abrade the inner wall of the vessel or the rotating shaft of the disks. Therefore, the materials of the vessel and the rotating shaft might mix in the slurry and contaminate the raw material to be pulverized. In addition, the beads collide with each other and are subject to wear. Therefore, the materials of the beads might also mix in the slurry.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Japanese Patent Publication No. 03-068444 (JP03-068444A) teaches that a process of charging fine powder having the particle size of below 100 Î¼m, for example, below 10 Î¼m into a bath of cryogenic or cryoscopic liquid prevents the particles of the fine powder from cohering and can mix a different kind of powder particles homogeneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-046899 (JP2001-046899A) discloses a continuous circulation type bead mill, which is adapted to prevent the abrasion of a vessel etc. of a wet type media grinding machine, comprising a plurality of stirring members disposed in a cylindrical stirring tank and arranged at predetermined intervals apart from each other, a stirring part for agitating bead-like dispersion media filled in the stirring tank and a slurry-like ground material to be injected into the stirring tank, a centrifugal separation part arranged above the stirring part to centrifuge the dispersion media from the ground material and take the ground material out of the stirring tank, and means for preventing the abrasion of an upper surface of the centrifugal separation part and an inner wall of the stirring tank.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-306940 (JP2002-306940A) discloses a continuous circulation type bead mill, which is adapted to use dispersion beads having very small particle size without causing any clogging with undispersed pigment particles and any wear by the dispersion beads, wherein a flow passage is formed to extend from an annular space defined by an inner wall of a vessel and an outer peripheral surface of a rotor to a discharge port of the vessel through the inside of the rotor, a centrifuge is arranged at an intermediate position of the flow passage in the rotor, the bead mill is used for centrifugally separating the dispersion beads from dispersion-treated paste due to the centrifugal force created by the rotor of the centrifuge.</p>

Therefore, when pulverizing other materials by the same wet type grinding machine, it is necessary to take the slurry and the beads out of the vessel to clean the vessel and it would be necessary to make a cleaning operation of the wet type grinding machine and wash out the beads taken out of the vessel.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0021">Various means of wear prevention are suggested so as to prevent an abrasion of an upper surface of a centrifuge or an abrasion of an inner wall of an agitated vessel in a wet type media grinding machine, however, these means of wear prevention cannot prevent an abrasion of bead that may be caused by a collision of beads in a process of pulverization or dispersion. Zirconia is a hard and abrasion-resistant material appropriate to bead, however, a measure of abrasion of a bead cannot be avoided even by the use of zirconia beads. When producing fine powder of a high degree of purity, for example, a medicinal bulk powder and the like, it is necessary to prevent a bead material from mixing in the fine powder so as to ensure the safety of humans.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0022">In a conventional method of a wet type medium grind performed by the use of a wet type medium grinding machine, it is necessary to separate beads for pulverization or dispersion from a slurry by a centrifuge and the like, because when the medium grinding process is completed, the beads for pulverization or dispersion remain in the slurry where the fine powder produced from a bulk material exists. The process for separating the beads increases the number of steps for producing fine powder by the use of a wet type medium grinding method.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0023">Furthermore, the fine powder produced by the above method adheres to a surface of the beads for pulverization or dispersion and separating the beads from the slurry brings out the fine powder adhered to the surface of the beads from the slurry together with the beads. In order to collect the fine powder adhered to the surface of the beads, a further process for recovering the fine powder is necessary, and it would be difficult to collect the fine powder from the small surface of the beads. Since the conventional method of a wet type medium grind is required for a process for separating the beads used as a medium for pulverization or dispersion, as mentioned above, and thereby is subject to reduction of the recovery rate of the fine powder, the conventional method is not necessarily appropriate to a method for pulverizing such an expensive material as a bulk material of medicine and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">In the conventional wet grinding method that employs grinding media, the dispersive medium is mainly water and the grinding is performed at normal temperature. Therefore, a method for pulverizing the material that is hydrolysable and is easily affected by heat is required. When using water as dispersive medium, a process for separating fine powder from slurry is necessary, and a particular drying process of the fine powder is required because the fine powder is separated as powder slurry. In addition, the powder slurry has the disadvantage that it readily forms cohesive powder when dried.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0025">In order to enhance pulverization of the material by using solid beads for pulverization or dispersion, the pulverization has to be performed by using beads having a smaller diameter as the pulverization proceeds. In other words, it is necessary to change the beads during the pulverization process or the dispersion process of the material. This is because the beads having a smaller diameter can reduce the size of powder particle. To replace the beads for pulverization or dispersion requires a process for drawing the beads having a larger diameter from the slurry and a process for putting the beads having a smaller diameter into the slurry. As a result, the number of processes for producing fine powder is increased, and the collection rate of the produced fine powder is decreased because it is difficult to collect the fine powder adhered to the beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0026">The first object of the present invention is to provide an extreme cold grinding method that employs grinding media, which can pulverize materials into a submicron-sized to nano-sized powder particle; which can pulverize low-melting materials and water-soluble substances; which can pulverize materials even more uniformly; which can pulverize materials simultaneously with retaining the crystal structure of the materials; which makes it possible to obtain dry powder without an operation of liquid-solid separation.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0027">The second object of the present invention is to provide an extreme cold grinding method that employs grinding media, which can improve the resolvability of bulk powder of drugs and medicines significantly.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0028">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a fine power, simultaneously with avoiding the possibility of contaminating the fine power, and to provide the fine powder produced by the method of the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0030">Further object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a fine power, which can achieve a high collection rate of fine powder, and to provide the fine powder produced by the method of the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0032">Further object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing fine powder, which can promote pulverization of the fine powder without exchanging the beads for pulverization or dispersion, and to provide the fine powder produced by the method of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0033">Further object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing fine powder inexpensively, readily and without increasing the number of processes, and to provide the fine powder produced by the method of the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Means of Solving the Problems</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0034">In the first embodiment of the present invention, the raw materials for pulverization such as bulk powder for medicines and additives, for example, dispersing agents and the like, are suspended in a liquefied inert gas, for example, liquid nitrogen and the like, and then the raw materials are subjected to a dry grinding at very low temperature by a grinding method employing grinding media and are pulverized to a submicron-sized to nano-sized powder particle.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0035">In the second embodiment of the present invention, the raw materials for pulverization and the additives are individually or simultaneously ground by means of grinding media, for example, zirconia beads and the like, in the liquefied inert gas, for example, liquid nitrogen, and then the grinding media is removed and the liquefied inert gas is vaporized. Thereby, the raw materials can be pulverized to a submicron-sized to nano-sized powder particle and the homogeneous mixture of the raw materials for pulverization and the additives can be obtained. The grinding medium is preferably a bead of zirconia, agate, quartz, titania, tungsten carbide, silicon nitride, alumina, stainless steel, soda glass, low soda glass, less soda glass, high-density glass, and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide, frozen nitrous oxide). The particle diameter of the bead is preferably in the range of 0.03 mm to 25.00 mm, more preferably in the range of 0.03 mm to 2.00 mm. The liquefied inert gas is preferably liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, liquid neon, liquid argon, liquid krypton, liquid xenon and the like. The additives are preferably water-soluble additives for medicines and dispersion accelerating agents for medicines, such as Hypromellose-Acetate-Succinate (HPMCAS), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), Methacrylic Acid Polymer (Eudragit L100), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MMC), low substituted hydroxy-propylcellulose (L-HPC), hydroxypropyl-cellulose (HPMC), and lactose.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0036">In the third embodiment of the present invention, the material for pulverization and granular dry ice are dispersed in liquefied inert gas, which is used as a dispersive medium, to produce the slurry and then, the slurry is agitated by a grinding machine so that the material for pulverization is pulverized in the slurry. The pulverization of the material means pulverization and/or dispersion of the material. By using granular dry ice as substitute for the conventional beads for pulverization, it can be prevented that an inner wall of a grinding vessel and a rotating shaft of a grinding machine wear by the impingement of the conventional beads and the abrasion powder of those materials mixes in the slurry; and it is also prevented that the conventional beads hit each other and the abrasion powder of the conventional beads mixes in the slurry. The conventional bead includes a ceramic bead made of alumina, agate, zirconia, silicon nitride, titania etc., a metal bead made of steel, tungsten carbide, stainless steel etc., a glass bead made of soda glass, fused quartz etc., and a plastic bead made of urethane and so on. When using the conventional bead, the conventional bead that is harder than the material for pulverization is chosen. Since those conventional bead pulverize the material by shock compression, friction, shearing and/or shear stress and so on, the bead is destroyed and any exogenous material is generated if the bead is not harder than the material for pulverization. In contrast to the conventional bead, the granular dry ice used by the present invention does not contaminate the produced fine powder because the granular dry ice sublimes and evaporates after the pulverization of the material is completed.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0037">The third embodiment of the present invention is further characterized by the steps of: after the material is pulverized in slurry, vaporizing the liquefied inert gas from the slurry and sublimating the granular dry ice to produce dry powder of the material. The vaporization of the liquefied inert gas and the sublimation of the granular dry ice may be carried out by leaving the slurry out at room temperature. When the material is pulverized in slurry and then the liquefied inert gas is vaporized and the dry ice is sublimated, the pulverized material having the form of fine powder remains. Therefore, the fine powder can be collected directly. In other words, the pulverized material having the form of fine powder can be absolutely prevented from discharging out of the slurry together with the liquefied inert gas and the dry ice, because a process for collecting the fine powder of the pulverized material, that is, a process for separating liquefied inert gas and dry ice from slurry, is not necessary for this embodiment of the present invention. Therefore, the collection rate of the fine powder of the pulverized material can be progressed grossly. Since the collected fine powder has low water content, therefore, it can be dried easily and it can be prevented from agglutinating after dried.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0038">The present invention uses liquefied inert gas as a dispersive medium, wherein preferred dispersive medium is liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, liquid neon, liquid argon, liquid krypton, and liquid xenon.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0039">Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide can be cited as the dry ice used by the present invention, wherein preferred dry ice is solid carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0040">The dry ice used by the present invention can be prepared by crushing so-called ârigid dry iceâ, which is formed by molding powdery dry ice, in an appropriate manner. The average size of granular dry ice used by the present invention may be determined, for example, in the rage of 0.01 mm to 25.0 mm. The average size of the granular dry ice may be set in the range of 0.10 mm to 1.00 mm. In order to pulverize the material, the average size of the granular dry ice may be determined in the range of 0.30 mm to 1.00 mm. In order to disperse the material in slurry, the average size of granular dry ice may be determined in the range of 0.03 mm to 0.30 mm. In addition, a lump of dry ice is prepared as substitute for granular dry ice and the lump of dry ice is agitated in liquefied inert gas together with the material for pulverization by means of a grinding machine, so that the lump of dry ice is crushed to granular dry ice and simultaneously, the material is pulverized and/or dispersed by the granular dry ice to obtain fine particles having a predetermined particle size. Furthermore, the particle size of dry ice can be adjusted to a desired range of diameter by the processes of putting beads for pulverization, for example, zirconia beads and the like and a lump of or granular dry ice in liquefied inert gas, pulverizing the dry ice in a grinding machine for a predetermined period of time, and then separating the beads for pulverization. In addition, the material for pulverization can be included in a grain of dry ice.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0041">The dry ice grain used in this embodiment can be generated by the processes of filling liquid nitrogen in a container for storing liquefied gas, putting a commercially produced dry ice, for example, dry ice for shot blasting, in the liquid nitrogen, and immersing the dry ice in the liquid nitrogen for twelve hours. In the prosecution of those processes, the liquid nitrogen and the dry ice should be mixed so that the ratio of the volume occupied by the liquid nitrogen to the volume occupied by the dry ice is 2:1. The granular dry ice is obtained by separating the liquid nitrogen from the mixture after the immersion of twelve hours. The granular dry ice can be used as dry ice beads for pulverization. When the cylindrical dry ice for shot blasting having the diameter of 3.0 mm and the length of 5.0 mm to 30.0 mm, called âShot Dryâ, is immersed in liquid nitrogen according to those processes, for example, for twelve hours, granular dry ice having an average diameter of 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm is generated.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0042">The method for producing fine powder according to the present invention is further characterized by generating the slurry of material that the material for pulverization and the granular dry ice are dispersed in the dispersive medium of liquefied inert gas, and agitating the slurry in a grinding machine so that the particle size of the granular dry ice reduces while the material for pulverization is pulverized in the slurry. As the particle size of granular dry ice gradually reduces, for example, by the abrasion of the dry ice particle, the material for pulverization is pulverized to fine particles having smaller size in a similar fashion to the conventional process for enhancing the pulverization of the material by exchanging a bead of larger size to a bead of smaller size. The method for producing fine powder according to the present invention can enhance the pulverization of the material effectively only by prolonging the operation time of a grinding machine and without exchanging the beads for pulverization or dispersion.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0043">The method for producing fine powder according to the present invention comprises the steps of generating a suspension of pulverizing material in a dispersive medium of a liquefied inert gas, and agitating the suspension together with beads for pulverization or dispersion by a pulverizer to pulverize the material in the suspension, wherein a granular dry ice is substituted for all of the beads or a part of the beads. Since the amount of beads to be used for pulverization or dispersion can be reduced by substituting granular dry ice for all of or a part of the conventional beads for pulverization or dispersion that has been used in a pulverizer, the quantity of abrasion of beads is decreased and the degree of contamination of fine powder can be reduced. By substituting the granular dry ice for a part of the beads for pulverization or dispersion, the pulverization or dispersion by the beads and by the dry ice can be performed simultaneously. Hereinbefore, liquid nitrogen can be used as the liquefied inert gas and a bead mill can be used as the pulverizer. In addition, the granular dry ice can consist of particles of solid carbon dioxide having a particle size of 0.30 to 1.00 mm.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0044">Due to the cold brittleness of the substance existing at a very low temperature and due to the effect of preventing particles from aggregation by the dispersive medium that permeates to a nicety of particles, the present invention can pulverize materials to fine particles of submicron size or nano-size, which cannot be attained by the conventional methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0045">According to the conventional pulverization method, amorphous transformation of bulk powder is found after the pulverization, however, according to the present method for pulverization, neither crystalline transformation of bulk powder nor crystalline descent is found before and after the pulverization. In other words, the method of the present invention can pulverize bulk powder with retaining the crystal form and crystalline of the bulk powder.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0046">The method of the present invention can pulverize low melting point materials or easily water-solvable materials. The method of the present invention can also pulverize materials more uniformly as compared to the method for pulverizing at normal temperature. Furthermore, the liquefied inert gas such as liquid nitrogen sublimes at a normal temperature and dry powder can be obtained directly from the material subject to the pulverization process. As a result, the present invention can improve the resolvability of bulk powder of drugs and medicines and, especially, the present invention will contribute to the development of pharmaceutical preparations that improves physiological application for oral administration due to the improvement of resolvability of low-solubility bulk powder of drugs. Thereby, the present invention can drastically improve the resolvability of active constituents of medicines and also improve the resolvability and the rate of dissolution of industrial materials when the present invention is applied to industrial materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0047">The method of the present invention can pulverize the material and additives into the particles of submicron size or nano size so that the solvability of the pulverized material and additives can be improved dramatically and simultaneously, a homogeneous mixture of the material and additives pulverized into submicron size or nano size can be obtained by a simple and easy operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0048">The method of the present invention can manufacture fine powder at a lower price and without difficulty and by smaller number of processes. Although the materials that can be pulverized by the present invention is not limited, water-soluble materials that are difficult to be pulverized by the conventional wet medium pulverization method and pharmaceutical bulk powder that should not be contaminated by any impurities can effectively be pulverized and dispersed by the method of present invention. Recently, the number of low solubility substances to be used as raw materials of pharmaceutical products is expressly increasing. It is eagerly required to improve the dissolution behavior of those medicines of low solubility by means of pulverization. The method for producing fine powder according to the present invention is expected to facilitate controlling the degree of pulverization and consequently improve the solubility and the rate of dissolution of medicines of low solubility, because the method of the present invention can improve the degree of pulverization of medicines merely by extending the processing time for pulverization, without carrying out the conventional process for changing beads. In addition, the method for producing fine powder according to the present invention can improve the collection rate of fine powder without contaminating expensive raw materials of medicines. Since the method for producing fine powder according to the present invention uses liquefied inert gas as dispersive medium, the raw materials can be pulverized without mixing dispersing agent such as a polymeric dispersant and a surfactant into the dispersive medium. Therefore, the fine powder to be produced is not contaminated with the exotic components for improving dispersion.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0097">The material or substance that can be pulverized by the present invention is not limited to extraordinary materials or substances. However, the present invention is especially available for pulverization of raw material of low dissoluble medicines such as Phenytoin and Ibuprofen.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0098">The additives or addition agents that is available for the present invention may be additives that are usually used as additives of medicines, such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), Methacrylic Acid Polymer (Eudragit L100), Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), low substituted hydroxy-propylcellulose (L-HPC) hydroxy-propylcellulose (HPMC) and lactose. The additives should be selected as appropriate according to the kind of material concurrently pulverized with the additives.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0099">As to beads that would be available for the present invention, the beads made of the materials such as zirconia, agate, quarts, titania, tungsten carbide, silicon nitride, alumina, stainless steel, soda glass, low soda glass, soda less glass, high density glass and dry ice (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide) can be quoted. The adequate diameter of a particle of a bead is considered to be within the range from 0.03 to 25 mm, preferably within the range from 0.03 to 2 mm. The material and size of a bead should be determined depending on the properties of the material and additive to be pulverized and the targeted size of particles etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0100">The method of the present invention is performed under the extreme cold condition generated by liquefied inert gas such as liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, liquid neon, liquid argon, liquid krypton and liquid xenon. Among these liquefied gases, liquid nitrogen is most preferable for the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0101">According to the pulverizing method of the present invention, pulverized and homogeneously mixed particles can be obtained by the steps of: pulverizing the material and additives in liquefied inert gas at a ultra low temperature with use of medium of bead, and removing the beads by the means commonly used in the technical field and evaporating or spontaneously evaporating the liquefied inert gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0102">As a result of concurrently pulverizing the material and additives in liquefied inert gas at ultra low temperature with use of medium of bead, the material and additives can be simultaneously pulverized into submicron-sized particles or nano-sized particles whereby pulverized materials having improved resolvability can be produced. After the simultaneous pulverization of the material and additives, the medium of pulverization is removed by commonly used means and the liquefied inert gas is evaporated or spontaneously evaporated, whereby the pulverized and homogeneously mixed particles having improved resolvability can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0103">On the other hand, the pulverized and homogeneously mixed particles can be obtained by the steps of: individually pulverizing the material and the additives in liquefied inert gas at ultra low temperature with use of medium of bead, removing the medium of bead by the means commonly used in the field of technology, mixing the slurry containing the pulverized material with the slurry containing the pulverized additives, and evaporating or spontaneously evaporating the liquid nitrogen.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0104">Since the method of the present invention can be operated with use of a bead mill etc. in accordance with the manner of operation commonly used in the technical field, the manner of operation is not described in detail in the specification of this application.</p>

      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0105">Phenytoin and Ibuprofen (low melting point: 76Â° C.) were used as very insoluble medical agent. Salbutamol sulfate was used as water-soluble medical agent. Zirconia bead (a small sphere, spherule) (YTZ ball by NIKKATO CORPORATION) having the particle diameter of 0.1 mmÃ, 0.3 mmÃ, 0.6 mmÃ, and 1.0 mmÃ was used as a grinding medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0106">Pulverizing Apparatus</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0107">The ultra low temperature medium pulverizing apparatus (LN2 Bead Mill) that is schematically illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> was used. This apparatus is a batch bead pulverizer (Ready Mill RMB-4, AIMEX CO., LTD.) that has been modified as a device for pulverizing in liquid nitrogen. The apparatus comprises a vessel <b>1</b> and rotating discs <b>3</b>, all of which are made of zirconia.</p>

      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0116">In an ultra low temperature medium grinding apparatus (LN2 bead mill) illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the bulk volume of 180 mL (the weight of 658 g) of a zirconia bead (a spherule) <b>4</b> having a diameter of 0.1 mmÃ¸, 0.3 mmÃ¸, 0.6 mmÃ¸ or 1.0 mmÃ¸ was put into a vessel <b>1</b> having a volume of 400 mL and then the bulk volume of 50 mL (the weight of 15 g to 20 g) of medical substance was fed into the vessel <b>1</b>. Next, liquid nitrogen <b>5</b> was fed into the vessel <b>1</b> to occupy the volume of 90% in the vessel <b>1</b>. And, by rotating a rotating shaft <b>2</b> at a predetermined velocity, a medium grind (bead milling) was performed. The rotating shaft <b>2</b> was continuously rotated for 30 minutes while liquid nitrogen <b>5</b> was supplied to the vessel <b>1</b> as needed to make up for the loss caused by vaporization of liquid nitrogen <b>5</b>. After the pulverization, the beads were sieved from the slurry by use of a sieve having apertures corresponding the size of bead. The sieved slurry was left at a room temperature and under atmospheric pressure in order to volatilize liquid nitrogen <b>5</b> from the slurry. Thereby, the dry powder of pulverized particles was obtained.</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0121">The pulverized particles were dispersed by compressed air (0.4 MPa) and then, the dry particle size distribution was measured by a laser diffraction apparatus for measuring particle size distribution (LMS-30, SEISHIN ENTERPRISE CO., LTD.).

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows electron micrographs (SEM) of the original bulk of phenytoin and the pulverized particles of phenytoin. Comparing <figref>FIG. 2(B)</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2(C)</figref>, it was found that the particles pulverized by the LN2 bead mill were regular in shape and they are smaller in particle size and elongation than the particles pulverized by the Jet mill. Since the majority of the particles of phenytoin, which were pulverized by the LN2 bead mill, have the dimension of 1 Î¼m or below, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2(B)</figref>, it is found that the objective of pulverizing the material into submicron size has been attained by the ultra low temperature medium grinding with the LN2 bead mill, although it could not be attained by the conventional dry method for pulverization.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 32</figref> represents the particle distribution of the bulk powder of phenytoin (OriB), the particle distribution of the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill, and the particle distribution of the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the ultra low temperature medium grinding apparatus (LN2 bead mill) according to the present invention, wherein all the particle distributions were the results measured by the aforementioned dry method (Dry method). <figref>FIG. 33</figref> represents the particle distribution of the bulk powder of phenytoin (OriB), the particle distribution of the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill, and the particle distribution of the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the ultra low temperature medium grinding apparatus (LN2 bead mill) according to the present invention, wherein all the particle distribution were the results measured by the aforementioned wet method (Wet method). In both the measurement values of the dry method and the wet method, the particle distributions of the pulverized phenytoin (LN2) were broadened from approximately 0.3 Î¼m to 10 Î¼m, which were inconsistent with the electron micrographs (SEM). It is presumed that these measurement values were the results of measuring the sizes of the particles and the sizes of the aggregated particles contained therein. However, the percentage of the mass consisting of the particles having the size of 1 Î¼m or below (the rate of submicron size particles) was measured up to 32% with regard to the particles pulverized by the wet method, which were three and a half times as much as the percentage figures measured as to the particles pulverized by the dry method, and thereby indicating excellent pulverizing effects of the wet method. When the diameter of zirconia bead is in the range of 0.3-1.0 mmÃ, the effects of pulverization were substantially the same over the range. When the diameter of zirconia bead is 0.1 mmÃ, however, a relatively inferior effect of pulverization was measured. From these measurement values, it is presumed that the results of pulverization depend not only upon the number of collisions among beads but also upon the force generated by the collision of a bead.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 34</figref> represents the results of powder X-ray diffractometry (XRPD) of the original bulk of phenytoin (OriB), the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill, and the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the ultra low temperature medium grinding apparatus (LN2 bead mill) according to the present invention, which were measured by a powder X-ray diffractometry device (RAD-2VC, Rigaku Corporation). <figref>FIG. 35</figref> represents differential scanning calory of the original bulk of phenytoin (OriB), the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill, and the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the ultra low temperature medium grinding apparatus (LN2 bead mill) according to the present invention, which were measured by a differential scanning calorimetry apparatus (DSC-60, SHIMADZU CORPORATION). As seen in the sample values attached to <figref>FIG. 35</figref>, the difference between AH value of the original bulk of phenytoin and AH value of the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the LN2 bead mill was very little, and crystalline descent was not found in the phenytoin (LN2) pulverized by the LN2 bead mill. On the other hand, the difference between AH value of the original bulk of phenytoin and AH value of the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill was substantial, and it was found that the degree of crystallinity of the phenytoin (Jet) pulverized by the dry method jet mill was reduced to 81%. As described above, neither crystalline transformation nor crystalline descent was found in the phenytoin (LN2) before or after pulverized by the LN2 bead mill, so that it was found that the pulverization of phenytoin was processed with retaining the crystal form and crystalline of the phenytoin.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0130">As an example of the present invention, the very low temperature medium grinding method according to the present invention may comprise the steps of: mixing additives such as dispersing agent with the original bulk and the like of pharmaceutical preparations; making a slurry that a mixture of the original bulk and the additives are suspended in a liquid nitrogen; and processing the slurry by a dry type very low temperature medium grinding method to pulverize the mixture of the original bulk and the additives into submicron sized particles or nano sized particles. In order to improve the solubility of low soluble medicines, the medicines have been pulverized into nano-sized particles to increase the superficial area thereof. When medicine was pulverized simply, however, the intensity of surface activity of the medicine increased just as much as the superficial area of the medicine had increased, so that it was observed that the pulverized particles of the medicine tended to agglutinate. The agglutinated particles decrease in solubility, so that the solubility of medicine might not be improved by the pulverization of medicine. In contrast, it is expected to prevent the original bulk from agglutinating by the method comprising the steps of: mixing the material such as original bulk of medicine with dispersing agent, pulverizing a mixture of the original bulk and dispersing agent by the ultra low temperature medium grinding method according to the present invention, and thereby obtaining pulverized particles between which the dispersing agent intervenes to prevent the agglutination. In addition, it is considered that the simultaneous pulverization of different materials, that is, the original bulk of medicine and the dispersing agent, further reduces particle diameters of the original bulk and the dispersing agent due to the difference between the physical property of the original bulk and that of the dispersing agent. As a result, the superficial area of the original bulk has further increased so that the original bulk is dispersed extremely rapidly in human body and the solubility of medicine can be improved drastically. Furthermore, the pulverized particles of medicine can be dispersed at an intended region of human body by selecting dispersing agent to ascertain the intended medicinal benefits. We prepared the first to third samples of fine powder and plotted the solubility of these samples against time on a graph. The first sample was prepared by pulverizing the original bulk of medicine by the ultra low temperature medium grinding method of the present invention. The second sample was prepared by pulverizing the original bulk of medicine and the dispersing agent individually by the ultra low temperature medium grinding method of the present invention and then, mixing the pulverized original bulk of medicine with the pulverized dispersing agent. The third sample was prepared by mixing the original bulk of medicine with the dispersing agent and then, pulverizing a mixture of the original bulk of medicine and the dispersing agent by the ultra low temperature medium grinding method of the present invention. Reviewing the graph, the solubility of the first sample increased gradually and in an approximately linear fashion as time advances. The solubility of the second sample increased relatively at a sharp angle in the early stages of dissolution and then, increased gradually to converge with the solubility value of approximately 1.3 times higher than the corresponding solubility value of the first sample. In contrast, the solubility of the third sample increased extremely rapidly to the solubility value of approximately 5 times higher than the corresponding solubility value of the second sample in the early stages of dissolution and then, increased in an arc to the solubility value of approximately 2 times higher than the corresponding solubility value of the second sample and then, increased gradually to the expected solubility value of 1.4 times higher the corresponding solubility value of the second sample. In the early stages of dissolution, the solubility of the first sample is approximately 1% and the solubility of the second sample is approximately 10%, however, the expected value of solubility of the third sample is 50 to 60%.</p>

The measurement was carried out under the basic pulverizing condition by use of zirconia beads (550 g, that is, 150 ccÃ3.66 g/cc). In addition, the preparation process for measurement comprises the steps of: adding phenytoin (0.1 g) as material to be pulverized to sulfuric acid; heating and dropping nitric acid to break down organic matter; verifying the complete dissolution by visual observation and then diluting by adding ultrapure water to become a given weight. The measurement was carried out by ICP-MS method (measuring mass number: Zr (90); analytical curve: 0, 1, 2, 5 ppb (A 1,000 ppm standard solution was diluted and used.).

      <heading id="h-00051-en" level="1">Concurrently Pulverizing Phenytoin and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)</heading>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0181">In compliance with the method for producing fine powder according to the present invention, phenytoin 7.5 g and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 7.5 g were concurrently pulverized by use of dry ice beads in the batch bead pulverizer Ready Mill RMB-04 (vessel volume 400 ml) manufactured by AIMEX Corporation, to which the standard disc assembly <b>19</b> was attached. The results of the concurrently pulverizing are shown in <figref>FIG. 45</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0182">The experimental conditions are as follows: <ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>(1) Vertical medium agitating mill: vessel volume 0.4 liter; standard disc assembly of three discs each having a diameter of 55 mm and a thickness of 5 mm</li><li>(2) Peripheral velocity of disc of the standard disc assembly: 8.05 m/s</li><li>(3) Pulverizing time: from 30 minutes to 120 minutes</li><li>(4) Volume of dry ice: 150 cc</li><li>(5) Weight of phenytoin: 7.5 g</li><li>(6) Weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP): 7.5 g</li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0189">In <figref>FIG. 45</figref>, the item of quantitative value (%) indicates a ratio of phenytoin composition included in concurrently pulverized materials to feed composition. If the quantitative value is equal to or more than 90%, the pulverizing process is of practical use. From <figref>FIG. 45</figref>, it is found that the quantitative value (%) obtained from the samples pulverized by dry ice beads is far higher than the quantitative value (%) obtained from the sample pulverized by zirconia beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0190">The above experiment used the batch bead pulverizer Ready Mill RMB-04 (vessel volume 400 ml) manufactured by AIMEX Corporation, to which the standard disc assembly <b>19</b> was attached. In addition to the above experiment, phenytoin 7.5 g and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 7.5 g were concurrently pulverized by use of dry ice beads in the batch bead pulverizer Ready Mill RMB-04 (vessel volume 400 ml) manufactured by AIMEX Corporation, wherein the disc assembly having rotating wings as shown in <figref>FIG. 20</figref> was substituted for the standard disc assembly <b>19</b>. As a result of this concurrent pulverization, it was found that the combination of the dry ice beads and the disc assembly having rotating wings significantly contributed to the enhancement of solubility as shown in <figref>FIG. 46</figref>. Since the disc assembly with rotating wings produces such an excellent stirring effect for enhancing the pulverization of materials, it is observed from <figref>FIG. 46</figref> that the solubility of approximately 90% could be attained at the pulverization time of 60 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0191">As a result of concurrently pulverizing phenytoin and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) by using a combination of the dry ice beads and the disc assembly with rotating wings, it was also found that the quantitative value (%) and the RSD value (relative standard deviation), which indicates dispersion of measured values, were also high as the solubility was high. As the RSD value (relative standard deviation) reduces, the degree of homogeneous mixing of phenytoin and PVP increases. In general, it is considered that the degree of homogeneous mixing may be at practical level if the RSD value would be approximately equal to or less than 5.0%. In addition, the quantitative value (%) indicates the ratio of phenytoin composition included in the concurrently pulverized materials to feed composition. It is also considered that the degree of homogeneous mixing may be at practical level if the quantitative value would be equal to or more than 90%. It is found from <figref>FIG. 47</figref> that the dry ice beads effectively stirred by the disc assembly with rotating wings enhance the mixing of phenytoin and PVP.</p>
