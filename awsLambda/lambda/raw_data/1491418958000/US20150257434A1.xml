      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to food preparation appliances. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved food preparation appliance with a cleaning feature for removing excessive buildup of pulp from a rotating sieve that shreds fruits and vegetables and extracts juice for consumption.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Appliances for preparing food are well known, and in particular, juicing appliances for preparing juice from fruits and vegetables. Typically, these appliance use a shredding implement such as a perforated disc to shred the fruits and vegetables and a filter screen to extract liquid from the solid food particles. An unfortunate consequence of shredding fruits and vegetables with such a shredding implement is that unwanted pulp builds up on the working surface of the shredding implement. This unwanted buildup of pulp needs to be periodically removed or the juicing efficiency is seriously reduced. Many of these juicing appliances use a cleaning implement to periodically scrape the pulp from the shredding implement. One drawback of these cleaning implements is that irregularities on the working surface of the shredding implement cause the cleaning implement to be unevenly applied against the surface of the shredding implement as it is rotated reducing cleaning efficiency.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> of the drawings, in an embodiment there is illustrated a juicing appliance <b>100</b> for preparing juice from fruits and vegetables. The juicing appliance <b>100</b> includes a base <b>102</b>, housing <b>109</b>, lid <b>104</b> with a cylindrical feed tube <b>107</b> extending upwardly therefrom, pulp container <b>111</b> removably attached to the front of the housing <b>109</b>, a juice jug <b>117</b> fitted with a lid <b>118</b> removably attached to the rear of the housing <b>109</b>, and a cylindrical food pusher <b>106</b> that is inserted into the feed tube <b>107</b>. A pair of arms <b>101</b> on opposite sides of the housing <b>109</b> secure the lid <b>104</b> to the housing <b>109</b>. A control knob <b>105</b> disposed on one side of the housing <b>109</b> controls the operative electronic components including an electric motor <b>115</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) disposed within the housing <b>109</b>. The control knob <b>105</b> may include variable settings such as off, low, medium, high, variable speed range, or any other combination speed setting. Alternately, the electric motor <b>115</b> may be controlled by a microprocessor (not shown) pre-programmed with juicing routines connected to the control knob <b>105</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">A juice spout <b>113</b> extends from the rear of the housing <b>109</b> and delivers juice to the juice jug <b>117</b> through a cutout <b>118</b><i>a </i>and the juice jug lid <b>118</b>. A pivoting bail <b>108</b> is connected to the housing <b>109</b> for transporting the juicing appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, there are illustrated an exploded view and cross-sectional view of the juicing appliance <b>100</b>. A frusto-conical shaped sieve <b>116</b> is disposed in the housing <b>109</b> above an electric motor assembly <b>115</b> that is rotatably coupled to the sieve <b>116</b>. The sieve <b>116</b> may be made of any suitable material including but not limited to stainless steel and includes a perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>(best seen in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>) for extracting fruit and vegetables urged against it. The perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>is comprised of multiple perforations having sharp edges. When energized with electrical power via the rotating knob <b>105</b>, the electric motor assembly <b>115</b> rotates the sieve <b>116</b> about its axis of rotation to urge by centrifugal action the fruits or vegetables fed into the sieve <b>116</b> via the feed tube <b>107</b> against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>and perforations. The food pusher <b>106</b> is removed and replaced into the feed tube <b>107</b> after the fruits and vegetables are fed into the sieve <b>116</b>. The fruits and vegetables are urged against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>by centrifugal action as the sieve <b>116</b> rotates. The food pusher <b>106</b> may be used to improve the extraction process by further urging the fruits and vegetables into the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the sieve <b>116</b> as it is being rotated.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The sieve <b>116</b> in the assembled configuration is inserted into a recess <b>110</b> within the housing <b>109</b>. The recess <b>110</b> is fluidly connected to the juice spout <b>113</b> that has an open end that drains into the juice jug <b>117</b> disposed at the rear of the housing <b>109</b>. The spout <b>113</b> may have an elbow <b>114</b> at the free end for directing the juice into the juice jug <b>117</b>. The elbow is rotatably coupled to the juice spout <b>113</b> and when rotated upward acts as a valve preventing juice from flowing out of the juice spout <b>113</b>. The recess <b>110</b> collects juice that drains from within the sieve <b>116</b> through the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>as the fruits and vegetables are extracted into liquid and small solid particles. The small solid particles are prevented from entering the recess <b>110</b> because they are too large to pass through the perforations in the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a. </i>As the volume of solid particles that are retained in the sieve <b>116</b> as the fruits and vegetables are extracted increases to the point they overflow the lip of the sieve <b>116</b>, the overflow of solid particles are directed by centrifugal action into a pulp container <b>111</b> attached to the front of the housing <b>109</b>. The pulp container <b>111</b> may be removed for emptying and cleaning as needed. A cleaning feature <b>215</b> is disposed within the housing <b>109</b> against the feed tube <b>106</b> for removing excess buildup of solid food particles on the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a</i>. The operation of the cleaning feature <b>215</b> is described further hereinbelow.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Referring now also to <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, as the sieve <b>116</b> is rotated during operation there is a buildup of solid particles within sieve <b>116</b> as described above. Fruits and vegetables are extracted as they are urged by centrifugal action against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>and the unwanted pulp residue begins to build up on the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>reducing juicing efficiency and drainage of juice from the sieve <b>116</b> into the recess <b>110</b>. As a result, this unwanted pulp buildup must be periodically removed from the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>during the juicing operation. In an embodiment, the cleaning feature assembly <b>215</b> is provided including a resilient wiper blade <b>225</b> that engages the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>as the sieve <b>116</b> is rotated to remove the buildup of unwanted pulp from the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a. </i>When it is desired to perform a cleaning operation of the sieve <b>116</b>, a user depresses a button <b>220</b> at the top of the cleaning feature assembly <b>215</b>. The button <b>220</b> is also disposed on the outer side of the lid <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">When the button <b>220</b> is depressed in the direction of arrow <b>400</b>, a pair of posts <b>221</b> extending downwardly from the button <b>220</b> urge a wiper blade assembly <b>225</b> downward into the sieve <b>116</b> and against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a. </i>Normally, the wiper blade assembly <b>225</b> is biased into a retracted position by a pair of springs <b>222</b> disposed around the posts <b>221</b> and does not contact the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a. </i>A wiper blade <b>230</b> is mounted on and extends outwardly from the wiper blade assembly <b>225</b> such that when the button <b>220</b> is depressed, the outer edge of the wiper blade <b>230</b> engages the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the sieve <b>116</b>. The wiper blade <b>230</b> disengages the buildup of pulp as the sieve <b>116</b> rotates. The wiper blade <b>230</b> is set at an optimal angle against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>for cleaning and removing pulp from the sieve <b>116</b>. The wiper blade <b>230</b> is comprised of a resilient material such as polytetrafluoroethylene, plastic, metal or any other suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In an embodiment, the wiper blade <b>230</b> may automatically be moved into position against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a. </i>at periodic intervals by a solenoid (not shown) controlled by an electronic pushbutton (not shown) or the microprocessor (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Referring now also to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, there is illustrated an embodiment of the cleaning feature assembly <b>215</b>. The wiper blade <b>230</b> is mounted on a mounting assembly <b>224</b>. The pair of posts <b>221</b> fit into apertures (not shown) formed in the top of the mounting assembly <b>224</b>. The pair of posts <b>221</b> are locked and released into the apertures (not shown) by a sliding lock <b>231</b> that fits into the mounting assembly <b>224</b>. An annular coil wave spring <b>226</b> is mounted in a recess <b>224</b><i>a </i>formed in the mounting assembly <b>224</b>. A mounting bracket <b>228</b> secures the wiper blade <b>230</b> against the coil wave spring <b>226</b> in the recess <b>224</b><i>a. </i>A pair of screws <b>229</b> affix the bracket <b>228</b> against the mounting assembly <b>224</b>. The coil wave spring <b>226</b> is resilient and biases the wiper blade <b>230</b> against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>but allows the wiper blade <b>230</b> to elastically return slightly back into the recess <b>224</b><i>a </i>when the wiper blade <b>230</b> encounters imperfections in the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>as the sieve <b>116</b> rotates. As such, the wave spring <b>226</b> causes the wiper blade <b>230</b> to apply constant pressure against the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>when the button <b>220</b> is depressed despite irregularities in the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>and the imperfections in the roundness of the sieve <b>116</b> as the sieve <b>116</b> is rotated.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A coil wave spring <b>226</b> was selected because of their smaller size in the axial direction as compared to conventional coil springs. In addition, the use of the coil wave spring <b>226</b> allows the wiper blade <b>230</b> to remain more fully engaged with the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>when irregularities are encountered on the perforated surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>as the sieve <b>116</b> is rotated. This is because the biasing forces from the coil wave spring <b>226</b> are distributed at multiple points on the wiper blade <b>230</b> as compared to a being applied at a single point with more conventional coils springs. Still, a conventional coil spring (not shown) may be used although with less effectiveness.</p>
