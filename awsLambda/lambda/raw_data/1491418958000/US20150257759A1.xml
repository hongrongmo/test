      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to medical devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an implant which in one embodiment facilitates sutured side-to-side arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation and maintains the patency thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing problem in the United States and abroad, with the number of patients requiring treatment far outstripping the number of donor kidneys available. Those patients who are unable to receive a kidney transplant are treated by dialysis, with roughly ten times as many patients receiving hemodialysis as all other forms combined.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To minimize treatment time, hemodialysis requires a large blood volume flow rate. Increasing flow is typically achieved through the surgical creation of an arteriovenous shunt. This creates a low resistance pathway, significantly increasing flow through a graft or an arteriovenous fistula.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In practice, AVF is preferred to graft usage because fistulas have better long-term patency rates and reduced incidences of secondary interventions after creation. However, the surgical creation of an AVF and the subsequent venous tissue remodelling required to realize optimized flow rates is only successful in approximately half of surgical procedures. Failures involving AVF are largely due to stenosis via neointimal hyperplasia and thrombosis. A potential cause of neointimal hyperplasia is the exposure of venous tissue to the abnormal hemodynamic conditions resulting from significantly increased flow rates and pulsatility of the added arterial blood flow. In other cases, large flow rates can cause extreme dilation and result in oversized fistulas which fail to achieve the purpose for which they were created.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">There exists a need for an improved method of creating arteriovenous fistula and maintaining the patency thereof, including implantation of devices designed to achieve these purposes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention provides a pair of device halves, each device half having a proximal end and a distal end, each of the device halves having an anastomosis window formed therethrough defining a first arch and a second arch opposite the first arch, the first and second arches being disposed normal to the proximal and distal ends, each device half having an inner surface and an outer surface opposite the inner surface, the device halves being connected at a proximal connector portion and at a distal connector portion on the inner surfaces defining a space therebetween and such that the anastomosis windows are in alignment with each other, the proximal connector portion and the distal connector portion defining a first suturing window and a second suturing window opposite the first suturing window, the first and second suturing windows being normal the anastomosis windows.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a pair of device halves, each device half having a proximal end and a distal end, each of the device halves having an anastomosis window formed therethrough, the anastomosis window defining a first arch and a second arch opposite the first arch, the first and second arches being disposed normal to the proximal and distal end, each device half having an inner surface and an outer surface opposite the inner surface, the device halves being connected at a proximal connector portion and at a distal connector portion on the inner surfaces defining a space therebetween such that the anastomosis windows are in alignment with each other, the proximal connector portion and the distal connector portion defining a first suturing window and a second suturing window opposite the first suturing window, the first and second suturing windows being normal the anastomosis windows, each device half having a first flange proximally extending from the proximal end, each device half having a second flange distally extending from the distal end, the first flanges being spaced apart from each other defining a first flange gap, the second flanges being spaced apart from each other defining a second flange gap, each device half comprising a plurality of barbs attached to the first and second arches on the inner surface, each device half comprising a plurality of suture ports formed through the first flanges and the second flanges.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of facilitating side-to-side fistula along a longitudinal portion of a vein and an artery, the vein having a vein wall, the artery having an artery wall. The method comprises in one step incising the vein wall substantially longitudinally to define a vein aperture, the vein wall comprising a first vein lip and a second vein lip opposite the vein aperture from the first vein lip. In a second step the method comprises incising the artery wall substantially longitudinally to define an artery aperture, the artery wall comprising a first artery lip and a second artery lip opposite the artery aperture from the first artery lip. The method includes implanting an anastomosis device in accordance with the principles of the present invention to form the side-to-side fistula. The implantation procedure includes disposing the second artery lip over one second arch and the second vein lip over the opposite second arch such that the second arches are disposed within the vein wall and the artery wall and such that the second vein lip and the second artery lip are disposed in the second suturing window; joining the second vein lip to the second artery lip by a first surgical method; disposing the first artery lip over one first arch and the first vein lip over the opposite first arch such that the first arches are disposed within the vein wall and the artery wall and such that the first vein lip and the first artery lip are disposed in the first suturing window; and joining the first vein lip to the first artery lip by a second surgical method.</p>

The term proximal is used to refer to an end of a component closest to the physician and in practice in or adjacent an external manipulation part of the deployment or treatment apparatus. Similarly, when referring to an implant such as an anastomosis device the term distal is used to refer to an end of the device which in use is furthest from the physician during the medical procedure and the term proximal is used to refer to an end of the device which is closest to the physician during the medical procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The terms âsubstantiallyâ or âaboutâ used herein with reference to a quantity includes variations in the recited quantity that are equivalent to the quantity recited, such as an amount that is equivalent to the quantity recited for an intended purpose or function. âSubstantiallyâ or derivatives thereof will be understood to mean significantly or in large part.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In this disclosure, where directionality is addressed, a âtopâ element may also be a âfirstâ element without being a top relative to another component, and a âbottomâ element may also be a âsecondâ element in likewise fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present disclosure generally provides an implant or device which facilitates the formation of an arteriovenous fistula and maintaining the patency thereof. Surgical fistula creation is presently the preferred method of increasing blood flow for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who are receiving hemodialysis. The advantages of fistulas over such treatments as grafts are numerous. For instance, of the treatment methods for ESRD patients that might be used to increase blood flow rates, arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are associated with decreased morbidity and mortality, and have the superior primary patency rates, the lowest rates of thrombosis, and require the fewest secondary interventions. AVFs generally provide longer hemodialysis access survival rates. Medical data shows that the total number of interventions during the life of the access is considerably lower for AVFs compared with AV grafts and that AVFs have lower rates of infection than AV grafts. The danger of infection is also decreased upon successful formation of an AVF. Thus, it is not surprising that AVFs also lead to lower hospitalization rates among ESRD patients who undergo some form of treatment to increase blood flow rates in order to facilitate hemodialysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">However, there is a need to improve the ways that AVFs are created and maintained. Fewer than 15% of dialysis fistulas remain patent and can function without problems during the entire period of a patient's dependence on hemodialysis. The mean problem-free patency period after creation of native fistulas is approximately 3 years, whereas prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts last 1-2 years before indications of failure or thrombosis are noted. After multiple interventions to treat underlying stenosis and thrombosis, the long-term secondary patency rates for native fistulas are reportedly 7 years for fistulas in the forearm and 3-5 years for fistulas in the upper arm. Prosthetic grafts remain patent for up to 2 years.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">For prosthetic grafts, fistula failure and eventual occlusion occur most commonly as a result of the progressive narrowing of the venous anastomosis; for native fistulas, failure occurs most commonly as a result of the narrowing of the outflow vein. The primary underlying pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for causing the failure is intimal hyperplasia at the anastomotic site. Additional causes include surgical and iatrogenic trauma, such as repeated venipunctures. Stenoses along the venous outflow and in intragraft locations (for prosthetic PTFE grafts) are also common.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The embodiments of the device described herein are designed in part to overcome these deficiencies. The anastomosis device provides a luminal region with a defined geometry for blood flow therethrough. It also provides a limited amount of contact between the intimal surfaces of the vessels to be connected by the fistula relative to methods of directly connecting the artery and the vein surgically.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, the veins and arteries of the arm are illustrated. Fistulas in ESRD patients are generally created in the arm. Arm <b>10</b> contains a plurality of arteries (illustrated in solid lines) and veins (illustrated in dashed lines.) Brachial artery <b>11</b> originates toward the shoulder and splits into an ulnar artery <b>13</b> and a radial artery <b>15</b> in the region of the elbow. Likewise, axillary vein <b>12</b> and cephalic vein <b>14</b> run through the shoulder region, and in the area of the elbow, the axillary vein <b>12</b> splits into the basilic vein <b>16</b>. The vessels that were previously split, arteries and veins alike, can undergo anastomosis and form fistulas. Exemplary fistulas illustrated include brachial-cephalic arteriovenous fistula <b>18</b>, between the brachial artery <b>11</b> and the cephalic vein <b>14</b>, and radial-cephalic fistula <b>19</b>, between the radial artery and the cephalic vein <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">
        <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an example of the blood flow consequences of arteriovenous fistula creation. Artery <b>21</b> carries arterial blood <b>23</b> away from the heart and through the arm <b>20</b> in the direction of hand <b>26</b>. Arteriovenous fistula <b>29</b> connects the artery <b>21</b> to vein <b>22</b>. A portion of the blood flows through fistula <b>29</b> and the remainder continues on its natural path through the capillary system <b>28</b> in the hand. In the capillaries the blood deoxygenates and flows as venous flow <b>25</b> through the vein <b>22</b>. Due to the fistula, a combined arterial-venous blood flow <b>27</b> forms, and as a result of the increased volume and flow rate of blood through the vasculature, an enlarged portion <b>24</b> of the vein arises.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A-C</figref> are examples of different configurations of arteriovenous fistula. <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates an artery <b>31</b> with an artery end <b>32</b> as well as a vein <b>33</b> having a vein end <b>34</b>. The artery end <b>32</b> is joined to vein end <b>34</b> to form end-to-end arteriovenous fistula <b>35</b>. Such a fistula configuration can be technically difficult to execute and has an intrinsic disadvantage as artificial creation of an end-to-end fistula naturally requires that the vessels used in its formation be completely severed in order to connect the ends, thereby completely disconnecting the vessels from the rest of the vascular system.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">
        <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> instead shows artery <b>38</b> with artery end <b>39</b> and vein <b>36</b> with vein wall <b>37</b>. The artery end <b>39</b> is attached to vein <b>36</b> through vein wall <b>38</b> to form side-to-end arteriovenous fistula <b>40</b>. This type of fistula is technically simpler to execute for a surgeon but still has the drawback that the vessel whose end it used (in the case illustrated, artery <b>38</b> with artery end <b>39</b>) has its downstream regions disconnected from the rest of the vascular system. This complete rerouting of the blood flow can have negative consequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">An alternative fistula arrangement, the side-to-side arteriovenous fistula, is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2C</figref>. In this example, artery <b>41</b> has been perforated through artery wall <b>42</b> and joined to vein <b>43</b> through vein wall <b>44</b> to create side-to-side fistula <b>45</b>. Because of the side-to-side configuration, a portion of the blood continues to flow in the natural pattern to downstream tissues, unlike the case in which an artery end or a vein end is employed to create the anastomosis. However, even creation of this type of AVF can be difficult using standard surgical techniques. A properly-designed device can simplify the procedure and, importantly, maintain patency of the AVF.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a device <b>50</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Device <b>50</b> has a proximal end <b>52</b> and a distal end <b>54</b>. It should be noted, however, that because of the symmetry between the proximal ends and distal ends, that these designations are arbitrary and employed for purposes of convenience.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The device is made of two device halves <b>60</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the device halves <b>60</b> extend between proximal end <b>52</b> and distal end <b>54</b>, as well as first arches <b>62</b> and second arches <b>63</b>, which serve to connect the proximal ends <b>52</b> to the distal ends <b>54</b>. The first arches <b>62</b> and the second arches <b>63</b> also frame an empty space in each device half <b>60</b> which is anastomosis window <b>58</b>. The device halves <b>60</b> are opposite and in alignment with one another, and the first arch <b>62</b> of one of the device halves are opposite and in alignment with the first arch <b>62</b> of the opposite device half, and the second arch <b>63</b> is opposite and in alignment with the second arch <b>63</b> of the other device half. Between the device halves <b>60</b> and in fluid connection with anastomosis windows <b>58</b> is a central space of the device which is device lumen <b>51</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The device halves <b>60</b> have an inner surface which provides a boundary for the device lumen <b>51</b> and also have a portion that does not face the device lumen <b>51</b>. This latter portion is referred to as outer device surface <b>61</b>. Outer device surface <b>61</b> is encompassed by portions of first arch <b>62</b> and second arch <b>63</b> and all other portions of device half <b>60</b> that are opposite to the device lumen <b>51</b>. Outer device surface <b>61</b> curves away from the device lumen <b>51</b>, giving each device a âCâ shape when viewed head-on and giving the device <b>50</b> a butterfly shape when viewed in profile.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The embodiment of device <b>50</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> further comprises a pair of flanges at each end. A device in accordance with the present disclosure does not require a flange. Each device half <b>60</b> has a first flange <b>55</b> at proximal end <b>52</b> and a second flange <b>56</b> at distal end <b>54</b>. The first flange <b>55</b> and the second flange <b>56</b> extend in the proximal and distal directions, respectively, beyond the first arch <b>62</b>, the second arch <b>63</b>, and the anastomosis window <b>58</b>. The first flange <b>55</b> of one device half <b>60</b> is not in contact with the first flange <b>55</b> of the other device half <b>60</b>, being separated by inner flange gap <b>65</b>. The second flanges <b>56</b> are constructed in a similar manner, also being separated and having an inner flange gap <b>65</b> separating the two second flanges <b>65</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As mentioned previously, when there are no features of the device which impart a directionality or introduce an asymmetrical element to it, and the device is outside a surgical context (that is, it is not being used at that moment in a procedure or has not been implanted into a patient), the terms proximal and distal can be switched with one another. The terms top and bottom can be switched in a similar fashion. However, the outer portion of the device, including outer device surfaces <b>61</b>, will remain an outer or exterior portion, and the device lumen <b>51</b> will remain interior, regardless of the designation of top/bottom and proximal/distal.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">An anastomosis device <b>50</b> with the structural features described herein can be made of a number of different materials. Such a device <b>50</b> can be made of a biocompatible and biologically-inert material which will be well-tolerated by the tissues it contacts but will not encourage, for instance, growth of new intimal tissue across its openings. The device <b>50</b> can be made of a variety of polymers, including photosensitive polymers which are used for rapid prototyping applications. The polymers can have a stiffness ranging from relatively labile to relatively stiff, taking into account that the integrity of the anastomosis windows <b>58</b> must be maintained for optimal operation of the device. The device <b>50</b> may also be coated or impregnated with drugs which will prevent or slow endothelialization of the anastomosis windows <b>58</b> and thereby reduce the space available for blood flow through the AVF. The device may be made by a number of processes, including injection molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The slits to be cut into the artery walls and vein walls to provide openings for blood flow, when used in a device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention will be made parallel to the direction of blood flow or substantially longitudinally. Put another way, the slitting is done parallel to a portion of a longitudinal axis of the vessel to be slit. Thus a longitudinal portion of a vein or of an artery comprises a portion which is parallel to the direction of blood flow, and can be in a plane substantially normal to the longitudinal axis. In many cases such a longitudinal portion may be about one centimeter in length. Therefore, a device <b>50</b> will have an anastomosis window <b>58</b> which extends for slightly greater than one centimeter in the proximal-to-distal dimension. It is possible that a favorable increase in blood flow through an AVF can be achieved with a fistula which is less than one centimeter wide, in which case it will be acceptable to construct a device <b>50</b> with an anastomosis window <b>58</b> which is less than 1 centimeter wide as well. Contrarily, certain patients may require that an AVF longer than one centimeter wide be constructed. In such cases, a device which has a longer anastomosis window <b>58</b> than one centimeter will be best suited for facilitating hemodialysis in such patients. The overall diameter of the device, as measured from one anastomosis window to another, may be about five to ten millimeters across.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In one embodiment the anastomosis windows are opposite and in alignment with one another across the body of the device such that blood may freely flow through the device. The first and second arches can be disposed normal to the proximal and distal ends of the device such that the planes of the proximal end or the distal end are substantially perpendicular to a plane that can be drawn through at least a portion of the arches. The first suturing window may be opposite the second suturing window and these may be disposed substantially normal the anastomosis windows. Thus there may be four planar faces of the device situated approximately 90 degrees from one another, each containing an anastomosis or a suturing window.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a top view of the device <b>50</b> is provided. From this perspective, the first flanges <b>55</b> can be seen in connection with the first arches <b>62</b>, which further connect to the second flanges <b>56</b>. The first flanges <b>55</b> are also connected to the second flanges by second arches <b>63</b>. The distal portions of the first arches <b>62</b> and the second arches <b>63</b> meet at distal connecting portion <b>69</b> and the proximal ends of these meet and join at proximal connecting portion <b>68</b>. These connecting portions sit opposite of the outer device surfaces <b>61</b>. They function to connect the device halves <b>60</b>. The proximal connecting portion <b>68</b> provides a bound at the proximal end of the device <b>50</b> for the interior device lumen <b>51</b> and the distal connecting portion <b>69</b> provides a bound at the distal end for the device lumen <b>51</b>. This further defines the flow area of blood through the AVF and prevents flow into the intervascular space. The proximal connector portion <b>68</b> and the distal connector portion <b>69</b> may take on similar shapes; in some cases, they can be wedge-shaped connectors which taper as they approach the ends of the device. In other cases they may be three-dimensional solids of varying shapes. In still other embodiments the device halves may simply connect at an edge or a line, which edge or line would comprise the connector portion. Finally, the connector portions may simply comprise a point at which the device halves meet.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Between the first arches <b>62</b> and bounded by the proximal connecting portion <b>68</b> and the distal connecting portion <b>69</b> is a space which is the first suturing window <b>57</b>. The second arches <b>63</b>, the proximal connecting portion <b>68</b>, and the distal connecting portion <b>69</b> frame a second suturing window. The first suturing window <b>57</b> and the second suturing window provide a top and bottom access, respectively, to the device lumen <b>51</b>. The suturing windows are the spaces in which the vessels being manipulated to create the AVF will be sutured or otherwise connected together to form the top and bottom portions of the fistula.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 5A-5B</figref> are side views of a device half <b>60</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. These views illustrate how the first arch <b>62</b> and the second arch <b>63</b> define the bounds of the anastomosis window <b>58</b>. The anastomosis window <b>58</b> can take on a variety of shapes. In the preferred embodiment of <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, the anastomosis window <b>58</b> has a substantially elliptical shape. The dimensions of the ellipse confer certain advantages on the device. For instance, the larger axis of the ellipse provides a way of incorporating the entire length of the AVF which is formed from combining an aperture in the vein and an aperture in the artery after slitting the vessels within the anastomosis window <b>58</b>, while the smaller axis of the ellipse further defines the geometry of the anastomosis and ensures that the dimensions of the device do not greatly exceed the height of the vessels involved. Likewise, a device according to the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>, in which the anastomosis window <b>58</b> is a rectangle having a greater length than height dimension, would confer similar advantages to the elliptical window of <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>. These embodiments, however, are not intended to be limiting. Devices having anastomosis windows <b>58</b> in various shapes, including squares, circles, or other polygonal shapes are also envisioned as acceptable alternative embodiments to those illustrated.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In another embodiment of the device <b>50</b> in accordance with the principles of the present invention, the device of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is shown. Notably, the device <b>50</b> depicted herein has a plurality of top barbs <b>72</b> which assist in the gripping and stabilization of portions of vessel walls which have been pulled through the device lumen <b>51</b> and into the first suturing window <b>57</b>. The top barbs <b>72</b> are formed along a portion of first arch <b>62</b> and extend with their points within device lumen <b>51</b>. A barb can have two ends, including the end which comprises a portion of the device from which it extends, and the barb can then extend to a second end, which may be a point. Each point is capable of securing the vascular material but are not sharp enough to pierce and damage it. The barbs may curve and have a dentite or bladelike shape. A barb that curves inward is considered to extend in a roughly opposite direction from the outer surface of the device half from which it originates and toward the opposite device half. Such a barb may be integrally formed with the device halves, such as by an additive manufacturing process, including 3D printing, and formed unitarily with the remainder of the device. A device with top or first barbs <b>72</b> could possibly ease and accelerate the suturing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Another embodiment has a plurality of bottom or second barbs <b>73</b> which assist in the gripping and stabilization of portions of vessel walls which have been pulled through the device lumen <b>51</b> and into the second suturing window. Analogously to top or first barbs <b>72</b>, bottom or second barbs <b>73</b> are formed along a portion of second arch <b>63</b> and extend with their points within device lumen <b>51</b>. The points are capable of securing the vascular material but are not sharp enough to pierce and damage it. A device may possess only top barbs <b>72</b>, only bottom barbs <b>73</b>, both top barbs <b>72</b> and bottom barbs <b>73</b>, or no barbs at all.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The embodiment of device <b>50</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> also possesses a plurality of distal suture ports <b>76</b> at the distal end <b>54</b> and a plurality of proximal suture ports at proximal end <b>52</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the distal suture ports <b>76</b> are formed within the second flanges <b>56</b>, through outer device surface <b>61</b> and connecting to inner flange gap <b>65</b>. However, in embodiments which lack flanges, these suture ports may be formed at the respective device end at any point wide enough to accommodate them. The suture ports <b>76</b> and <b>77</b> are configured to permit suturing of the device <b>50</b> to the vascular tissue to ease handling and provide stability through the implantation process.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 7A-7E</figref>, a method of creating an arteriovenous fistula in accordance with one embodiment of this invention is illustrated. A person having skill in the art will appreciate that variations to the process are possible beyond what is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7A-7E</figref> without deviating from the spirit of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates a vein <b>80</b> and an artery <b>90</b> which are to be used in the creation of an AVF. The vein <b>80</b> is bounded by vein wall <b>81</b> and the artery <b>90</b> by artery wall <b>91</b>. A vein slit <b>82</b> forming a vein aperture has been formed through vein wall <b>81</b> and an artery slit <b>92</b> creating an artery aperture has been formed through artery wall <b>91</b>. The slits may be made by any acceptable means, including by scalpel.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>, the vessels have been opened. The vein <b>80</b> has been opened along vein slit <b>82</b> to divide the vein <b>80</b> into second vein lip <b>83</b> and top or first vein lip <b>84</b> such that the second vein lip <b>83</b> lies opposite the first vein lip <b>84</b>. Likewise, the artery <b>90</b> has been opened along artery slit or aperture <b>92</b> to create top or first artery portion <b>94</b> and bottom artery lip <b>93</b>. The bottom vein portion <b>83</b> and the bottom or second artery lip <b>93</b> have been inserted into the bottom suturing window of device <b>50</b>. The position at which the vessels meet is first arteriovenous junction <b>85</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Referring to <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>, a top view of the procedure in progress is illustrated. Looking through the first suturing window <b>57</b>, the bottom vein lip <b>83</b> and the bottom artery portion <b>93</b> have been joined at first arteriovenous junction <b>85</b> by a first surgical step, in this case by suture <b>96</b>. The suturing can be done through the first suturing window <b>57</b> and may be stitched or otherwise attached in any suitable manner, for instance using a surgical glue such as fibrin glue.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">
        <figref>FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates a fourth step in the AVF creation procedure. In this step the top vein lip <b>84</b> and the top artery portion <b>94</b> have been inserted through the first suturing window <b>57</b> and into device lumen <b>51</b> of device <b>50</b>. If the embodiment of the device has a plurality of top barbs <b>72</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the top vein portion <b>84</b> and the top artery lip <b>94</b> are secured thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">
        <figref>FIG. 7E</figref> illustrates the final step in placement of the device <b>50</b>. The top vein portion <b>84</b> and the top artery lip <b>94</b> meet at second arteriovenous junction <b>95</b>. The second arteriovenous junction <b>95</b> can be secured in the same way as the first arteriovenous junction <b>85</b> or it can be sealed in a different manner. The AVF has been created and blood is flowing through the anastomosis window from the artery <b>90</b> into the device lumen <b>51</b> and then into the vein <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As mentioned, further steps may be incorporated into the method in accordance with other embodiments of the present invention. For instance, in the case of a device having at least one suture port, the vein <b>80</b> or artery <b>90</b> or both can be secured to the device <b>50</b> by suturing through the vessel walls and the ports. The vessels will then be thus secured to the device <b>50</b> and spaced apart from one another. Additionally, if the device <b>50</b> contains a plurality of top barbs <b>72</b> or a plurality of bottom barbs <b>73</b>, the respective vessel portions may be secured thereon at the appropriate steps of the procedure.</p>
