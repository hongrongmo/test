    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to biorefining processes utilizing sulfur dioxide for converting biomass into fermentable sugars, cellulose, and lignin.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Biomass refining (or biorefining) is becoming more prevalent in industry. Cellulose fibers and sugars, hemicellulose sugars, lignin, syngas, and derivatives of these intermediates are being used by many companies for chemical and fuel production. Indeed, we now are observing the commercialization of integrated biorefineries that are capable of processing incoming biomass much the same as petroleum refineries now process crude oil. Underutilized lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks have the potential to be much cheaper than petroleum, on a carbon basis, as well as much better from an environmental life-cycle standpoint.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable material on the planet and has long been recognized as a potential feedstock for producing chemicals, fuels, and materials. Lignocellulosic biomass normally comprises primarily cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are natural polymers of sugars, and lignin is an aromatic/aliphatic hydrocarbon polymer reinforcing the entire biomass network. Some forms of biomass (e.g., recycled materials) do not contain hemicellulose.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It has been found that sulfur dioxide can be a very effective chemical for various biorefining processes, including fractionation of biomass with SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and a solvent for lignin (AVAPÂ® technology). Also, SO<sub>2 </sub>may be utilized to hydrolyze extracted hemicellulose oligomers from biomass, to generate monomeric sugars, in a variation of the Green Power+Â® technology. The AVAP and Green Power+ technologies have been developed by American Process, Inc. and are commonly owned with the assignee of this patent application.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Improvements are still desired in overall management of SO<sub>2 </sub>in biorefineries, as well as economic recovery and recycle of SO<sub>2 </sub>or its derivatives. For example, there is a desire to reduce or eliminate the need for purchasing and storing pure sulfur dioxide. There is also a desire to improve the environmental air emissions of SO<sub>2 </sub>from power boilers, when using any fuels containing sulfur.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention addresses the aforementioned needs in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In some variations, the invention provides a biorefining process comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">(a) providing a lignocellulosic biomass feedstock;</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">(b) extracting, hydrolyzing, and/or digesting the feedstock, or a component thereof, with a liquid or vapor solution comprising reactant sulfur dioxide or a derivative thereof, to generate cellulose-rich solids and an intermediate liquid stream;</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">(c) combusting or gasifying a sulfur-containing fuel to generate heat and an exhaust gas stream comprising produced sulfur dioxide;</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">(d) optionally removing at least a portion of hemicellulosic sugars and/or lignin, if present, from the intermediate liquid stream;</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">(e) contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the intermediate liquid stream to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the intermediate liquid stream; and</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">(f) recycling at least some of the intermediate liquid stream back to step (b) to reuse the produced sulfur dioxide as the reactant sulfur dioxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In some embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises coal. In these or other embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises an intermediate stream or product derived from a biomass source, such as biochar or lignin. The biomass source may be the same as or different than the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises sulfonated lignin. The sulfonated lignin may be provided from an external process, or it may be generated in step (b) by reaction of lignin (derived from the feedstock) with the reactant sulfur dioxide, or with another source of sulfur.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In step (c), the sulfur-containing fuel is combusted to produce heat and combustion products (generally CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O), or gasified to produce heat and gasification products (generally CO, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>). Step (c) may employ a fluidized-bed boiler, in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Heat may be recovered in step (e) for process use. For example, heat recovered in step (e) may be recycled to step (b) by recycling a portion of the intermediate liquid stream for use as the liquid or vapor solution. That is, the intermediate liquid stream may be evaporated or stripped to generate SO<sub>2 </sub>and water (or other components) and such stream may be recycled, along with its heat content, to step (b).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In some embodiments, the cellulose-rich solids are utilized as pulp for production of a material, pellet, or consumer product. Alternatively, or additionally, the cellulose-rich solids may be combusted to produce energy. The cellulose-rich solids may also be enzymatically hydrolyzed to produce glucose.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In some embodiments, the process comprises washing the cellulose-rich solids using an aqueous wash solution, to produce a wash filtrate; and contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the wash filtrate to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the wash filtrate. In these or other embodiments, the process comprises pressing the cellulose-rich solids to produce a dewatered cellulose-rich solids and a press filtrate; and contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the press filtrate to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the press filtrate. It is also contemplated that the medium for scrubbing SO<sub>2 </sub>could be the wash filtrate and/or press filtrate alone, i.e. not in combination with the intermediate liquid stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In some variations of the invention, step (b) includes extracting hemicelluloses from the feedstock in the presence of steam or hot water, to generate hemicellulose oligomers in a liquid solution. The liquid solution is then treated with the liquid or vapor solution comprising reactant sulfur dioxide or a derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the liquid or vapor solution further comprises a solvent for lignin, such as ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The sulfur dioxide that is recycled may serve one or more chemical functions. In some embodiments, the reactant sulfur dioxide, or a derivative thereof, is effective to hydrolyze hemicellulose oligomers, contained in a liquid phase, into hemicellulose monomers. In these or other embodiments, the reactant sulfur dioxide, or a derivative thereof, is effective to hydrolyze hemicellulose oligomers, contained in a solid phase, into hemicellulose monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Hemicellulosic sugars may be recovered and optionally fermented to a fermentation product. If glucose is also produced from the cellulose, the glucose may also be fermented, alone or together with the hemicellulosic sugars.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Apparatus may be configured for carrying out the disclosed processes using chemical-engineering principles known in the art as well as principles disclosed in commonly owned patents and patent applications, cited below and incorporated by reference herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The present invention, in some variations, is premised on the realization that for biorefining processes employing sulfur dioxide, sufficient quantities or concentrations of SO<sub>2 </sub>can be economically realized by utilizing digested pulp filtrate as a scrubbing medium for an SO<sub>2</sub>-rich combustion exhaust. The SO<sub>2</sub>-rich combustion exhaust may derive from a coal boiler or a fluidized bed combusting lignin byproduct from the biomass hydrolysis, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Several benefits may be realized in the context of this invention. First, adequate sulfur dioxide could be captured at no purchased cost for external SO<sub>2</sub>. For example, if coal (which contains significant sulfur) is combusted for energy needs in the process, or even for a separate process, then a liquid stream may be used to economically capture the sulfur dioxide generated by sulfur oxidation. If sulfonated lignin is generated in the process and that sulfonated lignin is combusted, then SO<sub>2 </sub>will be present in the stack gases. If all that SO<sub>2 </sub>is recycled, there would be no need for make-up SO<sub>2</sub>, although in practice, some make-up SO<sub>2 </sub>would be typical.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Another potential benefit is that significant evaporative duty can be achieved in cooling stack gases. That is, when a liquid scrubbing medium (digested pulp filtrate, wash filtrate, etc.) is used to dissolve SO<sub>2</sub>, there will also be a transfer of heat from the stack gases to the liquid medium. When that medium is to be recycled for chemical reuse, generally to a digestion step at fairly high temperature, there is a requirement for process heat. The process material and energy balance benefits.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Another possible benefit is improvement in the environmental air emissions from power boilers, since SO<sub>2 </sub>exhaust will be reduced. Another benefit can be elimination of Tier II reportable quantities of sulfur dioxide on site. In certain embodiments, pressurized SO<sub>2 </sub>storage is eliminated, other than reactor (digestor) volume.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Some variations of the invention are premised on the realization that sulfur dioxide may be a preferred sulfur-containing acid catalyst, or precursor thereof, for hydrolyzing biomass or components thereof, e.g. hemicellulosic extracts. There are several potential reasons, without being limited to any particular theory or hypothesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">First, it is believed that sulfur dioxide is a more-efficient catalyst for catalyzing hydrolysis reactions to convert hemicellulose oligomers to monomers. Sulfur dioxide at ambient conditions is a gas which will have higher mass-transfer rates within a hydrolysis reactor, leading to more uniform hydrolysis chemistry. It is thought that in order for SO<sub>2 </sub>to function as a hydrolysis catalyst, it must proceed through a reactive intermediate that contains a proton (H<sup>+</sup>). After the reaction step, the proton may be returned to solution and molecular SO<sub>2 </sub>regenerated.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In particular, SO<sub>2 </sub>in water will normally convert to some extent to sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3 </sub>(which exists in solution as H<sup>+ </sup>and HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>â</sup>) whose dissociated hydrogen atom may initiate the reaction. The reaction hydrolysis starts with a proton from sulfurous acid interacting rapidly with a glycosidic oxygen linking two sugar units, forming a conjugate acid. The cleavage of the CâO bond and breakdown of the conjugate acid to the cyclic carbonium ion then takes place. After a rapid addition of a molecule of water, free sugar and a proton are liberated. That proton must return to the starting acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, or to the water phase. Stoichiometrically, another way to view these reactions is that SO<sub>2 </sub>temporarily combines with water, which is added to the sugar polymers to hydrolyze them (necessarily consuming a water molecule). In turn, the SO<sub>2 </sub>is again available for further chemistry, or recovery from the reactor prior to the reactor contents moving downstream. Recovery is made easier since the SO<sub>2 </sub>molecule is very volatile.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">This increased efficiency owing to the inherent properties of sulfur dioxide mean that less acid may be required. This has cost advantages itself, since sulfuric acid can be expensive. Additionally, and quite significantly, less acid usage also will translate into lower costs for a base (e.g., lime) to increase the pH following hydrolysis, for downstream operations. Furthermore, less acid and less base will also mean substantially less generation of waste salts (e.g., gypsum) that may otherwise require disposal.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Another reason that sulfur dioxide may be preferred relates not to sugar hydrolysis chemistry, but to lignin chemistry. It has been surprisingly discovered, through lab-scale experiments, that acid hydrolysis of hemicellulose with sulfur dioxide leads to dramatically less lignin deposition, compared to acid hydrolysis with sulfuric acid, for the same final sugar yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Without being limited by any theory, it is believed that SO<sub>2 </sub>(or HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>â</sup>) can react directly with lignin to produce sulfonated lignin (also known as lignosulfonates). The reaction of sulfur dioxide or a bisulfite ion with lignin is thought to involve acidic cleavage of ether bonds, which connect many of the constituents of lignin. The electrophilic carbocations produced during ether cleavage react with bisulfite ions to give lignosulfonates. An important site for ether cleavage is the Î±-carbon (carbon atom attached to the aromatic ring) of the propyl side chain of lignin. Sulfur dioxide does not tend to catalyze condensation reactions of lignin that increase molecular weight. Mechanistically, acid-catalyzed condensation and sulfonation can involve the same carbon atom, the Î±-carbon of the propyl group. The implication is that SO<sub>2 </sub>or HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>â </sup>may directly react with this carbon atom before condensation reactions can be initiated.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Also, native (non-sulfonated) lignin is hydrophobic, while lignosulfonates are hydrophilic. Hydrophilic lignosulfonates may have less propensity to clump, agglomerate, and stick to surfaces. Even lignosulfonates that do undergo some condensation and increase of molecular weight, will still have an HSO<sub>3 </sub>group that will contribute some solubility (hydrophilic).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Another reason that sulfur dioxide may be a preferred acid catalyst, or precursor thereof, is that SO<sub>2 </sub>can be recovered easily from solution after hydrolysis. The majority of the SO<sub>2 </sub>from the hydrolysate may be stripped and recycled back to the reactor. Recovery and recycling translates to less lime required compared to neutralization of comparable sulfuric acid, less solids to dispose of, and less separation equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Certain exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described. These embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed. The order of steps may be varied, some steps may be omitted, and/or other steps may be added. Reference herein to first step, second step, etc. is for illustration purposes only.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some variations, the invention provides a biorefining process comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">(a) providing a lignocellulosic biomass feedstock;</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">(e) contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the intermediate liquid stream to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the intermediate liquid stream; and</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">(f) recycling at least some of the intermediate liquid stream back to step (b) to reuse the produced sulfur dioxide as the reactant sulfur dioxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises coal. In these or other embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises an intermediate stream or product derived from a biomass source, such as biochar or lignin. The biomass source may be the same as or different than the lignocellulosic biomass feedstock.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In certain embodiments, the sulfur-containing fuel comprises sulfonated lignin. The sulfonated lignin may be provided from an external process, or it may be generated in step (b) by reaction of lignin (derived from the feedstock) with the reactant sulfur dioxide, or with another source of sulfur.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In step (c), the sulfur-containing fuel is combusted to produce heat and combustion products (generally CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O), or gasified to produce heat and gasification products (generally CO, H<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>). Step (c) may employ a fluidized-bed boiler, in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Heat may be recovered in step (e) for process use. For example, heat recovered in step (e) may be recycled to step (b) by recycling a portion of the intermediate liquid stream for use as the liquid or vapor solution. That is, the intermediate liquid stream may be evaporated or stripped to generate SO<sub>2 </sub>and water (or other components) and such stream may be recycled, along with its heat content, to step (b).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In some embodiments, the cellulose-rich solids are utilized as pulp for production of a material, pellet, or consumer product. Alternatively, or additionally, the cellulose-rich solids may be combusted to produce energy. The cellulose-rich solids may also be enzymatically hydrolyzed to produce glucose.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In some embodiments, the process comprises washing the cellulose-rich solids using an aqueous wash solution, to produce a wash filtrate; and contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the wash filtrate to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the wash filtrate. In these or other embodiments, the process comprises pressing the cellulose-rich solids to produce a dewatered cellulose-rich solids and a press filtrate; and contacting at least a portion of the exhaust gas stream with the press filtrate to dissolve the produced sulfur dioxide into the press filtrate. It is also contemplated that the medium for scrubbing SO<sub>2 </sub>could be the wash filtrate and/or press filtrate alone, i.e. not in combination with the intermediate liquid stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In some variations of the invention, step (b) includes extracting hemicelluloses from the feedstock in the presence of steam or hot water, to generate hemicellulose oligomers in a liquid solution. The liquid solution is then treated with the liquid or vapor solution comprising reactant sulfur dioxide or a derivative thereof. In some embodiments, the liquid or vapor solution further comprises a solvent for lignin, such as ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The sulfur dioxide that is recycled may serve one or more chemical functions. In some embodiments, the reactant sulfur dioxide, or a derivative thereof, is effective to hydrolyze hemicellulose oligomers, contained in a liquid phase, into hemicellulose monomers. In these or other embodiments, the reactant sulfur dioxide, or a derivative thereof, is effective to hydrolyze hemicellulose oligomers, contained in a solid phase, into hemicellulose monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Hemicellulosic sugars may be recovered and optionally fermented to a fermentation product. If glucose is also produced from the cellulose, the glucose may also be fermented, alone or together with the hemicellulosic sugars.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The biomass feedstock may be selected from hardwoods, softwoods, forest residues, industrial wastes, pulp and paper wastes, consumer wastes, or combinations thereof. Some embodiments utilize agricultural residues, which include lignocellulosic biomass associated with food crops, annual grasses, energy crops, or other annually renewable feedstocks.

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As used herein, âlignocellulosic biomassâ means any material containing cellulose and lignin. Lignocellulosic biomass may also contain hemicellulose. Mixtures of one or more types of biomass can be used. In some embodiments, the biomass feedstock comprises both a lignocellulosic component (such as one described above) in addition to a sucrose-containing component (e.g., sugarcane or energy cane) and/or a starch component (e.g., corn, wheat, rice, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Various moisture levels may be associated with the starting biomass. The biomass feedstock need not be, but may be, relatively dry. In general, the biomass is in the form of a particulate or chip, but particle size is not critical in this invention.</p>

In some embodiments, the process is a variation of the AVAPÂ® process technology which is commonly owned with the assignee of this patent application. In some embodiments, the process is a variation of the Green Power+Â® process technology which is commonly owned with the assignee of this patent application.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">A portion or all of the sulfur dioxide may be present as sulfurous acid in the extract liquor. In certain embodiments, sulfur dioxide is generated in situ by introducing sulfurous acid, sulfite ions, bisulfite ions, combinations thereof, or a salt of any of the foregoing. Excess sulfur dioxide, following hydrolysis, may be recovered and reused.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In some embodiments, sulfur dioxide is saturated in water (or aqueous solution, optionally with an alcohol) at a first temperature, and the hydrolysis is then carried out at a second, generally higher, temperature. In some embodiments, sulfur dioxide is sub-saturated. In some embodiments, sulfur dioxide is super-saturated.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Recovering and recycling the sulfur dioxide may utilize separations such as, but not limited to, vapor-liquid disengagement (e.g. flashing), steam stripping, extraction, or combinations or multiple stages thereof</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Fermentable sugars are defined as hydrolysis products of cellulose, galactoglucomannan, glucomannan, arabinoglucuronoxylans, arabinogalactan, and glucuronoxylans into their respective short-chained oligomers and monomer products, i.e., glucose, mannose, galactose, xylose, and arabinose. The fermentable sugars may be recovered in purified form, as a sugar slurry or dry sugar solids, for example. Any known technique may be employed to recover a slurry of sugars or to dry the solution to produce dry sugar solids.</p>
