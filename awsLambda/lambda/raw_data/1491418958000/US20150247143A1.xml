      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Complement was first discovered in the 1890s when it was found to aid or âcomplementâ the killing of bacteria by heat-stable antibodies present in normal serum (Walport, M. J. (2001) <i>N Engl J Med. </i>344:1058). The complement system consists of more than 30 proteins that are either present as soluble proteins in the blood or are present as membrane-associated proteins. Activation of complement leads to a sequential cascade of enzymatic reactions, known as complement activation pathways, resulting in the formation of the potent anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a that elicit a plethora of physiological responses that range from chemoattraction to apoptosis. Initially, complement was thought to play a major role in innate immunity where a robust and rapid response is mounted against invading pathogens. However, recently it is becoming increasingly evident that complement also plays an important role in adaptive immunity involving T and B cells that help in elimination of pathogens (Dunkelberger J R and Song W C. (2010) <i>Cell Res. </i>20:34; Molina H, et al. (1996) <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. </i>93:3357), in maintaining immunologic memory preventing pathogenic re-invasion, and is involved in numerous human pathological states (Qu, H, et al. (2009) <i>Mol Immunol. </i>47:185; Wagner, E. and Frank M M. (2010) <i>Nat Rev Drug Discov. </i>9:43).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Complement activation is known to occur through three different pathways: alternate, classical, and lectin (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), involving proteins that mostly exist as inactive zymogens that are then sequentially cleaved and activated. All pathways of complement activation lead to cleavage of the C5 molecule generating the anaphylatoxin C5a and, C5b that subsequently forms the terminal complement complex (C5b-9). C5a exerts a predominant pro-inflammatory activity through interactions with the classical G-protein coupled receptor C5aR (CD88) as well as with the non-G protein coupled receptor C5L2 (GPR77), expressed on various immune and non-immune cells. C5b-9 causes cytolysis through the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), and sub-lytic MAC and soluble C5b-9 also possess a multitude of non-cytolytic immune functions. These two complement effectors, C5a and C5b-9, generated from C5 cleavage, are key components of the complement system responsible for propagating and/or initiating pathology in different diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia-reperfusion injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">To date, only one therapeutic that targets the C5-C5a axis is available for the treatment of complement component C5-associated diseases, the anti-C5 antibody, eculizumab (SolirisÂ®). Although eculizumab has been shown to be effective for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for additional complement component C5-associated diseases, eculizumab therapy requires weekly high dose infusions followed by biweekly maintenance infusions at a yearly cost of about $400,000. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for alternative therapies and combination therapies for subjects having a complement component C5-associated disease.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention provides iRNA compositions which effect the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of a C5 gene. The C5 gene may be within a cell, e.g., a cell within a subject, such as a human. The present invention also provides methods and combination therapies for treating a subject having a disorder that would benefit from inhibiting or reducing the expression of a C5 gene, e.g., a complement component C5-associated disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) using iRNA compositions which effect the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of a C5 gene for inhibiting the expression of a C5 gene.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00299-en" num="0330">The present invention provides iRNA agents which effect the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of a complement component C5 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00300-en" num="0331">The iRNAs of the invention include an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is about 30 nucleotides or less in length, e.g., 15-30, 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 nucleotides in length, which region is substantially complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of a C5 gene. The use of these iRNAs enables the targeted degradation of mRNAs of a C5 gene in mammals. Very low dosages of C5 iRNAs, in particular, can specifically and efficiently mediate RNA interference (RNAi), resulting in significant inhibition of expression of a C5 gene. The present inventors have demonstrated that iRNAs targeting C5 can mediate RNAi in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of a C5 gene. Thus, methods and compositions including these iRNAs are useful for treating a subject who would benefit by a reduction in the levels and/or activity of a C5 protein, such as a subject having a complement component C5-associated disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).</p>
      <p id="p-00301-en" num="0332">The present invention also provides methods and combination therapies for treating a subject having a disorder that would benefit from inhibiting or reducing the expression of a C5 gene, e.g., a complement component C5-associated disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) using iRNA compositions which effect the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of a complement component C5 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0333">The present invention also provides methods for preventing at least one symptom, e.g., hemolysis, in a subject having a disorder that would benefit from inhibiting or reducing the expression of a C5 gene, e.g., a complement component C5-associated disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The present invention further provides iRNA compositions which effect the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-mediated cleavage of RNA transcripts of a complement component C5 gene. The C5 gene may be within a cell, e.g., a cell within a subject, such as a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0334">The combination therapies of the present invention include administering to a subject having a complement component C5-associated disease, an RNAi agent of the invention and an additional therapeutic, such as anti-complement component C5 antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, e.g., eculizumab. The combination therapies of the invention reduce C5 levels in the subject (e.g., by about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or about 99%) by targeting C5 mRNA with an iRNA agent of the invention and, accordingly, allow the therapeutically (or prophylactically) effective amount of eculizumab required to treat the subject to be reduced, thereby decreasing the costs of treatment and permitting easier and more convenient ways of administering eculizumab, such as subcutaneous administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0335">The following detailed description discloses how to make and use compositions containing iRNAs to inhibit the expression of a C5 gene, as well as compositions, uses, and methods for treating subjects having diseases and disorders that would benefit from inhibition and/or reduction of the expression of this gene.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">I. DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0336">In order that the present invention may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. In addition, it should be noted that whenever a value or range of values of a parameter are recited, it is intended that values and ranges intermediate to the recited values are also intended to be part of this invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0337">The articles âaâ and âanâ are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, âan elementâ means one element or more than one element, e.g., a plurality of elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0338">The term âincludingâ is used herein to mean, and is used interchangeably with, the phrase âincluding but not limited toâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0339">The term âorâ is used herein to mean, and is used interchangeably with, the term âand/or,â unless context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0340">As used herein, âcomplement component C5,â used interchangeably with the term âC5â refers to the well-known gene and polypeptide, also known in the art as CPAMD4, C3 and PZP-like alpha-2-macroglobulin domain-containing protein, anaphtlatoxin C5a analog, hemolytic complement (Hc), and complement C5. The sequence of a human C5 mRNA transcript can be found at, for example, GenBank Accession No. GI:38016946 (NM<sub>â</sub>001735.2; SEQ ID NO:1). The sequence of rhesus C5 mRNA can be found at, for example, GenBank Accession No. GI:297270262 (XM<sub>â</sub>001095750.2; SEQ ID NO:2). The sequence of mouse C5 mRNA can be found at, for example, GenBank Accession No. GI:291575171 (NM<sub>â</sub>010406.2; SEQ ID NO:3).</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0341">The sequence of rat C5 mRNA can be found at, for example, GenBank Accession No. GI:392346248 (XM<sub>â</sub>345342.4; SEQ ID NO:4). Additional examples of C5 mRNA sequences are readily available using publicly available databases, e.g., GenBank.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0342">The term âC5,â as used herein, also refers to naturally occurring DNA sequence variations of the C5 gene, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism in the C5 gene. Numerous SNPs within the C5 gene have been identified and may be found at, for example, NCBI dbSNP (see, e.g., ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp). Non-limiting examples of SNPs within the C5 gene may be found at, NCBI dbSNP Accession Nos. rs121909588 and rs121909587.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0343">As used herein, âtarget sequenceâ refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of a C5 gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product. In one embodiment, the target portion of the sequence will be at least long enough to serve as a substrate for iRNA-directed cleavage at or near that portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of a C5 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0344">The target sequence may be from about 9-36 nucleotides in length, e.g., about 15-30 nucleotides in length. For example, the target sequence can be from about 15-30 nucleotides, 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 nucleotides in length. Ranges and lengths intermediate to the above recited ranges and lengths are also contemplated to be part of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0345">As used herein, the term âstrand comprising a sequenceâ refers to an oligonucleotide comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0346">âG,â âC,â âA,â âTâ and âUâ each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the term âribonucleotideâ or ânucleotideâ can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety (see, e.g., Table 2). The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil can be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base can base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine can be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of dsRNA featured in the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. In another example, adenine and cytosine anywhere in the oligonucleotide can be replaced with guanine and uracil, respectively to form G-U Wobble base pairing with the target mRNA. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured in the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0347">The terms âiRNAâ, âRNAi agent,â âiRNA agent,â, âRNA interference agentâ as used interchangeably herein, refer to an agent that contains RNA as that term is defined herein, and which mediates the targeted cleavage of an RNA transcript via an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway. iRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). The iRNA modulates, e.g., inhibits, the expression of C5 in a cell, e.g., a cell within a subject, such as a mammalian subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0348">In one embodiment, an RNAi agent of the invention includes a single stranded RNA that interacts with a target RNA sequence, e.g., a C5 target mRNA sequence, to direct the cleavage of the target RNA. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that long double stranded RNA introduced into cells is broken down into siRNA by a Type III endonuclease known as Dicer (Sharp et al. (2001) <i>Genes Dev. </i>15:485). Dicer, a ribonuclease-III-like enzyme, processes the dsRNA into 19-23 base pair short interfering RNAs with characteristic two base 3â² overhangs (Bernstein, et al., (2001) <i>Nature </i>409:363). The siRNAs are then incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where one or more helicases unwind the siRNA duplex, enabling the complementary antisense strand to guide target recognition (Nykanen, et al., (2001) <i>Cell </i>107:309). Upon binding to the appropriate target mRNA, one or more endonucleases within the RISC cleave the target to induce silencing (Elbashir, et al., (2001) <i>Genes Dev</i>. 15:188). Thus, in one aspect the invention relates to a single stranded RNA (siRNA) generated within a cell and which promotes the formation of a RISC complex to effect silencing of the target gene, i.e., a C5 gene. Accordingly, the term âsiRNAâ is also used herein to refer to an RNAi as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0349">In another embodiment, the RNAi agent may be a single-stranded siRNA that is introduced into a cell or organism to inhibit a target mRNA. Single-stranded RNAi agents bind to the RISC endonuclease, Argonaute 2, which then cleaves the target mRNA. The single-stranded siRNAs are generally 15-30 nucleotides and are chemically modified. The design and testing of single-stranded siRNAs are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,101,348 and in Lima et al., (2012) <i>Cell </i>150: 883-894, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Any of the antisense nucleotide sequences described herein may be used as a single-stranded siRNA as described herein or as chemically modified by the methods described in Lima et al., (2012) <i>Cell </i>150:883-894.</p>
      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0350">In another embodiment, an âiRNAâ for use in the compositions, uses, and methods of the invention is a double-stranded RNA and is referred to herein as a âdouble stranded RNAi agent,â âdouble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule,â âdsRNA agent,â or âdsRNAâ. The term âdsRNAâ, refers to a complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure comprising two anti-parallel and substantially complementary nucleic acid strands, referred to as having âsenseâ and âantisenseâ orientations with respect to a target RNA, i.e., a C5 gene. In some embodiments of the invention, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers the degradation of a target RNA, e.g., an mRNA, through a post-transcriptional gene-silencing mechanism referred to herein as RNA interference or RNAi.</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0351">In general, the majority of nucleotides of each strand of a dsRNA molecule are ribonucleotides, but as described in detail herein, each or both strands can also include one or more non-ribonucleotides, e.g., a deoxyribonucleotide and/or a modified nucleotide. In addition, as used in this specification, an âRNAi agentâ may include ribonucleotides with chemical modifications; an RNAi agent may include substantial modifications at multiple nucleotides. Such modifications may include all types of modifications disclosed herein or known in the art. Any such modifications, as used in a siRNA type molecule, are encompassed by âRNAi agentâ for the purposes of this specification and claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0352">The duplex region may be of any length that permits specific degradation of a desired target RNA through a RISC pathway, and may range from about 9 to 36 base pairs in length, e.g., about 15-30 base pairs in length, for example, about 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, or 36 base pairs in length, such as about 15-30, 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 base pairs in length. Ranges and lengths intermediate to the above recited ranges and lengths are also contemplated to be part of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0353">The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3â²-end of one strand and the 5â²-end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a âhairpin loop.â A hairpin loop can comprise at least one unpaired nucleotide. In some embodiments, the hairpin loop can comprise at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 20, at least 23 or more unpaired nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0354">Where the two substantially complementary strands of a dsRNA are comprised by separate RNA molecules, those molecules need not, but can be covalently connected. Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3â²-end of one strand and the 5â²-end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a âlinker.â The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA minus any overhangs that are present in the duplex. In addition to the duplex structure, an RNAi may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0355">In one embodiment, an RNAi agent of the invention is a dsRNA of 24-30 nucleotides that interacts with a target RNA sequence, e.g., a C5 target mRNA sequence, to direct the cleavage of the target RNA. Without wishing to be bound by theory, long double stranded RNA introduced into cells is broken down into siRNA by a Type III endonuclease known as Dicer (Sharp et al. (2001) <i>Genes Dev. </i>15:485). Dicer, a ribonuclease-III-like enzyme, processes the dsRNA into 19-23 base pair short interfering RNAs with characteristic two base 3â² overhangs (Bernstein, et al., (2001) <i>Nature </i>409:363). The siRNAs are then incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where one or more helicases unwind the siRNA duplex, enabling the complementary antisense strand to guide target recognition (Nykanen, et al., (2001) <i>Cell </i>107:309). Upon binding to the appropriate target mRNA, one or more endonucleases within the RISC cleave the target to induce silencing (Elbashir, et al., (2001) <i>Genes Dev</i>. 15:188).</p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0356">As used herein, the term ânucleotide overhangâ refers to at least one unpaired nucleotide that protrudes from the duplex structure of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA. For example, when a 3â²-end of one strand of a dsRNA extends beyond the 5â²-end of the other strand, or vice versa, there is a nucleotide overhang. A dsRNA can comprise an overhang of at least one nucleotide; alternatively the overhang can comprise at least two nucleotides, at least three nucleotides, at least four nucleotides, at least five nucleotides or more. A nucleotide overhang can comprise or consist of a nucleotide/nucleoside analog, including a deoxynucleotide/nucleoside. The overhang(s) can be on the sense strand, the antisense strand or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the nucleotide(s) of an overhang can be present on the 5â²-end, 3â²-end or both ends of either an antisense or sense strand of a dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0357">In one embodiment, the antisense strand of a dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide, e.g., a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotide, overhang at the 3â²-end and/or the 5â²-end. In one embodiment, the sense strand of a dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide, e.g., a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotide, overhang at the 3â²-end and/or the 5â²-end. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0358">âBluntâ or âblunt endâ means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the double stranded RNAi agent, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A âblunt endedâ RNAi agent is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule. The RNAi agents of the invention include RNAi agents with nucleotide overhangs at one end (i.e., agents with one overhang and one blunt end) or with nucleotide overhangs at both ends.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0359">The term âantisense strandâ or âguide strandâ refers to the strand of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA, which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence, e.g., a C5 mRNA. As used herein, the term âregion of complementarityâ refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, e.g., a C5 nucleotide sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches can be in the internal or terminal regions of the molecule. Generally, the most tolerated mismatches are in the terminal regions, e.g., within 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5â²- and/or 3â²-terminus of the iRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0360">The term âsense strand,â or âpassenger strandâ as used herein, refers to the strand of an iRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand as that term is defined herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0361">As used herein, the term âcleavage regionâ refers to a region that is located immediately adjacent to the cleavage site. The cleavage site is the site on the target at which cleavage occurs. In some embodiments, the cleavage region comprises three bases on either end of, and immediately adjacent to, the cleavage site. In some embodiments, the cleavage region comprises two bases on either end of, and immediately adjacent to, the cleavage site. In some embodiments, the cleavage site specifically occurs at the site bound by nucleotides 10 and 11 of the antisense strand, and the cleavage region comprises nucleotides 11, 12 and 13.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0362">As used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term âcomplementary,â when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Such conditions can, for example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions can include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50Â° C. or 70Â° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing (see, e.g., âMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook, et al. (1989) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as can be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0363">Complementary sequences within an iRNA, e.g., within a dsRNA as described herein, include base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a first nucleotide sequence to an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a second nucleotide sequence over the entire length of one or both nucleotide sequences. Such sequences can be referred to as âfully complementaryâ with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to as âsubstantially complementaryâ with respect to a second sequence herein, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they can form one or more, but generally not more than 5, 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization for a duplex up to 30 base pairs, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application, e.g., inhibition of gene expression via a RISC pathway. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, can yet be referred to as âfully complementaryâ for the purposes described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0364">âComplementaryâ sequences, as used herein, can also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in so far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled. Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs include, but are not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base pairing.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0365">The terms âcomplementary,â âfully complementaryâ and âsubstantially complementaryâ herein can be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of an iRNA agent and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0366">As used herein, a polynucleotide that is âsubstantially complementary to at least part ofâ a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide that is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., an mRNA encoding C5). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a C5 mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding C5.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0367">In general, the majority of nucleotides of each strand are ribonucleotides, but as described in detail herein, each or both strands can also include one or more non-ribonucleotides, e.g., a deoxyribonucleotide and/or a modified nucleotide. In addition, an âiRNAâ may include ribonucleotides with chemical modifications. Such modifications may include all types of modifications disclosed herein or known in the art. Any such modifications, as used in an iRNA molecule, are encompassed by âiRNAâ for the purposes of this specification and claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0368">In one aspect of the invention, an agent for use in the methods and compositions of the invention is a single-stranded antisense RNA molecule that inhibits a target mRNA via an antisense inhibition mechanism. The single-stranded antisense RNA molecule is complementary to a sequence within the target mRNA. The single-stranded antisense oligonucleotides can inhibit translation in a stoichiometric manner by base pairing to the mRNA and physically obstructing the translation machinery, see Dias, N. et al., (2002) <i>Mol Cancer Ther </i>1:347-355. The single-stranded antisense RNA molecule may be about 15 to about 30 nucleotides in length and have a sequence that is complementary to a target sequence. For example, the single-stranded antisense RNA molecule may comprise a sequence that is at least about 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides from any one of the antisense sequences described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0369">The term âlipid nanoparticleâ or âLNPâ is a vesicle comprising a lipid layer encapsulating a pharmaceutically active molecule, such as a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., an iRNA or a plasmid from which an iRNA is transcribed. LNPs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,858,225, 6,815,432, 8,158,601, and 8,058,069, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0370">As used herein, a âsubjectâ is an animal, such as a mammal, including a primate (such as a human, a non-human primate, e.g., a monkey, and a chimpanzee), a non-primate (such as a cow, a pig, a camel, a llama, a horse, a goat, a rabbit, a sheep, a hamster, a guinea pig, a cat, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a horse, and a whale), or a bird (e.g., a duck or a goose). In an embodiment, the subject is a human, such as a human being treated or assessed for a disease, disorder or condition that would benefit from reduction in C5 expression; a human at risk for a disease, disorder or condition that would benefit from reduction in C5 expression; a human having a disease, disorder or condition that would benefit from reduction in C5 expression; and/or human being treated for a disease, disorder or condition that would benefit from reduction in C5 expression as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0371">As used herein, the terms âtreatingâ or âtreatmentâ refer to a beneficial or desired result including, but not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with unwanted complement pathway activation (e.g., hemolysis and/or chronic inflammation); diminishing the extent of unwanted complement pathway activation; stabilization (i.e., not worsening) of the state of chronic inflammation and/or hemolysis; amelioration or palliation of unwanted complement pathway activation (e.g., chronic inflammation and/or hemolysis) whether detectable or undetectable. âTreatmentâ can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival in the absence of treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0372">The term âlowerâ in the context of the level of a complement component C5 in a subject or a disease marker or symptom refers to a statistically significant decrease in such level. The decrease can be, for example, at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or more and is preferably down to a level accepted as within the range of normal for an individual without such disorder.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0373">As used herein, âpreventionâ or âpreventing,â when used in reference to a disease, disorder or condition thereof, that would benefit from a reduction in expression of a C5 gene, refers to a reduction in the likelihood that a subject will develop a symptom associated with such a disease, disorder, or condition, e.g., a symptom of unwanted complement activation, such as a chronic inflammation, hemolysis and/or thrombosis. The likelihood of developing a thrombosis is reduced, for example, when an individual having one or more risk factors for a thrombosis either fails to develop a thrombosis or develops a thrombosis with less severity relative to a population having the same risk factors and not receiving treatment as described herein. The failure to develop a disease, disorder or condition, or the reduction in the development of a symptom associated with such a disease, disorder or condition (e.g., by at least about 10% on a clinically accepted scale for that disease or disorder), or the exhibition of delayed symptoms delayed (e.g., by days, weeks, months or years) is considered effective prevention.</p>
      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0374">As used herein, the term âcomplement component C5-associated diseaseâ is a disease or disorder that is caused by, or associated with complement activation. Such diseases are typically associated with inflammation and/or immune system activation, e.g., membrane attack complex-mediated lysis, anaphylaxis, and/or hemolysis. Non-limiting examples of complement component C5-associated diseases include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), asthma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA); antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; lupus nephritis; ischemia-reperfusion injury; typical or infectious hemolytic uremic syndrome (tHUS); dense deposit disease (DDD); neuromyelitis optica (NMO); multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN); multiple sclerosis (MS); macular degeneration (e.g., age-related macular degeneration (AMD)); hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP); spontaneous fetal loss; Pauci-immune vasculitis; epidermolysis bullosa; recurrent fetal loss; pre-eclampsia, traumatic brain injury, myasthenia gravis, cold agglutinin disease, dermatomyositis bullous pemphigoid, Shiga toxin <i>E. coli</i>-related hemolytic uremic syndrome, C3 nephropathy, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener granulomatosis), Churg-Strauss syndrome, and microscopic polyangiitis), humoral and vascular transplant rejection, graft dysfunction, myocardial infarction (e.g., tissue damage and ischemia in myocardial infarction), an allogenic transplant, sepsis (e.g., poor outcome in sepsis), Coronary artery disease, dermatomyositis, Graves' disease, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, systemic inflammatory response sepsis, septic shock, spinal cord injury, glomerulonephritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, type I diabetes, psoriasis, pemphigus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), ITP, Goodpasture syndrome, Degos disease, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), catastrophic APS (CAPS), a cardiovascular disorder, myocarditis, a cerebrovascular disorder, a peripheral (e.g., musculoskeletal) vascular disorder, a renovascular disorder, a mesenteric/enteric vascular disorder, vasculitis, Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus-associated vasculitis, vasculitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, immune complex vasculitis, Takayasu's disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetic angiopathy, Kawasaki's disease (arteritis), venous gas embolus (VGE), and restenosis following stent placement, rotational atherectomy, membraneous nephropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (see, e.g., Holers (2008) Immunological Reviews 223:300-316; Holers and Thurman (2004) Molecular Immunology 41:147-152; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20070172483).</p>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0375">In one embodiment, a complement component C5-associated disease is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">II. iRNAS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00345-en" num="0376">The present invention provides iRNAs which inhibit the expression of a complement component C5 gene. In one embodiment, the iRNA agent includes double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of a C5 gene in a cell, such as a cell within a subject, e.g., a mammal, such as a human having a complement component C5-associated disease, e.g., PNH. The dsRNA includes an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is complementary to at least a part of an mRNA formed in the expression of a C5 gene. The region of complementarity is about 30 nucleotides or less in length (e.g., about 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, or 18 nucleotides or less in length). Upon contact with a cell expressing the C5 gene, the iRNA inhibits the expression of the C5 gene (e.g., a human, a primate, a non-primate, or a bird C5 gene) by at least about 10% as assayed by, for example, a PCR or branched DNA (bDNA)-based method, or by a protein-based method, such as by immunofluorescence analysis, using, for example, Western Blotting or flowcytometric techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00346-en" num="0377">A dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are complementary and hybridize to form a duplex structure under conditions in which the dsRNA will be used. One strand of a dsRNA (the antisense strand) includes a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and generally fully complementary, to a target sequence. The target sequence can be derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of a C5 gene. The other strand (the sense strand) includes a region that is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. As described elsewhere herein and as known in the art, the complementary sequences of a dsRNA can also be contained as self-complementary regions of a single nucleic acid molecule, as opposed to being on separate oligonucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0378">Generally, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30 base pairs in length, e.g., between, 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 base pairs in length. Ranges and lengths intermediate to the above recited ranges and lengths are also contemplated to be part of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0379">Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30 nucleotides in length, e.g., between 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 nucleotides in length. Ranges and lengths intermediate to the above recited ranges and lengths are also contemplated to be part of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0380">In some embodiments, the dsRNA is between about 15 and about 20 nucleotides in length, or between about 25 and about 30 nucleotides in length. In general, the dsRNA is long enough to serve as a substrate for the Dicer enzyme. For example, it is well-known in the art that dsRNAs longer than about 21-23 nucleotides in length may serve as substrates for Dicer. As the ordinarily skilled person will also recognize, the region of an RNA targeted for cleavage will most often be part of a larger RNA molecule, often an mRNA molecule. Where relevant, a âpartâ of an mRNA target is a contiguous sequence of an mRNA target of sufficient length to allow it to be a substrate for RNAi-directed cleavage (i.e., cleavage through a RISC pathway).</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0381">One of skill in the art will also recognize that the duplex region is a primary functional portion of a dsRNA, e.g., a duplex region of about 9 to 36 base pairs, e.g., about 10-36, 11-36, 12-36, 13-36, 14-36, 15-36, 9-35, 10-35, 11-35, 12-35, 13-35, 14-35, 15-35, 9-34, 10-34, 11-34, 12-34, 13-34, 14-34, 15-34, 9-33, 10-33, 11-33, 12-33, 13-33, 14-33, 15-33, 9-32, 10-32, 11-32, 12-32, 13-32, 14-32, 15-32, 9-31, 10-31, 11-31, 12-31, 13-32, 14-31, 15-31, 15-30, 15-29, 15-28, 15-27, 15-26, 15-25, 15-24, 15-23, 15-22, 15-21, 15-20, 15-19, 15-18, 15-17, 18-30, 18-29, 18-28, 18-27, 18-26, 18-25, 18-24, 18-23, 18-22, 18-21, 18-20, 19-30, 19-29, 19-28, 19-27, 19-26, 19-25, 19-24, 19-23, 19-22, 19-21, 19-20, 20-30, 20-29, 20-28, 20-27, 20-26, 20-25, 20-24, 20-23, 20-22, 20-21, 21-30, 21-29, 21-28, 21-27, 21-26, 21-25, 21-24, 21-23, or 21-22 base pairs. Thus, in one embodiment, to the extent that it becomes processed to a functional duplex, of e.g., 15-30 base pairs, that targets a desired RNA for cleavage, an RNA molecule or complex of RNA molecules having a duplex region greater than 30 base pairs is a dsRNA. Thus, an ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that in one embodiment, a miRNA is a dsRNA. In another embodiment, a dsRNA is not a naturally occurring miRNA. In another embodiment, an iRNA agent useful to target C5 expression is not generated in the target cell by cleavage of a larger dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0382">A dsRNA as described herein can further include one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhangs e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang can have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties relative to their blunt-ended counterparts. A nucleotide overhang can comprise or consist of a nucleotide/nucleoside analog, including a deoxynucleotide/nucleoside. The overhang(s) can be on the sense strand, the antisense strand or any combination thereof. Furthermore, the nucleotide(s) of an overhang can be present on the 5â²-end, 3â²-end or both ends of either an antisense or sense strand of a dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00352-en" num="0383">A dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc.</p>
      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0384">iRNA compounds of the invention may be prepared using a two-step procedure. First, the individual strands of the double-stranded RNA molecule are prepared separately. Then, the component strands are annealed. The individual strands of the siRNA compound can be prepared using solution-phase or solid-phase organic synthesis or both. Organic synthesis offers the advantage that the oligonucleotide strands comprising unnatural or modified nucleotides can be easily prepared. Single-stranded oligonucleotides of the invention can be prepared using solution-phase or solid-phase organic synthesis or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00354-en" num="0385">In one aspect, a dsRNA of the invention includes at least two nucleotide sequences, a sense sequence and an anti-sense sequence. The sense strand is selected from the group of sequences provided in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23, and the corresponding antisense strand of the sense strand is selected from the group of sequences of any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23. In this aspect, one of the two sequences is complementary to the other of the two sequences, with one of the sequences being substantially complementary to a sequence of an mRNA generated in the expression of a C5 gene. As such, in this aspect, a dsRNA will include two oligonucleotides, where one oligonucleotide is described as the sense strand in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23, and the second oligonucleotide is described as the corresponding antisense strand of the sense strand in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23. In one embodiment, the substantially complementary sequences of the dsRNA are contained on separate oligonucleotides. In another embodiment, the substantially complementary sequences of the dsRNA are contained on a single oligonucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0386">It will be understood that, although some of the sequences in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 are described as modified and/or conjugated sequences, the RNA of the iRNA of the invention e.g., a dsRNA of the invention, may comprise any one of the sequences set forth in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 that is un-modified, un-conjugated, and/or modified and/or conjugated differently than described therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0387">The skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs having a duplex structure of between about 20 and 23 base pairs, e.g., 21, base pairs have been hailed as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (Elbashir et al., <i>EMBO </i>2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or longer RNA duplex structures can also be effective (Chu and Rana (2007) RNA 14:1714-1719; Kim et al. (2005) <i>Nat Biotech </i>23:222-226). In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23, dsRNAs described herein can include at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nucleotides. It can be reasonably expected that shorter duplexes having one of the sequences of any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends can be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs having a sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides derived from one of the sequences of any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of a C5 gene by not more than about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% inhibition from a dsRNA comprising the full sequence, are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0388">In addition, the RNAs provided in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 identify a site(s) in a C5 transcript that is susceptible to RISC-mediated cleavage. As such, the present invention further features iRNAs that target within one of these sites. As used herein, an iRNA is said to target within a particular site of an RNA transcript if the iRNA promotes cleavage of the transcript anywhere within that particular site. Such an iRNA will generally include at least about 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 coupled to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in a C5 gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0389">While a target sequence is generally about 15-30 nucleotides in length, there is wide variation in the suitability of particular sequences in this range for directing cleavage of any given target RNA. Various software packages and the guidelines set out herein provide guidance for the identification of optimal target sequences for any given gene target, but an empirical approach can also be taken in which a âwindowâ or âmaskâ of a given size (as a non-limiting example, 21 nucleotides) is literally or figuratively (including, e.g., in silico) placed on the target RNA sequence to identify sequences in the size range that can serve as target sequences. By moving the sequence âwindowâ progressively one nucleotide upstream or downstream of an initial target sequence location, the next potential target sequence can be identified, until the complete set of possible sequences is identified for any given target size selected. This process, coupled with systematic synthesis and testing of the identified sequences (using assays as described herein or as known in the art) to identify those sequences that perform optimally can identify those RNA sequences that, when targeted with an iRNA agent, mediate the best inhibition of target gene expression. Thus, while the sequences identified, for example, in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23 represent effective target sequences, it is contemplated that further optimization of inhibition efficiency can be achieved by progressively âwalking the windowâ one nucleotide upstream or downstream of the given sequences to identify sequences with equal or better inhibition characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0390">Further, it is contemplated that for any sequence identified, e.g., in any one of Tables 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 23, further optimization could be achieved by systematically either adding or removing nucleotides to generate longer or shorter sequences and testing those sequences generated by walking a window of the longer or shorter size up or down the target RNA from that point. Again, coupling this approach to generating new candidate targets with testing for effectiveness of iRNAs based on those target sequences in an inhibition assay as known in the art and/or as described herein can lead to further improvements in the efficiency of inhibition. Further still, such optimized sequences can be adjusted by, e.g., the introduction of modified nucleotides as described herein or as known in the art, addition or changes in overhang, or other modifications as known in the art and/or discussed herein to further optimize the molecule (e.g., increasing serum stability or circulating half-life, increasing thermal stability, enhancing transmembrane delivery, targeting to a particular location or cell type, increasing interaction with silencing pathway enzymes, increasing release from endosomes) as an expression inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0391">An iRNA as described herein can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence. In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the antisense strand of the iRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of mismatch is not located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the iRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to be within the last 5 nucleotides from either the 5â²- or 3â²-end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide iRNA agent the strand which is complementary to a region of a C5 gene, generally does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described herein or methods known in the art can be used to determine whether an iRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of a C5 gene. Consideration of the efficacy of iRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of a C5 gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in a C5 gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.</p>

      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0408">In certain aspects of the invention, the double-stranded RNAi agents of the invention include agents with chemical modifications as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/561,710, filed on Nov. 18, 2011, or in PCT/US2012/065691, filed on Nov. 16, 2012, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00378-en" num="0409">As shown herein and in Provisional Application No. 61/561,710 or PCT Application No. PCT/US2012/065691, a superior result may be obtained by introducing one or more motifs of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides into a sense strand and/or antisense strand of an RNAi agent, particularly at or near the cleavage site. In some embodiments, the sense strand and antisense strand of the RNAi agent may otherwise be completely modified. The introduction of these motifs interrupts the modification pattern, if present, of the sense and/or antisense strand. The RNAi agent may be optionally conjugated with a GalNAc derivative ligand, for instance on the sense strand. The resulting RNAi agents present superior gene silencing activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00379-en" num="0410">More specifically, it has been surprisingly discovered that when the sense strand and antisense strand of the double-stranded RNAi agent are completely modified to have one or more motifs of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at or near the cleavage site of at least one strand of an RNAi agent, the gene silencing activity of the RNAi agent was superiorly enhanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0411">Accordingly, the invention provides double-stranded RNAi agents capable of inhibiting the expression of a target gene (i.e., a complement component C5 (C5) gene) in vivo. The RNAi agent comprises a sense strand and an antisense strand. Each strand of the RNAi agent may range from 12-30 nucleotides in length. For example, each strand may be between 14-30 nucleotides in length, 17-30 nucleotides in length, 25-30 nucleotides in length, 27-30 nucleotides in length, 17-23 nucleotides in length, 17-21 nucleotides in length, 17-19 nucleotides in length, 19-25 nucleotides in length, 19-23 nucleotides in length, 19-21 nucleotides in length, 21-25 nucleotides in length, or 21-23 nucleotides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00381-en" num="0412">The sense strand and antisense strand typically form a duplex double stranded RNA (âdsRNAâ), also referred to herein as an âRNAi agent.â The duplex region of an RNAi agent may be 12-30 nucleotide pairs in length. For example, the duplex region can be between 14-30 nucleotide pairs in length, 17-30 nucleotide pairs in length, 27-30 nucleotide pairs in length, 17-23 nucleotide pairs in length, 17-21 nucleotide pairs in length, 17-19 nucleotide pairs in length, 19-25 nucleotide pairs in length, 19-23 nucleotide pairs in length, 19-21 nucleotide pairs in length, 21-25 nucleotide pairs in length, or 21-23 nucleotide pairs in length. In another example, the duplex region is selected from 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 nucleotides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00382-en" num="0413">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent may contain one or more overhang regions and/or capping groups at the 3â²-end, 5â²-end, or both ends of one or both strands. The overhang can be 1-6 nucleotides in length, for instance 2-6 nucleotides in length, 1-5 nucleotides in length, 2-5 nucleotides in length, 1-4 nucleotides in length, 2-4 nucleotides in length, 1-3 nucleotides in length, 2-3 nucleotides in length, or 1-2 nucleotides in length. The overhangs can be the result of one strand being longer than the other, or the result of two strands of the same length being staggered. The overhang can form a mismatch with the target mRNA or it can be complementary to the gene sequences being targeted or can be another sequence. The first and second strands can also be joined, e.g., by additional bases to form a hairpin, or by other non-base linkers.</p>
      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0414">In one embodiment, the nucleotides in the overhang region of the RNAi agent can each independently be a modified or unmodified nucleotide including, but no limited to 2â²-sugar modified, such as, 2-F, 2â²-Omethyl, thymidine (T), 2â²-O-methoxyethyl-5-methyluridine (Teo), 2â²-O-methoxyethyladenosine (Aeo), 2â²-O-methoxyethyl-5-methylcytidine (m5Ceo), and any combinations thereof. For example, TT can be an overhang sequence for either end on either strand. The overhang can form a mismatch with the target mRNA or it can be complementary to the gene sequences being targeted or can be another sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0415">The 5â²- or 3â²-overhangs at the sense strand, antisense strand or both strands of the RNAi agent may be phosphorylated. In some embodiments, the overhang region(s) contains two nucleotides having a phosphorothioate between the two nucleotides, where the two nucleotides can be the same or different. In one embodiment, the overhang is present at the 3â²-end of the sense strand, antisense strand, or both strands. In one embodiment, this 3â²-overhang is present in the antisense strand. In one embodiment, this 3â²-overhang is present in the sense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00385-en" num="0416">The RNAi agent may contain only a single overhang, which can strengthen the interference activity of the RNAi, without affecting its overall stability. For example, the single-stranded overhang may be located at the 3â²-terminal end of the sense strand or, alternatively, at the 3â²-terminal end of the antisense strand. The RNAi may also have a blunt end, located at the 5â²-end of the antisense strand (or the 3â²-end of the sense strand) or vice versa. Generally, the antisense strand of the RNAi has a nucleotide overhang at the 3â²-end, and the 5â²-end is blunt. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the asymmetric blunt end at the 5â²-end of the antisense strand and 3â²-end overhang of the antisense strand favor the guide strand loading into RISC process.</p>
      <p id="p-00386-en" num="0417">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent is a double ended bluntmer of 19 nucleotides in length, wherein the sense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-F modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 7, 8, 9 from the 5â²end. The antisense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 11, 12, 13 from the 5â²end.</p>
      <p id="p-00387-en" num="0418">In another embodiment, the RNAi agent is a double ended bluntmer of 20 nucleotides in length, wherein the sense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-F modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 8, 9, 10 from the 5â²end. The antisense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 11, 12, 13 from the 5â²end.</p>
      <p id="p-00388-en" num="0419">In yet another embodiment, the RNAi agent is a double ended bluntmer of 21 nucleotides in length, wherein the sense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-F modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 9, 10, 11 from the 5â²end. The antisense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 11, 12, 13 from the 5â²end.</p>
      <p id="p-00389-en" num="0420">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises a 21 nucleotide sense strand and a 23 nucleotide antisense strand, wherein the sense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-F modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 9, 10, 11 from the 5â²end; the antisense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at positions 11, 12, 13 from the 5â²end, wherein one end of the RNAi agent is blunt, while the other end comprises a 2 nucleotide overhang. Preferably, the 2 nucleotide overhang is at the 3â²-end of the antisense strand. When the 2 nucleotide overhang is at the 3â²-end of the antisense strand, there may be two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between the terminal three nucleotides, wherein two of the three nucleotides are the overhang nucleotides, and the third nucleotide is a paired nucleotide next to the overhang nucleotide. In one embodiment, the RNAi agent additionally has two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between the terminal three nucleotides at both the 5â²-end of the sense strand and at the 5â²-end of the antisense strand. In one embodiment, every nucleotide in the sense strand and the antisense strand of the RNAi agent, including the nucleotides that are part of the motifs are modified nucleotides. In one embodiment each residue is independently modified with a 2â²-O-methyl or 3â²-fluoro, e.g., in an alternating motif. Optionally, the RNAi agent further comprises a ligand (preferably GalNAc<sub>3</sub>).</p>
      <p id="p-00390-en" num="0421">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises a sense and an antisense strand, wherein the sense strand is 25-30 nucleotide residues in length, wherein starting from the 5â² terminal nucleotide (position 1) positions 1 to 23 of the first strand comprise at least 8 ribonucleotides; the antisense strand is 36-66 nucleotide residues in length and, starting from the 3â² terminal nucleotide, comprises at least 8 ribonucleotides in the positions paired with positions 1-23 of sense strand to form a duplex; wherein at least the 3â² terminal nucleotide of antisense strand is unpaired with sense strand, and up to 6 consecutive 3â² terminal nucleotides are unpaired with sense strand, thereby forming a 3â² single stranded overhang of 1-6 nucleotides; wherein the 5â² terminus of antisense strand comprises from 10-30 consecutive nucleotides which are unpaired with sense strand, thereby forming a 10-30 nucleotide single stranded 5â² overhang; wherein at least the sense strand 5â² terminal and 3â² terminal nucleotides are base paired with nucleotides of antisense strand when sense and antisense strands are aligned for maximum complementarity, thereby forming a substantially duplexed region between sense and antisense strands; and antisense strand is sufficiently complementary to a target RNA along at least 19 ribonucleotides of antisense strand length to reduce target gene expression when the double stranded nucleic acid is introduced into a mammalian cell; and wherein the sense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-F modifications on three consecutive nucleotides, where at least one of the motifs occurs at or near the cleavage site. The antisense strand contains at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at or near the cleavage site.</p>
      <p id="p-00391-en" num="0422">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises sense and antisense strands, wherein the RNAi agent comprises a first strand having a length which is at least 25 and at most 29 nucleotides and a second strand having a length which is at most 30 nucleotides with at least one motif of three 2â²-O-methyl modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at position 11, 12, 13 from the 5â² end; wherein the 3â² end of the first strand and the 5â² end of the second strand form a blunt end and the second strand is 1-4 nucleotides longer at its 3â² end than the first strand, wherein the duplex region which is at least 25 nucleotides in length, and the second strand is sufficiently complementary to a target mRNA along at least 19 nucleotide of the second strand length to reduce target gene expression when the RNAi agent is introduced into a mammalian cell, and wherein dicer cleavage of the RNAi agent preferentially results in an siRNA comprising the 3â² end of the second strand, thereby reducing expression of the target gene in the mammal. Optionally, the RNAi agent further comprises a ligand.</p>
      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0423">In one embodiment, the sense strand of the RNAi agent contains at least one motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides, where one of the motifs occurs at the cleavage site in the sense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00393-en" num="0424">In one embodiment, the antisense strand of the RNAi agent can also contain at least one motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides, where one of the motifs occurs at or near the cleavage site in the antisense strand</p>
      <p id="p-00394-en" num="0425">For an RNAi agent having a duplex region of 17-23 nucleotide in length, the cleavage site of the antisense strand is typically around the 10, 11 and 12 positions from the 5â²-end. Thus the motifs of three identical modifications may occur at the 9, 10, 11 positions; 10, 11, 12 positions; 11, 12, 13 positions; 12, 13, 14 positions; or 13, 14, 15 positions of the antisense strand, the count starting from the 1<sup>st </sup>nucleotide from the 5â²-end of the antisense strand, or, the count starting from the 1<sup>st </sup>paired nucleotide within the duplex region from the 5â²-end of the antisense strand. The cleavage site in the antisense strand may also change according to the length of the duplex region of the RNAi from the 5â²-end.</p>
      <p id="p-00395-en" num="0426">The sense strand of the RNAi agent may contain at least one motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at the cleavage site of the strand; and the antisense strand may have at least one motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides at or near the cleavage site of the strand. When the sense strand and the antisense strand form a dsRNA duplex, the sense strand and the antisense strand can be so aligned that one motif of the three nucleotides on the sense strand and one motif of the three nucleotides on the antisense strand have at least one nucleotide overlap, i.e., at least one of the three nucleotides of the motif in the sense strand forms a base pair with at least one of the three nucleotides of the motif in the antisense strand. Alternatively, at least two nucleotides may overlap, or all three nucleotides may overlap.</p>
      <p id="p-00396-en" num="0427">In one embodiment, the sense strand of the RNAi agent may contain more than one motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides. The first motif may occur at or near the cleavage site of the strand and the other motifs may be a wing modification. The term âwing modificationâ herein refers to a motif occurring at another portion of the strand that is separated from the motif at or near the cleavage site of the same strand. The wing modification is either adjacent to the first motif or is separated by at least one or more nucleotides. When the motifs are immediately adjacent to each other then the chemistry of the motifs are distinct from each other and when the motifs are separated by one or more nucleotide than the chemistries can be the same or different. Two or more wing modifications may be present. For instance, when two wing modifications are present, each wing modification may occur at one end relative to the first motif which is at or near cleavage site or on either side of the lead motif.</p>
      <p id="p-00397-en" num="0428">Like the sense strand, the antisense strand of the RNAi agent may contain more than one motifs of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides, with at least one of the motifs occurring at or near the cleavage site of the strand. This antisense strand may also contain one or more wing modifications in an alignment similar to the wing modifications that may be present on the sense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0429">In one embodiment, the wing modification on the sense strand or antisense strand of the RNAi agent typically does not include the first one or two terminal nucleotides at the 3â²-end, 5â²-end or both ends of the strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00399-en" num="0430">In another embodiment, the wing modification on the sense strand or antisense strand of the RNAi agent typically does not include the first one or two paired nucleotides within the duplex region at the 3â²-end, 5â²-end or both ends of the strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00400-en" num="0431">When the sense strand and the antisense strand of the RNAi agent each contain at least one wing modification, the wing modifications may fall on the same end of the duplex region, and have an overlap of one, two or three nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00401-en" num="0432">When the sense strand and the antisense strand of the RNAi agent each contain at least two wing modifications, the sense strand and the antisense strand can be so aligned that two modifications each from one strand fall on one end of the duplex region, having an overlap of one, two or three nucleotides; two modifications each from one strand fall on the other end of the duplex region, having an overlap of one, two or three nucleotides; two modifications one strand fall on each side of the lead motif, having an overlap of one, two or three nucleotides in the duplex region.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0433">In one embodiment, every nucleotide in the sense strand and antisense strand of the RNAi agent, including the nucleotides that are part of the motifs, may be modified. Each nucleotide may be modified with the same or different modification which can include one or more alteration of one or both of the non-linking phosphate oxygens and/or of one or more of the linking phosphate oxygens; alteration of a constituent of the ribose sugar, e.g., of the 2â² hydroxyl on the ribose sugar; wholesale replacement of the phosphate moiety with âdephosphoâ linkers; modification or replacement of a naturally occurring base; and replacement or modification of the ribose-phosphate backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00403-en" num="0434">As nucleic acids are polymers of subunits, many of the modifications occur at a position which is repeated within a nucleic acid, e.g., a modification of a base, or a phosphate moiety, or a non-linking O of a phosphate moiety. In some cases the modification will occur at all of the subject positions in the nucleic acid but in many cases it will not. By way of example, a modification may only occur at a 3â² or 5â² terminal position, may only occur in a terminal region, e.g., at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand. A modification may occur in a double strand region, a single strand region, or in both. A modification may occur only in the double strand region of a RNA or may only occur in a single strand region of a RNA. For example, a phosphorothioate modification at a non-linking O position may only occur at one or both termini, may only occur in a terminal region, e.g., at a position on a terminal nucleotide or in the last 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 nucleotides of a strand, or may occur in double strand and single strand regions, particularly at termini. The 5â² end or ends can be phosphorylated.</p>
      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0435">It may be possible, e.g., to enhance stability, to include particular bases in overhangs, or to include modified nucleotides or nucleotide surrogates, in single strand overhangs, e.g., in a 5â² or 3â² overhang, or in both. For example, it can be desirable to include purine nucleotides in overhangs. In some embodiments all or some of the bases in a 3â² or 5â² overhang may be modified, e.g., with a modification described herein. Modifications can include, e.g., the use of modifications at the 2â² position of the ribose sugar with modifications that are known in the art, e.g., the use of deoxyribonucleotides, 2â²-deoxy-2â²-fluoro (2â²-F) or 2â²-O-methyl modified instead of the ribosugar of the nucleobase, and modifications in the phosphate group, e.g., phosphorothioate modifications. Overhangs need not be homologous with the target sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0436">In one embodiment, each residue of the sense strand and antisense strand is independently modified with LNA, HNA, CeNA, 2â²-methoxyethyl, 2â²-O-methyl, 2â²-O-allyl, 2â²-C-allyl, 2â²-deoxy, 2â²-hydroxyl, or 2â²-fluoro. The strands can contain more than one modification. In one embodiment, each residue of the sense strand and antisense strand is independently modified with 2â²-O-methyl or 2â²-fluoro.</p>
      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0437">At least two different modifications are typically present on the sense strand and antisense strand. Those two modifications may be the 2â²-O-methyl or 2â²-fluoro modifications, or others.</p>
      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0438">In one embodiment, the N<sub>a </sub>and/or N<sub>b </sub>comprise modifications of an alternating pattern. The term âalternating motifâ as used herein refers to a motif having one or more modifications, each modification occurring on alternating nucleotides of one strand. The alternating nucleotide may refer to one per every other nucleotide or one per every three nucleotides, or a similar pattern. For example, if A, B and C each represent one type of modification to the nucleotide, the alternating motif can be âABABABABABAB . . . ,â âAABBAABBAABB . . . ,â âAABAABAABAAB . . . ,â âAAABAAABAAAB . . . ,â âAAABBBAAABBB . . . ,â or âABCABCABCABC . . . ,â etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0439">The type of modifications contained in the alternating motif may be the same or different.</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0440">For example, if A, B, C, D each represent one type of modification on the nucleotide, the alternating pattern, i.e., modifications on every other nucleotide, may be the same, but each of the sense strand or antisense strand can be selected from several possibilities of modifications within the alternating motif such as âABABAB . . . â, âACACAC . . . â âBDBDBD . . . â or âCDCDCD . . . ,â etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00410-en" num="0441">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent of the invention comprises the modification pattern for the alternating motif on the sense strand relative to the modification pattern for the alternating motif on the antisense strand is shifted. The shift may be such that the modified group of nucleotides of the sense strand corresponds to a differently modified group of nucleotides of the antisense strand and vice versa. For example, the sense strand when paired with the antisense strand in the dsRNA duplex, the alternating motif in the sense strand may start with âABABABâ from 5â²-3â² of the strand and the alternating motif in the antisense strand may start with âBABABAâ from 5â²-3â² of the strand within the duplex region. As another example, the alternating motif in the sense strand may start with âAABBAABBâ from 5â²-3â² of the strand and the alternating motif in the antisense strand may start with âBBAABBAAâ from 5â²-3â² of the strand within the duplex region, so that there is a complete or partial shift of the modification patterns between the sense strand and the antisense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0442">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises the pattern of the alternating motif of 2â²-O-methyl modification and 2â²-F modification on the sense strand initially has a shift relative to the pattern of the alternating motif of 2â²-O-methyl modification and 2â²-F modification on the antisense strand initially, i.e., the 2â²-O-methyl modified nucleotide on the sense strand base pairs with a 2â²-F modified nucleotide on the antisense strand and vice versa. The 1 position of the sense strand may start with the 2â²-F modification, and the 1 position of the antisense strand may start with the 2â²-O-methyl modification.</p>
      <p id="p-00412-en" num="0443">The introduction of one or more motifs of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides to the sense strand and/or antisense strand interrupts the initial modification pattern present in the sense strand and/or antisense strand. This interruption of the modification pattern of the sense and/or antisense strand by introducing one or more motifs of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides to the sense and/or antisense strand surprisingly enhances the gene silencing activity to the target gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00413-en" num="0444">In one embodiment, when the motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotides is introduced to any of the strands, the modification of the nucleotide next to the motif is a different modification than the modification of the motif. For example, the portion of the sequence containing the motif is â . . . N<sub>a</sub>YYYN<sub>b </sub>. . . ,â where âYâ represents the modification of the motif of three identical modifications on three consecutive nucleotide, and âN<sub>a</sub>â and âN<sub>b</sub>â represent a modification to the nucleotide next to the motif âYYYâ that is different than the modification of Y, and where N<sub>a </sub>and N<sub>b </sub>can be the same or different modifications. Alternatively, N<sub>a </sub>and/or N<sub>b </sub>may be present or absent when there is a wing modification present.</p>
      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0445">The RNAi agent may further comprise at least one phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkage. The phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkage modification may occur on any nucleotide of the sense strand or antisense strand or both strands in any position of the strand. For instance, the internucleotide linkage modification may occur on every nucleotide on the sense strand and/or antisense strand; each internucleotide linkage modification may occur in an alternating pattern on the sense strand and/or antisense strand; or the sense strand or antisense strand may contain both internucleotide linkage modifications in an alternating pattern. The alternating pattern of the internucleotide linkage modification on the sense strand may be the same or different from the antisense strand, and the alternating pattern of the internucleotide linkage modification on the sense strand may have a shift relative to the alternating pattern of the internucleotide linkage modification on the antisense strand. In one embodiment, a double-stranded RNAi agent comprises 6-8 phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages. In one embodiment, the antisense strand comprises two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages at the 5â²-terminus and two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages at the 3â²-terminus, and the sense strand comprises at least two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages at either the 5â²-terminus or the 3â²-terminus.</p>
      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0446">In one embodiment, the RNAi comprises a phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkage modification in the overhang region. For example, the overhang region may contain two nucleotides having a phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkage between the two nucleotides. Internucleotide linkage modifications also may be made to link the overhang nucleotides with the terminal paired nucleotides within the duplex region. For example, at least 2, 3, 4, or all the overhang nucleotides may be linked through phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkage, and optionally, there may be additional phosphorothioate or methylphosphonate internucleotide linkages linking the overhang nucleotide with a paired nucleotide that is next to the overhang nucleotide. For instance, there may be at least two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between the terminal three nucleotides, in which two of the three nucleotides are overhang nucleotides, and the third is a paired nucleotide next to the overhang nucleotide. These terminal three nucleotides may be at the 3â²-end of the antisense strand, the 3â²-end of the sense strand, the 5â²-end of the antisense strand, and/or the 5â²end of the antisense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00416-en" num="0447">In one embodiment, the 2 nucleotide overhang is at the 3â²-end of the antisense strand, and there are two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between the terminal three nucleotides, wherein two of the three nucleotides are the overhang nucleotides, and the third nucleotide is a paired nucleotide next to the overhang nucleotide. Optionally, the RNAi agent may additionally have two phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between the terminal three nucleotides at both the 5â²-end of the sense strand and at the 5â²-end of the antisense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0448">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises mismatch(es) with the target, within the duplex, or combinations thereof. The mismatch may occur in the overhang region or the duplex region. The base pair may be ranked on the basis of their propensity to promote dissociation or melting (e.g., on the free energy of association or dissociation of a particular pairing, the simplest approach is to examine the pairs on an individual pair basis, though next neighbor or similar analysis can also be used). In terms of promoting dissociation: A:U is preferred over G:C; G:U is preferred over G:C; and I:C is preferred over G:C (I=inosine). Mismatches, e.g., non-canonical or other than canonical pairings (as described elsewhere herein) are preferred over canonical (A:T, A:U, G:C) pairings; and pairings which include a universal base are preferred over canonical pairings.</p>
      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0449">In one embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises at least one of the first 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 base pairs within the duplex regions from the 5â²-end of the antisense strand independently selected from the group of: A:U, G:U, I:C, and mismatched pairs, e.g., non-canonical or other than canonical pairings or pairings which include a universal base, to promote the dissociation of the antisense strand at the 5â²-end of the duplex.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0450">In one embodiment, the nucleotide at the 1 position within the duplex region from the 5â²-end in the antisense strand is selected from the group consisting of A, dA, dU, U, and dT. Alternatively, at least one of the first 1, 2 or 3 base pair within the duplex region from the 5â²-end of the antisense strand is an AU base pair. For example, the first base pair within the duplex region from the 5â²-end of the antisense strand is an AU base pair.</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0451">In another embodiment, the nucleotide at the 3â²-end of the sense strand is deoxy-thymine (dT). In another embodiment, the nucleotide at the 3â²-end of the antisense strand is deoxy-thymine (dT). In one embodiment, there is a short sequence of deoxy-thymine nucleotides, for example, two dT nucleotides on the 3â²-end of the sense and/or antisense strand.</p>

      <p id="p-00496-en" num="0519">As described in more detail below, the RNAi agent that contains conjugations of one or more carbohydrate moieties to a RNAi agent can optimize one or more properties of the RNAi agent. In many cases, the carbohydrate moiety will be attached to a modified subunit of the RNAi agent. For example, the ribose sugar of one or more ribonucleotide subunits of a dsRNA agent can be replaced with another moiety, e.g., a non-carbohydrate (preferably cyclic) carrier to which is attached a carbohydrate ligand. A ribonucleotide subunit in which the ribose sugar of the subunit has been so replaced is referred to herein as a ribose replacement modification subunit (RRMS). A cyclic carrier may be a carbocyclic ring system, i.e., all ring atoms are carbon atoms, or a heterocyclic ring system, i.e., one or more ring atoms may be a heteroatom, e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur. The cyclic carrier may be a monocyclic ring system, or may contain two or more rings, e.g. fused rings. The cyclic carrier may be a fully saturated ring system, or it may contain one or more double bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00497-en" num="0520">The ligand may be attached to the polynucleotide via a carrier. The carriers include (i) at least one âbackbone attachment point,â preferably two âbackbone attachment pointsâ and (ii) at least one âtethering attachment point.â A âbackbone attachment pointâ as used herein refers to a functional group, e.g. a hydroxyl group, or generally, a bond available for, and that is suitable for incorporation of the carrier into the backbone, e.g., the phosphate, or modified phosphate, e.g., sulfur containing, backbone, of a ribonucleic acid. A âtethering attachment pointâ (TAP) in some embodiments refers to a constituent ring atom of the cyclic carrier, e.g., a carbon atom or a heteroatom (distinct from an atom which provides a backbone attachment point), that connects a selected moiety. The moiety can be, e.g., a carbohydrate, e.g. monosaccharide, disaccharide, trisaccharide, tetrasaccharide, oligosaccharide and polysaccharide. Optionally, the selected moiety is connected by an intervening tether to the cyclic carrier. Thus, the cyclic carrier will often include a functional group, e.g., an amino group, or generally, provide a bond, that is suitable for incorporation or tethering of another chemical entity, e.g., a ligand to the constituent ring.</p>
      <p id="p-00498-en" num="0521">The RNAi agents may be conjugated to a ligand via a carrier, wherein the carrier can be cyclic group or acyclic group; preferably, the cyclic group is selected from pyrrolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, [1,3]dioxolane, oxazolidinyl, isoxazolidinyl, morpholinyl, thiazolidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, quinoxalinyl, pyridazinonyl, tetrahydrofuryl and decalin; preferably, the acyclic group is selected from serinol backbone or diethanolamine backbone.</p>

In preferred embodiments a ligand provides an enhanced affinity for a selected target, e.g., molecule, cell or cell type, compartment, e.g., a cellular or organ compartment, tissue, organ or region of the body, as, e.g., compared to a species absent such a ligand. Preferred ligands will not take part in duplex pairing in a duplexed nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00502-en" num="0525">Ligands can include a naturally occurring substance, such as a protein (e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or globulin); carbohydrate (e.g., a dextran, pullulan, chitin, chitosan, inulin, cyclodextrin, N-acetylgalactosamine, or hyaluronic acid); or a lipid. The ligand can also be a recombinant or synthetic molecule, such as a synthetic polymer, e.g., a synthetic polyamino acid. Examples of polyamino acids include polyamino acid is a polylysine (PLL), poly L-aspartic acid, poly L-glutamic acid, styrene-maleic acid anhydride copolymer, poly(L-lactide-co-glycolied) copolymer, divinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymer (HMPA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyurethane, poly(2-ethylacryllic acid), N-isopropylacrylamide polymers, or polyphosphazine. Example of polyamines include: polyethylenimine, polylysine (PLL), spermine, spermidine, polyamine, pseudopeptide-polyamine, peptidomimetic polyamine, dendrimer polyamine, arginine, amidine, protamine, cationic lipid, cationic porphyrin, quaternary salt of a polyamine, or an alpha helical peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00503-en" num="0526">Ligands can also include targeting groups, e.g., a cell or tissue targeting agent, e.g., a lectin, glycoprotein, lipid or protein, e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a kidney cell. A targeting group can be a thyrotropin, melanotropin, lectin, glycoprotein, surfactant protein A, Mucin carbohydrate, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucoseamine multivalent mannose, multivalent fucose, glycosylated polyaminoacids, multivalent galactose, transferrin, bisphosphonate, polyglutamate, polyaspartate, a lipid, cholesterol, a steroid, bile acid, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin A, biotin, or an RGD peptide or RGD peptide mimetic.</p>
      <p id="p-00504-en" num="0527">Other examples of ligands include dyes, intercalating agents (e.g. acridines), cross-linkers (e.g. psoralene, mitomycin C), porphyrins (TPPC4, texaphyrin, Sapphyrin), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., phenazine, dihydrophenazine), artificial endonucleases (e.g. EDTA), lipophilic molecules, e.g., cholesterol, cholic acid, adamantane acetic acid, 1-pyrene butyric acid, dihydrotestosterone, 1,3-Bis-O(hexadecyl)glycerol, geranyloxyhexyl group, hexadecylglycerol, bomeol, menthol, 1,3-propanediol, heptadecyl group, palmitic acid, myristic acid, O3-(oleoyl)lithocholic acid, O3-(oleoyl)cholenic acid, dimethoxytrityl, or phenoxazine) and peptide conjugates (e.g., antennapedia peptide, Tat peptide), alkylating agents, phosphate, amino, mercapto, PEG (e.g., PEG-40K), MPEG, [MPEG]<sub>2</sub>, polyamino, alkyl, substituted alkyl, radiolabeled markers, enzymes, haptens (e.g. biotin), transport/absorption facilitators (e.g., aspirin, vitamin E, folic acid), synthetic ribonucleases (e.g., imidazole, bisimidazole, histamine, imidazole clusters, acridine-imidazole conjugates, Eu3+ complexes of tetraazamacrocycles), dinitrophenyl, HRP, or AP.</p>
      <p id="p-00505-en" num="0528">Ligands can be proteins, e.g., glycoproteins, or peptides, e.g., molecules having a specific affinity for a co-ligand, or antibodies e.g., an antibody, that binds to a specified cell type such as a hepatic cell. Ligands can also include hormones and hormone receptors. They can also include non-peptidic species, such as lipids, lectins, carbohydrates, vitamins, cofactors, multivalent lactose, multivalent galactose, N-acetyl-galactosamine, N-acetyl-gulucosamine multivalent mannose, or multivalent fucose. The ligand can be, for example, a lipopolysaccharide, an activator of p38 MAP kinase, or an activator of NF-ÎºB.</p>
      <p id="p-00506-en" num="0529">The ligand can be a substance, e.g., a drug, which can increase the uptake of the iRNA agent into the cell, for example, by disrupting the cell's cytoskeleton, e.g., by disrupting the cell's microtubules, microfilaments, and/or intermediate filaments. The drug can be, for example, taxon, vincristine, vinblastine, cytochalasin, nocodazole, japlakinolide, latrunculin A, phalloidin, swinholide A, indanocine, or myoservin.</p>
      <p id="p-00507-en" num="0530">In some embodiments, a ligand attached to an iRNA as described herein acts as a pharmacokinetic modulator (PK modulator). PK modulators include lipophiles, bile acids, steroids, phospholipid analogues, peptides, protein binding agents, PEG, vitamins etc. Exemplary PK modulators include, but are not limited to, cholesterol, fatty acids, cholic acid, lithocholic acid, dialkylglycerides, diacylglyceride, phospholipids, sphingolipids, naproxen, ibuprofen, vitamin E, biotin etc. Oligonucleotides that comprise a number of phosphorothioate linkages are also known to bind to serum protein, thus short oligonucleotides, e.g., oligonucleotides of about 5 bases, 10 bases, 15 bases or 20 bases, comprising multiple of phosphorothioate linkages in the backbone are also amenable to the present invention as ligands (e.g. as PK modulating ligands). In addition, aptamers that bind serum components (e.g. serum proteins) are also suitable for use as PK modulating ligands in the embodiments described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00508-en" num="0531">Ligand-conjugated oligonucleotides of the invention may be synthesized by the use of an oligonucleotide that bears a pendant reactive functionality, such as that derived from the attachment of a linking molecule onto the oligonucleotide (described below). This reactive oligonucleotide may be reacted directly with commercially-available ligands, ligands that are synthesized bearing any of a variety of protecting groups, or ligands that have a linking moiety attached thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00509-en" num="0532">The oligonucleotides used in the conjugates of the present invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid-phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is also known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides, such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00510-en" num="0533">In the ligand-conjugated oligonucleotides and ligand-molecule bearing sequence-specific linked nucleosides of the present invention, the oligonucleotides and oligonucleosides may be assembled on a suitable DNA synthesizer utilizing standard nucleotide or nucleoside precursors, or nucleotide or nucleoside conjugate precursors that already bear the linking moiety, ligand-nucleotide or nucleoside-conjugate precursors that already bear the ligand molecule, or non-nucleoside ligand-bearing building blocks.</p>
      <p id="p-00511-en" num="0534">When using nucleotide-conjugate precursors that already bear a linking moiety, the synthesis of the sequence-specific linked nucleosides is typically completed, and the ligand molecule is then reacted with the linking moiety to form the ligand-conjugated oligonucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00512-en" num="0535">In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides or linked nucleosides of the present invention are synthesized by an automated synthesizer using phosphoramidites derived from ligand-nucleoside conjugates in addition to the standard phosphoramidites and non-standard phosphoramidites that are commercially available and routinely used in oligonucleotide synthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00513-en" num="0536">A. Lipid Conjugates</p>
      <p id="p-00514-en" num="0537">In one embodiment, the ligand or conjugate is a lipid or lipid-based molecule. Such a lipid or lipid-based molecule preferably binds a serum protein, e.g., human serum albumin (HSA). An HSA binding ligand allows for distribution of the conjugate to a target tissue, e.g., a non-kidney target tissue of the body. For example, the target tissue can be the liver, including parenchymal cells of the liver. Other molecules that can bind HSA can also be used as ligands. For example, naproxen or aspirin can be used. A lipid or lipid-based ligand can (a) increase resistance to degradation of the conjugate, (b) increase targeting or transport into a target cell or cell membrane, and/or (c) can be used to adjust binding to a serum protein, e.g., HSA.</p>
      <p id="p-00515-en" num="0538">A lipid based ligand can be used to inhibit, e.g., control the binding of the conjugate to a target tissue. For example, a lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA more strongly will be less likely to be targeted to the kidney and therefore less likely to be cleared from the body. A lipid or lipid-based ligand that binds to HSA less strongly can be used to target the conjugate to the kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00516-en" num="0539">In a preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA. Preferably, it binds HSA with a sufficient affinity such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to a non-kidney tissue. However, it is preferred that the affinity not be so strong that the HSA-ligand binding cannot be reversed.</p>
      <p id="p-00517-en" num="0540">In another preferred embodiment, the lipid based ligand binds HSA weakly or not at all, such that the conjugate will be preferably distributed to the kidney. Other moieties that target to kidney cells can also be used in place of or in addition to the lipid based ligand.</p>
      <p id="p-00518-en" num="0541">In another aspect, the ligand is a moiety, e.g., a vitamin, which is taken up by a target cell, e.g., a proliferating cell. These are particularly useful for treating disorders characterized by unwanted cell proliferation, e.g., of the malignant or non-malignant type, e.g., cancer cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00519-en" num="0542">Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A, E, and K. Other exemplary vitamins include are B vitamin, e.g., folic acid, B12, riboflavin, biotin, pyridoxal or other vitamins or nutrients taken up by target cells such as liver cells. Also included are HSA and low density lipoprotein (LDL).</p>
      <p id="p-00520-en" num="0543">B. Cell Permeation Agents</p>
      <p id="p-00521-en" num="0544">In another aspect, the ligand is a cell-permeation agent, preferably a helical cell-permeation agent. Preferably, the agent is amphipathic. An exemplary agent is a peptide such as tat or antennopedia. If the agent is a peptide, it can be modified, including a peptidylmimetic, invertomers, non-peptide or pseudo-peptide linkages, and use of D-amino acids. The helical agent is preferably an alpha-helical agent, which preferably has a lipophilic and a lipophobic phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00522-en" num="0545">The ligand can be a peptide or peptidomimetic. A peptidomimetic (also referred to herein as an oligopeptidomimetic) is a molecule capable of folding into a defined three-dimensional structure similar to a natural peptide. The attachment of peptide and peptidomimetics to iRNA agents can affect pharmacokinetic distribution of the iRNA, such as by enhancing cellular recognition and absorption. The peptide or peptidomimetic moiety can be about 5-50 amino acids long, e.g., about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 amino acids long.</p>
      <p id="p-00523-en" num="0546">A peptide or peptidomimetic can be, for example, a cell permeation peptide, cationic peptide, amphipathic peptide, or hydrophobic peptide (e.g., consisting primarily of Tyr, Trp or Phe). The peptide moiety can be a dendrimer peptide, constrained peptide or crosslinked peptide. In another alternative, the peptide moiety can include a hydrophobic membrane translocation sequence (MTS). An exemplary hydrophobic MTS-containing peptide is RFGF having the amino acid sequence AAVALLPAVLLALLAP (SEQ ID NO: 9). An RFGF analogue (e.g., amino acid sequence AALLPVLLAAP (SEQ ID NO: 10) containing a hydrophobic MTS can also be a targeting moiety. The peptide moiety can be a âdeliveryâ peptide, which can carry large polar molecules including peptides, oligonucleotides, and protein across cell membranes.</p>
      <p id="p-00524-en" num="0547">For example, sequences from the HIV Tat protein (GRKKRRQRRRPPQ (SEQ ID NO: 11) and the <i>Drosophila </i>Antennapedia protein (RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK (SEQ ID NO: 12) have been found to be capable of functioning as delivery peptides. A peptide or peptidomimetic can be encoded by a random sequence of DNA, such as a peptide identified from a phage-display library, or one-bead-one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library (Lam et al., Nature, 354:82-84, 1991). Examples of a peptide or peptidomimetic tethered to a dsRNA agent via an incorporated monomer unit for cell targeting purposes is an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-peptide, or RGD mimic. A peptide moiety can range in length from about 5 amino acids to about 40 amino acids. The peptide moieties can have a structural modification, such as to increase stability or direct conformational properties. Any of the structural modifications described below can be utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00525-en" num="0548">An RGD peptide for use in the compositions and methods of the invention may be linear or cyclic, and may be modified, e.g., glycosylated or methylated, to facilitate targeting to a specific tissue(s). RGD-containing peptides and peptidiomimemtics may include D-amino acids, as well as synthetic RGD mimics. In addition to RGD, one can use other moieties that target the integrin ligand. Preferred conjugates of this ligand target PECAM-1 or VEGF.</p>
      <p id="p-00526-en" num="0549">A âcell permeation peptideâ is capable of permeating a cell, e.g., a microbial cell, such as a bacterial or fungal cell, or a mammalian cell, such as a human cell. A microbial cell-permeating peptide can be, for example, a Î±-helical linear peptide (e.g., LL-37 or Ceropin P1), a disulfide bond-containing peptide (e.g., Î±-defensin, Î²-defensin or bactenecin), or a peptide containing only one or two dominating amino acids (e.g., PR-39 or indolicidin). A cell permeation peptide can also include a nuclear localization signal (NLS). For example, a cell permeation peptide can be a bipartite amphipathic peptide, such as MPG, which is derived from the fusion peptide domain of HIV-1 gp41 and the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (Simeoni et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 31:2717-2724, 2003).</p>

      <p id="p-00528-en" num="0551">In some embodiments of the compositions and methods of the invention, an iRNA oligonucleotide further comprises a carbohydrate. The carbohydrate conjugated iRNA are advantageous for the in vivo delivery of nucleic acids, as well as compositions suitable for in vivo therapeutic use, as described herein. As used herein, âcarbohydrateâ refers to a compound which is either a carbohydrate per se made up of one or more monosaccharide units having at least 6 carbon atoms (which can be linear, branched or cyclic) with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom; or a compound having as a part thereof a carbohydrate moiety made up of one or more monosaccharide units each having at least six carbon atoms (which can be linear, branched or cyclic), with an oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom bonded to each carbon atom. Representative carbohydrates include the sugars (mono-, di-, tri- and oligosaccharides containing from about 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 monosaccharide units), and polysaccharides such as starches, glycogen, cellulose and polysaccharide gums. Specific monosaccharides include C5 and above (e.g., C5, C6, C7, or C8) sugars; di- and trisaccharides include sugars having two or three monosaccharide units (e.g., C5, C6, C7, or C8).</p>

      <p id="p-00537-en" num="0556">D. Linkers</p>
      <p id="p-00538-en" num="0557">In some embodiments, the conjugate or ligand described herein can be attached to an iRNA oligonucleotide with various linkers that can be cleavable or non-cleavable.</p>
      <p id="p-00539-en" num="0558">The term âlinkerâ or âlinking groupâ means an organic moiety that connects two parts of a compound, e.g., covalently attaches two parts of a compound. Linkers typically comprise a direct bond or an atom such as oxygen or sulfur, a unit such as NR8, C(O), C(O)NH, SO, SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>NH or a chain of atoms, such as, but not limited to, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, arylalkynyl, heteroarylalkyl, heteroarylalkenyl, heteroarylalkynyl, heterocyclylalkyl, heterocyclylalkenyl, heterocyclylalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkylarylalkyl, alkylarylalkenyl, alkylarylalkynyl, alkenylarylalkyl, alkenylarylalkenyl, alkenylarylalkynyl, alkynylarylalkyl, alkynylarylalkenyl, alkynylarylalkynyl, alkylheteroarylalkyl, alkylheteroarylalkenyl, alkylheteroarylalkynyl, alkenylheteroarylalkyl, alkenylheteroarylalkenyl, alkenylheteroarylalkynyl, alkynylheteroarylalkyl, alkynylheteroarylalkenyl, alkynylheteroarylalkynyl, alkylheterocyclylalkyl, alkylheterocyclylalkenyl, alkylhererocyclylalkynyl, alkenylheterocyclylalkyl, alkenylheterocyclylalkenyl, alkenylheterocyclylalkynyl, alkynylheterocyclylalkyl, alkynylheterocyclylalkenyl, alkynylheterocyclylalkynyl, alkylaryl, alkenylaryl, alkynylaryl, alkylheteroaryl, alkenylheteroaryl, alkynylhereroaryl, which one or more methylenes can be interrupted or terminated by O, S, S(O), SO<sub>2</sub>, N(R8), C(O), substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic; where R8 is hydrogen, acyl, aliphatic or substituted aliphatic. In one embodiment, the linker is between about 1-24 atoms, 2-24, 3-24, 4-24, 5-24, 6-24, 6-18, 7-18, 8-18 atoms, 7-17, 8-17, 6-16, 7-16, or 8-16 atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00540-en" num="0559">A cleavable linking group is one which is sufficiently stable outside the cell, but which upon entry into a target cell is cleaved to release the two parts the linker is holding together. In a preferred embodiment, the cleavable linking group is cleaved at least about 10 times, 20, times, 30 times, 40 times, 50 times, 60 times, 70 times, 80 times, 90 times or more, or at least about 100 times faster in a target cell or under a first reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent intracellular conditions) than in the blood of a subject, or under a second reference condition (which can, e.g., be selected to mimic or represent conditions found in the blood or serum).</p>
      <p id="p-00541-en" num="0560">Cleavable linking groups are susceptible to cleavage agents, e.g., pH, redox potential or the presence of degradative molecules. Generally, cleavage agents are more prevalent or found at higher levels or activities inside cells than in serum or blood. Examples of such degradative agents include: redox agents which are selected for particular substrates or which have no substrate specificity, including, e.g., oxidative or reductive enzymes or reductive agents such as mercaptans, present in cells, that can degrade a redox cleavable linking group by reduction; esterases; endosomes or agents that can create an acidic environment, e.g., those that result in a pH of five or lower; enzymes that can hydrolyze or degrade an acid cleavable linking group by acting as a general acid, peptidases (which can be substrate specific), and phosphatases.</p>
      <p id="p-00542-en" num="0561">A cleavable linkage group, such as a disulfide bond can be susceptible to pH. The pH of human serum is 7.4, while the average intracellular pH is slightly lower, ranging from about 7.1-7.3. Endosomes have a more acidic pH, in the range of 5.5-6.0, and lysosomes have an even more acidic pH at around 5.0. Some linkers will have a cleavable linking group that is cleaved at a preferred pH, thereby releasing a cationic lipid from the ligand inside the cell, or into the desired compartment of the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00543-en" num="0562">A linker can include a cleavable linking group that is cleavable by a particular enzyme. The type of cleavable linking group incorporated into a linker can depend on the cell to be targeted. For example, a liver-targeting ligand can be linked to a cationic lipid through a linker that includes an ester group. Liver cells are rich in esterases, and therefore the linker will be cleaved more efficiently in liver cells than in cell types that are not esterase-rich. Other cell-types rich in esterases include cells of the lung, renal cortex, and testis.</p>
      <p id="p-00544-en" num="0563">Linkers that contain peptide bonds can be used when targeting cell types rich in peptidases, such as liver cells and synoviocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00545-en" num="0564">In general, the suitability of a candidate cleavable linking group can be evaluated by testing the ability of a degradative agent (or condition) to cleave the candidate linking group. It will also be desirable to also test the candidate cleavable linking group for the ability to resist cleavage in the blood or when in contact with other non-target tissue. Thus, one can determine the relative susceptibility to cleavage between a first and a second condition, where the first is selected to be indicative of cleavage in a target cell and the second is selected to be indicative of cleavage in other tissues or biological fluids, e.g., blood or serum. The evaluations can be carried out in cell free systems, in cells, in cell culture, in organ or tissue culture, or in whole animals. It can be useful to make initial evaluations in cell-free or culture conditions and to confirm by further evaluations in whole animals. In preferred embodiments, useful candidate compounds are cleaved at least about 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or about 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as compared to blood or serum (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions).</p>
      <p id="p-00546-en" num="0565">i. Redox Cleavable Linking Groups</p>
      <p id="p-00547-en" num="0566">In one embodiment, a cleavable linking group is a redox cleavable linking group that is cleaved upon reduction or oxidation. An example of reductively cleavable linking group is a disulphide linking group (âSâSâ). To determine if a candidate cleavable linking group is a suitable âreductively cleavable linking group,â or for example is suitable for use with a particular iRNA moiety and particular targeting agent one can look to methods described herein. For example, a candidate can be evaluated by incubation with dithiothreitol (DTT), or other reducing agent using reagents know in the art, which mimic the rate of cleavage which would be observed in a cell, e.g., a target cell. The candidates can also be evaluated under conditions which are selected to mimic blood or serum conditions. In one, candidate compounds are cleaved by at most about 10% in the blood. In other embodiments, useful candidate compounds are degraded at least about 2, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or about 100 times faster in the cell (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic intracellular conditions) as compared to blood (or under in vitro conditions selected to mimic extracellular conditions). The rate of cleavage of candidate compounds can be determined using standard enzyme kinetics assays under conditions chosen to mimic intracellular media and compared to conditions chosen to mimic extracellular media.</p>

      <p id="p-00551-en" num="0570">In another embodiment, a cleavable linker comprises an acid cleavable linking group. An acid cleavable linking group is a linking group that is cleaved under acidic conditions. In preferred embodiments acid cleavable linking groups are cleaved in an acidic environment with a pH of about 6.5 or lower (e.g., about 6.0, 5.75, 5.5, 5.25, 5.0, or lower), or by agents such as enzymes that can act as a general acid. In a cell, specific low pH organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes can provide a cleaving environment for acid cleavable linking groups. Examples of acid cleavable linking groups include but are not limited to hydrazones, esters, and esters of amino acids. Acid cleavable groups can have the general formula âCâNNâ, C(O)O, or âOC(O). A preferred embodiment is when the carbon attached to the oxygen of the ester (the alkoxy group) is an aryl group, substituted alkyl group, or tertiary alkyl group such as dimethyl pentyl or t-butyl.

A peptide-based cleavable linking group is cleaved by enzymes such as peptidases and proteases in cells. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups are peptide bonds formed between amino acids to yield oligopeptides (e.g., dipeptides, tripeptides etc.) and polypeptides. Peptide-based cleavable groups do not include the amide group (âC(O)NHâ). The amide group can be formed between any alkylene, alkenylene or alkynelene. A peptide bond is a special type of amide bond formed between amino acids to yield peptides and proteins. The peptide based cleavage group is generally limited to the peptide bond (i.e., the amide bond) formed between amino acids yielding peptides and proteins and does not include the entire amide functional group. Peptide-based cleavable linking groups have the general formula âNHCHRAC(O)NHCHRBC(O)â, where RA and RB are the R groups of the two adjacent amino acids.

      <p id="p-00571-en" num="0583">âChimericâ iRNA compounds or âchimeras,â in the context of this invention, are iRNA compounds, preferably dsRNAs, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of a dsRNA compound. These iRNAs typically contain at least one region wherein the RNA is modified so as to confer upon the iRNA increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the iRNA can serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of iRNA inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter iRNAs when chimeric dsRNAs are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxy dsRNAs hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00572-en" num="0584">In certain instances, the RNA of an iRNA can be modified by a non-ligand group. A number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to iRNAs in order to enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the iRNA, and procedures for performing such conjugations are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such as cholesterol (Kubo, T. et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.</i>, 2007, 365(1):54-61; Letsinger et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, </i>1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., </i>1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., <i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., </i>1992, 660:306; Manoharan et al., <i>Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let.</i>, 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res.</i>, 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., <i>EMBO J.</i>, 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., <i>FEBS Lett.</i>, 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et al., <i>Biochimie</i>, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethylammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., <i>Tetrahedron Lett</i>., 1995, 36:3651; Shea et al., <i>Nucl.

Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such RNA conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of an RNAs bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction can be performed either with the RNA still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the RNA, in solution phase. Purification of the RNA conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">IV. DELIVERY OF AN iRNA OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00573-en" num="0585">The delivery of an iRNA of the invention to a cell e.g., a cell within a subject, such as a human subject (e.g., a subject in need thereof, such as a subject having a complement component C5-associated disease) can be achieved in a number of different ways. For example, delivery may be performed by contacting a cell with an iRNA of the invention either in vitro or in vivo. In vivo delivery may also be performed directly by administering a composition comprising an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA, to a subject. Alternatively, in vivo delivery may be performed indirectly by administering one or more vectors that encode and direct the expression of the iRNA. These alternatives are discussed further below.</p>
      <p id="p-00574-en" num="0586">In general, any method of delivering a nucleic acid molecule (in vitro or in vivo) can be adapted for use with an iRNA of the invention (see e.g., Akhtar S. and Julian R L. (1992) <i>Trends Cell. Biol</i>. 2(5):139-144 and WO94/02595, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). For in vivo delivery, factors to consider in order to deliver an iRNA molecule include, for example, biological stability of the delivered molecule, prevention of non-specific effects, and accumulation of the delivered molecule in the target tissue. The non-specific effects of an iRNA can be minimized by local administration, for example, by direct injection or implantation into a tissue or topically administering the preparation. Local administration to a treatment site maximizes local concentration of the agent, limits the exposure of the agent to systemic tissues that can otherwise be harmed by the agent or that can degrade the agent, and permits a lower total dose of the iRNA molecule to be administered. Several studies have shown successful knockdown of gene products when an iRNA is administered locally. For example, intraocular delivery of a VEGF dsRNA by intravitreal injection in cynomolgus monkeys (Tolentino, M J., et al (2004) <i>Retina </i>24:132-138) and subretinal injections in mice (Reich, S J., et al (2003) <i>Mol. Vis. </i>9:210-216) were both shown to prevent neovascularization in an experimental model of age-related macular degeneration. In addition, direct intratumoral injection of a dsRNA in mice reduces tumor volume (Pille, J., et al (2005) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>11:267-274) and can prolong survival of tumor-bearing mice (Kim, W J., et al (2006) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>14:343-350; Li, S., et al (2007) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>15:515-523). RNA interference has also shown success with local delivery to the CNS by direct injection (Dorn, G., et al. (2004) <i>Nucleic Acids </i>32:e49; Tan, P H., et al (2005) <i>Gene Ther. </i>12:59-66; Makimura, H., et al (2002) <i>BMC Neurosci. </i>3:18; Shishkina, G T., et al (2004) <i>Neuroscience </i>129:521-528; Thakker, E R., et al (2004) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>101:17270-17275; Akaneya, Y., et al (2005) <i>J. Neurophysiol</i>. 93:594-602) and to the lungs by intranasal administration (Howard, K A., et al (2006) <i>Mol. Ther. </i>14:476-484; Zhang, X., et al (2004) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>279:10677-10684; Bitko, V., et al (2005) <i>Nat. Med. </i>11:50-55). For administering an iRNA systemically for the treatment of a disease, the RNA can be modified or alternatively delivered using a drug delivery system; both methods act to prevent the rapid degradation of the dsRNA by endo- and exo-nucleases in vivo. Modification of the RNA or the pharmaceutical carrier can also permit targeting of the iRNA composition to the target tissue and avoid undesirable off-target effects. iRNA molecules can be modified by chemical conjugation to lipophilic groups such as cholesterol to enhance cellular uptake and prevent degradation. For example, an iRNA directed against ApoB conjugated to a lipophilic cholesterol moiety was injected systemically into mice and resulted in knockdown of apoB mRNA in both the liver and jejunum (Soutschek, J., et al (2004) <i>Nature </i>432:173-178). Conjugation of an iRNA to an aptamer has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and mediate tumor regression in a mouse model of prostate cancer (McNamara, J O., et al (2006) <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>24:1005-1015). In an alternative embodiment, the iRNA can be delivered using drug delivery systems such as a nanoparticle, a dendrimer, a polymer, liposomes, or a cationic delivery system. Positively charged cationic delivery systems facilitate binding of an iRNA molecule (negatively charged) and also enhance interactions at the negatively charged cell membrane to permit efficient uptake of an iRNA by the cell. Cationic lipids, dendrimers, or polymers can either be bound to an iRNA, or induced to form a vesicle or micelle (see e.g., Kim S H., et al (2008) <i>Journal of Controlled Release </i>129(2):107-116) that encases an iRNA. The formation of vesicles or micelles further prevents degradation of the iRNA when administered systemically. Methods for making and administering cationic-iRNA complexes are well within the abilities of one skilled in the art (see e.g., Sorensen, D R., et al (2003) <i>J. Mol. Biol </i>327:761-766; Verma, U N., et al (2003) <i>Clin. Cancer Res. </i>9:1291-1300; Arnold, A S et al (2007) <i>J. Hypertens. </i>25:197-205, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Some non-limiting examples of drug delivery systems useful for systemic delivery of iRNAs include DOTAP (Sorensen, D R., et al (2003), supra; Verma, U N., et al (2003), supra), Oligofectamine, âsolid nucleic acid lipid particlesâ (Zimmermann, T S., et al (2006) <i>Nature </i>441:111-114), cardiolipin (Chien, P Y., et al (2005) <i>Cancer Gene Ther. </i>12:321-328; Pal, A., et al (2005) <i>Int J. Oncol. </i>26:1087-1091), polyethyleneimine (Bonnet M E., et al (2008) <i>Pharm. Res</i>. August 16 Epub ahead of print; Aigner, A. (2006) <i>J. Biomed. Biotechnol. </i>71659), Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides (Liu, S. (2006) <i>Mol. Pharm</i>. 3:472-487), and polyamidoamines (Tomalia, D A., et al (2007) <i>Biochem. Soc. Trans</i>. 35:61-67; Yoo, H., et al (1999) <i>Pharm. Res. </i>16:1799-1804). In some embodiments, an iRNA forms a complex with cyclodextrin for systemic administration.

      <p id="p-00575-en" num="0587">A. Vector encoded iRNAs of the Invention iRNA targeting the C5 gene can be expressed from transcription units inserted into DNA or RNA vectors (see, e.g., Couture, A, et al., <i>TIG</i>. (1996), 12:5-10; Skillern, A., et al., International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22113, Conrad, International PCT Publication No. WO 00/22114, and Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,299). Expression can be transient (on the order of hours to weeks) or sustained (weeks to months or longer), depending upon the specific construct used and the target tissue or cell type. These transgenes can be introduced as a linear construct, a circular plasmid, or a viral vector, which can be an integrating or non-integrating vector. The transgene can also be constructed to permit it to be inherited as an extrachromosomal plasmid (Gassmann, et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>(1995) 92:1292).</p>
      <p id="p-00576-en" num="0588">The individual strand or strands of an iRNA can be transcribed from a promoter on an expression vector. Where two separate strands are to be expressed to generate, for example, a dsRNA, two separate expression vectors can be co-introduced (e.g., by transfection or infection) into a target cell. Alternatively each individual strand of a dsRNA can be transcribed by promoters both of which are located on the same expression plasmid. In one embodiment, a dsRNA is expressed as inverted repeat polynucleotides joined by a linker polynucleotide sequence such that the dsRNA has a stem and loop structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00577-en" num="0589">iRNA expression vectors are generally DNA plasmids or viral vectors. Expression vectors compatible with eukaryotic cells, preferably those compatible with vertebrate cells, can be used to produce recombinant constructs for the expression of an iRNA as described herein. Eukaryotic cell expression vectors are well known in the art and are available from a number of commercial sources. Typically, such vectors are provided containing convenient restriction sites for insertion of the desired nucleic acid segment. Delivery of iRNA expressing vectors can be systemic, such as by intravenous or intramuscular administration, by administration to target cells ex-planted from the patient followed by reintroduction into the patient, or by any other means that allows for introduction into a desired target cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00578-en" num="0590">iRNA expression plasmids can be transfected into target cells as a complex with cationic lipid carriers (e.g., Oligofectamine) or non-cationic lipid-based carriers (e.g., Transit-TKOâ¢). Multiple lipid transfections for iRNA-mediated knockdowns targeting different regions of a target RNA over a period of a week or more are also contemplated by the invention. Successful introduction of vectors into host cells can be monitored using various known methods. For example, transient transfection can be signaled with a reporter, such as a fluorescent marker, such as Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Stable transfection of cells ex vivo can be ensured using markers that provide the transfected cell with resistance to specific environmental factors (e.g., antibiotics and drugs), such as hygromycin B resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00579-en" num="0591">Viral vector systems which can be utilized with the methods and compositions described herein include, but are not limited to, (a) adenovirus vectors; (b) retrovirus vectors, including but not limited to lentiviral vectors, moloney murine leukemia virus, etc.; (c) adeno-associated virus vectors; (d) herpes simplex virus vectors; (e) SV 40 vectors; (f) polyoma virus vectors; (g) papilloma virus vectors; (h) picornavirus vectors; (i) pox virus vectors such as an orthopox, e.g., vaccinia virus vectors or avipox, e.g. canary pox or fowl pox; and (j) a helper-dependent or gutless adenovirus. Replication-defective viruses can also be advantageous. Different vectors will or will not become incorporated into the cells' genome. The constructs can include viral sequences for transfection, if desired. Alternatively, the construct can be incorporated into vectors capable of episomal replication, e.g. EPV and EBV vectors. Constructs for the recombinant expression of an iRNA will generally require regulatory elements, e.g., promoters, enhancers, etc., to ensure the expression of the iRNA in target cells. Other aspects to consider for vectors and constructs are further described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00580-en" num="0592">Vectors useful for the delivery of an iRNA will include regulatory elements (promoter, enhancer, etc.) sufficient for expression of the iRNA in the desired target cell or tissue. The regulatory elements can be chosen to provide either constitutive or regulated/inducible expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00581-en" num="0593">Expression of the iRNA can be precisely regulated, for example, by using an inducible regulatory sequence that is sensitive to certain physiological regulators, e.g., circulating glucose levels, or hormones (Docherty et al., 1994<i>, FASEB J. </i>8:20-24). Such inducible expression systems, suitable for the control of dsRNA expression in cells or in mammals include, for example, regulation by ecdysone, by estrogen, progesterone, tetracycline, chemical inducers of dimerization, and isopropyl-beta-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). A person skilled in the art would be able to choose the appropriate regulatory/promoter sequence based on the intended use of the iRNA transgene.</p>
      <p id="p-00582-en" num="0594">Viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding an iRNA can be used. For example, a retroviral vector can be used (see Miller et al., <i>Meth. Enzymol. </i>217:581-599 (1993)). These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding an iRNA are cloned into one or more vectors, which facilitate delivery of the nucleic acid into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found, for example, in Boesen et al., <i>Biotherapy </i>6:291-302 (1994), which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are: Clowes et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>93:644-651 (1994); Kiem et al., <i>Blood </i>83:1467-1473 (1994); Salmons and Gunzberg, <i>Human Gene Therapy </i>4:129-141 (1993); and Grossman and Wilson, <i>Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. </i>3:110-114 (1993). Lentiviral vectors contemplated for use include, for example, the HIV based vectors described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,143,520; 5,665,557; and 5,981,276, which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00583-en" num="0595">Adenoviruses are also contemplated for use in delivery of iRNAs of the invention. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles, e.g., for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus-based delivery systems are liver, the central nervous system, endothelial cells, and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non-dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson, <i>Current Opinion in Genetics and Development </i>3:499-503 (1993) present a review of adenovirus-based gene therapy. Bout et al., <i>Human Gene Therapy </i>5:3-10 (1994) demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al., <i>Science </i>252:431-434 (1991); Rosenfeld et al., <i>Cell </i>68:143-155 (1992); Mastrangeli et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>91:225-234 (1993); PCT Publication WO94/12649; and Wang, et al., <i>Gene Therapy </i>2:775-783 (1995). A suitable AV vector for expressing an iRNA featured in the invention, a method for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and a method for delivering the vector into target cells, are described in Xia H et al. (2002), <i>Nat. Biotech. </i>20: 1006-1010.</p>
      <p id="p-00584-en" num="0596">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors may also be used to delivery an iRNA of the invention (Walsh et al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204:289-300 (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,436,146). In one embodiment, the iRNA can be expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant AAV vector having, for example, either the U6 or H1 RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Suitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, methods for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described in Samulski R et al. (1987), <i>J. Virol. </i>61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), <i>J. Virol</i>, 70: 520-532; Samulski R et al. (1989), <i>J. Virol. </i>63: 3822-3826; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479; U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,941; International Patent Application No. WO 94/13788; and International Patent Application No. WO 93/24641, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00585-en" num="0597">Another viral vector suitable for delivery of an iRNA of the inevtion is a pox virus such as a vaccinia virus, for example an attenuated vaccinia such as Modified Virus Ankara (MVA) or NYVAC, an avipox such as fowl pox or canary pox.</p>
      <p id="p-00586-en" num="0598">The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins, as appropriate. For example, lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors can be made to target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes; see, e.g., Rabinowitz J E et al. (2002), <i>J Virol </i>76:791-801, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00587-en" num="0599">The pharmaceutical preparation of a vector can include the vector in an acceptable diluent, or can include a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is imbedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery vector can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can include one or more cells which produce the gene delivery system.</p>

      <p id="p-00588-en" num="0600">The present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations which include the iRNAs of the invention. In one embodiment, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions containing an iRNA, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00589-en" num="0601">The phrase âpharmaceutically acceptableâ is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human subjects and animal subjects without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00590-en" num="0602">The phrase âpharmaceutically-acceptable carrierâ as used herein means a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, or steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be âacceptableâ in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the subject being treated. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) lubricating agents, such as magnesium state, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) pH buffered solutions; (21) polyesters, polycarbonates and/or polyanhydrides; (22) bulking agents, such as polypeptides and amino acids (23) serum component, such as serum albumin, HDL and LDL; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.</p>
      <p id="p-00591-en" num="0603">The pharmaceutical compositions containing the iRNA are useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of a C5 gene, e.g. a complement component C5-associated disease. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery, e.g., by subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) delivery. Another example is compositions that are formulated for direct delivery into the brain parenchyma, e.g., by infusion into the brain, such as by continuous pump infusion. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of a C5 gene. In general, a suitable dose of an iRNA of the invention will be in the range of about 0.001 to about 200.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of about 1 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, the dsRNA can be administered at about 0.01 mg/kg, about 0.05 mg/kg, about 0.5 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg, about 1.5 mg/kg, about 2 mg/kg, about 3 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg, about 20 mg/kg, about 30 mg/kg, about 40 mg/kg, or about 50 mg/kg per single dose.</p>

      <p id="p-00607-en" num="0619">A. iRNA Formulations Comprising Membranous Molecular Assemblies</p>
      <p id="p-00608-en" num="0620">An iRNA for use in the compositions and methods of the invention can be formulated for delivery in a membranous molecular assembly, e.g., a liposome or a micelle. As used herein, the term âliposomeâ refers to a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in at least one bilayer, e.g., one bilayer or a plurality of bilayers. Liposomes include unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles that have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior. The aqueous portion contains the iRNA composition. The lipophilic material isolates the aqueous interior from an aqueous exterior, which typically does not include the iRNA composition, although in some examples, it may. Liposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomal bilayer fuses with bilayer of the cellular membranes. As the merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the internal aqueous contents that include the iRNA are delivered into the cell where the iRNA can specifically bind to a target RNA and can mediate RNAi. In some cases the liposomes are also specifically targeted, e.g., to direct the iRNA to particular cell types.</p>
      <p id="p-00609-en" num="0621">A liposome containing a RNAi agent can be prepared by a variety of methods. In one example, the lipid component of a liposome is dissolved in a detergent so that micelles are formed with the lipid component. For example, the lipid component can be an amphipathic cationic lipid or lipid conjugate. The detergent can have a high critical micelle concentration and may be nonionic. Exemplary detergents include cholate, CHAPS, octylglucoside, deoxycholate, and lauroyl sarcosine. The RNAi agent preparation is then added to the micelles that include the lipid component. The cationic groups on the lipid interact with the RNAi agent and condense around the RNAi agent to form a liposome. After condensation, the detergent is removed, e.g., by dialysis, to yield a liposomal preparation of RNAi agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00610-en" num="0622">If necessary a carrier compound that assists in condensation can be added during the condensation reaction, e.g., by controlled addition. For example, the carrier compound can be a polymer other than a nucleic acid (e.g., spermine or spermidine). pH can also adjusted to favor condensation.</p>
      <p id="p-00611-en" num="0623">Methods for producing stable polynucleotide delivery vehicles, which incorporate a polynucleotide/cationic lipid complex as structural components of the delivery vehicle, are further described in, e.g., WO 96/37194, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Liposome formation can also include one or more aspects of exemplary methods described in Felgner, P. L. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>8:7413-7417, 1987; U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,355; U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,678; Bangham, et al. <i>M. Mol. Biol. </i>23:238, 1965; Olson, et al. <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>557:9, 1979; Szoka, et al. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>75: 4194, 1978; Mayhew, et al. <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>775:169, 1984; Kim, et al. <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>728:339, 1983; and Fukunaga, et al. <i>Endocrinol</i>. 115:757, 1984. Commonly used techniques for preparing lipid aggregates of appropriate size for use as delivery vehicles include sonication and freeze-thaw plus extrusion (see, e.g., Mayer, et al. <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>858:161, 1986). Microfluidization can be used when consistently small (50 to 200 nm) and relatively uniform aggregates are desired (Mayhew, et al. <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>775:169, 1984). These methods are readily adapted to packaging RNAi agent preparations into liposomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00612-en" num="0624">Liposomes fall into two broad classes. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged nucleic acid molecules to form a stable complex. The positively charged nucleic acid/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., </i>1987, 147, 980-985).</p>
      <p id="p-00613-en" num="0625">Liposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, entrap nucleic acids rather than complex with it. Since both the nucleic acid and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some nucleic acid is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver nucleic acids encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (Zhou et al., <i>Journal of Controlled Release, </i>1992, 19, 269-274).</p>
      <p id="p-00614-en" num="0626">One major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived phosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.</p>

      <p id="p-00616-en" num="0628">Non-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising Novasomeâ¢ I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasomeâ¢ II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporine A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. <i>S.T.P.Pharma.

      <p id="p-00617-en" num="0629">Liposomes also include âsterically stabilizedâ liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) comprises one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside G<sub>M1</sub>, or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al., <i>FEBS Letters, </i>1987, 223, 42; Wu et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>1993, 53, 3765).</p>
      <p id="p-00618-en" num="0630">Various liposomes comprising one or more glycolipids are known in the art. Papahadjopoulos et al. (<i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., </i>1987, 507, 64) reported the ability of monosialoganglioside G<sub>M1</sub>, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of liposomes.

No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses liposomes comprising sphingomyelin. Liposomes comprising 1,2-sn-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lim et al).</p>
      <p id="p-00619-en" num="0631">In one embodiment, cationic liposomes are used. Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell membrane. Non-cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as efficiently with the plasma membrane, are taken up by macrophages in vivo and can be used to deliver RNAi agents to macrophages.</p>
      <p id="p-00620-en" num="0632">Further advantages of liposomes include: liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated RNAi agents in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in âPharmaceutical Dosage Forms,â Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, volume 1, p. 245). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00621-en" num="0633">A positively charged synthetic cationic lipid, N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) can be used to form small liposomes that interact spontaneously with nucleic acid to form lipid-nucleic acid complexes which are capable of fusing with the negatively charged lipids of the cell membranes of tissue culture cells, resulting in delivery of RNAi agent (see, e.g., Felgner, P. L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 8:7413-7417, 1987 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,897,355 for a description of DOTMA and its use with DNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00622-en" num="0634">A DOTMA analogue, 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3-(trimethylammonia)propane (DOTAP) can be used in combination with a phospholipid to form DNA-complexing vesicles. Lipofectinâ¢ Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.) is an effective agent for the delivery of highly anionic nucleic acids into living tissue culture cells that comprise positively charged DOTMA liposomes which interact spontaneously with negatively charged polynucleotides to form complexes. When enough positively charged liposomes are used, the net charge on the resulting complexes is also positive. Positively charged complexes prepared in this way spontaneously attach to negatively charged cell surfaces, fuse with the plasma membrane, and efficiently deliver functional nucleic acids into, for example, tissue culture cells. Another commercially available cationic lipid, 1,2-bis(oleoyloxy)-3,3-(trimethylammonia)propane (âDOTAPâ) (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.) differs from DOTMA in that the oleoyl moieties are linked by ester, rather than ether linkages.</p>
      <p id="p-00623-en" num="0635">Other reported cationic lipid compounds include those that have been conjugated to a variety of moieties including, for example, carboxyspermine which has been conjugated to one of two types of lipids and includes compounds such as 5-carboxyspermylglycine dioctaoleoylamide (âDOGSâ) (Transfectamâ¢, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine 5-carboxyspermyl-amide (âDPPESâ) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,678).</p>
      <p id="p-00624-en" num="0636">Another cationic lipid conjugate includes derivatization of the lipid with cholesterol (âDC-Cholâ) which has been formulated into liposomes in combination with DOPE (See, Gao, X. and Huang, L., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>179:280, 1991). Lipopolylysine, made by conjugating polylysine to DOPE, has been reported to be effective for transfection in the presence of serum (Zhou, X. et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1065:8, 1991). For certain cell lines, these liposomes containing conjugated cationic lipids, are said to exhibit lower toxicity and provide more efficient transfection than the DOTMA-containing compositions. Other commercially available cationic lipid products include DMRIE and DMRIE-HP (Vical, La Jolla, Calif.) and Lipofectamine (DOSPA) (Life Technology, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Other cationic lipids suitable for the delivery of oligonucleotides are described in WO 98/39359 and WO 96/37194.</p>
      <p id="p-00625-en" num="0637">Liposomal formulations are particularly suited for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer RNAi agent into the skin. In some implementations, liposomes are used for delivering RNAi agent to epidermal cells and also to enhance the penetration of RNAi agent into dermal tissues, e.g., into skin. For example, the liposomes can be applied topically. Topical delivery of drugs formulated as liposomes to the skin has been documented (see, e.g., Weiner et al., <i>Journal of Drug Targeting</i>, 1992, vol. 2, 405-410 and du Plessis et al., <i>Antiviral Research, </i>18, 1992, 259-265; Mannino, R.

      <p id="p-00626-en" num="0638">Non-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems comprising non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations comprising Novasome I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver a drug into the dermis of mouse skin. Such formulations with RNAi agent are useful for treating a dermatological disorder.</p>
      <p id="p-00627-en" num="0639">Liposomes that include iRNA can be made highly deformable. Such deformability can enable the liposomes to penetrate through pore that are smaller than the average radius of the liposome. For example, transfersomes are a type of deformable liposomes. Transferosomes can be made by adding surface edge activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes that include RNAi agent can be delivered, for example, subcutaneously by infection in order to deliver RNAi agent to keratinocytes in the skin. In order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient. In addition, due to the lipid properties, these transferosomes can be self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores, e.g., in the skin), self-repairing, and can frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading.</p>
      <p id="p-00628-en" num="0640">Other formulations amenable to the present invention are described in U.S. provisional application Ser.

PCT application no PCT/US2007/080331, filed Oct. 3, 2007 also describes formulations that are amenable to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00629-en" num="0641">Transfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes can be described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, e.g., they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.</p>
      <p id="p-00630-en" num="0642">Surfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the âheadâ) provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger, in âPharmaceutical Dosage Formsâ, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).</p>
      <p id="p-00631-en" num="0643">If the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.</p>
      <p id="p-00632-en" num="0644">If the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.</p>
      <p id="p-00633-en" num="0645">If the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.</p>
      <p id="p-00634-en" num="0646">If the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.</p>
      <p id="p-00635-en" num="0647">The use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (Rieger, in âPharmaceutical Dosage Formsâ, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).</p>
      <p id="p-00636-en" num="0648">The iRNA for use in the methods of the invention can also be provided as micellar formulations. âMicellesâ are defined herein as a particular type of molecular assembly in which amphipathic molecules are arranged in a spherical structure such that all the hydrophobic portions of the molecules are directed inward, leaving the hydrophilic portions in contact with the surrounding aqueous phase. The converse arrangement exists if the environment is hydrophobic.</p>
      <p id="p-00637-en" num="0649">A mixed micellar formulation suitable for delivery through transdermal membranes may be prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the siRNA composition, an alkali metal C<sub>8 </sub>to C<sub>22 </sub>alkyl sulphate, and a micelle forming compounds.

The micelle forming compounds may be added at the same time or after addition of the alkali metal alkyl sulphate. Mixed micelles will form with substantially any kind of mixing of the ingredients but vigorous mixing in order to provide smaller size micelles.</p>
      <p id="p-00638-en" num="0650">In one method a first micellar composition is prepared which contains the siRNA composition and at least the alkali metal alkyl sulphate. The first micellar composition is then mixed with at least three micelle forming compounds to form a mixed micellar composition. In another method, the micellar composition is prepared by mixing the siRNA composition, the alkali metal alkyl sulphate and at least one of the micelle forming compounds, followed by addition of the remaining micelle forming compounds, with vigorous mixing.</p>
      <p id="p-00639-en" num="0651">Phenol and/or m-cresol may be added to the mixed micellar composition to stabilize the formulation and protect against bacterial growth. Alternatively, phenol and/or m-cresol may be added with the micelle forming ingredients. An isotonic agent such as glycerin may also be added after formation of the mixed micellar composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00640-en" num="0652">For delivery of the micellar formulation as a spray, the formulation can be put into an aerosol dispenser and the dispenser is charged with a propellant. The propellant, which is under pressure, is in liquid form in the dispenser. The ratios of the ingredients are adjusted so that the aqueous and propellant phases become one, i.e., there is one phase. If there are two phases, it is necessary to shake the dispenser prior to dispensing a portion of the contents, e.g., through a metered valve. The dispensed dose of pharmaceutical agent is propelled from the metered valve in a fine spray.</p>
      <p id="p-00641-en" num="0653">Propellants may include hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbons, hydrogen-containing fluorocarbons, dimethyl ether and diethyl ether. In certain embodiments, HFA 134a (1,1,1,2 tetrafluoroethane) may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00642-en" num="0654">The specific concentrations of the essential ingredients can be determined by relatively straightforward experimentation. For absorption through the oral cavities, it is often desirable to increase, e.g., at least double or triple, the dosage for through injection or administration through the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

      <p id="p-00645-en" num="0657">As used herein, the term âLNPâ refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle. LNPs typically contain a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle (e.g., a PEG-lipid conjugate). LNPs are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection and accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site). LNPs include âpSPLP,â which include an encapsulated condensing agent-nucleic acid complex as set forth in PCT Publication No. WO 00/03683. The particles of the present invention typically have a mean diameter of about 50 nm to about 150 nm, more typically about 60 nm to about 130 nm, more typically about 70 nm to about 110 nm, most typically about 70 nm to about 90 nm, and are substantially nontoxic.

      <p id="p-00684-en" num="0687">Formulations prepared by either the standard or extrusion-free method can be characterized in similar manners. For example, formulations are typically characterized by visual inspection. They should be whitish translucent solutions free from aggregates or sediment. Particle size and particle size distribution of lipid-nanoparticles can be measured by light scattering using, for example, a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). Particles should be about 20-300 nm, such as 40-100 nm in size. The particle size distribution should be unimodal. The total dsRNA concentration in the formulation, as well as the entrapped fraction, is estimated using a dye exclusion assay. A sample of the formulated dsRNA can be incubated with an RNA-binding dye, such as Ribogreen (Molecular Probes) in the presence or absence of a formulation disrupting surfactant, e.g., 0.5% Triton-X100. The total dsRNA in the formulation can be determined by the signal from the sample containing the surfactant, relative to a standard curve. The entrapped fraction is determined by subtracting the âfreeâ dsRNA content (as measured by the signal in the absence of surfactant) from the total dsRNA content. Percent entrapped dsRNA is typically &gt;85%. For SNALP formulation, the particle size is at least 30 nm, at least 40 nm, at least 50 nm, at least 60 nm, at least 70 nm, at least 80 nm, at least 90 nm, at least 100 nm, at least 110 nm, and at least 120 nm. The suitable range is typically about at least 50 nm to about at least 110 nm, about at least 60 nm to about at least 100 nm, or about at least 80 nm to about at least 90 nm.</p>

      <p id="p-00691-en" num="0694">i. Emulsions</p>
      <p id="p-00692-en" num="0695">The compositions of the present invention can be prepared and formulated as emulsions. Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 Î¼m in diameter (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., Volume 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems comprising two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions can be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions can contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug which can be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants can also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions can also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.</p>
      <p id="p-00693-en" num="0696">Emulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of the phases of the emulsion can be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that can be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers can broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).</p>
      <p id="p-00694-en" num="0697">Synthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, volume 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants can be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y. Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 285).</p>
      <p id="p-00695-en" num="0698">Naturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.</p>
      <p id="p-00696-en" num="0699">A large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199).</p>
      <p id="p-00697-en" num="0700">Hydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00698-en" num="0701">Since emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that can readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used can be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.</p>
      <p id="p-00699-en" num="0702">The application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 199). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions.</p>
      <p id="p-00700-en" num="0703">ii. Microemulsions</p>
      <p id="p-00701-en" num="0704">In one embodiment of the present invention, the compositions of iRNAs and nucleic acids are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion can be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245). Typically microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215).</p>
      <p id="p-00702-en" num="0705">Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (Schott, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 271).</p>
      <p id="p-00703-en" num="0706">The phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (see e.g., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Allen, L V., Popovich N G., and Ansel H C., 2004, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins (8th ed.), New York, N.Y.; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 245; Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., volume 1, p. 335). Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00704-en" num="0707">Surfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (MO750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DAO750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions can, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase can typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The oil phase can include, but is not limited to, materials such as Captex 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00705-en" num="0708">Microemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,191,105; 7,063,860; 7,070,802; 7,157,099; Constantinides et al., <i>Pharmaceutical Research, </i>1994, 11, 1385-1390; Ritschel, <i>Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., </i>1993, 13, 205). Microemulsions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,191,105; 7,063,860; 7,070,802; 7,157,099; Constantinides et al., <i>Pharmaceutical Research, </i>1994, 11, 1385; Ho et al., <i>J. Pharm. Sci., </i>1996, 85, 138-143). Often microemulsions can form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature. This can be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or iRNAs. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that the microemulsion compositions and formulations of the present invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of iRNAs and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of iRNAs and nucleic acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00706-en" num="0709">Microemulsions of the present invention can also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the iRNAs and nucleic acids of the present invention. Penetration enhancers used in the microemulsions of the present invention can be classified as belonging to one of five broad categoriesâsurfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., <i>Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, </i>1991, p. 92). Each of these classes has been discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00707-en" num="0710">iii. Microparticles</p>
      <p id="p-00708-en" num="0711">an RNAi agent of the invention may be incorporated into a particle, e.g., a microparticle. Microparticles can be produced by spray-drying, but may also be produced by other methods including lyophilization, evaporation, fluid bed drying, vacuum drying, or a combination of these techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00709-en" num="0712">iv. Penetration Enhancers</p>
      <p id="p-00710-en" num="0713">In one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly iRNAs, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs can cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00711-en" num="0714">Penetration enhancers can be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, N.Y., 2002; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of the above mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00712-en" num="0715">Surfactants (or âsurface-active agentsâ) are chemical entities which, when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of iRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, N.Y., 2002; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al., <i>J. Pharm. Pharmacol</i>., 1988, 40, 252).</p>
      <p id="p-00713-en" num="0716">Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, C<sub>1-20 </sub>alkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono- and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (see e.g., Touitou, E., et al. Enhancement in Drug Delivery, CRC Press, Danvers, Mass., 2006; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; El Hariri et al., <i>J. Pharm. Pharmacol., </i>1992, 44, 651-654).</p>
      <p id="p-00714-en" num="0717">The physiological role of bile includes the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, N.Y., 2002; Brunton, Chapter 38 in: Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al. Eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, pp. 934-935). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus the term âbile saltsâ includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. Suitable bile salts include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (see e.g., Malmsten, M. Surfactants and polymers in drug delivery, Informa Health Care, New York, N.Y., 2002; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Swinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Yamamoto et al., <i>J.

      <p id="p-00715-en" num="0718">Chelating agents, as used in connection with the present invention, can be defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of iRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as penetration enhancers in the present invention, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, <i>J. Chromatogr., </i>1993, 618, 315-339). Suitable chelating agents include but are not limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines)(see e.g., Katdare, A. et al., Excipient development for pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and drug delivery, CRC Press, Danvers, Mass., 2006; Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Buur et al., <i>J.

      <p id="p-00716-en" num="0719">As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of iRNAs through the alimentary mucosa (see e.g., Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33). This class of penetration enhancers includes, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., <i>J.

      <p id="p-00720-en" num="0723">Certain compositions of the present invention also incorporate carrier compounds in the formulation. As used herein, âcarrier compoundâ or âcarrierâ can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se) but is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation. The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor. For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate dsRNA in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4â²isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid (Miyao et al., DsRNA Res.

The excipient can be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc).</p>

      <p id="p-00727-en" num="0730">The compositions of the present invention can additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions can contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or can contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions of the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions of the present invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.</p>

Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to an anti-inflammatory agent, anti-steatosis agent, anti-viral, and/or anti-fibrosis agent. In addition, other substances commonly used to protect the liver, such as silymarin, can also be used in conjunction with the iRNAs described herein. Other agents useful for treating liver diseases include telbivudine, entecavir, and protease inhibitors such as telaprevir and other disclosed, for example, in Tung et al., U.S. Application Publication Nos. 2005/0148548, 2004/0167116, and 2003/0144217; and in Hale et al., U.S. Application Publication No. 2004/0127488.</p>
      <p id="p-00730-en" num="0733">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00731-en" num="0734">The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured herein in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>
      <p id="p-00732-en" num="0735">In addition to their administration, as discussed above, the iRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by C5 expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of iRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00733-en" num="0736">The present invention provides methods of inhibiting expression of C5 in a cell. The methods include contacting a cell with an RNAi agent, e.g., a double stranded RNAi agent, in an amount effective to inhibit expression of the C5 in the cell, thereby inhibiting expression of the C5 in the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00734-en" num="0737">Contacting of a cell with a double stranded RNAi agent may be done in vitro or in vivo. Contacting a cell in vivo with the RNAi agent includes contacting a cell or group of cells within a subject, e.g., a human subject, with the RNAi agent. Combinations of in vitro and in vivo methods of contacting are also possible. Contacting may be direct or indirect, as discussed above. Furthermore, contacting a cell may be accomplished via a targeting ligand, including any ligand described herein or known in the art. In preferred embodiments, the targeting ligand is a carbohydrate moiety, e.g., a GalNAc<sub>3 </sub>ligand, or any other ligand that directs the RNAi agent to a site of interest, e.g., the liver of a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00735-en" num="0738">The term âinhibiting,â as used herein, is used interchangeably with âreducing,â âsilencing,â âdownregulatingâ and other similar terms, and includes any level of inhibition.</p>
      <p id="p-00736-en" num="0739">The phrase âinhibiting expression of a C5â is intended to refer to inhibition of expression of any C5 gene (such as, e.g., a mouse C5 gene, a rat C5 gene, a monkey C5 gene, or a human C5 gene) as well as variants or mutants of a C5 gene. Thus, the C5 gene may be a wild-type C5 gene, a mutant C5 gene, or a transgenic C5 gene in the context of a genetically manipulated cell, group of cells, or organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00737-en" num="0740">âInhibiting expression of a C5 geneâ includes any level of inhibition of a C5 gene, e.g., at least partial suppression of the expression of a C5 gene. The expression of the C5 gene may be assessed based on the level, or the change in the level, of any variable associated with C5 gene expression, e.g., C5 mRNA level, C5 protein level, or for example, CH<sub>50 </sub>activity as a measure of total hemolytic complement, AH<sub>50 </sub>to measure the hemolytic activity of the alternate pathway of complement, and/or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels as a measure of intravascular hemolysis, and/or hemoglobin levels. Levels of C5a, C5b, and soluble C5b-9 complex may also be measured to assess C5 expression. This level may be assessed in an individual cell or in a group of cells, including, for example, a sample derived from a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00738-en" num="0741">Inhibition may be assessed by a decrease in an absolute or relative level of one or more variables that are associated with C5 expression compared with a control level. The control level may be any type of control level that is utilized in the art, e.g., a pre-dose baseline level, or a level determined from a similar subject, cell, or sample that is untreated or treated with a control (such as, e.g., buffer only control or inactive agent control).</p>
      <p id="p-00739-en" num="0742">In some embodiments of the methods of the invention, expression of a C5 gene is inhibited by at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 91%, at least about 92%, at least about 93%, at least about 94%. at least about 95%, at least about 96%, at least about 97%, at least about 98%, or at least about 99%.</p>
      <p id="p-00740-en" num="0743">Inhibition of the expression of a C5 gene may be manifested by a reduction of the amount of mRNA expressed by a first cell or group of cells (such cells may be present, for example, in a sample derived from a subject) in which a C5 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated (e.g., by contacting the cell or cells with an RNAi agent of the invention, or by administering an RNAi agent of the invention to a subject in which the cells are or were present) such that the expression of a C5 gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has not or have not been so treated (control cell(s)). In preferred embodiments, the inhibition is assessed by expressing the level of mRNA in treated cells as a percentage of the level of mRNA in control cells, using the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00742-en" num="0744">Alternatively, inhibition of the expression of a C5 gene may be assessed in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to C5 gene expression, e.g., C5 protein expression, hepcidin gene or protein expression, or iron levels in tissues or serum. C5 gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing C5, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any assay known in the art. The liver is the major site of C5 expression.

As explained above for the assessment of mRNA suppression, the inhibition of protein expression levels in a treated cell or group of cells may similarly be expressed as a percentage of the level of protein in a control cell or group of cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00744-en" num="0746">A control cell or group of cells that may be used to assess the inhibition of the expression of a C5 gene includes a cell or group of cells that has not yet been contacted with an RNAi agent of the invention. For example, the control cell or group of cells may be derived from an individual subject (e.g., a human or animal subject) prior to treatment of the subject with an RNAi agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00745-en" num="0747">The level of C5 mRNA that is expressed by a cell or group of cells may be determined using any method known in the art for assessing mRNA expression. In one embodiment, the level of expression of C5 in a sample is determined by detecting a transcribed polynucleotide, or portion thereof, e.g., mRNA of the C5 gene. RNA may be extracted from cells using RNA extraction techniques including, for example, using acid phenol/guanidine isothiocyanate extraction (RNAzol B; Biogenesis), RNeasy RNA preparation kits (Qiagen) or PAXgene (PreAnalytix, Switzerland). Typical assay formats utilizing ribonucleic acid hybridization include nuclear run-on assays, RT-PCR, RNase protection assays (Melton et al., <i>Nuc. Acids Res</i>. 12:7035), Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, and microarray analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00746-en" num="0748">In one embodiment, the level of expression of C5 is determined using a nucleic acid probe. The term âprobeâ, as used herein, refers to any molecule that is capable of selectively binding to a specific C5. Probes can be synthesized by one of skill in the art, or derived from appropriate biological preparations. Probes may be specifically designed to be labeled. Examples of molecules that can be utilized as probes include, but are not limited to, RNA, DNA, proteins, antibodies, and organic molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00747-en" num="0749">Isolated mRNA can be used in hybridization or amplification assays that include, but are not limited to, Southern or Northern analyses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses and probe arrays. One method for the determination of mRNA levels involves contacting the isolated mRNA with a nucleic acid molecule (probe) that can hybridize to C5 mRNA. In one embodiment, the mRNA is immobilized on a solid surface and contacted with a probe, for example by running the isolated mRNA on an agarose gel and transferring the mRNA from the gel to a membrane, such as nitrocellulose. In an alternative embodiment, the probe(s) are immobilized on a solid surface and the mRNA is contacted with the probe(s), for example, in an Affymetrix gene chip array. A skilled artisan can readily adapt known mRNA detection methods for use in determining the level of C5 mRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00748-en" num="0750">An alternative method for determining the level of expression of C5 in a sample involves the process of nucleic acid amplification and/or reverse transcriptase (to prepare cDNA) of for example mRNA in the sample, e.g., by RT-PCR (the experimental embodiment set forth in Mullis, 1987, U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202), ligase chain reaction (Barany (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:189-193), self sustained sequence replication (Guatelli et al. (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>87:1874-1878), transcriptional amplification system (Kwoh et al. (1989) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86:1173-1177), Q-Beta Replicase (Lizardi et al. (1988) <i>Bio/Technology </i>6:1197), rolling circle replication (Lizardi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,033) or any other nucleic acid amplification method, followed by the detection of the amplified molecules using techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These detection schemes are especially useful for the detection of nucleic acid molecules if such molecules are present in very low numbers. In particular aspects of the invention, the level of expression of C5 is determined by quantitative fluorogenic RT-PCR (i.e., the TaqManâ¢ System).</p>
      <p id="p-00749-en" num="0751">The expression levels of C5 mRNA may be monitored using a membrane blot (such as used in hybridization analysis such as Northern, Southern, dot, and the like), or microwells, sample tubes, gels, beads or fibers (or any solid support comprising bound nucleic acids). See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,722, 5,874,219, 5,744,305, 5,677,195 and 5,445,934, which are incorporated herein by reference. The determination of C5 expression level may also comprise using nucleic acid probes in solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00750-en" num="0752">In preferred embodiments, the level of mRNA expression is assessed using branched DNA (bDNA) assays or real time PCR (qPCR). The use of these methods is described and exemplified in the Examples presented herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00751-en" num="0753">The level of C5 protein expression may be determined using any method known in the art for the measurement of protein levels. Such methods include, for example, electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), hyperdiffusion chromatography, fluid or gel precipitin reactions, absorption spectroscopy, a colorimetric assays, spectrophotometric assays, flow cytometry, immunodiffusion (single or double), immunoelectrophoresis, Western blotting, radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunofluorescent assays, electrochemiluminescence assays, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00752-en" num="0754">The term âsampleâ as used herein refers to a collection of similar fluids, cells, or tissues isolated from a subject, as well as fluids, cells, or tissues present within a subject. Examples of biological fluids include blood, serum and serosal fluids, plasma, lymph, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, ocular fluids, and the like. Tissue samples may include samples from tissues, organs or localized regions. For example, samples may be derived from particular organs, parts of organs, or fluids or cells within those organs. In certain embodiments, samples may be derived from the liver (e.g., whole liver or certain segments of liver or certain types of cells in the liver, such as, e.g., hepatocytes). In preferred embodiments, a âsample derived from a subjectâ refers to blood or plasma drawn from the subject. In further embodiments, a âsample derived from a subjectâ refers to liver tissue derived from the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00753-en" num="0755">In some embodiments of the methods of the invention, the RNAi agent is administered to a subject such that the RNAi agent is delivered to a specific site within the subject. The inhibition of expression of C5 may be assessed using measurements of the level or change in the level of C5 mRNA or C5 protein in a sample derived from fluid or tissue from the specific site within the subject. In preferred embodiments, the site is the liver. The site may also be a subsection or subgroup of cells from any one of the aforementioned sites. The site may also include cells that express a particular type of receptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00754-en" num="0756">The phrase âcontacting a cell with an RNAi agent,â such as a dsRNA, as used herein, includes contacting a cell by any possible means. Contacting a cell with an RNAi agent includes contacting a cell in vitro with the iRNA or contacting a cell in vivo with the iRNA. The contacting may be done directly or indirectly. Thus, for example, the RNAi agent may be put into physical contact with the cell by the individual performing the method, or alternatively, the RNAi agent may be put into a situation that will permit or cause it to subsequently come into contact with the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00755-en" num="0757">Contacting a cell in vitro may be done, for example, by incubating the cell with the RNAi agent. Contacting a cell in vivo may be done, for example, by injecting the RNAi agent into or near the tissue where the cell is located, or by injecting the RNAi agent into another area, e.g., the bloodstream or the subcutaneous space, such that the agent will subsequently reach the tissue where the cell to be contacted is located. For example, the RNAi agent may contain and/or be coupled to a ligand, e.g., GalNAc3, that directs the RNAi agent to a site of interest, e.g., the liver. Combinations of in vitro and in vivo methods of contacting are also possible. For example, a cell may also be contacted in vitro with an RNAi agent and subsequently transplanted into a subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00756-en" num="0758">In one embodiment, contacting a cell with an iRNA includes âintroducingâ or âdelivering the iRNA into the cellâ by facilitating or effecting uptake or absorption into the cell. Absorption or uptake of an iRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. Introducing an iRNA into a cell may be in vitro and/or in vivo. For example, for in vivo introduction, iRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vivo delivery can also be done by a beta-glucan delivery system, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection. Further approaches are described herein below and/or are known in the art.</p>

If the subject is receiving plamapheresis or plasma exchange, eculizumab may be administered to the subject at a dose less than about 300 mg (e.g., if the most recent does of eculizumab was about 300 mg) or less than about 600 mg (e.g., if the most recent does of eculizumab was about 600 mg or more). If the subject is receiving plasma infusion, eculizumab may be administered to the subject at a dose less than about 300 mg (e.g., if the most recent does of eculizumab was about 300 mg or more). The lower doses of eculizumab allow for either subcutaneous or intravenous administration of eculizumab.</p>

The reduction can be, for example, at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or about 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00782-en" num="0784">Efficacy of treatment or prevention of disease can be assessed, for example by measuring disease progression, disease remission, symptom severity, reduction in pain, quality of life, dose of a medication required to sustain a treatment effect, level of a disease marker or any other measurable parameter appropriate for a given disease being treated or targeted for prevention. It is well within the ability of one skilled in the art to monitor efficacy of treatment or prevention by measuring any one of such parameters, or any combination of parameters. For example, efficacy of treatment of a hemolytic disorder may be assessed, for example, by periodic monitoring of LDH and CH<sub>50 </sub>levels. Comparisons of the later readings with the initial readings provide a physician an indication of whether the treatment is effective. It is well within the ability of one skilled in the art to monitor efficacy of treatment or prevention by measuring any one of such parameters, or any combination of parameters. In connection with the administration of an iRNA targeting C5 or pharmaceutical composition thereof, âeffective againstâ a complement component C5-associated disease indicates that administration in a clinically appropriate manner results in a beneficial effect for at least a statistically significant fraction of patients, such as improvement of symptoms, a cure, a reduction in disease, extension of life, improvement in quality of life, or other effect generally recognized as positive by medical doctors familiar with treating a complement component C5-associated disease and the related causes.</p>
      <p id="p-00783-en" num="0785">A treatment or preventive effect is evident when there is a statistically significant improvement in one or more parameters of disease status, or by a failure to worsen or to develop symptoms where they would otherwise be anticipated. As an example, a favorable change of at least 10% in a measurable parameter of disease, and preferably at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more can be indicative of effective treatment. Efficacy for a given iRNA drug or formulation of that drug can also be judged using an experimental animal model for the given disease as known in the art. When using an experimental animal model, efficacy of treatment is evidenced when a statistically significant reduction in a marker or symptom is observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00784-en" num="0786">Alternatively, the efficacy can be measured by a reduction in the severity of disease as determined by one skilled in the art of diagnosis based on a clinically accepted disease severity grading scale, as but one example the Rheumatoid Arthritis Severity Scale (RASS). Any positive change resulting in e.g., lessening of severity of disease measured using the appropriate scale, represents adequate treatment using an iRNA or iRNA formulation as described herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00816-en" num="0818">siRNA design was carried out to identify siRNAs targeting human, rhesus (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), mouse, and rat C5 transcripts annotated in the NCBI Gene database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/). Design used the following transcripts from the NCBI RefSeq collection: HumanâNM<sub>â</sub>001735.2; RhesusâXM<sub>â</sub>001095750.2; MouseâNM<sub>â</sub>010406.2; RatâXM<sub>â</sub>345342.4. SiRNA duplexes were designed in several separate batches, including but not limited to batches containing duplexes matching human and rhesus transcripts only; human, rhesus, and mouse transcripts only; human, rhesus, mouse, and rat transcripts only; and mouse and rat transcripts only. All siRNA duplexes were designed that shared 100% identity with the listed human transcript and other species transcripts considered in each design batch (above).</p>
      <p id="p-00817-en" num="0000">siRNA Design, Specificity, and Efficacy Prediction</p>
      <p id="p-00818-en" num="0819">The predicted specificity of all possible 19mers was predicted from each sequence. Candidate 19mers were then selected that lacked repeats longer than 7 nucleotides. These 2971 candidate human/rhesus, 142 human/rhesus/mouse, 54 human/rhesus/mouse/rat, and 807 mouse/rat siRNAs were used in comprehensive searches against the appropriate transcriptomes (defined as the set of NM_ and XM_records within the human, rhesus, dog, mouse, or rat NCBI Refseq sets) using an exhaustive âbrute-forceâ algorithm implemented in the python script BruteForce.py. The script next parsed the transcript-oligo alignments to generate a score based on the position and number of mismatches between the siRNA and any potential off-target transcript. The off-target score is weighted to emphasize differences in the âseedâ region of siRNAs, in positions 2-9 from the 5â²-end of the molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00819-en" num="0820">Each oligo-transcript pair from the brute-force search was given a mismatch score by summing the individual mismatch scores; mismatches in the position 2-9 were counted as 2.8, mismatches in the cleavage site positions 10-11 were counted as 1.2, and mismatches in region 12-19 counted as 1.0. An additional off-target prediction was carried out by comparing the frequency of heptamers and octomers derived from 3 distinct, seed-derived hexamers of each oligo. The hexamers from positions 2-7 relative to the 5â² start were used to create 2 heptamers and one octamer. âHeptamer1â was created by adding a 3â²-A to the hexamer; heptamer2 was created by adding a 5â²-A to the hexamer; the octomer was created by adding an A to both 5â²- and 3â²-ends of the hexamer. The frequency of octamers and heptamers in the human, rhesus, mouse, or rat 3â²-UTRome (defined as the subsequence of the transcriptome from NCBI's Refseq database where the end of the coding region, the âCDSâ, is clearly defined) was pre-calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00820-en" num="0821">The octamer frequency was normalized to the heptamer frequency using the median value from the range of octamer frequencies. A âmirSeedScoreâ was then calculated by calculating the sum of ((3Ãnormalized octamer count)+(2Ãheptamer2 count)+(1Ãheptamer1 count)).</p>
      <p id="p-00821-en" num="0822">Both siRNAs strands were assigned to a category of specificity according to the calculated scores: a score above 3 qualifies as highly specific, equal to 3 as specific and between 2.2 and 2.8 as moderately specific. The duplexes were sorted by the specificity of the antisense strand and those duplexes whose antisense oligos lacked GC at the first position, lacked G at both positions 13 and 14, and had 3 or more Us or As in the seed region were selected.</p>
      <p id="p-00822-en" num="0823">For GalNaC-conjugated duplexes, sense 21mer and antisense 23mer oligos were designed by extending antisense 19mers (described above) to 23 nucleotides of target-complementary sequence. All species transcripts included in the design batch were checked for complementarity. Only 23mers that preserved 100% sequence complementarity in at least 2 species were used. For each duplex, the sense 21mer was specified as the reverse complement of the first 21 nucleotides of the antisense strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00823-en" num="0000">siRNA Sequence Selection</p>

      <p id="p-00829-en" num="0828">RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at scales between 0.2-500 Î¼mol using commercially available 5â²-O-(4,4â²-dimethoxytrityl)-2â²-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl-3â²-O-(2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropyl)phosphoramidite monomers of uridine, 4-N-acetylcytidine, 6-N-benzoyladenosine and 2-N-isobutyrylguanosine and the corresponding 2â²-O-methyl and 2â²-fluoro phosphoramidites according to standard solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis protocols. The amidite solutions were prepared at 0.1-0.15 M concentration and 5-ethylthio-1H-tetrazole (0.25-0.6 M in acetonitrile) was used as the activator. Phosphorothioate backbone modifications were introduced during synthesis using 0.2 M phenylacetyl disulfide (PADS) in lutidine:acetonitrile (1:1) (v;v) or 0.1 M 3-(dimethylaminomethylene) amino-3H-1,2,4-dithiazole-5-thione (DDTT) in pyridine for the oxidation step. After completion of synthesis, the sequences were cleaved from the solid support and deprotected using methylamine followed by triethylamine.3HF to remove any 2â²-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl protecting groups present.</p>
      <p id="p-00830-en" num="0829">For synthesis scales between 5-500 Î¼mol and fully 2â² modified sequences (2â²-fluoro and/or 2â²-O-methyl or combinations thereof) the oligonucleotides where deprotected using 3:1 (v/v) ethanol and concentrated (28-32%) aqueous ammonia either at 35Â° C. 16 h or 55Â° C. for 5.5 h. Prior to ammonia deprotection the oligonucleotides where treated with 0.5 M piperidine in acetonitrile for 20 min on the solid support. The crude oligonucleotides were analyzed by LC-MS and anion-exchange HPLC (IEX-HPLC). Purification of the oligonucleotides was carried out by IEX HPLC using: 20 mM phosphate, 10%-15% ACN, pH=8.5 (buffer A) and 20 mM phosphate, 10%-15% ACN, 1 M NaBr, pH=8.5 (buffer B). Fractions were analyzed for purity by analytical HPLC. The product-containing fractions with suitable purity were pooled and concentrated on a rotary evaporator prior to desalting. The samples were desalted by size exclusion chromatography and lyophilized to dryness. Equal molar amounts of sense and antisense strands were annealed in 1ÃPBS buffer to prepare the corresponding siRNA duplexes.</p>
      <p id="p-00831-en" num="0830">For small scales (0.2-1 Î¼mol), synthesis was performed on a MerMade 192 synthesizer in a 96 well format. In case of fully 2â²-modified sequences (2â²-fluoro and/or 2â²-O-methyl or combinations thereof) the oligonucleotides where deprotected using methylamine at room temperature for 30-60 min followed by incubation at 60Â° C. for 30 min or using 3:1 (v/v) ethanol and concentrated (28-32%) aqueous ammonia at room temperature for 30-60 min followed by incubation at 40Â° C. for 1.5 hours. The crude oligonucleotides were then precipitated in a solution of acetonitrile:acetone (9:1) and isolated by centrifugation and decanting the supernatant. The crude oligonucleotide pellet was re-suspended in 20 mM NaOAc buffer and analyzed by LC-MS and anion exchange HPLC. The crude oligonucleotide sequences were desalted in 96 deep well plates on a 5 mL HiTrap Sephadex G25 column (GE Healthcare). In each well about 1.5 mL samples corresponding to an individual sequence was collected. These purified desalted oligonucleotides were analyzed by LC-MS and anion exchange chromatography. Duplexes were prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of sense and antisense sequences on a Tecan robot. Concentration of duplexes was adjusted to 10 Î¼M in 1ÃPBS buffer.</p>

      <p id="p-00834-en" num="0833">For synthesis of GalNAc conjugates in the scales between 5-500 Î¼mol, the above synthesis protocol for RNA was followed with the following adaptions: For polystyrene-based synthesis supports 5% dichloroacetic acid in toluene was used for DMT-cleavage during synthesis. Cleavage from the support and deprotection was performed as described above. Phosphorothioate-rich sequences (usually &gt;5 phorphorothioates) were synthesized without removing the final 5â²-DMT group (âDMT-onâ) and, after cleavage and deprotection as described above, purified by reverse phase HPLC using 50 mM ammonium acetate in water (buffer A) and 50 mM ammoniumacetate in 80% acetonitirile (buffer B). Fractions were analyzed for purity by analytical HPLC and/or LC-MS. The product-containing fractions with suitable purity were pooled and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The DMT-group was removed using 20%-25% acetic acid in water until completion. The samples were desalted by size exclusion chromatography and lyophilized to dryness. Equal molar amounts of sense and antisense strands were annealed in 1ÃPBS buffer to prepare the corresponding siRNA duplexes.</p>
      <p id="p-00835-en" num="0834">For small scale synthesis of GalNAc conjugates (0.2-1 Î¼mol), including sequences with multiple phosphorothioate linkages, the protocols described above for synthesis of RNA or fully 2â²-F/2â²-OMe-containing sequences on MerMade platform were applied. Synthesis was performed on pre-packed columns containing GalNAc-functionalized controlled pore glass support.</p>

      <p id="p-00875-en" num="0856">A subset of seven GalNAC conjugated iRNAs was selected for further in vivo evaluation.</p>
      <p id="p-00876-en" num="0857">C57BL/6 mice (N=3 per group) were injected subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg of GalNAc conjugated duplexes or an equal volume of 1Ã Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) (Life Technologies, Cat#14040133). Forty-eight hours later, mice were euthanized and the livers were dissected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Livers were ground in a 2000 Geno/Grinder (SPEX SamplePrep, Metuchen, N.J.). Approximately 10 mg of liver powder per sample was used for RNA isolation. Samples were first homogenized in a TissueLyserII (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, Calif.) and then RNA was extracted using a RNeasy 96 Universal Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Cat#74881) following manufacturer's protocol using vacuum/spin technology. RNA concentration was measured by a NanoDrop 8000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, Del.) and was adjusted to 100 ng/Î¼l. cDNA and RT-PCR were performed as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00877-en" num="0858">The results of the single dose screen are depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Table 17 shows the results of an in vivo single dose screen with the indicated GalNAC conjugated modified iRNAs. Data are expressed as percent of mRNA remaining relative to DPBS treated mice. The âExperimentsâ column lists the number of experiments from which the average was calculated. The standard deviation is calculated from all mice in a group across all experiments analyzed.</p>

      <p id="p-00881-en" num="0860">Given the impact of the additional phosphorothioate linkages on the silencing ability of the iRNA agents described above, the efficacy of additional GalNAC conjugated iRNA duplexes including phosphoriothioate linkages (Table 19) was determined in vivo as described above. The results of this single dose screen are depicted in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00882-en" num="0861">The duration of silencing of AD-58642 in vivo was determined by administering a single 2.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 25 mg/kg dose to rats and determining the amount of C5 protein (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) present on day 7 and the activity of C5 protein (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>) present on days 4 and 7. As demonstrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, there is a 50% reduction in the activity of C5 protein by Day 4 at a 25 mg/kg dose and at Day 7, a greater than 70% reduction in the activity of C5 protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00883-en" num="0862">The amount of C5 protein was determined by Western blot analysis of whole serum. The activity of C5 protein was determined by a hemolysis assay. Briefly, a fixed dilution of human C5 depleted human serum was mixed with mouse serum and incubated with antibody-coated sheep red blood cells for 1 hour. The hemoglobin absorbance was measured and the % hemolysis as compared to a reference curve (prepared using a dilution series of mouse serum) was calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00884-en" num="0863">The efficacy of AD-58642 in vivo was also assayed in mice following a single subcutaneous injection of 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 25 mg/kg of AD-58642. At day 5 C5 mRNA was assayed in liver samples using qPCR, C5 activity was assayed for hemolysis, and the amount of C5 protein was determined by Western blot analysis of whole serum.</p>
      <p id="p-00885-en" num="0864">As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, although there is only a minor improvement (i.e., about 5%) in efficacy of AD-58642 to inhibit C5 mRNA at a dose of 25 mg/kg as compared to a 10 mg/kg dose, there is an average of 85% silencing with a 25 mg/kg dose. In addition, there is a dose response effect with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of about 2.5 mg/kg.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> and <b>8</b> demonstrate that AD-58642 is efficacious for decreasing the amount of C5 protein (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>) and C5 protein activity (<figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00887-en" num="0866">The duration of silencing of AD-58641 in vivo was also determined by subcutaneously administering a single 0.625 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg dose of AD-58641 to C57Bl/6 (n=3) mice and determining the amount of C5 protein present in these animals on days 5 and 9 by ELISA. Briefly, serum was collected on day 0, pre-bleed, day 5, and day 9 and the levels of C5 proteins were quantified by ELISA. C5 protein levels were normalized to the day 0 pre-bleed level. As depicted in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the results demonstrate that there is a dose dependent potent and durable knock-down of C5 serum protein. (The single dose ED<sub>50 </sub>was 0.6 mg/kg).</p>
      <p id="p-00888-en" num="0867">Compound AD-58641 was also tested for efficacy in C57Bl/6 mice using a multi-dosing administration protocol. Mice were subcutaneously administered compound AD-58641 at a 0.625 mg/kg, 1.25 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg dose at days 0, 1, 2, and 3. Serum was collected at days 0 and 8 as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10</figref> and analyzed for C5 protein levels by ELISA. C5 levels were normalized to the day 0 pre-bleed level. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> shows that multi-dosing of AD-58641 achieves silencing of C5 protein at all of the does tested, with a greater than 90% silencing of C5 protein at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00889-en" num="0868">Compound AD-58641 was further tested for efficacy and to evaluate the cumulative effect of the compound in rats using a repeat administration protocol. Wild-type Sprague Dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with compound AD-58641 at a 2.5 mg/kg/dose or 5.0 mg/kg/dose twice a week for 3 weeks (q2wÃ3). Serum was collected on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 25, and 32. Serum hemolytic activity was quantified using a hemolysis assay in which a 1:150 dilution of rat serum was incubated with sensitized sheep rat blood cells in GVB++ buffer for 1 hour and hemoglobin release was quantified by measuring absorbance at 415 nm (see <figref>FIG. 11A</figref>). The amount of C5 protein present in the samples was also determined by ELISA (<figref>FIG. 11B</figref>). The results demonstrate a dose dependent potent and durable decrease in hemolytic activity, achieving about 90% hemolytic activity inhibition.</p>

      <p id="p-00892-en" num="0870">C5 duplexes, 19 nucleotides long for both the sense and antisense strand, were designed using the human C5 mRNA sequence set forth in GenBank Accession No. NM<sub>â</sub>001735.2. Five-hundred and sixty-nine duplexes were initially identified that did not contain repeats longer than 7 nucleotides, spanning substantially the entire 5480 nucleotide transcript. All 569 duplexes are then scored for predicted efficacy according to a linear model that evaluates the nucleotide pair at each duplex position, and the dose and cell line to be used for screening. The duplexes are also matched against all transcripts in the human RefSeq collection using a custom brute force algorithm, and scored for lowest numbers of mismatches (per strand) to transcripts other than C5. Duplexes to be synthesized and screened are then selected from the 569, according to the following scheme: Beginning at the 5â² end of the transcript, a duplex is selected within a âwindowâ of every 10Â±2 nucleotides that</p>
      <p id="p-00893-en" num="0871">1) had the highest predicted efficacy,</p>
      <p id="p-00894-en" num="0872">2) had at least one mismatch in both strands to all transcripts other than SERPINC1,</p>
      <p id="p-00895-en" num="0873">3) had not already been synthesized and screened as part of other duplex sets.</p>
      <p id="p-00896-en" num="0874">If no duplex is identified within a given window that satisfied all criteria, that window was skipped.</p>
      <p id="p-00897-en" num="0875">A detailed list of the 569 C5 sense and antisense strand sequences is shown in Table 20.</p>
      <p id="p-00898-en" num="0876">The in vitro efficacy of duplexes comprising the sense and antisense sequences listed in Table 20 is determined using the following methods.</p>

Transfection is carried out by adding 14.8 Î¼l of Opti-MEM plus 0.2 Î¼l of Lipofectamine RNAiMax per well (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif. cat #13778-150) to 51 Î¼l of each of the 164 siRNA duplexes to an individual well in a 96-well plate. The mixture is then incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 80 Î¼l of complete growth media without antibiotic containing Ë2.5Ã10<sup>4 </sup>HepG2 cells is then added to the siRNA mixture.

Ten microliters of magnetic beads and 80 Î¼l Lysis/Binding Buffer mixture are added to a round bottom plate and mixed for 1 minute. Magnetic beads are captured using magnetic stand and the supernatant is removed without disturbing the beads. After removing supernatant, the lysed cells are added to the remaining beads and mixed for 5 minutes. After removing supernatant, magnetic beads are washed 2 times with 150 Î¼l Wash Buffer A and mixed for 1 minute. Beads are captured again and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed with 150 Î¼l Wash Buffer B, captured and supernatant is removed. Beads are next washed with 150 Î¼l Elution Buffer, captured and supernatant removed. Beads are allowed to dry for 2 minutes. After drying, 50 Î¼l of Elution Buffer is added and mixed for 5 minutes at 70Â° C. Beads are captured on magnet for 5 minutes.

      <p id="p-00907-en" num="0882">Groups of three female cynomolgus macaques were treated with C5-siRNA AD-58641 subcutaneously in the scapular and mid-dorsal areas of the back at 2.5 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg doses or a vehicle control. Two rounds of dosing were administered with eight doses in each round given every third day. Serum C5 was collected and evaluated using an ELISA assay specific for C5 detection (Abcam) at the indicated time points (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). C5 levels were normalized to the average of three pre-dose samples. Samples collected prior to dosing, and on day 23 (24 hours after the last dose administered in the first round of treatment) were analyzed by complete serum chemistry, hematology and coagulation panels.</p>
      <p id="p-00908-en" num="0883">Analysis of serum C5 protein levels relative to pre-treatment serum C5 protein levels demonstrated that the 5 mg/kg AD-58641 dosing regimen reduced serum C5 protein levels up to 98% (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>). The average serum C5 levels were reduced by 97% at the nadir, indicating that the majority of circulating C5 is hepatic in origin. There was potent, dose-dependent and durable knock-down of serum C5 protein levels with subcutaneous administration of AD-58641. No changes in hematology, serum chemistry or coagulation parameters were identified 24 hours after the first round of dosing.</p>
      <p id="p-00909-en" num="0884">Serum hemolytic activity was also analyzed using a sensitized sheep erythrocyte assay to measure classical pathway activity. The percent hemolysis was calculated relative to maximal hemolysis and to background hemolysis in control samples. Mean hemolysis values+/âthe SEM for three animals were calculated and analyzed (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). Hemolysis was reduced up to 94% in the 5 mg/kg dosing regimen with an average inhibition of 92% at the nadir. The reduction in hemolysis was maintained for greater than two weeks following the last dose.</p>

      <p id="p-00913-en" num="0887">RNA isolation was performed using a semi-automated process of a Biotek EL 405 washer. Briefly, cells were lysed in 75 Î¼l of Lysis/Binding Buffer containing 2 ul of Dynabeads, then mixed for 10 minutes on setting 7 of an electromagnetic shaker (Union Scientific). Magnetic beads were captured using magnetic stand and the supernatant was removed. After removing supernatant, magnetic beads were washed with 90 Î¼l Wash Buffer A, followed by 90 Î¼l of Wash buffer B. Beads were then washed twice with 100 ul of Elution buffer which was then aspirated and cDNA generated directly on bead bound RNA in the 384 well plate.</p>

Plates were then shaken on an electromagnetic shaker for 10 minutes and then placed in a 37Â° C. incubator for 2 hours. Following this incubation, plates were place on a shake in an 80Â° C. incubator for 7 minutes to inactivate the enzyme and elute the RNA/cDNA from the beads.</p>

      <heading id="h-00047-en" level="1">In Vivo Screening of Additional siRNAs</heading>
      <p id="p-00921-en" num="0892">Based on the sequence of AD-58643, an additional four sense and three antisense sequences were synthesized and used to prepare twelve, 21/25 mer compounds (Table 23). In general, the antisense strands of these compounds were extended with a dTdT and the duplexes had fewer fluoro-modified nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00922-en" num="0893">C57BL/6 mice (N=3 per group) were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg/kg of these GalNAc conjugated duplexes, serum was collected on day 0 pre-bleed, and day 5, and the levels of C5 proteins were quantified by ELISA. C5 protein levels were normalized to the day 0 pre-bleed level.</p>
      <p id="p-00923-en" num="0894">
        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> shows the results of an in vivo single dose screen with the indicated iRNAs. Data are expressed as percent of C5 protein remaining relative to pre-bleed levels. Those iRNAs having improved efficacy as compared to the parent compound included AD-62510, AD-62643, AD-62645, AD-62646, AD-62650, and AD-62651. These iRNAs also demonstrated similar potencies (IC<sub>50 </sub>of about 23-59 pM).</p>
      <p id="p-00924-en" num="0895">The efficacy of these iRNAs was also tested in C57Bl/6 mice using a single-dosing administration protocol. Mice were subcutaneously administered AD-62510, AD-62643, AD-62645, AD-62646, AD-62650, and AD-62651 at a 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, or 2.5 mg/kg dose. Serum was collected at days 0 and 5 and analyzed for C5 protein levels by ELISA. C5 levels were normalized to the day 0 pre-bleed level.</p>
      <p id="p-00925-en" num="0896">
        <figref>FIG. 15</figref> shows that there is a dose response with all of the tested iRNAs and that single-dosing of all of these iRNAs achieved silencing of C5 protein similar to or better than AD-58641.</p>
      <p id="p-00926-en" num="0897">The duration of silencing of AD-62510, AD-62643, AD-62645, AD-62646, AD-62650, and AD-62651 in vivo was determined by administering a single 1.0 mg/kg dose to C57Bl/6 mice and determining the amount of C5 protein present on days 6, 13, 20, 27, and 34 by ELISA. C5 levels were normalized to the day 0 pre-bleed level.</p>
      <p id="p-00927-en" num="0898">As demonstrated in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, each of the iRNAs tested has the same recovery kinetics as AD-62643 trending toward the best silencing, but within the error of the assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00928-en" num="0899">AD-62510, AD-62643, AD-62645, AD-62646, AD-62650, and AD-62651 were further tested for efficacy and to evaluate the cumulative effect of the iRNAs in rats using a repeat administration protocol. Wild-type Sprague Dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with each of the iRNAs at a 5.0 mg/kg/dose on days 0, 4, and 7. Serum was collected on days 0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 25, 28, and 32. Serum hemolytic activity was quantified as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00929-en" num="0900">The results depicted in <figref>FIG. 17</figref> demonstrate that all of the tested iRNAs have a potent and durable decrease in hemolytic activity and a similar recovery of hemolysis to that observed with AD-58641 treatment.</p>
