    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The object of the present invention is a method for producing a confectionary product by extrusion through an extruder nozzle, in which cutting means are moved in a direction transverse to the extrusion direction to separate the end portion from the remaining part of the extruded confectionary (the so-called âconfectionary stringâ) and thus form the confectionary product.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention also relates to a machine for producing a confectionary product by extrusion, which machine comprises an extruder nozzle with a nozzle orifice, cutting means movable in a direction transverse to the extrusion direction to separate the end portion from the remaining part of the extruded confectionary and thus form the confectionary product.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention relates in particular to the production of confectionary products in the form of ice cream, but it is also usable for the production of other continuous string extruded products, irrespective of whether they are or are not provided with a stick, such as lollipops. However, the problems at the basis of the invention and the advantages achieved through the invention will be described with specific reference to the production of ice cream products.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It is known to produce ice lollies or ice cream by extrusion with a wide freedom of choice of the shape viewed in the extrusion direction and with the possibility of combining different colours and substances, such as ice cream and ice lollies. Moreover, the extruded ice cream products may be provided with or without a stick inserted.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is therefore possible to extrude the confectionary products in a vertical direction directly above horizontal support surfaces, in particular a series of support trays or a conveyor belt, on which the product sheared from the string is then put (i.e., rested) for further treatments, e.g. for freezing, coating, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In the case of cuts perpendicular to the extrusion direction, the resulting confectionary product will have a shape delimited between the two parallel cutting sides. Because of the impact of the cutting means, e.g. stretched wires or blades, against the string, the sheared confectionary product is âlaunchedâ on the conveying surface in a hardly controllable manner. This leads to unwanted variations in the product shape and to inaccurate placement thereof on the conveying surface, which cause complications in the later treatment steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The above drawbacks are particularly accentuated in the presence of macro-particles, such as grains of chocolate or nuts, brittle, dried fruit, etc., inside the confectionary string. In fact, the difficulty or impossibility of cutting through the macro-particles in the cutting plane leads to a flattening of the macro-particles through the soft confectionary substance and increases the product deformation and the errors of positioning on the conveying surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">To date, the need for newer and newer ice cream products with ingredients having different shape and texture, e.g. different kinds of nuts, chocolate, sweets, fruit etc., is not compatible with the needs of a production made by means of automated extrusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The object of the present invention therefore is to propose a method and a machine for producing products by extrusion and shearing of the confectionary string, having such features as to overcome at least some of the drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A particular object of the invention is to propose a method and a machine for producing confectionary products by extrusion and shearing of the confectionary string, having such features as to reconcile the need to extrude a confectionary substance containing cut-resistant macro-particles with the need to achieve a high shape uniformity of the products sheared from the string and a precise positioning of the products on the conveying surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">These and other objects are achieved by a method for producing a confectionary product, comprising the steps of:</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">forming a confectionary string through the extrusion of a confectionary substance through an extruder nozzle in an extrusion direction,</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">forming the confectionary product by moving the cutting means in a direction transverse to the extrusion direction from a rest position outside the confectionary string to a cutting position inside the confectionary string in such a way as to separate an end portion from a remaining part of the confectionary string emerging from the extruder nozzle,</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">moving the confectionary product away from the extruder nozzle by resting the end portion separated from the confectionary string on a conveying surface and moving the conveying surface in a transport direction transverse to the extrusion direction, characterized by the steps of:</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">resting the end portion on the conveying surface already before the separation of the end portion from the remaining part of the confectionary string, and</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">completing the separation of the end portion from the remaining part of the confectionary string while the end portion is resting on the conveying surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Resting the end portion of the confectionary string on the conveying surface already during the cutting is a further constraint which remarkably reduces the unwanted deformations and the positioning inaccuracies of the confectionary product due to the impact of the cutting means onto the confectionary string.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Likewise, the objects of the invention are achieved by a machine for producing a confectionary product, comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">an extruder nozzle configured to extrude a confectionary substance in an extrusion direction, thus forming a confectionary string,</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">cutting means configured to be moved in a cutting direction transverse to the extrusion direction from a rest position outside the confectionary string to a cutting position inside the confectionary string in such a way as to separate an end portion from a remaining part of the confectionary string emerging from the extruder nozzle and thus form the confectionary product,</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">a conveying surface suitable for receiving the end portion separated from the confectionary string and configured to be moved in a transport direction transverse to the extrusion direction for moving the confectionary product away from the extruder nozzle,</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0000">the machine being configured in such a way as to:</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0022">rest the end portion of the conveying surface already before the separation of the end portion from the remaining part of the confectionary string emerging from the extruder nozzle, and</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">Thanks to the support of the end portion <b>5</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> on the conveying surface <b>8</b>, the end portion <b>5</b> is constrained during cutting, thus obviating any deformation and wrong positioning of the confectionary product <b>1</b> due to the impact of the cutting means <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">According to an embodiment (<figref>FIG. 2</figref> steps POS<b>2</b> to POS<b>5</b>), the end portion <b>5</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> is rested on the conveying surface <b>8</b> already before cutting, i.e. before the cutting means <b>6</b> (e.g. one or more blades or one or more stretched wires) penetrate into the confectionary string <b>2</b>, and the end portion <b>5</b> remains resting on the conveying surface <b>8</b> during the whole cutting operation and up to a complete separation of the cutting means from the end portion <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">By resting the end portion <b>5</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> on the conveying surface already before starting the cut, an accurate positioning of the confectionary product <b>1</b> is obtained, completely independent of the cutting action and, therefore, suitable for subsequent automated treatment steps (coating, pick up and orientation, packaging, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">Of course, thanks to the constraint of the end portion <b>5</b> to the conveying surface <b>8</b> throughout the cutting step, the confectionary product <b>1</b> is also less subject to deformation due to the shock effect of the cutting means.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">According to an embodiment, the end portion <b>5</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> is integrally and rigidly fixed to the conveying surface <b>8</b> by freezing the end portion <b>5</b> in at least one zone of contact with the conveying surface <b>8</b>. The rigid fixing by freezing is carried out at least before the completion of the separation of the end portion <b>5</b> from the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> and preferably already before starting the cut.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">According to an embodiment, the rigid fixing by freezing can for example be achieved by cooling the conveying surface <b>8</b> (for example, in a temperature range from â20Â° C. . . . â30Â° C.) and/or by cooling the ambient air surrounding the conveying surface <b>8</b> (for example, in a temperature range from â35Â° C. . . . â45Â° C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">According to an embodiment, after the separation of the end portion <b>5</b> from the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>21</b>, the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> is moved away from the confectionary product <b>1</b> formed (and preferably also from the cutting means <b>6</b>) by a lifting movement <b>18</b> of the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> from a lower position (<figref>FIG. 2</figref> steps POS<b>1</b>-POS<b>3</b>) to an upper position (<figref>FIG. 2</figref> step POS<b>5</b>) along a lifting direction <b>11</b> parallel to the extrusion direction <b>4</b> but in a way opposite to the extrusion way and away from the conveying surface <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">This creates an interstice space between (in particular beneath) a free end of the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b> coming out of the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> and the formed confectionary product <b>1</b> (and preferably also a free space above the cutting means <b>6</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">Such free interstice space (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>4</b>) allows a continuation of the extrusion during the cutting step and during the removal of the confectionary product <b>1</b> without interference of the confectionary product <b>1</b> formed (and the cutting means <b>6</b>) with the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">According to a further embodiment, after the separation of the end portion <b>5</b> from the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>2</b>, the cutting means <b>6</b> are moved away from the formed confectionary product <b>1</b> by:</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">a cutting back-movement <b>12</b> in the cutting direction <b>13</b> transverse to the extrusion direction <b>4</b> from the cutting position (inside the confectionary string <b>2</b>) to the rest position (outside the confectionary string <b>2</b>) and</p>

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">This spaces apart the cutting means <b>6</b> from the extrusion trajectory of the confectionary string <b>2</b> and creates (below the cutting means <b>6</b>) a free interstice space which allows the removal of the confectionary product <b>1</b> in the transport direction without interfering with the cutting means <b>6</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>5</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">According to a further embodiment (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, steps POS<b>1</b> to POS<b>5</b>), during the forming of the confectionary string <b>2</b> and during the cut, the conveying surface <b>8</b> is moved (e.g., in a continuous manner) in the transport direction <b>9</b> and, at least since when the end portion <b>5</b> of the confectionary product <b>2</b> is rested up to the completion of the separation of the end portion <b>5</b> from the remaining part <b>7</b> of the confectionary string <b>21</b>, the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> is moved (along with the cutting means <b>6</b>) with a follow-through movement <b>16</b> from an initial position (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>1</b>) to a final position (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>5</b>) in a follow-through direction <b>17</b> parallel to the transport direction <b>9</b> in a manner synchronized with the transport movement <b>20</b> of the conveying surface <b>8</b>, so as to minimise or reduce to zero relative movement, transverse to the extrusion direction <b>4</b>, between the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> and the conveying surface <b>8</b>. This obviates any deformations or wrong positioning of the confectionary product <b>1</b> due to relative displacements of the constraint points of the confectionary string <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">At the end of the cycle (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>5</b>), i.e. after moving away the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> from the confectionary product <b>1</b> (extruder nozzle <b>3</b> in final position and in upper position) and after moving away the cutting means <b>6</b> from the confectionary product <b>1</b> (cutting means <b>6</b> in rest position and in raised position), the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> is moved from the upper position to the lower position and the cutting means <b>6</b> are moved from the raised position to the lowered position but they remain in the rest position (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, step POS<b>5</b>) so as to be ready for the next cycle of the production process. Moreover, the extruder nozzle <b>3</b> is returned together with the cutting means <b>6</b> from the final position to the initial position.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">According to a preferred embodiment, the extrusion direction <b>4</b> is substantially vertical and the extrusion way is downwards, i.e. in the gravity direction. The conveying surface <b>8</b> is substantially horizontal and orthogonal to the extrusion direction <b>4</b> and extended below the extruder nozzle <b>3</b>. The conveying direction <b>9</b> is substantially horizontal, at least in the zone where forming and cutting the confectionary string <b>2</b> are carried out. The cutting direction <b>13</b> and a cutting plane defined by the cutting displacement <b>12</b> of the cutting means <b>6</b> are substantially perpendicular to the extrusion direction <b>4</b>, preferably horizontal and parallel to the conveying surface <b>8</b> in the zone of forming and cutting the confectionary string <b>2</b>.</p>
