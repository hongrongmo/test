      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates to oligonucleotide reagents, oligonucleotide therapeutics, and methods of making and using thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The development of oligonucleotides into clinical medicines and their use as basic research tools is an ongoing endeavor. For example, the use of antisense oligonucleotides for gene silencing was described as early as 1978. Since this time other oligonucleotide based approaches have emerged for regulating gene expression, including RNA interference, microRNAs, and, recently, targeted inhibition or inactivation of long non-coding RNAs.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Although natural phosphodiester-backbone oligonucleotides are taken up by cells efficiently, they are highly susceptible to nuclease degradation in plasma, which limits their effectiveness as therapeutics in some cases. In some instances, therefore, it is advantageous to limit or control the extent to which oligonucleotides are degraded by nucleases. In this regard, a number of modified nucleotides (e.g., LNAs) and backbone modifications (e.g., phosphorothioates, methylphosphonates) have been reported that improve stability in some instances. Nonetheless, it remains as current objective in oligonucleotide based research and development to obtain oligonucleotides having favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">According to some aspects of the invention, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that are useful for regulating gene expression and function. Some aspects of the invention are based on the discovery that relatively high levels of a monomeric oligonucleotides can be achieved in a target tissue or cell when monomeric units are connected by a cleavable linker (e.g., an endonuclease-sensitive linker) and administered as a multimer. In some embodiments, the properties of a linker are selected to modulate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the multimeric oligonucleotide compounds. For example, in some embodiments, linker properties can be tuned to control the extent to which monomeric units are released in a particular tissue-type or cell-type to be targeted.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some embodiments, an advantage of using multimers is that it allows simultaneous knockdown of multiple targets, while exploiting the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic advantages of the administered oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, a sequence-specific concomitant knockdown of two or more targets may be achieved with a heteromultimer containing targeting oligonucleotides directed against several target gene combinations.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds provided herein comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by a cleavable linker. In some embodiments, each targeting oligonucleotide has a region complementary to a target region of a genomic target sequence. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides hybridize to a target nucleic acid encoded by a genomic target sequence and inhibit the function and/or effect degradation of the target nucleic acid. The target nucleic acid may be, for example, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA, or mRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA sponge, or anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide binds specifically to a target nucleic acid in a cell and brings about degradation of the target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by RNAse H. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by an RNAi pathway. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide binds specifically to its target nucleic acid in a cell and inhibits the function of the target nucleic acid. For example, in some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide binds to a target lncRNA and inhibits interaction of the lncRNA with one or more interacting proteins (e.g., a subunit of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2)).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to some aspects of the invention, compounds are provided that comprise the general formula: X-L-[X-L]<sub>i</sub>-X, in which i is an integer from 0 to 9, the value of which indicates the number of units of [X-L]<sub>i </sub>present in the compound, in which each X is independently a targeting oligonucleotide having a region of complementarity comprising at least 7 contiguous nucleotides complementary to a target region of a genomic target sequence, and each L is a linker that links at least two Xs and that is more susceptible to cleavage in a mammalian extract than each X.

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0029">In some embodiments, the invention is based, in part, on the discovery that multimeric oligonucleotide compounds (e.g., a 14-mer ASO linked to another 14-mer ASO) show significantly higher levels of the corresponding monomeric oligonucleotide compounds in the liver when the monomer units are connected by a rapidly degradable linker (e.g., a nuclease-sensitive linker or a disulfide linker), as opposed to a linker that is nuclease-resistant and, therefore, slowly degradable. Unexpectedly, the detected liver levels of the dimer-derived monomeric units were five to ten times higher than that of the corresponding monomers administered in the monomeric form. The increased delivery to the liver was also associated with a more effective target mRNA knockdown after 14 days of dosing in mice. The invention is therefore, in part, based on the realization that the type and properties of the linker can thus be used to modulate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the dimer antisense molecules.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0073">Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that are useful for regulating gene expression and/or function. In general, the multimeric oligonucleotide compounds provided herein comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by a cleavable linker. The multimeric oligonucleotides are useful for regulating the expression or function of a wide range of target nucleic acids including, for example, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA, or mRNA. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide of the multimer is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA sponge, or anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). However, other types of targeting oligonucleotides may be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0075">Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that comprise the general formula: X-L-[X-L]<sub>i</sub>-X, in which i is an integer, the value of which indicates the number of units of [X-L]<sub>i </sub>present in the compound, and in which each X is a targeting oligonucleotide and each L is a linker that links at least two Xs and that is more susceptible to cleavage in a mammalian extract than each X. In some embodiments, i is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more,</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0076">As used herein, the term âmammalian extractâ refers to a sample extracted from a mammalian tissue, cell or subcellular compartment (e.g., an endosome). Generally, a mammalian extract comprises one or more biomolecules (e.g., enzymes) from the tissue, cell or subcellular compartment. In some embodiments, a mammalian extract comprises one or more of a nuclease, peptidase, protease, phosphatase, oxidase, and reductase. The mammalian extract may be an extract from any tissue, including, for example, kidney, liver, intestinal or tumor tissue. The mammalian extract may be a cell extract or an extract from a subcellular component, such as a nuclear extract, or an endosomal extract.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0077">As used herein, the term âcleavageâ refers to the breaking of one or more chemical bonds in a relatively large molecule in a manner that produces two or more relatively small molecules. Cleavage in the mammalian extract may be mediated by a nuclease, peptidase, protease, phosphatase, oxidase, or reductase, for example. In some embodiments, the term âcleavable,â as used herein, refers to rapidly degradable linkers, such as, e.g., phosphodiester and disulfides, while the term ânoncleavableâ refer to more stable linkages, such as, e.g., nuclease-resistant phosphorothioates (e.g., a racemic mixture of Sp and Rp diastereoisomers, as used in the Examples below, or a backbone enriched in Sp form).

      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0084">In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds comprises ASOs. The invention provides in some embodiments multimeric oligonucleotide compounds, comprising two or more target-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), each ASO having a nuclease-resistant modified backbone, in which the targeting oligonucleotides are linked to each other by one or more degradable linkers. The term âmonomericâ or âmonomer,â in the context of targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs), refers to an targeting oligonucleotide that (i) is directed to a single site or a single contiguous stretch of nucleotides on a target and (ii) is not covalently linked to the another targeting oligonucleotide directed to the same or another site on the same or another target. Multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are not monomeric because they contain targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) that are covalently linked to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0085">The number of targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) in a multimeric oligonucleotide compound of the invention may be two or more, three or more, four or more, etc. For example, a multimeric oligonucleotide compound may contain 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more individual Targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) directed to one or more targets. The individual Targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) can be specific to the same or different targets. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, in some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is a dimer comprising two targeting oligonucleotides specific to the same target, or a dimer comprising two targeting oligonucleotides specific to two different targets, or alternatively, a trimer comprising three targeting oligonucleotides specific to the same target, or a trimer comprising three targeting oligonucleotides specific three different targets, etc. In some cases, the individual targeting oligonucleotides can be specific to the same target, yet directed to distinct target sites on the target, such as two sites on the target sequence that are separated by at least 10, 20, 50, 100, 300 or more nucleotides. In some embodiments, the target sites can be directly adjacent to each other and not separated by any intervening sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0086">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, the multimers can be linear or branched or a combination thereof. For example, two ASO may be connected head-to-tail (5â²-to-3â²-linear) (type A) or as in type B, tail-to-tail (3â²-to-3â²-branched); the ASOs could also be connected head-to-head (5â²-to-5â²-branched). Similarly, three or more antisense molecules can be connected (examples C, D, E in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>). In an alternative embodiment, the multimer can be in the form of a circular nucleic acid.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0088">In some embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotides provided herein comprise two or more targeting oligonucleotides linked together by a cleavable linker. In some embodiments, each targeting oligonucleotide has a region complementary to a target region of a genomic target sequence. In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), siRNA (e.g., a single stranded siRNA), miRNA sponge, or anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (AMO). In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotide binds specifically to a target RNA in a cell and brings about degradation of the RNA. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by RNAse H. In some embodiments, the degradation is mediated by an RNAi pathway. It should be appreciated that unless otherwise apparent from context âa targeting oligonucleotideâ or âthe targeting oligonucleotideâ as referred to herein, generally means at least one of the targeting oligonucleotides present in a multimeric compound. Similarly, it should be appreciated that unless otherwise apparent from context âa linkerâ or âthe linker,â as referred to herein, generally means at least one of the linkers present in a multimeric compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0089">In some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide may be a single stranded siRNA. Single stranded siRNAs (ss-siRNAs) are a viable therapeutic strategy for gene targeting (see, e.g., Lima et al. Single-Stranded siRNAs Activate RNAi in Animals. Cell 150, 883-894. 2012 and Yu et al. Single-Stranded RNAs Use RNAi to Potently and Allele-Selectively Inhibit Mutant Huntingtin Expression. Cell 150, 895-908. 2012). Additionally, it has been shown that chemical modifications such as, for example, inclusion of one or more phosphorothioate intemucleotide linkages, 2â²-fluoro-ribonucleotides, 2â² O-methyl-ribonucleotides, 2â²-methoxyethoxy-ribonucleotides, locked nucleic acids and/or 3â² terminal adenosine nucleotides increase the potency and/or stability of ss-siRNA both in vitro and in vivo (Lima et al. Single-Stranded siRNAs Activate RNAi in Animals. Cell 150, 883-894. 2012). Accordingly, in some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide is a single stranded siRNA comprising at least one of: phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages between at least two nucleotides, a 2â² O-methyl, a 2â²-methoxyethoxy, a 2â²-fluoro-deoxyribonucleotide, a locked nucleic acid and a 3â² terminal adenosine nucleotide or any other nucleotide modification disclosed herein. A 5â² phosphate group of an ss-siRNA may be important, in some embodiments, for maintaining activity in vivo and use of a 5â²phosphate analog may help to protect the 5â² phosphate group from degradation in vivo (Lima et al. Single-Stranded siRNAs Activate RNAi in Animals. Cell 150, 883-894. 2012). Accordingly, in some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide is a single stranded siRNA comprising a 5â² phosphate analog. In some embodiments, the 5â²phosphate analog is a 5â²-methylenephosphonate or a 5â²-(E)-vinylphosphate. Lipophilic modifications, such as conjugation to a lipophilic moiety, have also been shown to enhance ss-siRNA activity in vivo (Lima et al. Single-Stranded siRNAs Activate RNAi in Animals. Cell 150, 883-894. 2012). Thus, in some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide is a single stranded siRNA is linked to a lipophilic moiety.

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0090">As used herein, the term âgenomic target sequenceâ refers to a nucleotide sequence of clinical, therapeutic or research interest in a genome (e.g., a mammalian genome, e.g., a human or mouse genome). Typically, a genomic target sequence is a sequence of a genome that comprises a gene coding or regulatory region, or that is present within a gene coding or regulatory region. In some embodiments, a genomic target sequence is a sequence that encodes at least a portion of a gene. The gene may be an non-coding RNA gene or a protein coding gene. The non-coding RNA gene may be a long non-coding RNA gene or an miRNA gene, for example. The product of the gene may be an RNA or protein that mediates gene expression through an epigenetic mechanism. In other embodiments, a genomic target sequence is a sequence positioned in a regulatory region of one or more genes, such as a promoter, enhancer, silencer region, locus control region and other functional region of a genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0091">In some embodiments, the genomic target sequence is present in the sense strand of a gene. The sense strand or coding strand is the segment of double stranded DNA running from 5â²-3â² that is complementary to the antisense strand or template strand of a gene. The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the RNA transcribed from the gene (e.g., mRNA, IncRNA, or miRNA), which takes the antisense strand as its template during transcription.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0092">The âtarget regionâ of a genomic target sequence is a sequence of nucleotides that constitutes a hybridization site of a targeting oligonucleotide. The actual target oligonucleotide may hybridize with the genomic target itself (e.g., a promoter element) or an nucleic acid encoded by the genomic target sequence or containing the genomic target sequence (e.g., an lncRNA, miRNA, or mRNA). In some embodiments, the target region encodes a site on a transcribed RNA, and hybridization of a targeting oligonucleotide to the site results in inactivation or degradation of the transcribed RNA. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides hybridize to a transcribed RNA encoded by a genomic target sequence and inhibit the function and/or effect degradation of the transcribed RNA. The RNA may be, for example, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), microRNA, or mRNA.</p>

In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that immunoprecipitates with an antibody that targets a component of PRC2, or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that RNA region. In some embodiments, a PRC2-associated region is a region of an RNA that immunoprecipitates with an antibody that binds specifically to SUZ12, EED, EZH2 or RBBP4 (which as noted above are components of PRC2), or a region of genomic DNA that encodes that RNA region.</p>

      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0100">In some embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides interfere with the binding of and function of PRC2 by preventing recruitment of PRC2 to a specific chromosomal locus through lncRNAs. For example, in some embodiments, administration of multimeric oligonucleotide compounds comprising targeting oligonucleotides designed to specifically bind a PRC2-associated region of a lncRNA can stably displace not only the lncRNA, but also the PRC2 that binds to the lncRNA, from binding chromatin. Further, lncRNA can recruit PRC2 in a cis fashion, repressing gene expression at or near the specific chromosomal locus from which the lncRNA was transcribed. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein may be used to inhibit cis mediated gene repression by lncRNAs.</p>

      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0130">In some embodiments, both a sugar and an internucleoside linkage, i.e., the backbone, of the nucleotide units are replaced with novel groups. The base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, an oligonucleotide mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar-backbone of an oligonucleotide is replaced with an amide containing backbone, for example, an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of PNA compounds include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,539,082; 5,714,331; and 5,719,262, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. Further teaching of PNA compounds can be found in Nielsen et al, Science, 1991, 254, 1497-1500.</p>

      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0141">In illustrative embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides are targeting oligonucleotides that contain locked nucleic acid 3-8-3 gapmers which have a phosphorothioate backbone. However, in general, the chemistry of the oligonucleotide is not limited to LNA (2â²-O,4â²-C-methylene-bridged nucleic acids described, e.g., in PCT patent application WO 98/39352), LNA gapmers, or the phosphorothioate backbone, and can be expected to work with any chemistry for which the target knock-down using a monomeric ASO is effective. Such chemistries include, for instance, 2â²-O,4â²-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acids (ENA; European patent No. EP 1152009), hexitol nucleic acids (HNA; WO 93/25565 and WO 97/30064), fluoro-HNA, 2â²-deoxy-2â²-fluoro-13-D-arabino nucleic acids (FANA; EP 1088066), 2â²-modified analogs such as 2â²-O-methyl (2â²-OMe) and 2â²-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (MOE) modified nucleic acids, CeNA (EP 1210347 and EP 1244667) as well as phosphate-modified analogs such as phosphoroamidate, morpholinos, base-modified analogs, such as G-clamps (WO 99/24452) and 5-alkynyl-pyrimidines. Examples of LNA other gapmers are described in PCT patent applications published as WO 01/25248, WO 01/48190, WO 2003/085110, WO 2004/046160, WO 2008/113832, WO 2005/023825 and WO 2007/14651; examples of FANA/DNA/FANA gapmers are described in EP 1315807; examples of 2â²-OMe/FANA/2â²-OMe gapmers are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,673,611.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0142">The backbone may be stabilized by other modifications, for example, methylphosphonate or other chemistries. The antisense oligonucleotides of this invention can work via an RNase H mechanism, but can also work by steric blocking only, which also includes transcriptional gene silencing and transcriptional gene activation (see, e.g., Hawkins et al., 2009, Nucl. Acids Res., 37(9):2984-2995 and Schwartz et al., 2008, Nature Struct. Mol. Biol., 15:842-848). The dimer/multimer approach can also be combined with any modification which increases the delivery into cells, including lipophilic modifications, conjugates to cell surface receptors or ligands (e.g., folate), aptamers, etc. For example, to exploit the RNAse H mechanism, DNA:mRNA or gapmer:RNA duplexes need to be formed to permit RNAse to bind to the substrate. However, in the case of steric blocking, RNA:RNA, RNA:2â²-O-methyl-RNA, RNA:PNA or RNA:LNA duplexes (without a DNA gap) may be used. Thus, the ASO chemistry may be adjusted based on the intended use. Any chemistry suitable for the antisense oligonucleotides should be applicable to the dimer/multimer approach of the invention (for the state-of-the-art chemistries, see, e.g., Bennett and Swaize, 2009, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol., 50:259-293; Yokota at al., 2010, Arch. Neurol., 66:32-38; Aboul-Fadl, 2005, Curr. Med. Chem., 12:2193-2214; Kurreck, 2003, Eur. J. Biochem., 270:1628-1644).</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0143">In some illustrative embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides are 14-nucleotide long, but could be generally longer or shorter. For example, the targeting oligonucleotide could be 8-50-nucleotide long, or 10-40, 10-25, 8-20, 10-25, 12-25, 12-20, 12-16, 12-15, 12-14, 12-13, 13-16, 13-15, or 13-14 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, targeting oligonucleotides are so-called tiny LNAs, containing as few as 8 or fewer nucleotides (see, e.g., Obad et al. (2011) Nature Genetics, 43:371).</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0144">Further, in some embodiments, a targeting oligonucleotide (e.g., ASO) comprises at least 7 contiguous nucleotides complementary to the target sequence. In further embodiments, targeting oligonucleotide (e.g., ASO) comprises at least 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, or 40 contiguous nucleotides complementary to a target sequence. Due to specificities and isoform variations, ASO may additionally comprise 1, 2, 3 or more non-complementary nucleotides, either within the contiguous sequences or flanking them. In some embodiments, at least one or all of the targeting oligonucleotides are gapmers. In other embodiments, the targeting oligonucleotides (e.g., ASOs) are XâNâY gapmers, wherein at X or Y contains 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more modified nucleotides, e.g., LNA, ENA, FANA, G-clamp, and N is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 deoxynucleotides with non-modified sugars. For example, ASO can be a 3-8-3, 2-10-2, 3-9-2, 2-9-3, 2-8-2, 3-7-2, 2-7-3 gapmer or another type of gapmer or mixmer.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0145">D. Linkers</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0146">The term âlinkerâ generally refers to a chemical moiety that is capable of covalently linking two or more targeting oligonucleotides, in which at least one bond comprised within the linker is capable of being cleaved (e.g., in a biological context, such as in a mammalian extract, such as an endosomal extract), such that at least two targeting oligonucleotides are no longer covalently linked to one another after bond cleavage. It will be appreciated that a provided linker may include a region that is non-cleavable, as long as the linker also comprises at least one bond that is cleavable.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0147">In some embodiments, the linker comprises a polypeptide that is more susceptible to cleavage by an endopeptidase in the mammalian extract than the targeting oligonucleotides. The endopeptidase may be a trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thermolysin, pepsin, or endopeptidase V8. The endopeptidase may be a cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cathepsin L, cathepsin C, papain, cathepsin S or endosomal acidic insulinase. For example, the linker comprise a peptide having an amino acid sequence selected from: ALAL (SEQ ID NO: 125), APISFFELG (SEQ ID NO: 126), FL, GFN, R/KXX, GRWHTVGLRWE (SEQ ID NO: 127), YL, GF, and FF, in which X is any amino acid.</p>

In some embodiments, the linker does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region of the genomic target sequence that is contiguous with two flanking target regions. In some embodiments, the linker does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a self-complementary nucleotide sequence and does not comprise an oligonucleotide having a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a region of the genomic target sequence that is contiguous with two flanking target regions of the particular linker. In some embodiments, the at least one L is a linker that does not comprise an oligonucleotide having an abasic site.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0151">In some embodiments, at least one L is a linker derived from one or more molecules in Table 2.1.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0152">In other embodiments, multimeric oligonucleotide compounds are provided that comprise at least two targeting oligonucleotides each of which is linked to one or two other targeting oligonucleotides through a linker. In some embodiments, at least one linker is 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more sensitive to enzymatic cleavage in the presence of a mammalian extract than at least two targeting oligonucleotides. It should be appreciated that different linkers can be designed to be cleaved at different rates and/or by different enzymes in compounds comprising two or more linkers. Similarly different linkers can be designed to be sensitive to cleavage in different tissues, cells or subcellular compartments in compounds comprising two or more linkers. This can advantageously permit compounds to have targeting oligonucleotides that are released from compounds at different rates, by different enzymes, or in different tissues, cells or subcellular compartments thereby controlling release of the monomeric oligonucleotides to a desired in vivo location or at a desired time following administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0153">In some embodiments, the invention also provides ASO multimers comprising targeting oligonucleotides having nuclease-resistant backbone (e.g., phosphorothioate), wherein the targeting oligonucleotides are linked to each other by one or more cleavable linkers.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0154">In certain embodiments, linkers are stable in plasma, blood or serum which are richer in exonucleases, and less stable in the intracellular environments which are relatively rich in endonucleases. The intracellular stability of linkers can be assessed in vitro or in vivo as described in the Examples. In some embodiments, a linker is considered ânon-cleavableâ if the linker's half-life is at least 24, or 28, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96 hours or longer under the conditions described here, such as in liver homogenates. Conversely, in some embodiments, a linker is considered âcleavableâ if the half-life of the linker is at most 10, or 8, 6, 5 hours or shorter.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0155">In some embodiments, the linker is a nuclease-cleavable oligonucleotide linker. In some embodiments, the nuclease-cleavable linker contains one or more phosphodiester bonds in the oligonucleotide backbone. For example, the linker may contain a single phosphodiester bridge or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more phosphodiester linkages, for example as a string of 1-10 deoxynucleotides, e.g., dT, or ribonucleotides, e.g., rU, in the case of RNA linkers. In the case of dT or other DNA nucleotides dN in the linker, in certain embodiments the cleavable linker contains one or more phosphodiester linkages. In other embodiments, in the case of rU or other RNA nucleotides rN, the cleavable linker may consist of phosphorothioate linkages only. In contrast to phosphorothioate-linked deoxynucleotides, which are only cleaved slowly by nucleases (thus termed ânoncleavableâ), phosphorothioate-linked rU undergoes relatively rapid cleavage by ribonucleases and therefore is considered cleavable herein. It is also possible to combine dN and rN into the linker region, which are connected by phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkages. In other embodiments, the linker can also contain chemically modified nucleotides, which are still cleavable by nucleases, such as, e.g., 2â²-O-modified analogs. In particular, 2â²-O-methyl or 2â²-fluoro nucleotides can be combined with each other or with dN or rN nucleotides. Generally, in the case of nucleotide linkers, the linker is a part of the multimer that is usually not complementary to a target, although it could be. This is because the linker is generally cleaved prior to targeting oligonucleotides action on the target, and therefore, the linker identity with respect to a target is inconsequential. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a linker is an (oligo)nucleotide linker that is not complementary to any of the targets against which the targeting oligonucleotides are designed.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0156">In some embodiments, the cleavable linker is oligonucleotide linker that contains a continuous stretch of deliberately introduced Rp phosphorothioate stereoisomers (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7 or longer stretches). The Rp stereoisoform, unlike Sp isoform, is known to be susceptible to nuclease cleavage (Krieg et al., 2003, Oligonucleotides, 13:491-499). Such a linker would not include a racemic mix of PS linkages oligonucleotides since the mixed linkages are relatively stable and are not likely to contain long stretches of the Rp stereoisomers, and therefore, considered ânon-cleavableâ herein. Thus, in some embodiments, a linker comprises a stretch of 4, 5, 6, 7 or more phosphorothioated nucleotides, wherein the stretch does not contain a substantial amount or any of the Sp stereoisoform. The amount could be considered substantial if it exceeds 10% on per-mole basis.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0157">In some embodiments, the linker is a non-nucleotide linker, for example, a single phosphodiester bridge. Another example of such cleavable linkers is a chemical group comprising a disulfide bond, for example, â(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>SâS(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>m</sub>â, wherein n and m are integers from 0 to 10. In illustrative embodiments, n=m=6. Additional example of non-nucleotide linkers are described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0158">The cleavable linkers may be present in other linear or branched multimers. For example in some branched embodiments, the cleavable linker comprises a âdoubler,â âtrebler,â or another branching chemical group with multiple âarmsâ that link phosphodiester linked nucleotides, as for example, illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref> and Formulas IV, V, and VIII. In some linear embodiments, cleavable linkers can be incorporated as shown in Formulas I and II.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0159">The linker can be designed so as to undergo a chemical or enzymatic cleavage reaction. Chemical reactions involve, for example, cleavage in acidic environment (e.g., endosomes), reductive cleavage (e.g., cytosolic cleavage) or oxidative cleavage (e.g., in liver microsomes). The cleavage reaction can also be initiated by a rearrangement reaction. Enzymatic reactions can include reactions mediated by nucleases, peptidases, proteases, phosphatases, oxidases, reductases, etc. For example, a linker can be pH-sensitive, cathepsin-sensitive, or predominantly cleaved in endosomes and/or cytosol.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0160">In some embodiments, the linker comprises a peptide. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises a peptide which includes a sequence that is cleavable by an endopeptidase. In addition to the cleavable peptide sequence, the linker may comprise additional amino acid residues and/or non-peptide chemical moieties, such as an alkyl chain. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu (SEQ ID NO.: 125), which is a substrate for cathepsin B. See, for example, the maleimidocaproyl-Arg-Arg-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu (SEQ ID NO.: 136) linkers described in Schmid et al, Bioconjugate Chem 2007, 18, 702-716. In certain embodiments, a cathepsin B-cleavable linker is cleaved in tumor cells. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises Ala-Pro-Ile-Ser-Phe-Phe-Glu-Leu-Gly (SEQ ID NO.: 126), which is a substrate for cathepsins D, L, and B (see, for example, Fischer et al, Chembiochem 2006, 7, 1428-1434). In certain embodiments, a cathepsin-cleavable linker is cleaved in HeLA cells. In some embodiments, the linker comprises Phe-Lys, which is a substrate for cathepsin B. For example, in certain embodiments, the linker comprises Phe-Lys-p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). See, e.g., the maleimidocaproyl-Phe-Lys-PABA linker described in Walker et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002, 12, 217-219. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises Gly-Phe-2-naphthylamide, which is a substrate for cathepsin C (see, for example, Berg et al. Biochem. J. 1994, 300, 229-235). In certain embodiments, a cathepsin C-cleavable linker is cleaved in hepatocytes, In some embodiments, the linker comprises a cathepsin S cleavage site. For example, in some embodiments, the linker comprises Gly-Arg-Trp-His-Thr-Val-Gly-Leu-Arg-Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.: 127), Gly-Arg-Trp-Pro-Pro-Met-Gly-Leu-Pro-Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.: 137), or Gly-Arg-Trp-His-Pro-Met-Gly-Ala-Pro-Trp-Glu (SEQ ID NO.: 138), for example, as described in Lutzner et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2008, 283, 36185-36194. In certain embodiments, a cathepsin S-cleavable linker is cleaved in antigen presenting cells. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a papain cleavage site. Papain typically cleaves a peptide having the sequence âR/KâXâX (see Chapman et al, Annu. Rev. Physiol 1997, 59, 63-88). In certain embodiments, a papain-cleavable linker is cleaved in endosomes. In some embodiments, the linker comprises an endosomal acidic insulinase cleavage site. For example, in some embodiments, the linker comprises Tyr-Leu, Gly-Phe, or Phe-Phe (see, e.g., Authier et al, FEBS Lett. 1996, 389, 55-60). In certain embodiments, an endosomal acidic insulinase-cleavable linker is cleaved in hepatic cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0161">In some embodiments, the linker is pH sensitive. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile bond. As used herein, a low-pH labile bond is a bond that is selectively broken under acidic conditions (pH&lt;7). Such bonds may also be termed endosomally labile bonds, because cell endosomes and lysosomes have a pH less than 7. For example, in certain embodiments, the linker comprises an amine, an imine, an ester, a benzoic imine, an amino ester, a diortho ester, a polyphosphoester, a polyphosphazene, an acetal, a vinyl ether, a hydrazone, an azidomethyl-methylmaleic anhydride, a thiopropionate, a masked endosomolytic agent or a citraconyl group.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0162">In certain embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile bond selected from the following: ketals that are labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH less than 7, greater than about 4) to form a diol and a ketone; acetals that are labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH less than 7, greater than about 4) to form a diol and an aldehyde; imines or iminiums that are labile in acidic environments (e.g., pH less than 7, greater than about 4) to form an amine and an aldehyde or a ketone; silicon-oxygen-carbon linkages that are labile under acidic condition; silicon-nitrogen (silazane) linkages; silicon-carbon linkages (e.g., arylsilanes, vinylsilanes, and allylsilanes); maleamates (amide bonds synthesized from maleic anhydride derivatives and amines); ortho esters; hydrazones; activated carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) designed to undergo acid catalyzed hydrolysis); or vinyl ethers. Further examples may be found in International Patent Appln. Pub. No. WO 2008/022309, entitled POLYCONJUGATES FOR IN VIVO DELIVERY OF POLYNUCLEOTIDES, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0163">Organosilanes (e.g., silyl ethers, silyl enol ethers) are used as oxygen protecting groups in organic synthesis. Silicon-oxygen-carbon linkages are susceptible to hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form silanols and an alcohol (or enol). The substitution on both the silicon atom and the alcohol carbon can affect the rate of hydrolysis due to steric and electronic effects. This allows for the possibility of tuning the rate of hydrolysis of the silicon-oxygen-carbon linkage by changing the substitution on either the organosilane, the alcohol, or both the organosilane and alcohol. In addition, charged or reactive groups, such as amines or carboxylate, may be attached to the silicon atom, which confers the labile compound with charge and/or reactivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0164">Hydrolysis of a silazane leads to the formation of a silanol and an amine. Silazanes are inherently more susceptible to hydrolysis than is the silicon-oxygen-carbon linkage, however, the rate of hydrolysis is increased under acidic conditions. The substitution on both the silicon atom and the amine can affect the rate of hydrolysis due to steric and electronic effects. This allows for the possibility of tuning the rate of hydrolysis of the silazane by changing the substitution on either the silicon or the amine.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0165">Another example of a pH labile bond is an acid labile enol ether bond. The rate at which this labile bond is cleaved depends on the structures of the carbonyl compound formed and the alcohol released. For example analogs of ethyl isopropenyl ether, which may be synthesized from Î²-haloethers, generally have shorter half lives than analogs of ethyl cyclohexenyl ether, which may be synthesized from phenol ethers</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0166">Reaction of an anhydride with an amine forms an amide and an acid. Typically, the reverse reaction (formation of an anhydride and amine) is very slow and energetically unfavorable. However, if the anhydride is a cyclic anhydride, reaction with an amine yields a molecule in which the amide and the acid are in the same molecule, an amide acid. The presence of both reactive groups (the amide and the carboxylic acid) in the same molecule accelerates the reverse reaction. In certain embodiments, the linker comprises maleamic acid. Cleavage of the amide acid to form an amine and an anhydride is pH-dependent, and is greatly accelerated at acidic pH. This pH-dependent reactivity can be exploited to form reversible pH-sensitive bonds and linkers. Cis-aconitic acid has been used as such a pH-sensitive linker molecule. The Î³-carboxylate is first coupled to a molecule. In a second step, either the Î± or Î² carboxylate is coupled to a second molecule to form a pH-sensitive coupling of the two molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0167">In some embodiments, the linker comprises a benzoic imine as a low-pH labile bond. See, for example, the conjugates described in Zhu et al, Langmuir 2012, 28, 11988-96; Ding et al, Bioconjug. Chem. 2009, 20, 1163-70.</p>

In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile ketal (see, e.g., Abraham et al, J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 2011, 22, 1001-22) or acetal (see, e.g., Liu et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 1500). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile 4-(4â²-acetylphenoxy)butanoic acid linker (see, e.g., DiJoseph et al, Blood 2004, 103, 1807-14). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile cis-aconityl linker (see, e.g., Haas et al, J. Drug Target 2002, 10, 81-9; Ahmad et al, Anticancer Res. 1990, 10, 837-43; Dillman et al, Cancer Res. 1988, 48, 6097-102). In some embodiments, the linker comprises a low pH-labile diortho ester (see, e.g, Guo et al, Bioconjug. Chem. 2001, 12, 291-300).</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0169">In some embodiments, the linker comprises a masked endosomolytic agent. Endosomolytic polymers are polymers that, in response to a change in pH, are able to cause disruption or lysis of an endosome or provide for escape of a normally membrane-impermeable compound, such as a polynucleotide or protein, from a cellular internal membrane-enclosed vesicle, such as an endosome or lysosome. A subset of endosomolytic compounds is fusogenic compounds, including fusogenic peptides. Fusogenic peptides can facilitate endosomal release of agents such as oligomeric compounds to the cytoplasm. See, for example, US Patent Application Publication Nos. 20040198687, 20080281041, 20080152661, and 20090023890, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0170">The linker can also be designed to undergo an organ/tissue-specific cleavage. For example, for certain targets, which are expressed in multiple tissues, only the knock-down in liver may be desirable, as knock-down in other organs may lead to undesired side effects. Thus, linkers susceptible to liver-specific enzymes, such as pyrrolase (TPO) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), can be engineered, so as to limit the antisense effect to the liver mainly. Alternatively, linkers not susceptible to liver enzymes but susceptible to kidney-specific enzymes, such as gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, can be engineered, so that the antisense effect is limited to the kidneys mainly. Analogously, intestine-specific peptidases cleaving Phe-Ala and Leu-Ala could be considered for orally administered multimeric targeting oligonucleotides. Similarly, by placing an enzyme recognition site into the linker, which is recognized by an enzyme over-expressed in tumors, such as plasmin (e.g., PHEA-D-Val-Leu-Lys recognition site), tumor-specific knock-down should be feasible. By selecting the right enzyme recognition site in the linker, specific cleavage and knock-down should be achievable in many organs. In addition, the linker can also contain a targeting signal, such as N-acetyl galactosamine for liver targeting, or folate, vitamin A or RGD-peptide in the case of tumor or activated macrophage targeting. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the cleavable linker is organ- or tissue-specific, for example, liver-specific, kidney-specific, intestine-specific, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0171">The targeting oligonucleotides can be linked through any part of the individual targeting oligonucleotide, e.g., via the phosphate, the sugar (e.g., ribose, deoxyribose), or the nucleobase. In certain embodiments, when linking two oligonucleotides together, the linker can be attached e.g. to the 5â²-end of the first oligonucleotide and the 3â²-end of the second nucleotide, to the 5â²-end of the first oligonucleotide and the 5â²end of the second nucleotide, to the 3â²-end of the first oligonucleotide and the 3â²-end of the second nucleotide. In other embodiments, when linking two oligonucleotides together, the linker can attach internal residues of each oligonucleotides, e.g., via a modified nucleobase. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that many such permutations are available for multimers.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0172">The linkers described herein can also be used to attach other moieties to an oligonucleotide. Such moieties include lipophilic moieties, targeting moieties (e.g., a ligand of a cell surface receptor), and tags (e.g., a fluorescent moiety for imaging or an affinity tag such as biotin). In some embodiments, the linkers described herein may be used to attach targeting moieties to an oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is a carbohydrate. Carbohydrate targeting moieties are known in the art and include, for example, monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, and polysaccharides (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,106,022, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Exemplary carbohydrate targeting moieties include galactose, mannose, mannose-6-phosphate, N-Acetyl-Galactosylamine (GalNAc), N-Acetyl-Glucosamine (GluNAc). Multiple copies, e.g., two, three, four, five, or more, of these carbohydrates are also contemplated. Other targeting moieties, such as a ligand for a cell surface receptor or an antibody or fragment thereof may also be used, Exemplary ligands for cell surface receptors include EGF, asialoglycoprotein, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide, asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) peptide, folate, transferrin, and GM-CSF (see, e.g., Allen. Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy. Nature 750, 2002, Vol 2). Antibodies include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as fragments such as Fab, F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, Fabâ², scFv, and sdAb. Exemplary targeting antibodies include anti-VEGFR, anti-ERBB2, anti-CD20, anti-CD22, anti-CD19, anti-CD33, anti-CD25, anti-HLA-DR10beta, anti-tenascin, anti-CEA, anti-MUC1, and anti-TAG72. Still other suitable targeting moieties will be apparent to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0173">In certain embodiments, the linker is attached to an oligonucleotide via click chemistry (for a review of using click chemistry with DNA, see El-Sagheer et al, Chem. Soc. Rev. 2010, 39, 1388-1405). The term âclick chemistryâ is used to describe any facile reaction that occurs in high yields, under mild conditions, and in the presence of diverse functional groups, but it is most commonly used to refer to a [3+2]azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Such reactions are generally catalyzed by Cu<sup>I </sup>and proceed in the presence of functional groups typically encountered in biological molecules. In some embodiments, an unnatural base is introduced into the oligonucleotide, wherein the base is modified to comprise an alkyne or azide.</p>

      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0185">E. Targets and Uses</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0186">The disclosure provides a method of inhibiting target expression levels of one or more targets, comprising administering to a cell or a subject the compounds of the invention in an amount effective to inhibit the expression of the target(s). In certain embodiments, the target is an mRNA. In other embodiments, the target could be a microRNA, as described above. In such cases, the individual targeting oligonucleotides may be referred to as âantagomiRs.â In other embodiments, the target can be a non-coding RNA naturally expressed in the cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0187">The subjects treated according to the methods of the invention can be animals, including humans, primates, and rodents. Cells can be present in vitro, or treated ex vivo. In some cases, ex vivo treated cells are re-administered to the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0188">The invention also encompasses dual and multiple target antisense inhibitors, in particular those to treat liver diseases, metabolic diseases, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological diseases, viral, bacterial, parasitic, or prion infections and cancer. In particular, it includes the use of dimeric antisense inhibitors to inhibit liver targets (also referred to as âhepatic targetsâ), such as ApoB and ApoC3 dual inhibition. Since knock-down of ApoB has been reported to lead to undesired lipid deposition in the liver, the simultaneous knock-down of ApoC3 can decrease this side effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0189">In cancer, the simultaneous knock-down of two targets can lead to synergistic anti-tumor effects. In particular, combination of targets with different mechanisms of action and signaling pathways should be of interest, e.g., a combination of cytostatic mechanism with anti-metastatic mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0190">By selecting appropriate sequences against various cancer or tumor related targets, the present invention is also suitable for cancer treatment. Thus, it is possible to use multimeric oligonucleotide compounds of the invention that comprise targeting oligonucleotides which are directed 1) against targets responsible for the differentiation, development, or growth of cancers, such as: oncoproteins or transcription factors, e.g., c-myc, N-myc, c-myb, c-fos, c-fos/jun, PCNA, p120, EJ-ras, c-Ha-ras, N-ras, rrg, bcl-2, bcl-x, bcl-w, cdc-2, c-raf-1, c-mos, c-src, c-abl, c-ets; 2) against cellular receptors, such as EGF receptor, Her-2, c-erbA, VEGF receptor (KDR-1), retinoid receptors; 3) against protein kinases, c-fms, Tie-2, c-raf-1 kinase, PKC-alpha, protein kinase A (R1 alpha); 4) against growth or angiogenic factors, such as bFGF, VEGF, EGF, HB-EGF, PDGF and TGF-Î²; 5) against cytokines, such as IL-10, against cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin-E; 6) against tumor proteins, such as MAT-8; or 7) against inhibitors of tumor suppressor genes such as MDM-2. Also of use are antisense or directed against 8) components of spindle formation, such as eg5 and PLK1, or 9) against targets to suppress metastasis, such as CXCR4. Of use are antisense sequences directed against 10) factors which suppress apoptosis, such as survivin, stat3 and hdm2, or which suppress the expression of multiple drug resistance genes, such as MDR1 (P-glycoprotein).</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0191">The dimer/multimer can also degrade or antagonize microRNA (miRNA) which are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 21-23 nucleotides in length regulating gene expression. miRNAs are encoded by genes that are transcribed from DNA but not translated into protein (non-coding RNA); instead they are processed from primary transcripts known as pri-miRNA to short stem-loop structures called pre-miRNA and finally to functional miRNA. Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, and their main function is to down-regulate gene expression. It appears that many miRNA sequences discovered in the human genome contribute to the development of cancer. Some miRNAs are significantly deregulated in cancer. Further, miRNA which is over-expressed (e.g., TGF-Î²2 receptor, RB1 and PLAG1) leading to tumor growth can be down-regulated using antisense approaches as described before. An miRNA expression signature of human solid tumors defining cancer gene targets was reported, for example, by Volinia et al., PNAS, 2006, 103, 2257-61.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0192">Further provided are pharmaceutical compositions, comprising a compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Methods of formulating and administering oligonucleotides to a cell or a subject are known in the art (see, e.g., Hardee, Gregory E.; Tillman, Lloyd G.; Geary, Richard S.

      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0193">In some embodiments, the compound of the invention possesses additional desirable properties such as a level of purity, a salt concentration, and/or an endotoxin level. In some embodiments, the level of purity is greater than 75% pure. In some embodiments, the compound is provided in a lyophilized formulation in an amount of 10 mg to 100 mg (e.g., about 50 mg). In some embodiments, the compound is provided in a formulation with a counter ion, such as, for example, sodium. In some embodiments, the endotoxin level is at or below 1000 entoxoin units (EU)/gram.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0194">In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention possess favorable pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, in some case, a therapeutically effective knockdown of the target(s) persists for two weeks or longer following the administration. In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention are characterized by one or more of the following properties when administered in vivo:</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0195">(d) increased concentration in the liver (or other tissues) and reduced clearance by kidneys as compared to respective monomeric targeting oligonucleotides;</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0196">(e) longer duration of target knockdown as compared to respective monomeric targeting oligonucleotides; and</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0197">(f) lower effective concentrations as compared to respective monomeric targeting oligonucleotides and/or the same multimeric oligonucleotide compound, wherein the cleavable linker is substituted with a noncleavable linker.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0198">F. Routes of Delivery</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0199">A composition that includes a multimeric oligonucleotide compound can be delivered to a subject by a variety of routes. Exemplary routes include: intravenous, intradermal, topical, rectal, parenteral, anal, intravaginal, intranasal, pulmonary, ocular. The term âtherapeutically effective amountâ is the amount of multimeric oligonucleotide compound present in the composition that is needed to provide the desired level of target gene modulation (e.g., inhibition or activation) in the subject to be treated to give the anticipated physiological response. The term âphysiologically effective amountâ is that amount delivered to a subject to give the desired palliative or curative effect. The term âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ means that the carrier can be administered to a subject with no significant adverse toxicological effects to the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0200">The multimeric oligonucleotide compound molecules of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically include one or more species of multimeric oligonucleotide compounds and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0201">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic, vaginal, rectal, intranasal, transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, or intrathecal or intraventricular administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0202">The route and site of administration may be chosen to enhance targeting. For example, to target muscle cells, intramuscular injection into the muscles of interest would be a logical choice. Lung cells might be targeted by administering the multimeric oligonucleotide compound in aerosol form. The vascular endothelial cells could be targeted by coating a balloon catheter with the multimeric oligonucleotide compound and mechanically introducing the oligonucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0203">Topical administration refers to the delivery to a subject by contacting the formulation directly to a surface of the subject. The most common form of topical delivery is to the skin, but a composition disclosed herein can also be directly applied to other surfaces of the body, e.g., to the eye, a mucous membrane, to surfaces of a body cavity or to an internal surface. As mentioned above, the most common topical delivery is to the skin. The term encompasses several routes of administration including, but not limited to, topical and transdermal. These modes of administration typically include penetration of the skin's permeability barrier and efficient delivery to the target tissue or stratum. Topical administration can be used as a means to penetrate the epidermis and dermis and ultimately achieve systemic delivery of the composition. Topical administration can also be used as a means to selectively deliver oligonucleotides to the epidermis or dermis of a subject, or to specific strata thereof, or to an underlying tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0204">Formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0205">Transdermal delivery is a valuable route for the administration of lipid soluble therapeutics. The dermis is more permeable than the epidermis and therefore absorption is much more rapid through abraded, burned or denuded skin. Inflammation and other physiologic conditions that increase blood flow to the skin also enhance transdermal adsorption. Absorption via this route may be enhanced by the use of an oily vehicle (inunction) or through the use of one or more penetration enhancers. Other effective ways to deliver a composition disclosed herein via the transdermal route include hydration of the skin and the use of controlled release topical patches. The transdermal route provides a potentially effective means to deliver a composition disclosed herein for systemic and/or local therapy. In addition, iontophoresis (transfer of ionic solutes through biological membranes under the influence of an electric field), phonophoresis or sonophoresis (use of ultrasound to enhance the absorption of various therapeutic agents across biological membranes, notably the skin and the cornea), and optimization of vehicle characteristics relative to dose position and retention at the site of administration may be useful methods for enhancing the transport of topically applied compositions across skin and mucosal sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0206">Both the oral and nasal membranes offer advantages over other routes of administration. For example, oligonucleotides administered through these membranes may have a rapid onset of action, provide therapeutic plasma levels, avoid first pass effect of hepatic metabolism, and avoid exposure of the oligonucleotides to the hostile gastrointestinal (GI) environment. Additional advantages include easy access to the membrane sites so that the oligonucleotide can be applied, localized and removed easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0207">In oral delivery, compositions can be targeted to a surface of the oral cavity, e.g., to sublingual mucosa which includes the membrane of ventral surface of the tongue and the floor of the mouth or the buccal mucosa which constitutes the lining of the cheek. The sublingual mucosa is relatively permeable thus giving rapid absorption and acceptable bioavailability of many agents. Further, the sublingual mucosa is convenient, acceptable and easily accessible.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0208">A pharmaceutical composition of multimeric oligonucleotide compound may also be administered to the buccal cavity of a human being by spraying into the cavity, without inhalation, from a metered dose spray dispenser, a mixed micellar pharmaceutical formulation as described above and a propellant. In one embodiment, the dispenser is first shaken prior to spraying the pharmaceutical formulation and propellant into the buccal cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0209">Compositions for oral administration include powders or granules, suspensions or solutions in water, syrups, slurries, emulsions, elixirs or non-aqueous media, tablets, capsules, lozenges, or troches. In the case of tablets, carriers that can be used include lactose, sodium citrate and salts of phosphoric acid. Various disintegrants such as starch, and lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc, are commonly used in tablets. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents are lactose and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the nucleic acid compositions can be combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring agents can be added.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0210">Parenteral administration includes intravenous drip, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection, intrathecal or intraventricular administration. In some embodiments, parental administration involves administration directly to the site of disease (e.g. injection into a tumor).</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0211">Formulations for parenteral administration may include sterile aqueous solutions which may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled to render the preparation isotonic.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0212">Any of the multimeric oligonucleotide compounds described herein can be administered to ocular tissue. For example, the compositions can be applied to the surface of the eye or nearby tissue, e.g., the inside of the eyelid. For ocular administration, ointments or droppable liquids may be delivered by ocular delivery systems known to the art such as applicators or eye droppers. Such compositions can include mucomimetics such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or poly(vinyl alcohol), preservatives such as sorbic acid, EDTA or benzylchronium chloride, and the usual quantities of diluents and/or carriers. The multimeric oligonucleotide compound can also be administered to the interior of the eye, and can be introduced by a needle or other delivery device which can introduce it to a selected area or structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0213">Pulmonary delivery compositions can be delivered by inhalation by the patient of a dispersion so that the composition, preferably multimeric oligonucleotide compounds, within the dispersion can reach the lung where it can be readily absorbed through the alveolar region directly into blood circulation. Pulmonary delivery can be effective both for systemic delivery and for localized delivery to treat diseases of the lungs.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0214">Pulmonary delivery can be achieved by different approaches, including the use of nebulized, aerosolized, micellular and dry powder-based formulations. Delivery can be achieved with liquid nebulizers, aerosol-based inhalers, and dry powder dispersion devices. Metered-dose devices are preferred. One of the benefits of using an atomizer or inhaler is that the potential for contamination is minimized because the devices are self-contained. Dry powder dispersion devices, for example, deliver agents that may be readily formulated as dry powders. A multimeric oligonucleotide compound may be stably stored as lyophilized or spray-dried powders by itself or in combination with suitable powder carriers. The delivery of a composition for inhalation can be mediated by a dosing timing element which can include a timer, a dose counter, time measuring device, or a time indicator which when incorporated into the device enables dose tracking, compliance monitoring, and/or dose triggering to a patient during administration of the aerosol medicament.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0215">The term âpowderâ means a composition that consists of finely dispersed solid particles that are free flowing and capable of being readily dispersed in an inhalation device and subsequently inhaled by a subject so that the particles reach the lungs to permit penetration into the alveoli. Thus, the powder is said to be ârespirable.â Preferably the average particle size is less than about 10 Î¼m in diameter preferably with a relatively uniform spheroidal shape distribution. More preferably the diameter is less than about 7.5 Î¼m and most preferably less than about 5.0 Î¼m. Usually the particle size distribution is between about 0.1 Î¼m and about 5 Î¼m in diameter, particularly about 0.3 Î¼m to about 5 m.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0216">The term âdryâ means that the composition has a moisture content below about 10% by weight (% w) water, usually below about 5% w and preferably less it than about 3% w. A dry composition can be such that the particles are readily dispersible in an inhalation device to form an aerosol.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0217">The types of pharmaceutical excipients that are useful as carrier include stabilizers such as human serum albumin (HSA), bulking agents such as carbohydrates, amino acids and polypeptides; pH adjusters or buffers; salts such as sodium chloride; and the like. These carriers may be in a crystalline or amorphous form or may be a mixture of the two.</p>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0218">Suitable pH adjusters or buffers include organic salts prepared from organic acids and bases, such as sodium citrate, sodium ascorbate, and the like; sodium citrate is preferred. Pulmonary administration of a micellar multimeric oligonucleotide compound formulation may be achieved through metered dose spray devices with propellants such as tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoroethane, dimethylfluoropropane, tetrafluoropropane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether and other non-CFC and CFC propellants.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0219">Exemplary devices include devices which are introduced into the vasculature, e.g., devices inserted into the lumen of a vascular tissue, or which devices themselves form a part of the vasculature, including stents, catheters, heart valves, and other vascular devices. These devices, e.g., catheters or stents, can be placed in the vasculature of the lung, heart, or leg.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0220">Other devices include non-vascular devices, e.g., devices implanted in the peritoneum, or in organ or glandular tissue, e.g., artificial organs. The device can release a therapeutic substance in addition to a multimeric oligonucleotide compound, e.g., a device can release insulin.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0221">In one embodiment, unit doses or measured doses of a composition that includes multimeric oligonucleotide compound are dispensed by an implanted device. The device can include a sensor that monitors a parameter within a subject. For example, the device can include pump, e.g., and, optionally, associated electronics.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0222">Tissue, e.g., cells or organs can be treated with a multimeric oligonucleotide compound, ex vivo and then administered or implanted in a subject. The tissue can be autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic tissue. E.g., tissue can be treated to reduce graft v. host disease. In other embodiments, the tissue is allogeneic and the tissue is treated to treat a disorder characterized by unwanted gene expression in that tissue. E.g., tissue, e.g., hematopoietic cells, e.g., bone marrow hematopoietic cells, can be treated to inhibit unwanted cell proliferation. Introduction of treated tissue, whether autologous or transplant, can be combined with other therapies. In some implementations, the multimeric oligonucleotide compound treated cells are insulated from other cells, e.g., by a semi-permeable porous barrier that prevents the cells from leaving the implant, but enables molecules from the body to reach the cells and molecules produced by the cells to enter the body. In one embodiment, the porous barrier is formed from alginate.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0223">In one embodiment, a contraceptive device is coated with or contains a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. Exemplary devices include condoms, diaphragms, IUD (implantable uterine devices, sponges, vaginal sheaths, and birth control devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0224">G. Dosage</p>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0225">In one aspect, the invention features a method of administering a multimeric oligonucleotide compound to a subject (e.g., a human subject). In one embodiment, the unit dose is between about 10 mg and 25 mg per kg of bodyweight. In one embodiment, the unit dose is between about 1 mg and 100 mg per kg of bodyweight. In one embodiment, the unit dose is between about 0.1 mg and 500 mg per kg of bodyweight. In some embodiments, the unit dose is more than 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg per kg of bodyweight.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0226">The defined amount can be an amount effective to treat or prevent a disease or disorder, e.g., a disease or disorder associated with a particular target gene. The unit dose, for example, can be administered by injection (e.g., intravenous or intramuscular), an inhaled dose, or a topical application.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0227">In some embodiments, the unit dose is administered daily. In some embodiments, less frequently than once a day, e.g., less than every 2, 4, 8 or 30 days. In another embodiment, the unit dose is not administered with a frequency (e.g., not a regular frequency). For example, the unit dose may be administered a single time. In some embodiments, the unit dose is administered more than once a day, e.g., once an hour, two hours, four hours, eight hours, twelve hours, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0228">In one embodiment, a subject is administered an initial dose and one or more maintenance doses of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. The maintenance dose or doses are generally lower than the initial dose, e.g., one-half less of the initial dose. A maintenance regimen can include treating the subject with a dose or doses ranging from 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, e.g., 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, or 0.0001 mg per kg of bodyweight per day. The maintenance doses may be administered no more than once every 1, 5, 10, or 30 days. Further, the treatment regimen may last for a period of time which will vary depending upon the nature of the particular disease, its severity and the overall condition of the patient. In some embodiments the dosage may be delivered no more than once per day, e.g., no more than once per 24, 36, 48, or more hours, e.g., no more than once for every 5 or 8 days. Following treatment, the patient can be monitored for changes in his condition and for alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state. The dosage of the oligonucleotide may either be increased in the event the patient does not respond significantly to current dosage levels, or the dose may be decreased if an alleviation of the symptoms of the disease state is observed, if the disease state has been ablated, or if undesired side-effects are observed.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0229">The effective dose can be administered in a single dose or in two or more doses, as desired or considered appropriate under the specific circumstances. If desired to facilitate repeated or frequent infusions, implantation of a delivery device, e.g., a pump, semi-permanent stent (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracisternal or intracapsular), or reservoir may be advisable.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0230">Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the compound of the invention is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.0001 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0231">The concentration of the multimeric oligonucleotide compound is an amount sufficient to be effective in treating or preventing a disorder or to regulate a physiological condition in humans. The concentration or amount of multimeric oligonucleotide compound administered will depend on the parameters determined for the agent and the method of administration, e.g. nasal, buccal, pulmonary. For example, nasal formulations may tend to require much lower concentrations of some ingredients in order to avoid irritation or burning of the nasal passages. It is sometimes desirable to dilute an oral formulation up to 10-100 times in order to provide a suitable nasal formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0232">Certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of a multimeric oligonucleotide compound used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. For example, the subject can be monitored after administering a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. Based on information from the monitoring, an additional amount of the multimeric oligonucleotide compound can be administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0233">Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease condition to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of target gene expression levels in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual compounds, and can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In some embodiments, the animal models include transgenic animals that express a human target gene. In another embodiment, the composition for testing includes a multimeric oligonucleotide compound that is complementary, at least in an internal region, to a sequence that is conserved between target gene in the animal model and the target gene in a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0234">In one embodiment, the administration of the multimeric oligonucleotide compound is parenteral, e.g. intravenous (e.g., as a bolus or as a diffusible infusion), intradermal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intrathecal, intraventricular, intracranial, subcutaneous, transmucosal, buccal, sublingual, endoscopic, rectal, oral, vaginal, topical, pulmonary, intranasal, urethral or ocular. Administration can be provided by the subject or by another person, e.g., a health care provider. The composition can be provided in measured doses or in a dispenser which delivers a metered dose. Selected modes of delivery are discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0235">H. Kits</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0236">In certain aspects of the invention, kits are provided, comprising a container housing a composition comprising a multimeric oligonucleotide compound. In some embodiments, the composition is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a multimeric oligonucleotide compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, the individual components of the pharmaceutical composition may be provided in one container. Alternatively, it may be desirable to provide the components of the pharmaceutical composition separately in two or more containers, e.g., one container for multimeric oligonucleotide compounds, and at least another for a carrier compound. The kit may be packaged in a number of different configurations such as one or more containers in a single box. The different components can be combined, e.g., according to instructions provided with the kit. The components can be combined according to a method described herein, e.g., to prepare and administer a pharmaceutical composition. The kit can also include a delivery device.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0237">The following examples provide illustrative embodiments of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the numerous modifications and variations that may be performed without altering the spirit or scope of the present invention. Such modifications and variations are encompassed within the scope of the invention. The Examples do not in any way limit the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0238">Antisense oligonucleotides against ApoC3, ApoB, Hif-1alpha, survivin and B2M were either selected using a series of bioinformatics filters and computational design algorithms or were derived from the literature. They were selected to be 13, 14 or more nucleotides in length and tested using one or multiple chemical modification design patterns (for example, 3LNAs-8DNAs-3LNAs). The list of all targeting oligonucleotide sequences is given in Table 1 and specific chemical modification patterns are explicitly specified when data is presented. Factors taken into account during the design include species homology, alignment to multiple human transcripts, off-target matches, SNPs, exon-exon boundaries, coverage of the transcript, and statistical models of efficacy and polyA regions. For species homology human, rat, mouse and macaque sequences were considered. For off-target matches, putative sequences were searched against the human transcriptome and perfect matches were identified along with compounds that had only 1 or 2 mismatches. Preference was given to compounds with no perfect off-target matches, but compounds were selected with 1 or 2 mismatches if the compound met many of the other criteria. Statistical classification models were derived from existing in-house projects for other targeting oligonucleotide projects. These models were applied to the potential ASOs and preference given to those classified as active. Known SNPs, exon-exon boundaries and polyA regions were also avoided in the design when possible. Other ASO design features are also well known in the art, such as avoidance of immune stimulatory sequences such as CpG motifs, avoidance of poly G regions, and avoidance of toxic sequences such as certain poly-pyrimidine motifs.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show schematic representation of exemplary dimeric/multimeric constructs. Specifically, in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, two 14-mer gapmers (e.g., 3LNA-8DNA-3LNA) are connected via a cleavable linker, which can be cleaved by enzymes, such as nucleases, peptidases or by reduction or oxidation. It could also be a linker which is cleaved by a pH shift within the cells (e.g. acidic pH in endosomes). The two antisense gapmers can be identical (homo-dimer), which leads to suppression of a single target mRNA1. However, the two antisense gapmers can also have different sequences (hetero-dimer) which are complementary to two or more different targets and which will lead to inhibition of two targets (mRNA1 and mRNA2) or trimers or tetramers, etc., specific to 3, 4, or more different targets.</p>

      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0240">All oligonucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite protocols (Beaucage, S. L.; Caruthers, M. H. âDeoxynucleoside phosphoramiditesâA new class of key intermediates for deoxypolynucleotide synthesisâ. Tetrahedron Lett., 1981, 22:1859) on a MerMade 192 oligonucleotide synthesizer (BioAutomation) or Oligopilot 10 synthesizer (GE) at 200 to 1000 nmole scales employing standard CPG supports (BioSearch) or Glen UnySupport (Glen Research). The DNA, 2â²-OMe, 2â²-F, and G-clamp monomers were obtained from ChemGenes Corporation or Glen Research, and the LNA monomers were obtained from other commercially available sources. All phosphoramidites other than DNA were coupled with extended coupling times (e.g. 8 to 15 min for RNA, LNA, 2â²-O-Methyl, 2â²-Fluoro, 5-Propynyl and G-Clamps). After the synthesis, the oligonucleotides were cleaved from the support and deprotected using AMA (a 50:50 mixture of ammonium hydroxide and aqueous methylamine) at 65Â° C. for one hour or using aqueous ammonium hydroxide at 55Â° C. for 8 hours. The crude DMTr-on oligonucleotides were purified via DMTr-selective cartridge purification techniques and if necessary further purified via RP HPLC and desalted via cartridge-based methods. Alternatively, they were purified using ion exchange chromatography. The final oligonucleotides were characterized using LC-MS.</p>
      <p id="p-00273-en" num="0241">A C Technologies Solo VP Slope (Bridgewater, N.J.) reader equipped with âQuick Slopeâ software was used to determine the concentration of oligonucleotides. Fifty Î¼l of sample was required for the measurement in a micro quartz vessel. The instrument measured the change in absorbance at varying path lengths, utilizing Beer's Law to determine final concentrations. Extinction coefficients were calculated using the nearest neighbor model.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">(B) Synthesis of Linear Dimers and Trimers</heading>
      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0242">The synthesis of linear dimers and trimers was completed by linear addition of all monomers until the full length sequence was obtained on solid support. First, ASO 1 was completely synthesized followed by addition of the cleavable or noncleavable linker X (e.g., tri-thymidyl, tetra-thymidyl, tetra-uridyl, disulfide, etc.) and finally either ASO 1 (âhomoâ-dimer) or an ASO with another sequence ASO 2 (âheteroâ-dimer) and optionally directed against another target mRNA was added. The ASO synthesized first is connected to the linker X via its 5â²-end whereas the finally synthesized ASO is connected via 3â². This might lead to 3â²- and 5â²-modified metabolites after cleavage. Due to its linearity, a trimer, tetramer, or other multimer could be synthesized by adding a second, third, or more cleavable linker(s) followed by another ASO (1, 2 or 3).</p>

      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0252">For the synthesis of trimers with two different ASO molecules, the first ASO1 is synthesized by linear addition of all monomers until the full length sequence of ASO1 was obtained on solid support. Then, the cleavable (or noncleavable) linker X (tetrathymidyl, tetrauridyl, disulfide etc.) is synthesized followed by addition of the doubler using a symmetric doubler phosphoramidite (Glen Research, 10-1920) the solid phase synthesis of the linker X and ASO 1 was performed in parallel as indicated in the figure below.</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0253">After removal of the DMT protecting groups of the symmetric doubler, two ASO2 molecules are synthesized simultaneously from 3â² to 5â² direction using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. This results in a trimer consisting of two ASO2 molecules having two free 5â²-ends and one ASO1 molecule having one free 3â²-end of the structure shown in <figref>FIG. 1D</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00295-en" num="0254">For the synthesis of branched trimers consisting of three different ASO1, ASO2 and ASO3 molecules, the non-symmetric brancher phosphoramidite is coupled after first synthesis of ASO1, followed by sequential synthesis of ASO2 and ASO3. The non-symmetrical phosphoramidite structure is shown in Formula IX. The resulting trimer has the structure show in <figref>FIG. 1D</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0274">Stability measurements were performed using 4 different oligonucleotides (including dimers and the monomer, SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, 3, 4).</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0275">Briefly, oligos were incubated in 95% plasma of mouse or monkey and in 5% liver homogenate at a concentration of 30 Î¼M and at 37Â° C. Samples for measurement were taken after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h of incubation. Samples were subjected to a phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed using LC-MS.</p>
      <p id="p-00323-en" num="0276">In detail, stock solutions with a final concentration of 600 Î¼M and a final volume of 100 Î¼l have been prepared of all oligonucleotides. Twelve pieces of approximately 50 mg of liver from CD1 mouse (female, Charles River) were added to individual Lysing matrix tubes. A calculated volume of 1ÃPBS to give a final concentration of 5% liver (W/W) was added to each of the twelve tubes. All samples were homogenized using a BioRad Fast prep System. The resulting homogenate solutions were combined to give about 12 ml of 5% liver homogenate in 1ÃPBS which was subsequently used for incubation.</p>
      <p id="p-00324-en" num="0277">Plasmas used were a Na-Citrate plasma from female NMRI mice (Charles River) and K-EDTA plasma from male Cynomolgous monkeys (Seralab International).</p>
      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0278">Four samples of each oligo were prepared representing each individual incubation time point (0, 7, 24 and 48 h) in mouse and monkey plasma and in mouse liver homogenate, respectively. In addition, a blank sample and a recovery sample were prepared of each oligo and incubation matrix. Generally, plasma samples were prepared by adding 5 Î¼l of the 600 Î¼M oligo stock solution to 95 Î¼l of mouse or monkey plasma, respectively, with a final oligo concentration of 30 Î¼M. Recovery samples were prepared by adding 5 Î¼l of water to 95 Î¼l of plasma. Blank samples are oligo in water with a final concentration of 100 Î¼M. Liver samples and recoveries were prepared in the same way except that liver homogenate in PBS was used instead of plasma.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0279">All samples and recoveries were incubated at 37Â° C. Samples were cooled to room temperature after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h and was subjected to phenol/chloroform purification. To that end, 370 Î¼l of ammonium hydroxide (15%), 10 Î¼l dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 M, Sigma Cat. No. 43816) and 800 Î¼l premixed phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (Sigma P2069) was added to each sample. Samples were then vortexed for 10 min at a maximum vortex speed and incubated at 4Â° C. for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 3500 RFC for 20 min at 4Â° C. and 400 Î¼l of the aqueous layer were removed and dried in a lyophilizer.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0280">The dried samples were dissolved in water (100 Î¼l). The recovery samples were dissolved in water (95 Î¼l) and spiked with 5 Î¼l of the respective oligo stock solution (600 Î¼M).</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0281">Samples were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1200, Bruker Esquire 3000) using a Waters Acquity UPLC OST C18 column (1.7 Î¼m, 2.1Ã50) with HFIP/TEA/water (385 mM 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol, 14.4 mM triethylamine in water) as buffer A and methanol as buffer B at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and a column temperature of 60Â° C. The following gradient was used: 3 min at 5% B, 5-15% B in 2.5 min (10%/min), 15-23% B in 5.5 min, 23-30% B in 3 min, 30-100% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 100% B, 100-5% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 5% B.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0282">Samples were analyzed in 96-well plate format. A standard curve with 8 standards (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 Î¼g/ml; 25 Î¼g/ml IS), standard 0 (0 Î¼g/ml; 25 Î¼g/ml IS) and three recovery samples (20, 50, 100 Î¼g/ml; 25 Î¼g/ml IS) were prepared for each oligo. Samples related to one oligo were analyzed together on the same plate.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0283">Standards were prepared as follows. A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue was cut from the respective organ tissue, weighted and placed into the respective well of a 2.2 ml 96-deepwell plate (VWR 732-0585). Two steel balls (5 mm diameter, KGM Kugelfabrik GmbH, part No. 1.3541) were placed into each well and 500 Î¼l homogenization buffer (vide infra), 20 Î¼l DTT (1 M, Sigma 43816), 50 Î¼l of proteinase K solution (Qiagen, 19133) was added. Furthermore, 10 Î¼l working solution analyte and 10 Î¼l working solution internal standard was added into each well of the standards to give the corresponding final concentrations of (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 75, 90, 100 Î¼g/ml; 25 Î¼g/ml IS (Internal Standard)). Standard 0 and recovered material were spiked with 10 Î¼l of working solution internal standards only; recoveries were spiked with 10 Î¼l of working solution analyte after the entire extraction process and prior to analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0284">Samples were processed as follows. A piece of approximately 50 mg of tissue was cut from the respective organ tissue, weighed and placed into the respective well of a 96-deepwell plate. Two steel balls were placed into each well and 500 Î¼l homogenization buffer 20 Î¼l DTT (1 M), 50 Î¼l of proteinase K solution was added. The plate was sealed with STAR lab foils (StarLab E 2796 3070) and samples were homogenized using a Qiagen Tissue Lyzer 3Ã30 s at 17 Hz.

Subsequently, the plate was incubated for 10 min at 4Â° C. and centrifuged at 4Â° C. for another 10 min at 3500 RCF. The plate was then handled to the TomTec System which was used to remove the aqueous layer. The remaining organic layer was washed by adding 500 Î¼l water. The aqueous phase was again removed using the TomTec system. The aqueous phases were combined, 50 Î¼l HCl (1 N), 500 Î¼l SAX Load High buffer (vide infra) and 300 Î¼l acetonitrile was added and the resulting solution was mixed thoroughly by up and down pipetting using the TomTec system. (âThe program âSPE extraction of tissue samples 100416â was used for the subsequent solid-phase extraction procedure).</p>

      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0315">All samples and recoveries were incubated at 37Â° C. A sample of each oligo and type of matrix was cooled to room temperature after 0, 7, 24 and 48 h and was subjected to Phenol/Chloroform purification. To this end, 370 Î¼l of ammonium hydroxide (15%), 10 Î¼l dithiothreitole (DTT, 1 M, Sigma 43816) and 800 Î¼l premixed Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (Sigma P2069) was added to each sample. The sample was vortexed for 10 min at maximum vortex speed and then incubated at 4Â° C. for 20 min. Subsequently, the sample was centrifuged at 3500 RFC for 20 min at 4Â° C. and 400 Î¼l of the aqueous layer were removed and dried in a lyophilizer. The dried samples were dissolved in water (100 Î¼l). The recovery samples were dissolved in water (95 Î¼l) and spiked with 5 Î¼l of the respective oligo stock solution (600 Î¼M). Samples were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1200, Bruker Esquire 3000) using a Waters Acquity UPLC OST C18 column (1.7 Î¼m, 2.1Ã50) with HFIP/TEA/water (385 mM 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol, 14.4 mM triethylamine in water) as buffer A and methanol as buffer B and a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at a column temperature of 60Â° C. The following gradient was used: 3 min at 5% B, 5-15% B in 2.5 min (10%/min), 15-23% B in 5.5 min, 23-30% B in 3 min, 30-100% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 100% B, 100-5% B in 0.5 min, 5 min at 5% B.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0316">Surprisingly, the levels of dimers in the liver (organ target for ApoB and ApoC3) and kidney were dramatically increased after a single i.v. bolus injection. It was found that about 10 to 16% monomeric metabolite of the total dose in liver 24 hours after injection of the dimers (Table 5), while previously it was known that only 2 to 5% of the total dose of the monomeric 14-mer (SEQ ID NO: 1)) in mice or monkeys (Table 6) was detected in a separate study. Accordingly, dimers exhibited significantly higher biodistribution to liver and kidney as compared to the monomers. Table 5 shows organ-distribution of antisense dimers SEQ ID NO:2, 3 and 4 as percent of total administered dose 24 hrs after a single i.v. bolus injection into mice. (Peak 1 refers to the degradation product, whereas Peak 2 is remaining dimer starting material. The sum of both components represents the percentage of total dose in the corresponding organ.) Organ-distribution of monomeric SEQ ID NO: 1 as percent of total administered in mice and monkeys in previous studies as compared to the dimers (last row) is shown Table 6. Percent total dose calculation based on: 5 kg monkey, 135 g liver, 30 g kidney (Davies et al., Pharm. Res., 1993, 10 (7):1093).</p>

      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0317">The high levels of the monomeric equivalent (peak 1) were very surprising, since most of the injected dimer was already processed to a monomeric form (left peak 1 with shortest retention time, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>). In the case of dimer of SEQ ID NO:2, the intact dimer was detected at 6.458 min), as well as the monomer and the monomer with an additional dT (SEQ ID NO: 1 plus dT) from the incomplete cleavage of the linker. The internal standard (IS) is poly-(dT)<sub>30 </sub>phosphorothioate. The dimers SEQ ID NOs:4 and 2 were already completely converted to the monomeric forms comprising the monomer (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the monomer plus dT. In case of dimer SEQ ID NO:3 with a disulfide linker, the monomeric cleavage product was slightly larger than monomer resulting from reductive disulfide cleavage and is indicated as â#1 plus Xâ in the figure, where X is a yet unidentified organic radical with the molecular weight of less 100 Da. It could be hypothesized that that â#1 plus Xâ results from oxidative cleavage rather than reductive cleavage of the disulfide bond. If the dimers had been already cleaved in the serum, the bio-distribution to liver and kidneys should not have increased so dramatically as compared to monomers. Thus, the stability of the dimers in plasma and in liver homogenates was investigated. It was demonstrated in Example 3 that plasma stability of the dimers is relatively high over 48 hours, while the dimers are rapidly cleaved in liver homogenates. Further cleavage product analysis of samples extracted from the liver homogenate treatment showed that the dimer is completely converted to the monomeric form. This observation is compatible with a bio-distribution mechanism, in which dimers are relatively stable after injection into animal. The dimers distributed more efficiently to the organs like liver and kidney as opposed to the corresponding monomer. In the organs (e.g., liver and kidney), the dimer is cleaved to the monomer and can act as a normal antisense oligonucleotide. Since the dimers are stable in serum (plasma), the linkers can be designed to undergo an organ-specific cleavage by using appropriate linker chemistry.</p>

The plates were then washed three times with wash buffer (Tris Buffer/0.1% Tween 20) and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS/3% BSA) for 1-2 hrs. 30 Î¼L of Samples, Standards, and QCs were mixed with 270 Î¼L of 50 nM detection probe in hybridization buffer (4ÃSSC/0.5% Sarkosyl) in Costar cluster tubes and two 100 Î¼L aliquots from the mixture were transferred into 96-well PCR plate and denatured on the thermocycler for 12.5 minutes at 95Â° C. After the samples were cooled to 40Â° C., they were transferred to DNA-Bind plate already coated with capture probe. The plate was sealed and incubated at 40Â° C. for two hours. Following the hybridization, Poly-HRP Streptavidin conjugate (Catalogue #N200, Thermo) at 1:10,000 dilution in Poly-HRP dilution buffer (Catalogue #N500, Thermo) was added.

      <p id="p-00397-en" num="0343">The ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) or the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) were spiked into liver or kidney (n=2 each) and homogenized as described above. The homogenate was divided into two aliquots. One of the aliquots was stored at â80Â° C., the other aliquot was placed at 37Â° C. for 15 hours before storage at â80Â° C. The two aliquots were thawed and analyzed together for the concentration of heterodimeric ASOs and apoB monomer with the hybridization assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0344">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, concentrations of both heterodimers were lower after overnight incubation at 37Â° C., suggesting degradation in tissue at physiological temperature. The ApoB monomer ASO was detectable as a metabolite in both liver and kidney samples spiked with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) and the levels were more than 5 fold higher in samples incubated at 37Â° C. After spiking with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), the ApoB monomer ASO was only detectable in liver homogenates which had been frozen. Taken together, the data suggest that SEQ ID NO: 21 is degraded to active ApoB monomer (SEQ ID NO: 13) metabolite more readily from the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (SEQ ID NO: 21) than from the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59).</p>

      <p id="p-00399-en" num="0345">In plasma, heterodimer ASOs and the ApoB monomer were measured using the methods above in 2 pools of 3 individuals each after treatment with the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21), the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), the ApoB monomer ASO (SEQ ID NO: 13) or the physical combination of the ApoC3 and ApoB monomer ASOs (SEQ ID NO: 30 plus SEQ ID NO: 13). As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, both heterodimer ASOs were detected in plasma 3 days post-treatment. ApoB monomer was also detected 3 days after treatment with the ApoB monomer ASO alone or in physical combination with the ApoC3 monomer. However, ApoB monomer ASO was detected as a metabolite of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) 3 days after treatment, but not after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), demonstrating that the endonuclease sensitive linker resulted in enhanced metabolism to active ASO monomers. None of the analytes were detected in plasma pools taken 14 days after treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00400-en" num="0346">Differences between heterodimer or monomer concentrations in tissues were determined statistically by unpaired t-test (heterodimers) or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons (monomers) using GraphPad Prism.</p>
      <p id="p-00401-en" num="0347">In the kidney, measured concentrations of all administered constructs and the ApoB monomer metabolite decrease significantly between 3 and 14 days after administration. The decline in the concentrations of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) is the most rapid/marked, which is compatible with the hypothesis that the construct is most vulnerable to metabolism via cleavage of the linker (see <figref>FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>). On both day 3 and day 14, levels of the ApoB monomer are lowest after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) while the levels of intact SEQ ID NO: 59 are the highest of the constructs measured. Taken together, these observations demonstrate slower metabolism of the relatively stable phosphothioate linker.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0348">In liver, the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) was present at lower concentrations than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) after treatment with the respective constructs (see <figref>FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>), demonstrating that SEQ ID NO: 21 is metabolized more quickly in liver. Monomer levels that were measured on day 3 and 14 were significantly lower after administration of the ApoB monomer (SEQ ID NO: 13) either alone or in physical combination with the ApoC3 monomer than after administration of with either of the measured heterodimer of ApoC3/ApoB ASOs. On day 3, the concentration of ApoB monomer present in the liver as a metabolite after heterodimer administration was significantly higher after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59), substantiating that the linker designed for cleavage by endonucleases resulted in higher concentration of active monomeric ASO metabolite within a few days of administration (see <figref>FIG. 12A</figref>). On day 14, the reverse was observed (see <figref>FIG. 12B</figref>). The concentration of ApoB monomer present in the liver as a metabolite after heterodimer administration was significantly higher after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four phosphothioate bases (stable; SEQ ID NO: 59) than the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21). Since the phosphothioate linked heterodimer also degrades in tissue, albeit at a slower rate, relatively more monomer is present at this time point. The levels of ApoB monomer, after its administration or as a metabolite of administered ASO heterodimers is related to target mRNA knockdown, e.g., the highest levels of ApoB monomer are present after administration of the ApoC3/ApoB ASO heterodimer linked with four diester bases (cleavable; SEQ ID NO: 21) and the highest level of target mRNA knockdown is also observed in this treatment group (compare <figref>FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> to <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>)</p>

      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0350">Animal experiments were conducted in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) facility under a constant light-dark cycle, maintained on a standard mouse diet, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2 </sub>inhalation. All mouse experiments were approved and conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vivisource Laboratories, Inc. Female C57BL6/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.) and female Balb/C mice obtained from the Charles River Laboratories. Oligonucleotides were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered to mice based on body weight by subcutaneous injection. Mice were injected once per week (MALAT-1) at 50 mg/kg or twice per week (MIR-122) at 10 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed after one week and at study termination (four weeks) and liver, kidney and plasma harvested for further analysis.</p>

      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0351">Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and total plasma harvested by centrifugation in Minicollect tubes (Thermo Fisher). Plasma concentrations of Triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were determined by enzymatic assay (Bioo Scientific) on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader according to manufacturer's recommendations.</p>

      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0352">Tissue was disrupted using a FastPrep-24 tissue homogenizer (MPBio) and total RNA isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and miRNEasy columns (Qiagen). RNA concentration was assessed using RIboGreen plates (Molecular Probes) and a Molecular Dynamics M5 multimodal plate reader. 250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers in a 50 ml reaction using High Capacity Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase. qPCR was carried out using the equivalent of 12.5 ng cDNA in 20 Î¼l reaction volumes using MIR122 or MALAT-1 specific TaqMan primers and probes on a Step-One Plus thermocycler. Relative qPCR expression of individual genes was normalized to the expression of reference genes GusB (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>010368), GAPDH (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>008084.2) or SNO-135 (accession#AF357323) RNA using the ÎÎCt method.</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0000">miR-122 Study Results</p>
      <p id="p-00410-en" num="0353">Two separate cohorts of C57B16/J mice (short and long dosing arm) were analyzed. The mice were females and, both cohorts were maintained on regular chow. Both cohorts were dosed at 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection twice a week (day 1 and 4). Targeting oligonucleotides used were 15 base gapmers with LNA at the ends (3-9-3) and full phosphorothioate linkage. Animals were euthanized at day 7 (short arm) and day 28 (long arm). Dose Groups were n=5. The following parameters were analyzed in an ex vivo analysis: ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides by ELISA.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0354">As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, oligonucleotides targeting miR-122 decreased target miRNA in vivo by 75-90% compared to PBS treated controls. Monomers exhibited 75% knockdown of miR-122; whereas dimers caused 90% knockdown of miR-122.</p>
      <p id="p-00412-en" num="0355">As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, 50 mg/kg dose of oligonucleotides targeting miR-122 decreased target miRNA in vivo by 90-95% compared to PBS treated controls. Monomers exhibited 90% knockdown of miR-122; whereas dimers caused 95% knockdown of miR-122. It was noted that monomer at 50 mg/kg is equivalent to dimer at 10 mg/kg for % miR-122 knockdown.</p>
      <p id="p-00413-en" num="0356">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, in vivo results show that dimers at 10 mg/kg exhibits similar knockdown as monomer at 50 mg/kg. Thus, dimer oligonucleotides are Ë5Ã more active than monomer (in vivo 7 d study).</p>
      <heading id="h-00065-en" level="2">MALAT-1 Study Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0357">Female Balb/c mice which were 7 weeks at shipment were evaluated (N=5). The mice were dosed at 50 mg/kg on Thursday, and takedown was at 5 days post-dose. Sample obtained from the mice included tserum, kidney, brain, and liver. Organs with high levels of MALAT-1 are heart, kidney, brain and minimally found in spleen and skeletal muscle. qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate Malat-1 knockdown. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 16A-16C</figref>, dimer oligonucleotides robustly decreased Malat-1 lncRNA expression; where the control GusB gene was unaffected.</p>

      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0358">Oligos were designed as single monomers or as homodimers, or as homotrimers linked by an oligo-dT linker (4 bases) via cleavable phosphodiester bonds. Each monomer was either 15 oligonucleotides long (âgapmersâ and âmixmersâ in the following table) or 8 oligonucleotides long (âtinyâ in the following table). Gapmers consisted of three LNA-modified bases at each end of the monomer with 9 unmodified DNA bases in the center or gap region. Mixmers consisted of mixtures of LNA-modified bases and unmodified DNA bases. Tinies (8-mers) consisted of LNA-modified bases. The oligos were designed to target miR-122. The sequences of the following table correspond, from top to bottom, to SEQ ID NOS: 261-274.</p>

      <heading id="h-00068-en" level="2">Animal Care and Treatments:</heading>
      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0359">Animal experiments were conducted in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) facility under a constant light-dark cycle, maintained on a standard mouse diet, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were euthanized by C02 inhalation. All mouse experiments were approved and conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vivisource Laboratories, Inc. Female C57BL6/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.). Oligonucleotides were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered to mice based on body weight by subcutaneous injection. Mice were injected on days 1, 2, and 3 with each oligonucleotide at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed after one week and liver and serum were harvested for further analysis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00069-en" level="2">Cholesterol Measurements:</heading>
      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0360">Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum harvested by centrifugation in Minicollect tubes (Thermo Fisher). Serum concentrations of cholesterol were determined by enzymatic assay (Bio Scientific) on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader according to manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0000">RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription and mRNA qPCR:</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0361">Tissue was disrupted using a FastPrep-24 tissue homogenizer (MPBio) and total RNA isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and miRNEasy columns (Qiagen). RNA concentration was assessed using RIboGreen plates (Molecular Probes) and a Molecular Dynamics M5 multimodal plate reader. 250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers in a 50 ml reaction using High Capacity Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase. qPCR was carried out using the equivalent of 12.5 ng cDNA in 20 Î¼l reaction volumes using BCKDK and ALDOA1 specific TaqMan primers and probes on a Step-One Plus thermocycler. Relative qPCR expression of individual genes was normalized to the expression of reference genes GusB (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>010368), GAPDH (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>008084.2) or SNO-135 (accession#AF357323) RNA using the ÎÎCt method.</p>
      <heading id="h-00070-en" level="2">Study Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00421-en" num="0362">Cohorts of C57B16/J mice (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg dosing arms of gapmers, mixmers, or tinies) were analyzed. The mice were females and all cohorts were maintained on regular chow. The cohorts were dosed at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection on days 1, 2, and 3. Animals were euthanized at day 7. Dose Groups were n=5. The following parameters were analyzed in an ex vivo analysis: cholesterol by ELISA and BCKDK and ALDOA1 levels using qPCR.</p>
      <p id="p-00422-en" num="0363">BCKDK and ALDOA1 are targets of miR-122, and it was hypothesized that targeting miR-122 using oligos would result in increased mRNA levels of BCKDK and ALDOA1. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 17-22</figref>, in general oligonucleotides targeting miR-122 increased BCKDK and ALDOA1 mRNA levels in vivo compared to PBS treated controls. In general, dimers and trimers increased BCKDK and ALDOA1 mRNA levels to the same extent or better than monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00423-en" num="0364">miR-122 is a regulator of cholesterol, and decreasing levels of miR-122 have been previously shown to decrease levels of cholestorol. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 23-25</figref>, in general oligonucleotides targeting miR-122 decreased cholesterol levels in vivo compared to PBS treated controls. In general, dimers and trimers decreased cholesterol levels to the same extent or better than monomers.</p>

      <heading id="h-00072-en" level="1">Oligo Sequences</heading>
      <p id="p-00424-en" num="0365">Oligos were designed as single monomers or as homodimers linked by an oligo-dT linker (4, 5, or 6 bases) via cleavable phosphodiester bonds, an oligo-dTs linker (4 bases) containing phophorothioate linkages, or a symmetrical doubler B and a triEG-CPG (branched linker). Each monomer was a15 oligonucleotide long gapmers consisting of three LNA-modified or ENA-modified bases at each end of the monomer with 9 unmodified DNA bases in the center or gap region. The oligos were designed to target miR-122 and are shown in the table below.</p>

      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0366">Animal experiments were conducted in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) facility under a constant light-dark cycle, maintained on a standard mouse diet, and allowed ad libitum access to food and water. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. All mouse experiments were approved and conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vivisource Laboratories, Inc. Female C57BL6/J mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.). Oligonucleotides were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and administered to mice based on body weight by subcutaneous injection. Mice were injected on days 1, 2, and 3 with each oligonucleotide at 3 or 10 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed after one week and liver and serum were harvested for further analysis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00074-en" level="2">LDL and Cholesterol Measurements:</heading>
      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0367">Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and serum harvested by centrifugation in Minicollect tubes (Thermo Fisher). Serum concentrations of cholesterol and LDL were determined by enzymatic assay (Bio Scientific) on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5 plate reader according to manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0000">RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription and mRNA qPCR:</p>
      <p id="p-00429-en" num="0368">Tissue was disrupted using a FastPrep-24 tissue homogenizer (MPBio) and total RNA isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and miRNEasy columns (Qiagen). RNA concentration was assessed using RIboGreen plates (Molecular Probes) and a Molecular Dynamics M5 multimodal plate reader. 250 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers in a 50 ml reaction using High Capacity Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase. qPCR was carried out using the equivalent of 12.5 ng cDNA in 20 Î¼l reaction volumes using BCKDK and ACC1 specific TaqMan primers and probes on a Step-One Plus thermocycler. Relative qPCR expression of individual genes was normalized to the expression of reference genes GusB (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>010368), GAPDH (accession#NM<sub>â</sub>008084.2) or SNO-135 (accession#AF357323) RNA using the ÎÎCt method.</p>
      <heading id="h-00075-en" level="2">Study Results</heading>
      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0369">Cohorts of C57B16/J mice (3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg dosing arms of gapmers) were analyzed. The mice were females and all cohorts were maintained on regular chow. The cohorts were dosed at 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection on days 1, 2, and 3. Animals were euthanized at day 7. Dose Groups were n=10. The following parameters were analyzed in an ex vivo analysis: LDL and cholesterol by ELISA and BCKDK and ACC1 levels using qPCR.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0370">BCKDK is a target of miR-122, and it was hypothesized that targeting miR-122 using oligos would result in increased mRNA levels of BCKDK and ACC1. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, in general oligonucleotides targeting miR-122 increased BCKDK mRNA levels in vivo compared to PBS treated controls. LNA gapmers with cleavable phosphodiester bonds showed increased efficacy compared to monomers. ENA gapmers with cleavable phosphodiester bonds increased BCKDK. Branched linker gapmers also increased BCKDK.</p>
      <p id="p-00432-en" num="0371">ACC1 is predicted to decrease when miR-122 is targeted using oligos. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 28 and 29</figref>, LNA gapmers with 5 or 6 cleavable phosphodiester bonds decreased ACC1. Branched linker gapmers also decreased ACC1.</p>
      <p id="p-00433-en" num="0372">miR-122 is a regulator of cholesterol, and decreasing levels of miR-122 have been previously shown to decrease levels of cholestorol and LDL. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 30-33</figref>, LNA gapmers with 4 or 5 cleavable phosphodiester bonds decreased LDL and cholesterol. ENA gapmers with 4 or 6 cleavable phosphodiester bonds decreased LDL and cholesterol.</p>
