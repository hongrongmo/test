    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to systems and methods for appropriately supporting a reclining user in anatomically-correct neutral-spine positions that ensures restful sleep.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many of us are not getting the proper number of hours of restful sleep needed to stay healthy. Sleep is a vital component of a long, healthy lifestyle. Studies have shown that most of us need a minimum of seven hours of sleep, with eight hours being optimal.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Inferior sleep positions result in back and neck pain and also poor quality of sleep. Our bodies comprise a multitude of complex curves; including our spines. However, despite other advances in sciences including healthcare, our beds and our pillows are generally flat. Lying on a conventional soft flat mattress creates an improper spine angle, causing our muscles to stay tight throughout the night by pulling our spine out of its natural curvatures. Not surprisingly, many of us toss and turn at bedtime trying to find a comfortable restful sleep position.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In addition, most of us have poor postures and slouch during our waking hours. This is compounded by too many hours in a seated position. By the end of each day, most of our spines have been misaligned and the result is strained back muscles and ligaments.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Many attempts at providing a comfortable sleep support system have failed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,878,453 attempts to alleviate lower back pain by placing an under knee pillow 10 to hold an individual's knee in flexion (see Abstract and FIGS. 3, 4). It is undesirable to support the underside of the knees when the individual is in the face-up position without supporting the pelvic region because it puts pressure on the sciatic nerves and surrounding musculature. It also undesirable to support the inside of the knees when the user is lying on the side as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> because pressure on the medial collateral ligament and trigger points to surrounding musculature located on the insides of the knees causes discomfort. In addition, locating the pillow under the inside of the upper knee creates a fulcrum on the upper leg and puts pressure on the upper hip joint.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,761, a pillow for reversing the lordotic curve of a patient by acting on the base of the spine is disclosed having a second wedge 15 that is higher at the foot end and lower at the head end of the patient to place the pelvis into a posterior pelvic tilt by placing pressure in the cavity at the base of the back on the vertebrae of the spine (see Abstract and Col. 3, lines 18-35). However, applying direct pressure on the sacrum (tail bone) of the patient is counterproductive because direct pressure on the sacrum can compress the sacral and/or sciatic nerves, causing discomfort and potential nerve damage over time. Further, wedging the middle of the pelvis causes the pelvis to open outwards, rotates the legs outwards (feet pointing away from each other) and increases the level of user discomfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An attempt at relaxing the lumbar area of the spine is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,796,315. As shown in FIG. 5, a lumbar cushion 10 is placed under the lumbar region of the spine there by rotating the tailbone clockwise, i.e., with the tip of the sacrum and pelvis rotating towards the ground. This undesirable rotation has the effect of straightening the legs which causes discomfort. This rotation can also result in the undesirable shortening of the back muscles.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is therefore apparent that an urgent need exists for a greatly improved neutral-spine support system. This improved rollable support system enables the user to enjoy restful sleep by providing a continuous range of anatomically-correct comfortable reclining positions that alleviates and corrects the user's poor posture.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">To achieve the foregoing and in accordance with the present invention, body support systems and methods are provided. In particular, the system and methods for appropriately supporting a reclining user in anatomically-correct neutral spine positions that ensures restful sleep.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one embodiment, a support system includes a rollable lower body bolster, an upper body supporter, and an optional coverall. The lower body bolster includes a raised leg supporter, a leg spacer and a pelvic supporter, while the upper body supporter includes a back support, a neck rest, a head cradle, a right head support and a left head support.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The raised leg supporter supports the legs of the reclining user in a raised-knee position, and includes cutouts to reduce pressure on undersides of the user's knees. The leg spacer extends upwards from the leg supporter while in a neutral position, and comfortably separates the legs by supporting the user's thighs while avoiding direct pressure on sides of the knees. The pelvic supporter is adjacent to the leg supporter, and supports the user's pelvic region by supporting gluteus maximus muscles and rotating the sacrum base upwards while avoiding direct pressure on the sacrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The back support keeps the user's upper and middle spine in an open and neutral position. The head cradle and neck rest supports the user in a face-up position. Conversely, the left and right head supports are used by the user in the respective left side and right side lying positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Note that the various features of the present invention described above may be practiced alone or in combination. These and other features of the present invention will be described in more detail below in the detailed description of the invention and in conjunction with the following figures.</p>

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring first to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, user <b>110</b> is reclined in a face-up anatomically-correct position, with the head, neck and the upper and middle back supported by supporter <b>120</b>, while the pelvic area including lower back and the legs are supported by bolster <b>180</b>. <figref>FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates user <b>110</b> lying sideways in an anatomically-correct position while remaining comfortably supported by supporter <b>120</b> and bolster <b>180</b>. <figref>FIG. 1C</figref> shows the reclining support system <b>100</b> with the addition of an optional coverall <b>190</b> covering snugly user <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C are perspective, front and side views, respectively, illustrating one embodiment of rollable lower body bolster <b>180</b> in greater detail. Bolster <b>180</b> includes a raised leg supporter <b>220</b> which has two knee cutouts <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> for comfortably supporting the right and left leg of user <b>110</b>, respectively in a raised-knee position, while reducing direct pressure on the undersides of the knees.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A leg spacer <b>240</b> is coupled to and rises upwards from the middle of leg supporter <b>220</b> and is configured to comfortably support and separate the thighs of user <b>110</b>. Spacer <b>240</b> has two cutouts <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> for supporting the left side of user's right thigh and for supporting the right side of user's left thigh, respectively. Hence, spacer <b>240</b> is shaped to secure the user's legs to bolster <b>180</b> so the legs do not fall out during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In some embodiments, for ease of manufacturing, supporter <b>220</b> and spacer <b>240</b> are molded together as a single structure from a suitable material such as natural (e.g., latex) foam and synthetic (e.g., polyethylene) foams, including close-cell foams, open-cell foams, memory foams and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Alternatively, as illustrated by dotted-lines in <figref>FIGS. 2B and 2C</figref>, supporter <b>220</b> and spacer <b>240</b> can be molded separately and coupled to each other using for example a mortise and tenon joint, i.e., knee spacer <b>240</b> has a tenon which fits into a corresponding mortise of knee supporter <b>220</b>. Such a combined structure permits supporter <b>220</b> and spacer <b>240</b> to be easily constructed from materials with differing compositions and/or differing densities. Leg spacer <b>240</b> can also be user detachable to become a part of a compact package so as to facilitate transportation and shipping.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIG. 2D</figref> is a cross-section view showing the right side view of user <b>110</b> illustrating how neutral-spine support for user <b>110</b> is accomplished by bolster <b>180</b>. Bolster <b>180</b> also includes a curved pelvic supporter <b>260</b> adjacent to raised leg supporter <b>220</b> and configured to properly support the pelvic region of user <b>110</b>. Pelvis supporter <b>260</b> is configured to gently rotate the tip of the sacrum (tail bone) upward thereby stretching and relaxing the lower back muscles, while reducing direct pressure on the sacrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">With pelvic supporter <b>260</b> providing a proper tailbone angle and leg supporter <b>220</b> providing the proper knee angle to user <b>110</b>, the resulting pelvic rotation elongates the back muscles thereby promoting the relaxation necessary for a restful sleep. Hence, by properly flexing the pelvis and shortening the anterior musculature just enough to align the spine in a stable anatomically-correct position, support system <b>100</b> allows the user <b>110</b> to correct and reshape the spine while sleeping.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, in accordance to an important aspect of the present invention, a substantial portion of the base of bolster <b>180</b> includes a hull <b>268</b> shaped to enable the reclining user <b>110</b> to effortlessly roll together with bolster <b>180</b> in either a clockwise direction or in an anti-clockwise direction from the neutral face up position, and ending up in a side body laying position. This rollable feature of hull <b>268</b> advantageously enables user <b>110</b> to maintain proper spine alignment while laying on one side of the body, with the ears remaining substantially in-line with the shoulder, the shoulder substantially in-line with the hip, thereby avoiding the undesirable unhealthy slouching fetal position. As a result, there is no unnecessary strain and tension in the hips and lower back of user <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, the curvature or contour of the hull <b>268</b> can be conveniently configured in the field (e.g., user adjustable) by for example either adding hull insert(s) or removing hull layer(s) (not shown). Hull inserts can be attached by methods known to one skilled in the arts such as adhesives or Velcro™.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Conversely, to accommodate users who prefer to sleep primarily in a face-up position, the curvature of the hull <b>268</b> can be very gentle to permit very limited rolling. Accordingly, hull <b>268</b> of bolster <b>180</b> can be also substantially flat and stable to discourage rolling.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">It is also possible to better secure bolster <b>180</b> to user <b>110</b> by adding one or more optional straps (not shown) configured to wrap bolster <b>180</b> around the pelvic region and/or the legs of user <b>110</b>. Specially configured shorts/pants with Velcro™ can also be worn by user <b>110</b> for coupling with Velcro™ on the corresponding surface(s) of bolster <b>180</b>. In addition, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, a fitted coverall <b>190</b> can also be incorporated into system <b>100</b> to better secure user <b>110</b> and/or to provide heat retention.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are perspective and top views, respectively, of upper body supporter <b>120</b> which includes a back support <b>322</b>, a right head support <b>323</b>, a left head support <b>324</b>, a neck rest <b>327</b> and a head cradle <b>328</b>. In this embodiment, head supports <b>323</b>, <b>324</b> are topped by optional face rests <b>325</b>, <b>326</b>. Right face rest <b>325</b> and left face rest <b>326</b> can be made from the similar or different material as right head support <b>323</b> and <b>324</b> respectively. For example, head supports <b>323</b>, <b>324</b> can be made from inexpensive firmer foam while face rests <b>325</b>, <b>326</b> can be made from more expensive but more conformable memory foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">When user <b>110</b> is in a face-up position, the back of the user's head is resting on head cradle <b>328</b> while the user's neck is supported by neck rest <b>327</b>. The user's upper spine is supported by back support <b>322</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In accordance to another aspect of the present invention, back support <b>322</b> is shaped to ensure that the vertebrae in upper and middle spine of user <b>110</b> is supported and aligned in the anatomically-correct arched position by providing the optimal support into the apex of the kyphotic curve to guide the user's upper and middle back, and neck back into a neutral spinal position. In other words, back support <b>322</b> puts pressure on middle back to gently allows the shoulder to relax in an open position, thereby facilitating breathing and also promotes muscle relaxation in the upper chest and upper back. As a result, the user's back is opened and the head is tilted slightly upwards into the head cradle <b>328</b>, in a manner similar to opening of the airway in first responder CPR training. Opening the airway advantageously improves breathing and reduces snoring and alleviates some of the symptoms associated with sleep apnea.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring again to <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, when user <b>110</b> is laying on the right side of the body, the user's right face is resting comfortably on right face rest <b>325</b>, with the head, neck and upper spine substantially parallel to each other. Conversely, when user <b>110</b> is lying on the left side of the body, the user's left face is resting comfortable on left face rest <b>326</b>. This anatomically-correct rollability feature of upper body supporter <b>120</b> ensures the proper spinal alignment as defined by the relative positioning of the head, neck, shoulder and hip of user <b>110</b> described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Many modifications and additions to the support system <b>100</b> are possible. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> and <b>2</b>D, in some embodiments, bolster <b>180</b> also includes an optional calf extension (ottoman) <b>160</b> to provide addition lower leg support thereby increasing user comfort and also stability of bolster <b>180</b> during use. In addition, the sides of leg supporter <b>220</b> and/or pelvis supporter <b>260</b> can be further extended to better secure and support the outside of the thighs and/or hips of user <b>110</b>, thereby ensuring that support system <b>100</b> and user <b>110</b> remain coupled together.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Depending on the rigidity of the materials for constructing bolster <b>180</b>, structural reinforcement for bolster <b>180</b> is also possible. For example, a substantially vertical rigid or semi-rigid insert (not shown) can be incorporated inside spacer <b>240</b>, extending from the top of spacer <b>240</b> to the bottom of booster hull <b>168</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Other modifications to support <b>100</b> are also possible. For example, in some embodiments, the ease of rollability can be made adjustable by incorporating optional ballast <b>488</b>, which enable the center of gravity of the bolster <b>180</b> to be adjusted as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Ballast <b>488</b> enables the center of gravity of bolster <b>180</b> to be adjusted higher or lower relative to the rolling axis of bolster <b>180</b>. For example the center of gravity of bolster <b>180</b> can be adjusted lower than the rolling axis for users who prefer to sleep predominantly on the user's back. Conversely, the center of gravity of bolster <b>180</b> can be adjusted higher than the rolling axis for users who prefer to sleep predominantly on the sides of user's body. Examples of ballast <b>488</b> include a fluid stored in a pouch, and one or more solid weights in a hollow tube, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Advantages of ballast <b>488</b> includes the ability to adjust compensate for the user's own center of gravity with respect to rollability. For example, it is possible to adjust ballast <b>488</b> so that the combined center of gravity of the user <b>110</b> and bolster <b>180</b> is substantially close to the axis of rotation, i.e., neutral, so that rolling to and fro between face-up side-body positions becomes effortless.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Modifications to support system <b>100</b> can also include incorporating passive ventilation channels to promote ventilation, cooling and/or heating. It is also possible to include active heating or cooling capabilities such as heat pads or tubing for circulating a warming/cooling fluid. Massage options such as vibrators can also be incorporated into system <b>100</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> are perspective, front and side views. <figref>FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C are perspective, front and side views, respectively, illustrating an exemplary alternate embodiment of a lower body bolster <b>580</b> in greater detail. Bolster <b>580</b> includes a raised leg supporter <b>520</b> which has two knee cutouts <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> for comfortably supporting the right and left leg of user <b>110</b>, respectively in a raised-knee position, while reducing direct pressure on the undersides of the user's knees. In this embodiment, bolster <b>580</b> has a substantially flat bottom <b>550</b> to enhance stability during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 5D</figref> is a cross-section view showing the right side view of user <b>110</b> illustrating how neutral-spine support for user <b>110</b> is accomplished by bolster <b>580</b>. Bolster <b>580</b> includes a curved pelvic supporter <b>560</b> adjacent to raised leg supporter <b>220</b> and configured to properly support the pelvic region of user <b>110</b>. Pelvis supporter <b>560</b> is configured to gently rotate the tip of the sacrum (tail bone) upward thereby stretching and relaxing the lower back muscles, while reducing direct pressure on the sacrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Booster <b>580</b> further includes a lower back supporter <b>590</b> which firmly supports the user's lower back and reinforces the anatomically-correct posture for restful sleep.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Pelvic supporter <b>560</b> and lower back supporter <b>590</b> in combination provide a proper tailbone angle, while leg supporter <b>520</b> providing the proper knee angle to user <b>110</b>. The resulting pelvic rotation elongates the back muscles thereby promoting the relaxation necessary for a restful sleep. Hence, by properly flexing the pelvis and shortening the anterior musculature just enough to align the spine in a stable anatomically-correct position, the user <b>110</b> is able to correct and reshape her/his spine while sleeping.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">To accommodate side laying positions, in this embodiment, when user <b>110</b> is laying on her/his side, bolster <b>580</b> includes substantially flat tops <b>582</b>, <b>584</b> and <b>586</b> configured to firmly and gently support an inner thigh of the upper leg of the user <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Modifications to booster <b>580</b> are possible. For example, the edges of tops <b>582</b>, <b>584</b>, <b>586</b> may be radiused to enhance comfort while supporting the legs of user <b>110</b>. In addition, the leg supporter <b>520</b> may be made from layers of form with different firmness, e.g., a firmer stiffer lower layer towards bottom <b>550</b>, combined with a softer more pliable upper layer toward tops <b>582</b>, <b>584</b>, <b>586</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Referring now to the top view of <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, and also to <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> which is the corresponding cross-sectional view <b>6</b>B-<b>6</b>B, an alternate embodiment of upper body supporter <b>620</b> suitable for use with either bolster <b>180</b> or bolster <b>580</b> is shown. Upper body supporter <b>620</b> includes an extended back support <b>622</b> that can be extended all the way to lower back supporter <b>590</b>. As shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, back support <b>622</b> can include a convex profile configured to provide superior back support for user <b>110</b> in the raised-knee position.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Modifications to upper body supporter <b>620</b> are also possible. For example, a coupler such as a Velcro strap (not shown) may be used to secure end <b>629</b> of extended back support <b>622</b> to the lower back supporter <b>590</b> of bolster <b>580</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In sum, the present invention provides novel systems and methods for maintaining anatomically-correct neutral-spine postures while users are comfortably resting in a range of reclined positions, thereby ensuring restful sleep necessary for good health.</p>
