      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">External fixation devices are typically used as a final step during complex and delicate surgeries. The external fixators are utilized to maintain the placement of bones during the healing process. The external fixator provides strength and stability to the healing bones while they regenerate, strengthen and grow.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Typical external fixation devices have been constructed of relatively heavy metallic materials that are difficult for surgeons to manipulate. Any adjustability of these prior external fixation devices typically require mechanical fasteners that require the surgeon to manipulate with both hands and/or the assistance of another surgeon or assistant to manipulate tools or to perform various other tasks to adjust the external fixator or related components. In addition, the bulky metallic structures are generally not radiolucent, thereby complicating post-operative evaluation of the regeneration and healing of the bone via imaging techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Accordingly, it would be desirable to design, construct and implement an external fixator that is relatively light weight, may be both disposable and reusable, has radiolucent properties and is relatively easy to adjust and manipulate. It would also be desirable to construct an external fixator that provides flexibility of positioning along with the necessary clamping force required to maintain pretension in wires that stabilize the patient's anatomy, but has improved ease of use and a reduced cost of goods. The device is also preferably compatible with standard wires and tensioning devices. The preferred external fixator of the present invention addresses these shortcomings of existing external fixators and provides desired improvements.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Briefly stated, the preferred external fixator includes a wire clamping assembly with a main body that incorporates an internal conical taper that interacts with a split tapered collet that clamps the wire. The angle of the taper is acute enough that the clamping action is self energizing and preferably does not require user interaction to achieve proper clamping. There is preferably a spring element that displaces the collet forward into the taper of the main body to ensure when tension is applied to the wire the clamping elements are in the proper relationship. The device is initially supplied with a disposable rear plug that spreads the collet allowing easy placement of the preferred wire clamping assembly on the wire. Once the preferred wire clamping assembly is properly placed on the wire the disposable plug is withdrawn and the device is operational. The from end of the collet has been extended beyond the main body to allow for the release of the device from the wire through the use of an auxiliary tool if the initial placement is incorrect. The geometry of the tapered elements is preferably optimized for efficient production by computer numerical controlled (âCNCâ) Swiss turning machines.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The preferred wire clamping assembly also incorporates features that allow for flexibility of positioning. The main body, washer and support bracket contain elements that allow for vertical and angular adjustment of the wire position relative to the external fixator frame. Once again the geometry and placement of the features are preferably optimized for efficient production by CNC Swiss turning machines.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The preferred wire clamping assembly also preferably includes a rear polymer cap that protects the patient: from the sharp end of the wire after it is cut to length. The cap has an annular snap fit that interacts with a mating feature on the rear of the main body. The geometry of the polymer cap and the snap fit feature is preferably optimized for ease of production.</p>

The preferred external fixator is generally light, may be disposable or reusable and stabilizes a patient's bone(s) with the device generally positioned external to the patient's skin. The preferred external fixator <b>10</b> is preferably constructed of a significant number of radiolucent materials, is relatively light weight, has a relatively reasonable price and is disposable and/or reusable.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The preferred external fixator <b>10</b> includes a first or upper ring <b>12</b>, a second or middle ring <b>14</b>, a foot plate <b>16</b>, a first plurality of struts <b>18</b> that secure the first ring <b>12</b> to the second ring <b>14</b> and a second plurality of struts <b>20</b> that secure the foot plate <b>16</b> to the second ring <b>14</b>. These components of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> are constructed of a selection of materials including high-quality plastic or polymeric materials, metals, such as aluminum, composite materials, such as thermosetting carbon-graphite composites or the like. The external fixator <b>10</b> of the preferred embodiment preferably permits angulation and translation adjustability in combination with light weight, strength, disposability or reusability, radiolucency and related similar features. The preferred external fixator <b>10</b> is generally easy to use with a wire or pin aiming system and allows a surgeon to reduce application time of the frame and driving of wires. The external fixator <b>10</b> may be a particularly adaptable to the Illizarov method used in orthopedic and podiatric surgical applications (leg, foot/ankle, foot).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have a similar construction in that they are preferably comprised of full rings with a series of slots <b>26</b> therethrough. The slots <b>26</b> are also preferably included in the foot plate <b>16</b>. The slots <b>26</b> permit mounting of various elements to the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and foot plate <b>16</b>, such as the plurality of struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The slots <b>26</b> preferably provide a simple means of mounting various elements and structures to the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the foot plate <b>16</b> to permit adjustability of the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and foot plate <b>16</b> relative to each other and the patient's body. The first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are not limited to being constructed of full rings and may be incomplete rings or have other various shapes to adapt to various anatomies of a patient's body. The preferred foot plate <b>16</b> has a generally U-shape or C-shape and includes the slots <b>26</b> throughout. The foot plate <b>16</b> is not limited to having the C-shape or the U-shape and may have nearly any shape for adaptability to a patient's body. In addition, none of the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> nor the foot plate <b>16</b> are limited to inclusion of the slots <b>26</b> and may be constructed with other attachment means or mechanisms for attaching the first and/or second plurality of struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> or other components thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the preferred embodiment, the first ring <b>12</b> is adjustably mounted to the second ring <b>14</b> by the first plurality of struts <b>18</b>, which comprise first, second and third struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C in the preferred embodiment. In addition, the second ring <b>14</b> is preferably secured to the foot plate <b>16</b> by the second plurality struts <b>20</b> including a fourth strut <b>20</b>A, a fifth strut <b>20</b>B and a sixth strut <b>20</b>C. The external fixator <b>10</b> is not limited to having the first, second and third struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C securing the first ring <b>12</b> to the second ring <b>14</b> nor the fourth, fifth and sixth struts <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C mounting the foot plate <b>16</b> to the second ring <b>14</b>. The first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the foot plate <b>16</b> may be mounted to each other utilizing any number of struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> that are able to secure the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and foot plate <b>16</b> relative to each other and permit adjustability of these components relative to each other under normal operating conditions of the external fixator <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Each of the struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C preferably incorporate two end fittings <b>22</b>, with one at each end and a telescoping element <b>24</b> secured between the end fittings <b>22</b>. The preferred end fittings <b>22</b> are designed for mounting the struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C to the first and/or second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the foot plate <b>16</b>. The telescoping elements <b>24</b> are provided to permit a relatively simple telescopic length adjustment of the struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C. In combination, the end fittings <b>22</b> and telescoping elements <b>24</b> permit angular and linear adjustment of the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and foot plate <b>16</b> relative to each other and the patient's body in multiple axes in a relatively intuitive manner. The end fittings <b>22</b> preferably provide a relatively loose self-locking feature that is able to support at least the weight of the components of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> to hold the external fixator <b>10</b> in certain configurations without collapsing or locking the end fittings <b>22</b> and/or telescoping elements <b>24</b> in a final locked position, as will be described in greater detail below. The preferred external fixator <b>10</b> preferably provides easy adjustment on all three planes in height, as well as compression and angular orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 3-8B</figref>, the end fittings <b>22</b> are preferably comprised of a series of nesting shell elements. The preferred shell elements allow for angular adjustment of the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the foot plate <b>16</b> relative to each other in multiple axes in a very intuitive manner and only have a single attachment and locking stud. The preferred nesting shells generally provide reliable attachment and locking of the end fittings <b>22</b> in specific configurations. The preferred nesting shells assembly are also designed for efficient production by Computer Numerical Control (âCNCâ) machining techniques and turning machines.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Each of the struts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C includes an upper end fitting <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a lower end fitting <b>22</b><i>b</i>. In addition, each of the end fittings <b>22</b>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>are preferably constructed of an assembly including an end plate <b>28</b>, a spring element <b>30</b>, a shell <b>32</b>, an end plate fastener <b>34</b> and a washer <b>36</b>. The end plates <b>28</b> preferably provide an attachment area or point for mounting to one end of the struts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C and provide rigidity for the shell <b>32</b>. The spring element <b>30</b> is preferably mounted between the end plate <b>28</b> and the end plate fastener <b>34</b> to provide partial locking of the end fittings <b>22</b> that support preliminary configuring of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b>. The spring element <b>30</b> is preferably mounted within the shell <b>32</b> in an assembled configuration. The spring element <b>30</b> is preferably constructed of a compression spring or compression spring material that is able to take on the size and configuration of the spring element <b>30</b> and withstand the normal operating conditions of the spring element <b>30</b>. The shell <b>32</b> preferably has an inner spherical contact surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>and an outer spherical contact surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>to provide adjustability for the end fittings <b>22</b> and locking capabilities. The end plate fastener <b>34</b> preferably includes a spherical contact surface <b>34</b><i>a</i>, a shaft <b>34</b><i>b </i>and a threaded section <b>34</b><i>c</i>. The spherical surface <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the end plate fastener <b>34</b> preferably contacts the inner spherical surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the shell <b>32</b> to provide for adjustment and locking. The shaft <b>34</b><i>b </i>preferably provides for attachment to the first and/or second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b>. The threaded section <b>34</b><i>c </i>preferably engages a nut <b>38</b> for securing the end fittings <b>22</b> to the first and/or second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b>. The washer <b>36</b> preferably provides a spherical contact surface <b>36</b><i>a </i>to engage the outer spherical surface <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the shell <b>32</b> and a relatively planar surface <b>36</b><i>b </i>that engages the first or second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> or the foot plate <b>16</b> in a mounted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Referring to FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>9</b>-<b>9</b>B, the struts <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, <b>20</b>C each preferably include one of the telescoping elements <b>24</b> mounted between an upper tube <b>25</b><i>a </i>that is telescopically slidable within a lower tube <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the preferred telescoping fitting <b>24</b> allows for length adjustments of the plurality of struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. The telescoping fitting <b>24</b> is designed to provide a generally intuitive operation and a relatively rigid joint that can accommodate bending forces typically encountered during the use of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> under normal operating conditions. The telescoping fitting <b>24</b> is configured to accommodate tolerances associated with standard commercial tubing and for efficient production by CNC machining techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the preferred embodiment, the upper and lower tubes <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>are constructed of a thermosetting epoxy and graphite composite material. More preferably, the upper and lower tubes <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>are constructed of pultruded epoxy and graphite rods or tubes. The epoxy and graphite materials provide radiolucency, relatively light weight and relatively high strength for the struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. However, the struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are not limited to being constructed of graphite and epoxy composite tubes and may be constructed of nearly any material that is able to withstand the normal operating conditions of the struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. For example, the upper and lower tubes <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>may be constructed of aluminum or other materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The telescoping elements <b>24</b> are preferably constructed of a lower housing <b>40</b>, a double-tapered and partially flexible collet <b>42</b> and an upper housing <b>44</b>. The upper housing <b>44</b> includes internal threads and the lower housing <b>40</b> includes external threads <b>40</b><i>a </i>that are matable with each other. The collet <b>42</b> is preferably mounted within and between the upper and lower housings <b>44</b>, <b>40</b> and interacts with the upper and lower housings <b>44</b>, <b>40</b> at two partially flexible or collapsible tapered surfaces <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b</i>. In the assembled configuration, drawing the lower housing <b>40</b> toward the upper housing <b>44</b> by turning the threads causes the tapered surfaces <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>to interact with the upper and lower housings <b>44</b>, <b>40</b> and to collapse onto and grip the upper tube <b>25</b><i>a </i>to lock the position of the upper tube <b>25</b><i>a </i>to the lower tube <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Moving the lower housing <b>40</b> away from the upper housing <b>44</b> by turning the threads in an opposite direction permits the collet <b>44</b> to flex back to a relaxed position, thereby permitting movement of the upper tube <b>25</b><i>a </i>relative to the lower tube <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Dual gripping surfaces <b>42</b><i>c</i>, <b>42</b><i>d </i>of the collet <b>42</b> are preferably spaced from each other at ends of the collet <b>42</b> for gripping the upper tube <b>25</b><i>a</i>. The dual gripping surfaces <b>42</b><i>c</i>, <b>42</b><i>d </i>and their spaced apart configuration permits reduction of stresses in the tubes <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Specifically, the spacing of the dual gripping surfaces <b>42</b><i>c</i>, <b>42</b><i>d </i>is better able to react bending forces that may be encountered by the struts <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">Wire Clamping Assembly</heading>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>14</b>C, the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> may also be utilized with a first preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b>. The first preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b> is preferably mountable to the first and/or second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> and to a wire <b>64</b>. The wire <b>64</b> is secured at two locations to the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> by a pair of the first preferred wire clamping assemblies <b>50</b> to stabilize the patient's bones or other anatomy during healing.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The first preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b> preferably includes a fastening body <b>52</b>, a main body or nut <b>54</b> and a collet <b>56</b>. The fastening body <b>52</b> includes a pair of U-shaped channels <b>52</b><i>a </i>and a threaded shaft <b>52</b><i>b</i>. The fastening body <b>52</b> is preferably removably mountable to the slots <b>26</b> using one of the nuts <b>38</b>. The U-shaped channels <b>52</b><i>a </i>preferably face away from a center line <b>46</b> of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> in an assembled configuration. The collet <b>56</b> of the first preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b> includes a pair of ears <b>56</b><i>a </i>that engage the U-shaped channels <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the fastening body <b>52</b>. The main body <b>54</b> preferably includes a funnel-like or frusta-conical internal surface <b>54</b><i>a </i>that receives a funnel-like external surface <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the collet <b>56</b> to alternatively compress or release the collet <b>56</b> for clamping the wire <b>64</b>. The funnel-like internal surface <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the main body <b>54</b> is preferably oriented at an approximate twenty degree) (20Â° angle relative to a longitudinal axis <b>55</b> of the main body <b>54</b> to provide increased clamping force for the wire clamping assembly <b>50</b>. The funnel like or tapered internal surface <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the main body <b>54</b> preferably interacts with the externally tapered or funnel-like surface or end <b>56</b><i>b </i>of the collet <b>56</b> to provide clamping. The collet <b>56</b> is preferably secured to the main body <b>54</b> by external threads <b>56</b><i>c </i>on the collet <b>56</b> and internal threads <b>54</b><i>a </i>on the main body <b>54</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In operation, the a pair of the fastening bodies <b>52</b> are mounted opposite each other to the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> by urging the threaded shafts <b>52</b><i>b </i>through the slots <b>26</b> on opposite sides of the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b>. The fastening bodies <b>52</b> are secured to the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> by engaging and tightening nuts <b>38</b> to the threaded shafts <b>52</b><i>b</i>. The collets <b>56</b> are positioned such that the ears <b>56</b><i>a </i>are in the U-shaped channels <b>52</b><i>a </i>with the main bodies <b>54</b> closest to the center line <b>46</b> of the preferred external fixator <b>10</b>. When the wire <b>64</b> is appropriately positioned in the patient's body, the position of the wire <b>64</b> relative to the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> is fixed by tightening the main body <b>54</b> onto the collets <b>56</b> to tightly engage the wire <b>64</b>. The wire <b>64</b> may be tensioned by a tensioning tool (not shown) prior to final fixing of the wire <b>64</b>. The ends of the wire <b>64</b> outward of the collets <b>56</b> are preferably cut to minimize portions of the wire <b>64</b> extending beyond the first preferred wire clamping assemblies <b>50</b> on either side of the external fixator <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 15-20</figref>, a second preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b>â² includes similar features to the first preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b> and like reference numerals are utilized to identify like elements between the first and second preferred wire clamping assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>â² with a prime symbol (â²) to specifically identify the elements of the second preferred wire clamping assembly <b>50</b>â². The second preferred wire clamping assembly includes a fastening body <b>52</b>â², a main body <b>54</b>â², a collet <b>56</b>â², a back plate <b>58</b>, a securing washer <b>68</b>, a spring element <b>60</b>, a plug <b>62</b> and a cap <b>66</b>. The securing washer <b>68</b> includes a pair of teeth <b>68</b><i>a </i>on one side that are realeasably engageable with serrations <b>52</b><i>c </i>on the fastening body <b>52</b>â² and a partial spherical surface <b>68</b><i>b </i>on an opposite side facing away from the fastening body <b>52</b>â² in an assembled configuration. The main body <b>54</b>â² preferably includes a partial spherical surface <b>54</b><i>b </i>that engages the partial spherical surface <b>68</b><i>b </i>of the fastening body <b>52</b>â² to permit pivoting adjustment of the fastening body <b>52</b>â² relative to the main body <b>54</b>â² in an assembled configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The back plate <b>58</b> is preferably press fit into the main body <b>54</b>â² or is comprised of a snap ring that engages the main body <b>54</b>â² and the spring element <b>60</b> is preferably mounted between the back plate <b>58</b> and the collet <b>56</b>â². The pair of teeth <b>68</b><i>a </i>preferably engage one of the sets of serrations <b>52</b><i>c </i>on the fastening body <b>52</b>â² and the partial spherical surface <b>68</b><i>b </i>on the securing washer <b>68</b> slidably engages the partial spherical surface <b>54</b><i>b </i>on the main body <b>54</b>â² in the assembled configuration. The plug <b>62</b> is preferably positioned within a cavity <b>56</b><i>d </i>at a rear of the collet <b>56</b>â² to maintain the collet <b>56</b>â² in an expanded configuration and permit movement of the wire <b>64</b> within the collet <b>56</b>â². The assembly is preferably, initially placed over the wire <b>64</b> with the plug <b>62</b> positioned in the cavity <b>56</b><i>d</i>, which generally provides free sliding of the wire <b>64</b> relative to the second preferred wire clamp assembly <b>50</b>â². The plug <b>62</b> is subsequently removed, thereby permitting the collet <b>56</b>â² to collapse on the wire <b>64</b> and at least initially secure the position of the wire <b>64</b> relative to the wire clamp assembly <b>50</b>â². This initial or partial locking is caused at least partially by the spring element <b>60</b> forcing the collet <b>56</b>â² and its externally tapered surface <b>56</b><i>b </i>forward into the internal funnel-like or tapered surface <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the main body <b>54</b>â². The partial, initial clamping force engages the wire <b>64</b> with an initial clamping force. If the wire <b>64</b> is pulled toward the center line <b>46</b> of the external fixator <b>10</b>, the clamping force tends to increase on the wire <b>64</b> due to the configuration of the collet <b>56</b>â² and the main body <b>54</b>â². The wire <b>64</b> may be more securely locked to the wire clamping assembly <b>50</b>â² by further urging the externally tapered surface <b>56</b><i>b</i>â² of the collet <b>56</b>â² into the internal tapered surface <b>54</b><i>a</i>â² of the main body <b>54</b>â² and further compressing the collet <b>56</b>â². Force supplied on the wire <b>64</b> toward the center line <b>46</b> of the external fixator <b>10</b> causes additional tightening of the collet <b>56</b>â² because such force urges the collet <b>56</b>â² into the tapered surface <b>54</b><i>a</i>â² of the main body <b>54</b>â². The cap <b>66</b> is placed onto the end of the main body <b>54</b>â² to cover a sheared or cut end of the wire <b>64</b> after the wire <b>64</b> is positioned by the surgeon and cut to length to limit exposure to the cut end of the wire <b>64</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In operation or use of the preferred external fixator <b>50</b>, the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are secured in a particular orientation relative to each other by mounting the first plurality of struts <b>18</b> therebetween. The orientation of the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> relative to each other may be modified by changing the angulation of the end fittings <b>22</b> and the lengths of the individual struts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C utilizing the telescoping elements <b>24</b>. The second ring <b>14</b> is also preferably similarly secured to the foot plate <b>16</b> by the second plurality of struts <b>20</b>. The patient's limb, such as a foot and leg or other anatomy are inserted, generally along the center line <b>46</b> of the external fixator <b>10</b>. The partial locking of the telescoping elements <b>24</b> and end fittings <b>22</b> permit the preferred external fixator <b>10</b> to generally maintain a provisional or preliminary shape for orientation relative to the patient's anatomy.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Multiple wires <b>64</b> are then preferably mounted in the patient's anatomy to secure a desired orientation and position of the anatomy to promote healing. The wires <b>64</b> are preferably secured to the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b> by either one of the first and/or second preferred wire clamping assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>â², with pairs of wire clamping assemblies <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>â² mounting each wire <b>64</b> at two locations to the first and second rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or the foot plate <b>16</b>. The positioning of the ears <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the collet <b>56</b> in the U-shaped channels <b>52</b><i>a </i>of the fastening body <b>52</b>, as well as the engagement of the fastening body <b>52</b> to the rings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and/or plate <b>16</b> also permits angular adaptation of the orientation of the wire <b>64</b> and self-alignment when utilizing the first preferred wire assembly <b>50</b>. In addition, the positioning of the pair of teeth <b>68</b><i>a </i>in the serrations <b>52</b><i>c </i>and the sliding engagement of the partial spherical surface <b>68</b><i>b </i>of the securing washer <b>68</b> with the partial spherical surface <b>54</b><i>b </i>of the main body <b>54</b>â² permits angular adaptation of the orientation of the wire <b>64</b> and self-alignment when utilizing the second preferred wire assembly <b>50</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The design elements of the external fixator of the invention provide several advantages over the prior art in respect of ease of use and the ease and cost of manufacture. For example, the design permits single wrench tightening of strut end fittings <b>22</b> and fastening bodies <b>52</b>. The flat contact surfaces of the washer <b>36</b> and the fastening body <b>52</b> that bear on a ring or foot plate have a counterbore that increases the contact radius of those surfaces. The larger contact radius provides a resisting torque due to friction that is greater than the torque due to thread friction during tightening. The spherical contact surface of the washer <b>36</b> also has a counterbore that increases the contact radius of that surface. The counterbore also increases the contact angle which increases normal forces and the associated frictional forces. The effect of both the increased contact radius and angle is a resisting torque that is greater than the torque due to thread friction. The spherical surface of the end plate fastener <b>34</b> also has been truncated near the center line. The effect is the same as the counterbore in the spherical surface of the washer.*</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The design concept is to calculate the relationship between the preload created when a nut is tightened and the amount of frictional torque the nut is applying to the male threads of the mating part. As a rough estimate, it is about 40% of applied torque and may range, for example, from about 30% to about 50%, preferably from about 35% to about 45% of applied torque. The next step in the design is to develop a relationship between the preload and the resisting torque for the mating part. Once this relationship is determined, the geometry of the mating part is modified such that the resisting torque is greater than the torque applied to the threads by the nut. In the case of a flat surface, two parameters can be adjusted. These are the frictional coefficient of the surfaces in contact and the effective contact radius. For a round flat surface, the contact radius is a function of the inside diameter and the outside diameter of the mating surface. Since the outside diameters of the elements of the external fixator are limited by size and weight constraints, the inside diameter was enlarged to increase the effective contact radius and yield a resisting torque that is greater than the torque applied by the nut. The coefficient of friction could also be increased by modifying the surface but that would result in increased manufacturing costs as compared with adding a counterbore to enlarge the inside diameter. The same basic approach applies to spherical surfaces except that contact angle also needs to be taken into account because it affects the relationship between preload and resisting torque. As an example of the application of this principle, the washer <b>36</b> can have a counterbore on the flat side of 0.325 inches in diameter by 0.015 inches deep. On the spherical side, it is 0.375 inches in diameter by 0.045 inches deep. For the support bracket, it is the same as the washer.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The torque required to lock the strut and end fitting is compatible with the lower values typically seen in clinical practice, 5 Nm to 15 Nm. The use of partial spherical surfaces versus full spheres allows for the use of larger radiuses while limiting overall size and cost of the components. The larger radiuses provide a greater resisting moment for a given tightening torque. The control of the contact angles by adding counterbores or truncating the surface near the center line also provides a greater resisting moment.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The torque required to lock the telescoping element is also compatible with the lower values typically seen in clinical practice. The double tapered collet <b>42</b> provides a partially self-energizing effect in both tension and compression, reducing the required force and associated torque that is needed to lock the joint. The ability to resist both compression and tension allows the strut to be flipped end for end without affecting the performance of the telescoping element.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Another advantage is that the fastening body <b>52</b> does not need to be perfectly aligned with the axis of the wire. The spherical surfaces of the design allow both vertical and radial misalignment. The radial motion can accommodate up to 10Â° of misalignment without affecting performance of the wire clamp or adding additional stresses to the wire. Similar to the end fittings of the strut, the partial spherical surfaces allow the tension in the wire to provide enough resisting moment to handle any applied lateral loads to the wire.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The torque or spring force required to lock the collet in either the telescoping element or the wire clamp can be reduced by selectively applying a lubricious coating to the tapered surface of the collet or the associated housing. The reduced torque in the case of the telescoping element allows hand tightening to lock the joint for provisional placement.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The struts not only allow intuitive angular and axial motion of the rings relative to each other but also allow rotation if a wire clamping position needs to be adjusted at a resolution that is less than the spacing of the slots or holes in the ring or allows the clinician to adjust the position of a bone element that is fixed with a wire.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Manufacturing ease and cost is enhanced by the use of partial spherical surfaces versus full spheres. This allows for the use of larger radiuses. The mechanics of larger radiuses reduce the stresses in a number of components allowing for simplified designs and thinner sections. For example, the forces in the washer <b>36</b> are principally axial due to the larger radius and create compression in the washer which is easy to resist. A smaller radius would lead to greater lateral forces which would require thicker sections and a more complex design to resist. Additionally, welding or bonding the end plate <b>28</b> to the shell <b>32</b> reduces the complexity of the two parts and allows for thinner sections in both parts. The reduction in the thickness of the shell permits the use of even larger radiuses without increasing the overall dimensions of the end fitting.</p>
