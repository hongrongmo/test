    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to a process for preparing compounds containing isocyanate groups and silane groups, to the products obtainable by this process and to a composition comprising compounds containing isocyanate groups and silane groups. The invention further relates to the use of the products obtainable by the process according to the invention and of the composition of compounds containing isocyanate groups and silane groups as a starting component in the preparation of polyurethanes containing silane groups, and in the production of crosslinkable binders and of raw materials for varnishes, sealants or adhesives.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Isocyanatoorganosilanes, being compounds having two different reactive functionalities, are units of interest for chemical synthesis. They can react either with compounds bearing acidic hydrogen atoms via the isocyanate group or, for example in the presence of moisture, crosslink under polycondensation of the silane group. Isocyanatoorganosilanes are of particular significance for modification of hydroxy-functional polymers for a number of different applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Isocyanatoalkylalkoxysilanes, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,494,951 or EP-A 0 649 850, enable, for example, the preparation of particularly low-viscosity silane-terminated prepolymers which are used as moisture-crosslinking adhesives and sealants (see, for example, EP-A 0 070 475, EP-A 0 372 561).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">According to the teaching of WO 2009/115079, alkoxysilane-containing reaction products of polyols, for example polyacrylate polyols and/or simple polyhydric alcohols, with isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane or isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane can be cured thermally in the presence of suitable catalysts even with exclusion of water. Binders of this kind enable, inter alia, the formulation of automotive paints of very high scratch resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, the industrial processes for preparing isocyanatoalkylalkoxysilanes are very inconvenient and costly. The products are obtained in only moderate yields and, moreover, with varying quality and inadequate storage stability. Efforts have therefore already been made to synthesize alternative compounds which have both an isocyanate group and a silane structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">EP-A 1 136 495 describes a process for preparing low-monomer 1:1 mono adducts from specific secondary aminoalkylalkoxysilanes and diisocyanates, in which the co-reactants are reacted with one another using a large molar excess of isocyanate and, thereafter, the unconverted monomeric diisocyanates are removed by distillation. Aminosilanes used in this process are the aspartic esters which are known from EP-A 0 596 360, are obtainable by reaction of dialkyl maleates and aminosilanes and, according to the teaching of EP-A 1 136 495, form storage-stable adducts with isocyanates, in contrast to other simple secondary aminosilanes. As shown by in-house studies, the urea structures formed in the reaction of the silane-functional aspartic esters with isocyanates are indeed stable to redissociation, while simple N-alkylaminosilanes, with respect to isocyanate groups, act like standard blocking agents and are released again at elevated temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">During the thin-film distillation of reaction mixtures based on such simple N-alkylaminosilanes, even if a very high excess of diisocyanate has been chosen at the start, thermal urea cleavage and subsequently recombination, given that diisocyanate monomer has already partly distilled off, cause formation not only of the desired isocyanatosilane (1:1 mono adduct) but also of very high proportions of disilylated bisurea (2:1 bis adduct) as an unwanted by-product, which is no longer available for further conversion.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Even though the reaction, described in EP-A 1 136 495, of diisocyanates with silane-functional aspartic esters, in contrast, gives urea groups which are stable to redissociation under the conditions of a thin-film distillation, this process has another serious disadvantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">As known from EP-A 0 807 649, adducts of isocyanates onto aspartic esters containing alkoxysilane groups react even at comparatively mild temperatures of 50-160Â° C., with elimination of the alcohol from one of the ester groups and cyclization, to give hydantoin derivatives. This reaction inevitably also takes place in the process of EP-A 1 136 495 because of the thermal stress during the thin-film distillation. The monoalcohol released either reacts with the desired isocyanatosilane with urethanization and loss of NCO functionality in the target molecule or is distilled out of the product together with excess monomeric diisocyanate. The resultant diisocyanate distillate contaminated by the alcohol or by the urethane that forms cannot be reused in the synthesis process without further purification and may need to be disposed of in a costly manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A further method already known in principle for preparation of isocyanates containing silane groups is that of reacting polyisocyanates with mercaptosilanes. JP-A 60233133 describes, for example, the equimolar reaction of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) with 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. The reaction product which, as well as the 1:1 adduct, because of the statistical course of the reaction, contains considerable proportions of 2:1 bis adduct and monomeric, unconverted diisocyanate is used as such without further purification or monomer removal for modification of a polyamide. JP-A 61047774 describes the use of these reaction products as formation components for hotmelt adhesives.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">JP-A 61218631 also describes the use of reaction products of diisocyanates and mercaptosilanes for hotmelt adhesives. The reaction mixtures obtained through the equimolar reaction of diisocyanates and mercaptosilanes serve here for modification of polyester resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">DE-A 2540080 describes the use of different isocyanatosilanes, including adducts of polyisocyanates and silanes that are reactive toward isocyanate groups, for example including mercaptosilanes, in a ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to groups that are reactive toward isocyanates of at least 2:1, in specific adhesive compositions. In the specific examples of DE-A 2540080, however, isocyanatosilanes based on mercaptosilanes are not used.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,369, however, discloses that aliphatic and aromatic thiols are blocking agents for isocyanates, which are eliminated again at only low temperatures.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">There was therefore a need for novel isocyanatosilanes, especially thermally stable isocyanatosilanes, which can be prepared in a simple process.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing thermally stable and storage-stable isocyanatosilanes, which is based on raw materials of good availability and is additionally economically viable. Through the process according to the invention, the desired products should be preparable in a reliable and reproducible manner and without excessively large proportions of unwanted by-products.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by a process for preparing compounds containing isocyanate groups and silane groups, by reacting at least <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>A) a monomeric diisocyanate having aliphatically, cycloaliphatically, araliphatically and/or aromatically bonded isocyanate groups with</li><li>B) a mercaptosilane, <br /> characterized in that component A) is reacted with component B) in a ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to mercapto groups of at least 6:1 to at most 40:1. </li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0019">The process according to the invention is based on the surprising observation that thiourethanes formed from standard mercaptoalkylsilanes and diisocyanates, unlike the above-described N-alkylaminosilanes, are entirely stable under the conditions of a thin-film distillation. The person skilled in the art was unable to take any hint at all from any of the abovementioned publications that it is possible, in spite of the known thermal lability of thiourethanes, to work up reaction mixtures of diisocyanates and mercaptosilanes by distillation without breakdown; U.S. Pat. No. 4,246,369 even teaches that the opposite is the case. This surprising stability of thiourethane formation allows simple distillation of the unconverted monomers out of the desired isocyanatosilane (1:1 mono adduct) in reaction mixtures of mercaptosilanes and molar excess amounts of diisocyanates, without formation of an increased proportion of 2:1 bis adduct at the same time. Thus, it is also possible to achieve reactions with ratios of equivalents of isocyanate groups to mercapto groups of 6:1 to 40:1. Within this range, it is possible to reduce the formation of unwanted 2:1 bis adduct to an economically acceptable proportion and nevertheless to achieve sufficient conversion.</p>

      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0101">To 1680 g (10 mol) of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) at room temperature under dry nitrogen were added 351 g (1.0 mol) of an adduct of aminopropyltrimethoxysilane onto diethyl maleate prepared according to example 5 of EP-A 0 596 360 within one hour, and the mixture was stirred for one further hour until an NCO content of 39.3%, corresponding to full conversion, had been attained. Subsequently, the unconverted monomeric HDI was removed on a thin-film evaporator at a temperature of 140Â° C. and a pressure of 0.1 mbar. This gave a yellow/brown product having the following characteristic data:</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0000">NCO content: 8.3%</p>
      <heading id="h-00035-en" level="2">Monomeric HDI: 0.12%</heading>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0102">Viscosity (23Â° C.): 470 mPas</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0103">The example shows that the isocyanatosilane containing urea groups formed is unstable under the conditions of the thin-film distillation. According to analysis (GPC, <sup>13</sup>C NMR), about 30% of the urea groups originally present in the addition product have reacted by the mechanism described in EP-A 0 807 649 with elimination of ethanol to give hydantoin structures. The HDI obtained as the distillate of the thin-film process is contaminated by HDI ethyl urethanes.</p>
