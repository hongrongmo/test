      <b>Field of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process and system for producing fuel components, and more particularly to a process and system for producing fuel components from a material of biological origin. The process is a process comprising purifying of the feed material and refining the purified feed material to form a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds from which mixture liquid hydrocarbon compounds are separated and further fractionated into fuel components. The present invention relates further to fuel components obtained by the process of the present invention as well as to the use of the fuel components and a mixture comprising the fuel components.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>Background of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Raw materials of biological origin are potential sources of various biofuels or biofuel components. These raw materials can be converted to biofuels by feeding the raw material through a catalytic reactor by contacting it simultaneously with gaseous hydrogen. The resulting product is drawn off the reactor as a product stream which can be further fractionated for example by distillation to form biofuel/biofuel components.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">There are however various problems related to production processes of biofuels from the raw materials of biological origin, such as poisoning and clogging of the catalyst material used in the production processes. There are impurities in the raw materials of biological origin, such as metals and solids that cause the inactivation of the catalyst material and prevent it to function properly. In order to prevent the inactivation of the catalyst and to prolong its lifetime, the raw material can be purified and/or pretreated before feeding it to the hydrotreatment process. Purifying of the raw materials of biological origin to be suitable for feeding to a catalytic process is also challenging. Prior art describes various ways of doing this. However, these all have problems and the quality of the raw material is not always in required level for the catalytic step to be able to function in the most efficient way.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">One possibility of purifying and/or pretreating a raw material of biological origin to be fed to catalytic hydrotreatment processes is ion-exchange with an acidic ion exchange resin. Another possibility is to use methods such as adsorption on a suitable material, ion exchange, or acid washing to remove alkaline metals and earth alkaline metals (Na, K, Ca). Yet another possibility is to use degumming for removing metals in the feed. Degumming is performed by washing the biological feed at 90 - 105Â°C, 300 - 500 kPa(a), with H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, NaOH and soft water and separating the formed gums. A major amount of metal components, which are harmful for the hydrotreatment catalyst, are removed from the feedstock during the degumming stage.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">If the raw material of biological origin contains tall oil, depitching of the crude tall oil can be used to remove impurities from the tall oil. Depitched tall oil is obtained by evaporating crude tall oil, for example by thin-film evaporator. <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="US5705722A"><text>US patent document 5,705,722</text></patcit> describes converting unsaturated fatty acids, for example tall oil fatty acids to naphtha and cetane improvers for diesel fuels. According to the document, a feedstock comprising tall oil is fed through a hydrodeoxygenating reactor containing NiMo/CoMo catalyst where it is contacted with gaseous hydrogen. The resulting product is drawn off the reactor as one product stream which is further fractionated by distillation, to naphtha and middle distillate which is said to be used as a cetane improver. Also a residue is drawn off from the reactor. However, this process has disadvantages, for example the yield of biofuel or biofuel components, i.e. naphtha and cetane improvers, is poor. This is due to the fact that in depitching a huge amount of valuable raw material for hydrogenation is lost as residue, i.e. pitch. According to the document, the residue is used as such as fuel for boilers.</p>

      <b>Brief description of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An object of the present invention is thus to provide a process and a system for implementing the process so as to overcome the above problems. The objects of the invention are achieved by a process and a system, which are characterized by what is stated in the independent claims. The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The invention is based on the idea of purifying the material of biological origin and hydroprocessing the purified material of biological origin to form a mixture of hydrocarbon compounds, separating gaseous compounds from said mixture of hydrocarbon compounds to form liquid hydrocarbon compounds and fractionating said liquid hydrocarbon compounds to obtain fuel components. The purifying of the material of biological origin is performed by evaporating.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">By evaporation is meant here any suitable separation method for separating two or more components from each other, such as gases from liquid, which separation method is based on utilising the differences in the vapour pressure of the components. Examples of such separation methods are evaporation, flashing and distillation. Examples of suitable evaporation methods are those using thin film evaporation technology. The evaporators can thus be selected from the group of thin film evaporator, falling film evaporator, short path evaporator, plate molecular still and any other evaporator using thin film evaporation technology. The evaporation unit can comprise one, two, three or more evaporators which can be either of the same type or different type and are selected independently from the suitable separation methods presented above. If the evaporation unit comprises more than one evaporator, the evaporators are arranged in series.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">An advantage of the process and system of the invention is that when the material of biological origin is evaporated, the impurities, such as metals and solids are retained in the concentrate and the condensate retrieved from the evaporation is ready to be fed to the hydroprocessing reactor. If the evaporation is accomplished in two steps, i.e. the evaporation unit comprises two evaporators, water and light components are first evaporated from the material of biological origin in order to make the second evaporation step more efficient. Also the risk of carry-over is reduced in a controlled way. If the evaporation is accomplished in three steps, i.e. the evaporation unit comprises three evaporators, water and light components are first evaporated from the material of biological origin in the first evaporation step in order to make the following evaporation steps more efficient. In the second and third evaporation steps the residual fraction containing pitch is minimized by evaporating the liquid product of the first evaporation step. The advantage of using a three step evaporation unit is that the second evaporation step can be a small and cheap evaporator that removes light components from the material. The following third evaporation step can also be smaller and cheaper than the second step in two-step evaporation. Consequently, a three step evaporation unit can be cheaper than a two step evaporation unit. The heavy fraction from the second evaporation step is directed to the third evaporator, from which the heavy fraction is removed.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">An advantage of such purifying with a two, three or more step evaporation is that the boiling takes place in a more controlled manner because low boiling light components, i.e. components having boiling point of 150 - 210Â°C, preferably 150 - 170Â°C, in normal pressure, do not cause so much "carry over", i.e. migrating of the compounds having a boiling point range at the higher end of the above boiling point ranges as well as impurities to the vapour in the subsequent evaporation step. The light components, can be, if desired, returned back to the material of biological origin or refined further in another process or sold further as such.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">An advantage of the present invention compared to those known from the prior art is that the material of biological origin purified according to the present invention is ready to be fed to hydroprocessing and the hydroprocessing is able to produce fuel components with excellent yield. Especially when the feed contains tall oil, the process of the invention is advantageous compared to those known from the prior art. An advantage of the present invention is that the pitch can be avoided in the product fractions. A further advantage of the present invention is that the cold flow properties of the fuel are improved when the fuel components of the present invention are used in a fuel pool.</p>

The evaporating of the material of biological origin can be performed either in one, two, three or more steps. Having more than one evaporating step provides the advantage that the boiling in the evaporation steps following the first step takes place in a more controlled manner because low boiling light components do not cause so much "carry over", i.e. migrating of the impurities to the vapour. The light compounds separated in the first step can be recycled back to the evaporation unit or to another process step and refined in another production line or sold as such. In the case when the feed is crude tall oil, the light compounds comprise components having boiling point of 150 - 210Â°C in normal pressure, preferably 150 - 170Â°C, such as turpentine components, and light components boiling in a similar boiling range as turpentine.

The evaporator is preferably a plate molecular still or a thin film evaporator. Most preferably the evaporator is a thin film evaporator. The distillate of the second step is recovered as purified material and the liquid fraction is directed to third evaporation step. In the third step the fraction containing pitch is minimized by evaporating the liquid product of the second evaporation step at a temperature of 200 - 450Â°C and a pressure of 0 - 50 mbar, preferably at a temperature of 300 - 390Â° and a pressure of 0.01 - 10 mbar.

    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As a result of the purification metals, such as Na, P and Si are removed from the material of biological origin.

In the process of the invention the process conditions (temperature, pressure) of the evaporation are controlled in such a way that the heavy neutral components in the feed are withdrawn with the condensate, and not taken out with the heavy fraction as in prior art depitching. When the amount of heavy fraction is small, it means that the amount of purified biological material is higher that of the prior art processes.</p>

The additional purification may also be realised by a purification bed or section located in connection with the hydropocessing reactor. The process of the present invention optionally comprises one or more guard beds. The one or more guard beds can be arranged either to separate guard bed units and/or in the hydroprocessing reactor.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The guard bed has the task of acting against harmful substances in the feed. The guard bed is typically activated gamma aluminium oxide or some commercially available purifying catalyst. The guard bed material may also comprise catalyst materials that are capable of catalysing hydroprocessing reactions. The catalyst material may comprise the same material/materials that are used in the hydroprocessing reactor. The guard bed or the guard bed units can retain both solid and solvated impurities of the feed of biological origin, such as silicon based anti-foaming agents of a tall oil process and harmful chemical elements. The guard bed and/or the guard bed units can be heated, unheated, pressurized or unpressurised, fed with hydrogen gas or without hydrogen gas.

    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The process of the present invention comprises hydroprocessing the purified biological material in the presence of at least one catalyst to form a mixture of fuel components.

    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">According to one embodiment of the present invention the hydroprocessing is done in one step. The catalyst is a catalyst capable of hydrodeoxygenating, isomerising, ring opening and cracking the purified biological material to form a mixture of fuel components. In this embodiment, the catalyst is selected so, that it hydrates the double bonds of the purified biological material fed to the hydroprocessing. The catalyst removes heteroatoms of the feed molecules, especially oxygen, by hydrating. The catalyst has a capability of hydrogenating the olefinic bonds of the compounds in the feed, opening at least one of the bicyclic rings, and cracking the side chains of hydrocarbon chains. In other words, hydrocarbons are hydrogenated, isomerized and/or cracked in a single step. The cracking/isomerizing are controlled by process variables, such as pressure and/or temperature and by the properties of the catalyst, for example by controlling its acidicity. At the same time sulfur compounds are reduced to hydrogen sulphide. The catalyst contained in the hydroprocessing reactor is selected from catalysts containing metals from group VI and/or VIII of the Periodic System or mixtures or combinations thereof, which catalyst is capable of converting biological feed material to fuel components in a single step. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the catalyst comprises NiW, typically on a support selected from Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, zeolite, zeolite-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>.

In the first step the fatty acids contained in the feed material of biological origin are converted to n-paraffins and in the second step the obtained n-paraffins are isomerised and/or cracked. In the first step a catalyst is used which has a suitable metal, such as metals from Group VIII and /or VIB of the Periodic System may be used. Suitable catalysts are supported Pt, Pd, Ni, NiMo or a CoMo catalysts, on a suitable support, such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and/or SiO<sub>2</sub>. The catalyst used in the isomerising step is for example a molecular sieve, which contains as a metal noble metals from the group VIII, such as Pt and/or Pd, or a NiW catalyst on a suitable support, such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, zeolite, zeolite-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In order to function and stay active the catalysts used in the present invention need organic sulphur. Therefore when the feed of biological origin does not in itself contain sulphur or its sulphur concentration is too low, additional sulphur is fed to the step of hydroprocessing. The additional sulphur can be fed to the hydroprocessing step together with the feed of purified biological origin or it can be fed separately to the hydroprocessing step. Additional sulphur can be supplied to the process in gaseous form like hydrogen sulphide, or it can be any material that produces hydrogen sulphide in the process, like organic sulphur compounds, such as dimethyl disulphide. The amount of additional sulphur depends on the amount of sulphur contained in the feed. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the amount of needed sulphur without undue burden. Generally, the H<sub>2</sub> feed/H<sub>2</sub>S ratio must be maintained over about 0.0001, preferably over about 0.001.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The catalyst material must be activated before it is effective and taken into use. The activation comprises several steps, of which one is treating the catalyst with activating sulphur compound, for example dimethyl disulphide. The procedure of activating thus comprises sulphiding of the catalyst. The activation of catalysts is common knowledge in the art and will thus not be discussed here in detail.</p>

    <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">From the tables above it is obvious that the CTO HDO mid cut is poor as a blending component in terms of distillation and cold flow properties. CTO HW and CTO HW+HDO mid cuts perform well and the Cloud Point of the blend is improved and Cold Filter Plugging Point maintained within the EN 590 Grade E without disturbing the distillation properties. The Cloud Points (CP) and Cold Filtering Plugging Points (CFPP) of the samples are presented in <figref>Figure 3</figref>.</p>
