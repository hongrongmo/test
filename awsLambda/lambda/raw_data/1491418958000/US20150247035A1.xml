      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0024022, filed on Feb. 28, 2014, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2015-0022497, filed on Feb. 13, 2015, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition and a molded article produced using the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">BACKGROUND</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Lighting display devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the like using novel light sources have rapidly superseded existing light sources and have come to the forefront of light technology. The lighting display devices form a lighting display device package together with components such as reflectors, reflector cups, scramblers, housings, etc. The lighting display devices may efficiently utilize light by maximizing optical efficiency while having high reflectivity. To this end, it is desired for materials used for such a component to be able to withstand high temperatures and to minimize decreased whiteness due to reflection and yellowing.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thermoplastic and thermal resistant polyester resins have been used as the materials for the lighting display devices. The thermoplastic and thermal resistant polyester resins can have minimal deformation and excellent discoloration resistance at high temperatures relative to other resins, but can also exhibit problems of reduced impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To resolve the problems, compositions in which white pigments and fillers are added to the polyester resins have been developed. Reference is made, for example, to Korean patent laid-open publication No. 2012-0140332 A, which is directed to a polyester resin composition including a polyester resin defined therein, white pigment, and filler. However, such compositions also can have problems such as dramatically reduced impact strength and moldability depending on the amounts of the white pigments and the fillers, and decreased light stability at high temperatures during long term operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, in the thermoplastic polyester resins used for the components of the lighting display devices, there has been increasing demand for technologies to impart heat resistance to the polyester resins and improve light stability and discoloration resistance of the polyester resins even though exposed to light and heat for a long time, without decreasing moldability and mechanical properties.</p>

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0124">As shown in Table 2, it can be seen that Examples 1 to 3 according to the present invention exhibit excellent mechanical properties such as impact strength, and flexural strength, did not cause reflector deformation at high temperatures (260Â° C.), and have excellent initial yellowness index and reflectivity. It can be also seen that Examples 1 to 3 did not experience the greatly reduced yellowness index and reflectivity, and changes thereof even if left at high temperatures for a long time.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0125">Meanwhile, Comparative Examples 1 and 2, which do not include the second polyester resin, exhibit significantly reduced mechanical properties such as impact strength and flexural strength, as well as significantly reduced discoloration resistance and light stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0126">Furthermore, Comparative Example 3, which includes the amorphous polyester resin instead of the second polyester resin to reduce the crystallization rate, exhibits reduced mechanical properties, discoloration resistance and light stability relative to the Examples, and exhibits reduced crystallization rate and deteriorated moldability.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0127">In addition, Comparative Example 4, which did not include the first polyester resin, exhibits improved mechanical properties, but exhibits reflector deformation when left at 260Â° C. for 5 minutes due to non-uniform molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0128">Therefore, it is possible to improve significantly mechanical properties as well as discoloration resistance and light stability, and enhance greatly moldability and molding stability by using the first polyester resin and the second polyester resin in amounts as described herein.</p>

In some instances, as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art as of the filing of the present application, features, characteristics, and/or elements described in connection with a particular embodiment may be used singly or in combination with features, characteristics, and/or elements described in connection with other embodiments unless otherwise specifically indicated.
