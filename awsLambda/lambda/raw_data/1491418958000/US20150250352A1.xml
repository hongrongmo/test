      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a check valve, an injection assembly containing a check valve and a piercing needle, and a beverage preparation machine integrating said injection assembly. In particular, the check valve of the present invention has been developed for safety and compactness reasons.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In the state of the art beverage preparation machines are known, which include an injection assembly for injecting a hot fluid into a capsule containing beverage ingredients, in order to brew and dispense a beverage. Typically such beverage preparation machines further include a reservoir for storing a fluid, a heater for heating the fluid received from the reservoir, an air separator for removing air from the heated liquid, and an injection assembly for piercing the capsule and for injecting the fluid into the capsule. In most cases a check valve is located between the air separator and the piercing needle. The check valve opens when fluid is pressurized upstream, and otherwise closes to prevent backflow into the machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">WO 2009/135899 A1 discloses a beverage preparation device according to the above-described state of the art. The beverage production device comprises means to hold a capsule, means for heating and supplying a fluid, and means for injecting the hot fluid into the capsule. The machine particularly discloses a check valve, which is connected between an air separator and a fluid line to an injection member.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> of the present application shows the check valve, which is used in WO 2009/135899 A1. The check valve has a water inlet <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a water outlet <b>2</b><i>a. </i>The check valve design has the disadvantage that between the preparations of two beverages, a large dead volume <b>3</b><i>a </i>of hot fluid remains between the check valve and the piercing needle. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows that the dead volume <b>3</b><i>a </i>appears particularly in cavities within the check valve and in a fluid line downstream of the check valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Any dead volume of fluid in a beverage preparation machine is disadvantageous due to safety and health issues. A dead volume can promote the development of bacteria, for example bacteria originating in and/or migrating into the dead volume from a used capsule, which has not yet been ejected or removed from the beverage preparation machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">EP 2 395 269 A1 discloses a check valve having a reduced dead volume. The check valve <b>1</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>of the present application and comprises a main body <b>2</b><i>b </i>and a plug member <b>3</b><i>b </i>inside the body <b>2</b><i>b. </i>The plug member <b>3</b><i>b </i>is subjected to an elastic load <b>4</b><i>b </i>housed inside a cavity of the body <b>2</b><i>b. </i>The plug member <b>3</b><i>b </i>is movable. The check valve further comprises a conduit <b>9</b><i>b, </i>along which a pressurized fluid may flow. In an open position of the plug member <b>3</b><i>b, </i>the fluid can flow past a head part of the plug member <b>3</b><i>b, </i>whereas in a closed position of the plug member <b>3</b><i>b </i>the fluid flow is interrupted by the head part of the plug member, since the head part engages with a seat <b>19</b><i>b. </i>The conduit <b>9</b><i>b </i>further has an off-take conduit <b>32</b><i>b </i>connecting to a chamber <b>30</b><i>b. </i>Due to the off-take conduit <b>32</b><i>b </i>the fluid in the conduit <b>9</b><i>b </i>can exert a pressure on a first surface <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the plug member <b>3</b><i>b, </i>and can move the plug member <b>3</b><i>b </i>to its open position, if the fluid pressure exceeds a predetermined threshold.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref>
        <i>b </i>shows how such a check valve can be integrated with an air separator in a beverage preparation machine. The check valve, however, has the disadvantage that it leaves still a too important dead volume downstream of the check valve, and moreover takes a lot of space in the machine due to its bulky configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In view of the above, the object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. In particular, the object of the present invention is to provide a check valve, an injection assembly and a beverage preparation machine, which reduce the risk of bacteria development due to a reduced dead volume, and can additionally be built more compact.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The main objects of the present invention are solved by the attached independent claims. The attached dependent claims develop further advantages of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In particular, the present invention is directed to a check valve comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>a body defining a cylindrical chamber presenting an upper wall and a lower wall, wherein:     <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>the upper wall comprises a central opening and</li><li>the lower wall presents a shoulder around a bore,</li><li>the end of said bore comprises a central opening and forms the seat of the valve,</li></ul></li><li>a plug member housed inside the body chamber, the plug member comprising:     <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li>a tube with a bore, said tube extending through the body chamber upper wall central opening,</li><li>a cylindrical sealing element around the tube, said cylindrical sealing element dividing the body chamber in an upper cavity and lower cavity and sealing said cavities one from the other,</li><li>wherein the surface of the cylindrical sealing element facing the lower cavity presents a shoulder around a protruding part, said protruding part being configured to fit inside the bore of the body chamber lower wall to act as the valve member,</li><li>wherein the bore inside the plug member tube extends through the plug member and emerges in the lower cavity of the body chamber, and</li></ul></li><li>an elastic element housed in the body upper cavity in order to press the plug member protruding part against the valve seat.</li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0021">The check valve could be integrated into a beverage preparation machine as shown in WO 2009/135899 A1. The geometry of the check valve of the present invention is much compacter than the check valves of the prior art. The reason for its compactness is mainly the specific arrangement of the plug member with its fluid inlet and its fluid outlet, and the elastic member inside the body. The check valve can in particular be built such that the valve outlet and inlet are aligned with each other and also with the movement direction of the plug member, in order to achieve maximum compactness.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0022">The check valve of the present invention only opens and lets fluid pass through, when the fluid flow is directed from the valve inlet to the valve outlet. In an opposite fluid direction the pressure on the valve member does not increase beyond the predetermined threshold. The force exerted by the elastic member for biasing the plug member into its closed position is too large to be overcome by typical fluid pressures on the plug member from the valve outlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0023">The valve inlet is integrated with the plug member so that it also moves together with the moving plug member. By aligning the plug member, in particular the free movement directions of the plug member, with the orientation of the valve outlet and the valve inlet, a very compact check valve can be built.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0024">Preferably, the elastic member is arranged in the upper cavity of the body chamber. The elastic member does not come into contact with the fluid and therefore has a longer lifetime. Furthermore, the specific arrangement of the elastic member within the body of the check valve favors a compact design of the check valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0025">Preferably, the elastic member is a coil spring and said coil spring is wrapped around the tube of the plug member passing through the upper cavity. By wrapping the coil spring around the fluid inlet extending from the second surface through the body, a very compact design of the check valve is possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0026">Preferably, the plug member comprises a protruding part protruding from the first surface towards the first fluid outlet, wherein the second fluid outlet of the plug member is arranged on a side surface of the protruding part.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0027">Preferably, the bore inside the plug member tube emerges on a side surface of the plug member protruding part. Thus, the valve outlet and the part of the plug member that is responsible for interrupting the fluid flow to the second fluid outlet are integrated. Thereby, the compactness of the check valve is supported. The end of the protruding part is preferably deformable as to adjust to the shape of the valve outlet, in order to interrupt the fluid flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0028">Preferably, the lower part and the upper part of the body are separate parts, which are connected to each other by engaging means. The check valve can thus be easily assembled or disassembled for reasons of exchange or cleaning.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0029">Preferably, the elastic element is connected to the upper part of the body with its first end, and to the second surface of the plug member with its second end. The connection can for example be realized by a releasable snap connection so that the elastic element can be easily installed or removed for purposes of cleaning or adjustment.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0030">Preferably, the central opening in the bore of the body chamber lower wall is designed for attaching an injection needle of a beverage machine. Thus, the assembly of an injection needle and a check valve can be made very compact. Additionally, by attaching the injection needle directly to the valve outlet, the dead volume downstream of the assembly can be reduced to the internal volume of the piercing needle. The check valve exhibits no other downstream cavities, in which a dead volume could remain after beverage preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0031">Preferably, the tube of the plug member is designed for attaching a flexible tube of a beverage machine. The check valve can thus be easily installed inside different beverage preparation machines, e.g. in a machine like described in WO 2009/135899 A1. The flexible tube will move with the movement of the valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0032">The present invention is further directed to an injection assembly comprising a check valve according to the above description, a piercing needle for penetrating a capsule containing beverage ingredients, and for injecting fluid into the capsule, wherein the piercing needle is attached to the first fluid outlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0033">The injection assembly is with only minor modifications of the machine compatible with a machine as described in WO 2009/135899 A1. The injection assembly has only a very small dead volume of fluid after the production of beverages, particularly a dead volume that is reduced to the internal volume of the piercing needle. The injection assembly is further very compact, and requires less space in the beverage preparation machine. The beverage preparation machine can therefore be designed smaller.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0034">The present invention is further directed to a beverage preparation machine comprising a fluid reservoir for storing a fluid, a heater for heating fluid received from the fluid reservoir, an injection assembly according to the above description, wherein the check valve is connected to receive fluid from the heater; and a dispensing chamber for receiving and holding a capsule containing beverage ingredients, and for dispensing as a beverage the fluid injected by the injection assembly into the capsule.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0035">The beverage preparation machine can be operated with less danger of bacteria migrating to or developing in a dead volume of fluid downstream of the check valve, since the total dead volume is reduced. Further, the beverage preparation machine can be built smaller, since the check valve requires less space in the machine. The beverage preparation machine can be designed similar to the machine presented in WO 2009/135899 A1 with a reconstruction of at least the injection assembly according to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0036">Preferably, the beverage preparation machine further comprises an air separator for removing air from the fluid heated in the heater, wherein the check valve is connected to receive substantially airless fluid from the air separator.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0037">The airless fluid enables a more precise and qualitatively improved brewing of the beverage in the beverage preparation machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0038">In the present application the terms âupperâ, âlowerâ, âaxialâ, âsideâ are used to describe the relational positioning of features of the invention. These terms should be understood to refer to the sense of introduction of the fluid in the valve. Consequently âupperâ relates to the part of the valve that is upstream according to the fluid path in the valve and by opposition âlowerâ relates to the part of the valve that is downstream according to the fluid path in the valve. Similarly âaxialâ corresponds to the global direction of the fluid between the valve inlet and the valve outlet as illustrated by the axis XXâ² in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and âsideâ corresponds to elements oriented perpendicularly to said axis.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0047">In <figref>FIG. 3</figref> it is shown that an injection assembly <b>60</b> according to the present invention comprises a check valve <b>10</b> according to the present invention and a piercing needle <b>50</b> attached directly to the check valve <b>10</b>. The piercing needle <b>50</b> is suited to penetrate a capsule or cartridge or some other similar container that contains beverage ingredients and is held inside a beverage preparation machine. The piercing needle <b>50</b> is further suitable for injecting a fluid, which it receives directly from an outlet of the check valve <b>10</b>, into the capsule. In the injection assembly <b>60</b> according to the present invention, the piercing needle <b>50</b> can be directly attached to the fluid outlet <b>21</b> of the check valve <b>10</b>, in order to reduce the dead volume and the size of the injection assembly <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0048">The check valve <b>10</b> comprises: <ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>a body <b>20</b> that has been represented in dotted lines,</li><li>a plug member <b>30</b>, which is disposed at least partially inside the body <b>20</b>, and</li><li>an elastic member <b>40</b>, which is disposed inside the body <b>20</b>.</li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0052">The body <b>20</b> defines a cylindrical chamber presenting an upper wall <b>201</b> and a lower wall <b>202</b>. The upper wall <b>201</b> comprises a central opening <b>22</b>. The lower wall <b>202</b> presents a shoulder <b>202</b><i>a </i>around a bore <b>202</b><i>b. </i>The end of said bore <b>202</b><i>b </i>comprises a central opening <b>202</b><i>c </i>to the outside of the chamber and forms the seat of the valve. The central opening <b>202</b><i>c </i>communicates with the valve outlet <b>21</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0053">As illustrated also in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> the body <b>20</b> is preferably divided into an upper part <b>20</b><i>b </i>and a lower part <b>20</b><i>a. </i>The upper part <b>20</b><i>b </i>can be preferably connected to the lower part <b>20</b><i>a </i>by means of engaging means. The engaging means are for example designed as a protrusion <b>36</b> provided on the upper part <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>20</b> and corresponding holes <b>26</b> in the lower part <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the body <b>20</b>. The upper part <b>20</b><i>a </i>can in this case be snapped to the lower part <b>20</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this kind of engaging means. The body <b>20</b> of the check valve <b>10</b> is preferably made of a plastic material or a metal. In any case the material of the body <b>20</b> is at least impermeable to the fluid used for brewing the beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0054">The body <b>20</b> presents a symmetrical shape around axis XXâ² on which the central opening <b>22</b>, the bore <b>202</b><i>b </i>and the opening <b>202</b><i>c </i>are centered.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0055">The body <b>20</b> has internal space for housing the plug member <b>30</b>. The plug member comprises a tube <b>31</b> with a bore <b>32</b>. The inlet of this bore corresponds to the fluid inlet of the valve. This tube <b>31</b> extends through the central opening <b>22</b> of the body chamber upper wall. The plug member comprises a cylindrical sealing element <b>38</b> around the tube <b>31</b>. This sealing element <b>38</b> divides the chamber of the body in an upper cavity <b>12</b> and lower cavity <b>11</b> and seals said cavities one from the other. This sealing element has a global disc shape extending from the tube <b>31</b> to the lateral sides of the body chamber. Preferably it incorporates an O-ring <b>38</b><i>a </i>to improve sealing between the two cavities. The lower surface <b>381</b> of the cylindrical sealing element that faces the lower cavity <b>11</b> presents a shoulder <b>39</b> around a protruding part <b>35</b>. This protruding part <b>35</b> is configured to fit inside the bore <b>202</b><i>b </i>of the body chamber lower wall to act as the valve member of the check valve. Preferably the lower cavity <b>11</b> presents a small volume so as to avoid dead volume of fluid in the valve. For this reason the shape of the plug member is conformal and as close as possible to the shape of the body lower wall <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0056">The bore <b>32</b> inside the plug member tube <b>31</b> extends through the plug member and emerges in the lower cavity <b>11</b> of the body chamber. Preferably the bore <b>32</b> inside the plug member tube emerges at an outlet <b>321</b> on a side surface of the plug member protruding part <b>35</b>. So the fluid can exit oblique or orthogonal to the tube <b>31</b> and the axis XXâ². The end of the protruding part <b>35</b> can be made of a rubber or plastic material, and is formed to match or resemble as close as possible the internal profile of the bore <b>202</b><i>b. </i>Since said end is in contact with the hot fluid it might need to be exchanged after some time. That end part is preferably deformable so as to be able to adapt to the shape of the opening <b>202</b><i>c, </i>in order to most efficiently interrupt the fluid flow out of the check valve <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0057">Finally the check valve comprises an elastic element <b>40</b> housed in the body upper cavity <b>12</b> in order to press the plug member protruding part <b>35</b> against the valve seat. For example, the elastic member <b>40</b> can be a coil spring. The coil spring is further preferably disposed in such a manner in the body <b>20</b> that it is wrapped around the tube <b>31</b>, which preferably extends through the upper cavity <b>12</b>. Thereby, a compact arrangement of the check valve <b>10</b> can be achieved. Preferably the force of the elastic element <b>40</b> is set such that at rest the plug member protruding part <b>35</b> is pressed against the valve seat that is the central opening <b>202</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0058">The fluid outlet <b>21</b> is designed to directly attach the injection needle <b>50</b>. For example, the injection needle <b>50</b> could be screwed into or onto the fluid outlet <b>21</b> provided with a thread. Alternatively, the injection needle <b>50</b> could be snapped onto the fluid outlet <b>21</b> provided with a snap connector or similar engaging means. Thus, the dead volume downstream of the check valve <b>10</b> is reduced to the internal volume of the injection needle <b>50</b>. The injection needle <b>50</b> is preferably made of plastic or metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0059">The fluid inlet at the extremity of the tube <b>31</b> is further designed to attach a fluid line or pipe, for instance a flexible tube to deliver fluid from a heater or an air separator, to the fluid inlet. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> the tube <b>31</b> can to this end be provided with several protrusions or step-like structures, which allow to easily slide a flexible tube onto the fluid inlet with only small resistance, but prevent the flexible tube from sliding off the fluid inlet by a larger resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0060">The plug member <b>30</b> is movable within the body <b>20</b> along the direction XXâ² that is aligned with the injection needle <b>50</b>. The plug member <b>30</b> can move between an open position and a closed position depending on the pressure of the fluid delivered in the valve. In operation fluid is delivered to the bore <b>32</b> in the tube <b>31</b> that flows through the plug member <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>11</b>, which is formed between the lower surface <b>381</b> of the plug cylindrical sealing element <b>38</b> and the lower wall of the body chamber <b>202</b>. Depending on the pressure of the fluid introduced in the lower cavity <b>11</b> the plug member can be moved upward against the force of the elastic member <b>40</b> and consequently prevents the plug member protruding part <b>35</b> from pressing against the valve seat and the central opening <b>202</b><i>c; </i>fluid can be delivered through the needle <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0061">In its closed positionâthat is at rest or under a low fluid pressureâthe plug member <b>30</b> is located closest to the injection needle <b>50</b>, and the protruding part <b>35</b> of the plug member closes the central opening <b>202</b><i>c </i>of the bore <b>202</b><i>b </i>to interrupt a fluid path from the cavity <b>11</b> through the fluid outlet <b>21</b> into the injection needle <b>50</b>. Indeed the elastic member <b>40</b> bias the plug member <b>30</b> to its closed position, if no fluid is flowing.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0062">In its open positionâthat is when a higher fluid pressureâpressurized fluid is introduced through the outlet <b>381</b> inside the lower cavity <b>11</b>. If said fluid pressure on the surface <b>381</b> of the cylindrical sealing element facing the lower cavity is equal to or larger than a predetermined threshold pressure, the plug member <b>30</b> is moved from its closed position, into which it is biased by the elastic member <b>40</b>, to its open position against the force exerted by the elastic member. This upward movement of the plug member <b>30</b> removes its protruding part <b>35</b> from the opening <b>202</b><i>c </i>at the end of bore <b>202</b><i>b </i>that acts as a valve seat. Consequently the fluid path is opened from the inlet at the extremity of the tube <b>31</b> down to the needle <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0063">When the fluid pressure on the surface <b>381</b> of the cylindrical sealing element facing the lower cavity <b>11</b> is or drops below the predetermined threshold after the beverage has been prepared, the plug member <b>30</b> is moved to its closed position due to the elastic force exerted by the elastic member <b>40</b> onto the upper surface <b>34</b> of the sealing element <b>38</b> of the plug member.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0064">In case that fluid flows in the opposite direction, for instance caused by a back pressure from the injection needle <b>50</b> or capsule to the fluid outlet <b>21</b>, the fluid can only exercise fluid pressure onto the head part <b>37</b> of the plug member <b>30</b>. However, the surface of said head part <b>37</b> is designed small enough that the typical fluid pressure cannot overcome the elastic force of the elastic member <b>40</b>. Only in case fluid pressure is applied to the larger first surface <b>381</b>, the check valve <b>10</b> can be opened.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0065">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows another view of the injection assembly <b>60</b> of the present invention. Here the injection assembly <b>60</b> is inserted into and is held in a dispensing chamber <b>90</b> of a beverage preparation machine. It can be seen that preferably the plug member <b>30</b> is provided with sealing means <b>38</b>, more preferably an O-ring disposed around a cylindrical main body of the plug member <b>30</b>. The sealing member is designed to seal the lower cavity <b>11</b> from the upper cavity <b>12</b> so as to prevent any fluid flow from one to the other. Thereby, no fluid can enter into the cavity <b>12</b>, in which the elastic member <b>40</b> is disposed. Also dirt and dust is blocked from entering the first cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0066">As mentioned above the elastic member <b>40</b> is for example a coil spring made of metal. Such an elastic member <b>40</b> could deteriorate if in permanent contact with the fluid. In the dry upper cavity <b>12</b> the life time of the elastic member <b>40</b> is prolonged. The sealing means <b>38</b> is also suited to guide the movement of the plug member <b>30</b> inside the body <b>20</b>. By means of said guidance movement of the plug member can be restricted to a single axis movement, i.e. a movement in the first and opposite second direction, respectively. Preferably, the movement directions are aligned (i.e. oriented along a same axis) with the orientation of the inlet tube <b>31</b> and the injection needle <b>50</b>.</p>

The opening <b>22</b> in the upper part is shown, through which preferably the tube <b>31</b> of the plug member <b>30</b> extends. Also the engaging means <b>26</b>, <b>36</b> are shown, which are suitable to connect the upper part <b>20</b><i>b </i>and lower part <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>20</b>.</p>

The plug member <b>30</b> fits to the inner shape of the body <b>20</b>, and is tightly guided, preferably by the sealing means <b>38</b>, so that only movement in predetermined opposite directions, preferably the first and second directions, is possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0070">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref>
        <i>b </i>is a side view showing the cylindrical sealing element <b>38</b> of the plug member <b>30</b>. The cylindrical portion has the tube <b>32</b> protruding from one face <b>34</b> thereof, and has the protruding part <b>35</b> protruding from the opposite face <b>33</b> thereof. The elastic member <b>40</b>, preferably a coil spring made from a metal, is wrapped around the tube <b>32</b>. In this way a compact arrangement of the components inside the body <b>20</b> is achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0071">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>, which comprises the injection assembly <b>60</b> of the present invention, which again includes the check valve <b>10</b> of the present invention and the injection needle <b>50</b>. The beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> comprises at least one water reservoir <b>70</b> for storing a fluid, which is used to prepare a beverage. The reservoir <b>70</b> is in fluid connection with the heater <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0072">The heater <b>80</b> receives fluid from the reservoir <b>70</b>, and is configured to heat up the fluid to a set desired temperature. The temperature can be controlled by the user or automatically depending on the type of capsule in the machine. Therefore, the machine can have means for detecting and identifying an inserted capsule. The temperature can be controlled with a temperature sensor coupled to a control unit, for instance a microprocessor, of the machine. The heater <b>80</b> is in fluid connection with the check valve <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0073">Optionally, an air separator <b>85</b> can be connected between the heater <b>80</b> and the check valve <b>10</b>. An air separator is used for removing air from the heated liquid. The air separator <b>85</b> therefore separates the air from the fluid as for example described in WO 2009/135899 A1. For instance the air is separated by means of a special valve and disposed through an air outlet. The airless fluid is further provided to the check valve <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0074">The check valve <b>10</b> functions as described above, and is directly attached to the injection needle <b>50</b>. If a beverage is to be dispensed, the injection needle <b>50</b> is injected into a capsule <b>110</b>, which has been inserted into and is held in a dispensing chamber <b>90</b> of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>. When the fluid is injected into the capsule <b>110</b> the ingredients inside the capsule <b>110</b> mix with the heated fluid and a beverage is brewed. After a predetermined amount of time, which can for instance be set automatically according to the detected type of capsule, the heated fluid interacting with the beverage ingredients in the capsule is dispensed from the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> as the final beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0075">After the preparation of each beverage, the only dead volume in the beverage preparation machine according to the present invention is the internal volume of the injection needle. Thus, it is less likely that bacteria migrate to or develop in dead volumes inside the beverage preparation machine. Since furthermore, the injection needle <b>50</b> is preferably detachable from the check valve <b>10</b>, it can be regularly cleaned or replaced so that the risk is further reduced. The beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is consequently safer than beverage preparation machines known from the state of the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0076">Moreover, the injection assembly <b>60</b> is more compact, since no fluid lines are necessary between the check valve <b>10</b> and the injection needle <b>50</b>. Furthermore, it has been described above how the check valve <b>10</b> itself can be built very compact. Therefore, the whole beverage preparation machine can be built smaller.</p>
