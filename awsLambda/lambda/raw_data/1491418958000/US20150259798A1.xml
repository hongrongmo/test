      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0031009, filed on Mar. 17, 2014, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. Â§119, the content of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the invention relate to an atomic layer deposition apparatus, and more particularly to an atomic layer deposition apparatus which forms an atomic layer in the form of a fine thin film on a substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A gas injection device of an atomic layer deposition apparatus typically includes injection nozzles for injecting multiple reaction gases and purge gas nozzles provided between the injection nozzles to prevent foreign substances from being generated due to unwanted reactions between the reaction gases.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In general, to deposit a thin film having a predetermined thickness on a substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer or glass, a thin film fabrication method using a steam method, a chemical vapor deposition method, or an atomic layer deposition method is used. Among such deposition methods, the atomic layer deposition method is a method for stacking respective reactants on a processed substrate in the unit of an atomic layer by successively supplying reaction gases and purge gases through a gas pulsing method.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The atomic layer deposition method is typically used to form a thin film having a high aspect ratio to increase integrity of a semiconductor device, for thin film uniformity on uneven surfaces, and to improve electrical and physical properties. According to the atomic layer deposition method, reactants are dissolved by chemical replacements through a periodic supply of reaction gases rather than incineration to provide a stoichiometric film with high film density. Since residual products produced due to the chemical replacements in the process are always gases, the residual products may be efficiently removed to facilitate cleaning of a chamber. Further, since only temperature is a process parameter, the process adjustment and maintenance may be easily performed. However, it typically takes a relatively long time to form a desired thin film over the whole region of the substrate using the atomic layer deposition apparatus in comparison to other deposition apparatuses.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which various embodiments are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms, and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being âonâ another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being âdirectly onâ another element, there are no intervening elements present.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">It will be understood that, although the terms âfirst,â âsecond,â âthirdâ etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, âa first element,â âcomponent,â âregion,â âlayerâ or âsectionâ discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ are intended to include the plural forms, including âat least one,â unless the content clearly indicates otherwise. âOrâ means âand/or.â As used herein, the term âand/orâ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms âcomprisesâ and/or âcomprising,â or âincludesâ and/or âincludingâ when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Furthermore, relative terms, such as âlowerâ or âbottomâ and âupperâ or âtop,â may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to another element as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as being on the âlowerâ side of other elements would then be oriented on âupperâ sides of the other elements. The exemplary term âlower,â can therefore, encompasses both an orientation of âlowerâ and âupper,â depending on the particular orientation of the figure. Similarly, if the device in one of the figures is turned over, elements described as âbelowâ or âbeneathâ other elements would then be oriented âaboveâ the other elements. The exemplary terms âbelowâ or âbeneathâ can, therefore, encompass both an orientation of above and below.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">âAboutâ or âapproximatelyâ as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system). For example, âaboutâ can mean within one or more standard deviations, or within Â±30%, 20%, 10%, 5% of the stated value.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present claims.</p>
