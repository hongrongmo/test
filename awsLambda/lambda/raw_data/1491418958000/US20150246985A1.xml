      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ionomer resins and polyurethane are used as materials for constituting golf balls. Use of the ionomer resins as the constituting material of the golf ball provides the golf ball traveling a great distance, because of its high stiffness. Accordingly, ionomer resins are widely used as a material constituting a cover or an intermediate layer of the golf ball. However, there still remains a room for further improvement with respect to the stiffness and fluidity thereof and various improvements have been proposed for improving these properties.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In order to improve the resilience of the golf ball, from an aspect of the golf ball construction, there is an approach of making the thin-walled cover or intermediate layer. From an aspect of the material, the ionomer resin having a high degree of neutralization is employed. However, since the ionomer resin having a high degree of neutralization has low fluidity, it is difficult to make a thin-walled cover or intermediate layer. As a technology of improving the fluidity of the ionomer resin, it is known that a metal salt of a fatty acid is added to the ionomer resin having a high degree of neutralization. However, if the added amount is less than the certain level, the effect of improving the resilience of the obtained golf ball is low, while if the added amount is more than the certain level, the durability of the obtained golf ball is lowered, because mechanical properties of the material are lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above circumstances. An object of the present invention is to provide a golf ball resin composition that comprises an ionomer resin with an excellent resilience and fluidity. Another object of the present invention is to provide a golf ball excellent in the resilience without lowering the durability significantly in a golf ball using the ionomer resin for the intermediate layer.</p>

If the content of (B) the fatty acid metal salt is 25 parts by mass or more, the resilience of the golf ball improves, while if the content is 100 parts by mass or less, it is possible to suppress the lowering of the durability of the golf ball due to the increase in the low molecular weight component.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">If the golf ball resin composition of the present invention, which is obtained by neutralizing (A) the ternary ionomer resin with (B) the fatty acid metal salt, is analyzed with FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer), an area A under a peak around 1600 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and an area B under a peak around 1700 cm<sup>â1 </sup>in the obtained spectrum preferably satisfy the following equation: 0.50â¦P=A/(A+B)â¦1.00.</p>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The golf ball resin composition of the present invention preferably contains, as a resin component, (A) the ternary ionomer resin and (B) the fatty acid metal salt only, but may further contain another thermoplastic elastomer to the extent that the effect of the present invention is not deteriorated.

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The golf ball resin composition of the present invention can be obtained, for example, by dry blending (A) the ternary ionomer resin and (B) the fatty acid metal salt, followed by extruding them in the form of pellet. The dry blending may be carried out using for example, a mixer capable of blending a raw material in the form of pellet, more preferably a tumbler type mixer. In addition to the dry blending, the materials may be supplied respectively by the respective feeding machines. Extruding can be carried out by publicly known extruders such as a single-screw kneading extruder, a twin-screw kneading extruder, and a twin-single kneading extruder.

      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The golf ball of the present invention is not limited, as long as it comprises a constituent member formed from the golf ball resin composition of the present invention. For example, in a two-piece golf ball comprising a single-layered core and a cover disposed around the core, in a three-piece golf ball comprising a core having a center and a single-layered intermediate layer disposed around the center, and a cover disposed around the core, and in a multi-piece golf ball comprising a core having a center and at least one intermediate layer disposed around the center, and a cover disposed around the core (including the three-piece golf ball mentioned above), anyone of constituent members is formed from the above golf ball resin composition. In one preferable embodiment, the intermediate layer is formed from the above golf ball resin composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In the followings, the present invention will be explained based on the preferable golf ball that comprises a core having a center and at least one intermediate layer disposed around the center and a cover disposed around the core, wherein the intermediate layer is formed from the above golf ball resin composition. However, the present invention is not limited to this embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The core of the golf ball of the present invention preferably includes, for example, a multi-layered core having a center and at least one intermediate layer covering the center. The core preferably has a spherical shape. If the core does not have a spherical shape, the cover does not have a uniform thickness. As a result, there exist some portions where the performance of the cover is lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">On the other hand, the center generally has the spherical shape, but the center may be provided with a rib on the surface thereof so that the surface of the spherical center is divided by the ribs. For example, the surface of the spherical center is evenly divided by the ribs. In one embodiment, the ribs are preferably formed on the surface of the spherical center in an integrated manner, and in another embodiment, the ribs are formed as an intermediate layer on the surface of the spherical center. The ribs are preferably formed along an equatorial line and meridians that evenly divide the surface of the spherical center, if the spherical center is assumed as the earth. For example, if the surface of the spherical center is evenly divided into 8, the ribs are formed along the equatorial line, any meridian as a standard, and meridians at the longitude 90 degrees east, longitude 90 degrees west, and the longitude 180 degrees east(west), assuming that the meridian as the standard is at longitude 0 degree. If the ribs are formed, the depressed portion divided by the ribs are preferably filled with a plurality of intermediate layers or with a single-layered intermediate layer that fills each of the depressed portions to make a core in the spherical shape. The shape of the ribs, without limitation, includes an arc or an almost arc (for example, a part of the arc is removed to obtain a flat surface at the cross or orthogonal portions thereof).</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">A conventionally known rubber composition (hereinafter, sometimes simply referred to as âcenter rubber compositionâ) may be employed for the center of the golf ball of the present invention, and it can be molded by, for example, heat-pressing a rubber composition containing a base rubber, a crosslinking initiator, a co-crosslinking agent, and a filler.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As the base rubber, a natural rubber and/or a synthetic rubber may be used. Examples of the base rubber are a polybutadiene rubber, a natural rubber, a polyisoprene rubber, a styrene polybutadiene rubber, and ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer (EPDM). Among them, typically preferred is the high cis-polybutadiene having cis-1,4-bond in a proportion of 40% or more, more preferably 70% or more, even more preferably 90% or more in view of its superior resilience property.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The crosslinking initiator is blended to crosslink the base rubber component. As the crosslinking initiator, an organic peroxide is preferably used. Examples of the organic peroxide for use in the present invention are dicumyl peroxide, 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(t-butylperoxy)hexane, and di-t-butyl peroxide. Among them, dicumyl peroxide is preferable. An amount of the crosslinking initiator to be blended in the rubber composition is preferably 0.3 part by mass or more, more preferably 0.4 part by mass or more, and is preferably 5 parts by mass or less, more preferably 3 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the base rubber. If the amount is less than 0.3 part by mass, the center becomes too soft, and the resilience tends to be lowered, and if the amount is more than 5 parts by mass, the amount of the co-crosslinking agent must be increased in order to obtain the appropriate hardness, which tends to cause the insufficient resilience.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The co-crosslinking agent is not particularly limited as long as it serves to crosslink a rubber molecule by graft polymerization to a base rubber molecular chain; for example, Î±,Î²-unsaturated carboxylic acid having 3 to 8 carbon atoms or a metal salt thereof, more preferably acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or a metal salt thereof may be used. As the metal constituting the metal salt, for example, zinc, magnesium, calcium, aluminum and sodium may be used, and among them, zinc is preferred because it provides high resilience.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The amount of the co-crosslinking agent to be used is preferably 10 parts or more, more preferably 15 parts or more, even more preferably 20 parts or more, and is preferably 55 parts or less, more preferably 50 parts or less, even more preferably 48 parts or less, based on 100 parts of the base rubber by mass. If the amount of the co-crosslinking agent to be used is less than 10 parts by mass, the amount of the crosslinking initiator must be increased to obtain an appropriate hardness, which tends to lower the resilience. On the other hand, if the amount of the co-crosslinking agent to be used is more than 55 parts by mass, the center becomes too hard, so that the shot feeling may be lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The filler contained in the center rubber composition is mainly blended as a specific gravity adjusting agent in order to adjust the specific gravity of the golf ball obtained as the final product in the range of 1.0 to 1.5, and may be blended as required. Examples of the filler include an inorganic filler such as zinc oxide, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, tungsten powder, and molybdenum powder. The amount of the filler to be blended in the rubber composition is preferably 0.5 part or more, more preferably 1 part or more, and is preferably 30 parts or less, more preferably 20 parts or less based on 100 parts of the base rubber by mass. If the amount of the filler to be blended is less than 0.5 part by mass, it becomes difficult to adjust the weight, while if it is more than 30 parts by mass, the weight ratio of the rubber component becomes small and the resilience tends to be lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As the center rubber composition, an organic sulfur compound, an antioxidant or a peptizing agent may be blended appropriately in addition to the base rubber, the crosslinking initiator, the co-crosslinking agent and the filler.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As the organic sulfur compound, diphenyl disulfide or a derivative thereof may be preferably used. Examples of the diphenyl disulfide or the derivative thereof include diphenyl disulfide; mono-substituted diphenyl disulfide such as bis (4-chlorophenyl) disulfide, bis (3-chlorophenyl) disulfide, bis (4-bromophenyl) disulfide, bis (3-bromophenyl) disulfide, bis (4-fluorophenyl) disulfide, bis (4-iodophenyl) disulfide and bis (4-cyanophenyl) disulfide; di-substituted diphenyl disulfide such as bis (2,5-dichlorophenyl) disulfide, bis (3,5-dichlorophenyl) disulfide, bis (2,6-dichlorophenyl) disulfide, bis (2,5-dibromophenyl) disulfide, bis (3,5-dibromophenyl) disulfide, bis (2-chloro-5-bromophenyl) disulfide, and bis (2-cyano-5-bromophenyl) disulfide; tri-substituted diphenyl disulfide such as bis (2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) disulfide, and bis (2-cyano-4-chloro-6-bromophenyl) disulfide; tetra-substituted diphenyl disulfide such as bis (2,3,5,6-tetra chlorophenyl) disulfide; penta-substituted diphenyl disulfide such as bis (2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorophenyl) disulfide and bis (2,3,4,5,6-pentabromophenyl) disulfide. These diphenyl disulfides or the derivative thereof can enhance resilience by having some influence on the state of vulcanization of vulcanized rubber. Among them, diphenyl disulfide or bis (pentabromophenyl) disulfide is preferably used since the golf ball having particularly high resilience can be obtained. The amount of the diphenyl disulfide or the derivative thereof to be blended is preferably 0.1 part by mass or more, more preferably 0.3 part by mass or more, and is preferably 5.0 parts by mass or less, more preferably 3.0 parts by mass or less relative to 100 parts by mass of the base rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The amount of the antioxidant to be blended is preferably 0.1 part or more and is preferably 1 part or less based on 100 parts of the base rubber by mass. Further, the amount of the peptizing agent is preferably 0.1 part or more and is preferably 5 parts or less based on 100 parts of the base rubber by mass.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The center can be obtained by mixing, kneading the above mentioned rubber composition and molding the rubber composition in the mold. The conditions for press-molding the center rubber composition should be determined depending on the rubber composition. Specifically, the press-molding is preferably carried out for 10 to 60 minutes at the temperature of 130Â° C. to 200Â° C. under the pressure from 2.9 MPa to 11.8 MPa. Alternatively, the press-molding is preferably carried out in a two-step heating, for example, for 20 to 40 minutes at the temperature of 130Â° C. to 150Â° C., and continuously for 5 to 15 minutes at the temperature of 160Â° C. to 180Â° C.</p>

If the diameter of the center is 34.8 mm or more, the intermediate layer or the cover layer does not become excessively thick, and hence the resilience of the golf ball becomes good. On the other hand, if the diameter of the center is 41.2 mm or less, the intermediate layer or the cover does not become excessively thin, and hence the intermediate layer or the cover functions better.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">When the center has a diameter from 34.8 mm to 41.2 mm, a compression deformation amount (shrinking deformation amount of the center along the compression direction) of the center when applying a load from 98 N as an initial load to 1275 N as a final load is preferably 1.90 mm or more, more preferably 2.00 mm or more, even more preferably 2.10 mm or more, and is preferably 4.00 mm or less, more preferably 3.90 mm or less, even more preferably 3.80 mm or less. If the compression deformation amount is 1.90 mm or more, the shot feeling becomes good, while if the compression deformation amount is 4.00 mm or less, the resilience becomes better.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The surface hardness of the center is preferably 45 or larger, more preferably 50 or larger, and even more preferably 55 or larger, and is preferably 65 or smaller, more preferably 62 or smaller, and even more preferably 60 or smaller in shore D hardness. If the surface hardness is 45 or more in Shore D hardness, the center does not become excessively soft and the resilience becomes good. If the surface hardness of the center is 65 or less in Shore D hardness, the center does not become so hard and the shot feeling becomes good.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In one preferable embodiment, the intermediate layer is, for example, formed by covering the center with the golf ball resin composition (hereinafter, sometimes merely referred to as âintermediate layer compositionâ). An embodiment for molding the intermediate layer is not particularly limited, and includes an embodiment which comprises injection molding the intermediate layer composition directly onto the center, or an embodiment which comprises molding the intermediate layer composition into a half hollow-shell, covering the center with the two half hollow-shells, and subjecting the center with the two half hollow-shells to the compression-molding at the temperature of 130Â° C. to 170Â° C. for 1 min to 5 mins.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the case of directly injection molding the intermediate layer composition onto the center, it is preferred to use upper and lower molds for forming the intermediate layer having a spherical cavity and pimples, wherein a part of the pimple also serves as a retractable hold pin. When forming the intermediate layer by injection molding, the hold pin is protruded to hold the center, and the intermediate layer composition which has been heated and melted is charged and then cooled to obtain the intermediate layer. For example, the intermediate layer composition heated and melted at the temperature of 150Â° C. to 230Â° C. is charged into a mold held under the pressure of 980 KPa to 1,500 KPa for 0.1 to 1 second. After cooling for 15 to 60 seconds, the mold is opened.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">When molding the intermediate layer in a compression molding method, molding of the half shell can be performed by either compression molding method or injection molding method, and the compression molding method is preferred. The compression-molding of the intermediate layer composition into half shell can be carried out, for example, under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less at a temperature of â20Â° C. or more and 70Â° C. or less relative to the flow beginning temperature of the intermediate layer composition. By performing the molding under the above conditions, a half shell having a uniform thickness can be formed. Examples of a method for molding the intermediate layer using half shells include compression molding by covering the center with two half shells. The compression molding of half shells into the intermediate layer can be carried out, for example, under a pressure of 0.5 MPa or more and 25 MPa or less at a temperature of â20Â° C. or more and 70Â° C. or less relative to the flow beginning temperature of the intermediate layer composition. By performing the molding under the above conditions, the intermediate layer having a uniform thickness can be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The molding temperature means the highest temperature where the temperature at the surface of the concave portion of the lower mold reaches from closing through opening the molds. Further, the flow beginning temperature of the golf ball forming resin composition can be measured in a pellet form under the following conditions by using a flow characteristics evaluation apparatus (Flow Tester CFT-500, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation).</p>

In the case of using the relatively soft material for the cover covering the core (for example, the cover composition has a slab hardness of less than 50 in Shore D hardness), the high launch angle and low spin rate on the driver shot or the like are achieved by increasing the hardness of the intermediate layer.

      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0074">When molding the cover in a compression molding method, molding of the half shell can be performed by either compression molding method or injection molding method, and the compression molding method is preferred. The compression-molding of the cover composition into half shell can be carried out, for example, under a pressure of 1 MPa or more and 20 MPa or less at a temperature of â20Â° C. or more and 70Â° C. or less relative to the flow beginning temperature of the cover composition. By performing the molding under the above conditions, a half shell having a uniform thickness can be formed. Examples of a method for molding the cover using half shells include compression molding by covering the core with two half shells. The compression molding of half shells into the cover can be carried out, for example, under a pressure of 0.5 MPa or more and 25 MPa or less at a temperature of â20Â° C. or more and 70Â° C. or less relative to the flow beginning temperature of the cover composition.

When forming the cover by injection molding, the hold pin is protruded to hold the core, and the cover composition which has been heated and melted is charged and then cooled to obtain a cover. For example, the cover composition heated and melted at the temperature of 200Â° C. to 250Â° C. is charged into a mold held under the pressure of 9 MPa to 15 MPa for 0.5 to 5 second. After cooling for 10 to 60 seconds, the mold is opened and the golf ball with the cover molded is taken out from the mold.</p>

The total number of the dimples is preferably 200 or more and 500 or less. If the total number is less than 200, the dimple effect is hardly obtained. On the other hand, if the total number exceeds 500, the dimple effect is hardly obtained because the size of the respective dimples is small. The shape (shape in a plan view) of dimples includes, for example, without limitation, a circle, polygonal shapes such as roughly triangular shape, roughly quadrangular shape, roughly pentagonal shape, and roughly hexagonal shape, another irregular shape. The shape of the dimples is employed solely or in combination at least two of them.</p>

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0078">After the cover is molded, the mold is opened and the golf ball body is taken out from the mold, and as necessary, the golf ball body is preferably subjected to surface treatments such as deburring, cleaning, and sandblast. If desired, a paint film or a mark may be formed. The paint film preferably has a thickness of, but not limited to, 5 Î¼m or larger, and more preferably 7 Î¼m or larger, and preferably has a thickness of 25 Î¼m or smaller, and more preferably 18 Î¼m or smaller. If the thickness is smaller than 5 Î¼m, the paint film is easy to wear off due to continued use of the golf ball, and if the thickness is larger than 25 Î¼m, the effect of the dimples is reduced, resulting in deteriorating flying performance of the golf ball.</p>

If the compression deformation amount is 2.0 mm or more, the golf ball does not become excessively hard, and thus exhibits the good shot feeling. If the compression deformation amount is 4.0 mm or less, the resilience is enhanced.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0093">The intermediate layer compositions obtained above were injection-molded onto the spherical centers to form the intermediate layers covering the centers and prepare spherical cores. Subsequently, golf balls were produced by injection-molding the cover composition onto the spherical cores to form the cover. Upper and lower molds for the intermediate layer and the cover have a spherical cavity with pimples, a part of which serves as a hold pin which is extendable and retractable.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0094">When molding the intermediate layer, the hold pins were protruded to hold the center after the center was put in, the intermediate layer composition heated to 260Â° C. was charged into the mold under a pressure of 80 tons within 0.3 seconds, and cooled for 30 seconds. Then, the mold was opened, and the cores were taken out from the mold.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0095">When molding the cover, the hold pins were protruded to hold the core after the core was put in, the cover composition heated to 210Â° C. was charged into the mold under a pressure of 80 tons within 0.3 seconds, and cooled for 30 seconds. Then, the mold was opened, and the golf ball bodies were taken out from the mold. The surface of the obtained golf ball bodies were treated with sandblast, marked, and painted with a clear paint. The paint was dried in an oven at 40Â° C. to form a paint film, and golf balls having a diameter of 42.8 mm and a mass of 45.4 g were obtained. The results of evaluations with respect to the compression deformation amount and resilience of the golf balls were also shown in tables 3 to 7.</p>
