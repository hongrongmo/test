      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate with an excellent hue, a method for producing the same, poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) with an excellent hue using the same, and a dispersant and synthetic starch for clothing finishing using the poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate).</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Further, the present invention relates to sodium p-styrenesulfonate also with excellent fluidity and solubility, and a method for producing the same. That is to say, the present invention relates to sodium p-styrene-sulfonate with excellent fluidity and solubility, which is sodium p-styrenesulfonate with an appropriate particle size and a low water content, and a method for producing the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A p-styrenesulfonic acid (salt) represented by sodium p-styrenesulfonate is a functional monomer having a radical polymerizable vinyl group, a hydrophobic benzene ring having Ï electrons, and a sulfonic acid (salt) group that is a strong electrolyte, and has been valued in various industrial fields. For example, it has been used as a reactive emulsifier in order to improve stability of an emulsion and water resistance or cationic dye dyeability of a (emulsion) polymer. Further, a polymer or a copolymer of sodium p-styrenesulfonate has been used as a dispersant for producing various aqueous dispersions of pigments, antioxidants, various polymers (tackifier resins, chloroprene rubber, polyacrylic acid esters, polyesters, styrene-butadiene copolymers, polyvinyl chloride, poly-acrylonitrile, polysilicones, conductive polymers and the like), nanocarbon materials, silica particles for hot forging release agents or abrasives, battery electrode materials (carbon, lithium iron phosphate, lithium manganese phosphate and the like), photographic silver halides and the like. Furthermore, the polymer of sodium p-styrenesulfonate has been utilized as synthetic starch for clothing finishing such as an ironing agent, a hair care product, an antistatic agent, a resist acid generator, a water treatment agent, an allergen scavenger, an ion-exchange resin, a plating solution additive, a detergent for production of semiconductors and hard disks, an additive to fluids for shale oil drilling and a flame retardant for resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the above-mentioned application fields, various improvements have been required for sodium p-styrenesulfonate and the (co)polymer thereof. Among these, an improvement need common to many uses is hue. The hue of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and the (co)polymer thereof is an important factor directly exerting an effect on the commercial value, particularly in uses of an adhesive, a polymer emulsion for pigments, synthetic starch for clothing finishing such as an ironing agent, an antistatic agent, a frame retardant for transparent resins, a photographic silver halide emulsion and the like. That is to say, conventional sodium p-styrenesulfonate industrially available and the (co)polymer thereof exhibit a pale yellow to pale yellowish brown color, and it has been strongly desired to make them light-colored or colorless.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">About the hue of sodium p-styrenesulfonate, an influence of impurities is suggested (for example, Patent Document 1). However, about the most important impurities, metal halides are only mentioned, and no other specific hue is mentioned in any way. Further, about the hue of the (co)polymer of sodium p-styrenesulfonate, an influence of a polymerization initiator is suggested (for example, Patent Document 2). However, iron and other impurities contained in sodium p-styrenesulfonate as a raw material and an influence thereof on the hue are not mentioned in any way.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Further, chloroprene rubber-based adhesives have long been used as all-purpose adhesives. Methods for producing chloroprene rubber are publicly known. For example, chloroprene or chloroprene and a radical polymerizable monomer copolymerizable therewith are emulsified in water using an alkali metal salt of disproportionated rosin acid (acting as an emulsifier) and an alkali metal salt of a naphthalenesulfonic acid formalin condensate (acting as a dispersant), and a radical polymerization initiator is added thereto to perform emulsion polymerization. The unreacted monomer(s) in a chloroprene rubber emulsion obtained is removed by a steam distillation process. Finally, chloroprene rubber is taken out of the emulsion by a process such as freezing coagulation, and washed with water and dried, thereby being able to produce solid chloroprene rubber (for example, Non-Patent Document 1). The chloroprene rubber-based adhesive is produced by dissolving the above-mentioned chloroprene rubber and compounding agents such as a tackifier resin, a metal oxide and a crosslinking agent in an organic solvent such as toluene, methylcyclohexane, n-hexane, methyl ethyl ketone or an acetate ester. When the chloroprene rubber-based adhesives are used for production of footwear or sporting goods, an excellent hue (to be as close to colorless as possible) is required.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, as a method for improving the hue of the adhesives, there has been proposed a method using as a dispersant an alkali metal salt of a styrenesulfonic acid (co)polymer that is hardly discolored, instead of the above-mentioned alkali metal salt of the naphthalenesulfonic acid formalin condensate (for example, Patent Document 3). Surely, the hue is improved. However, it is not necessarily satisfactory, and a further improvement has been required. Further, the hue of the poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (co)polymer used is not mentioned in any way.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Furthermore, as synthetic starch used for a clothing finishing agent such as an ironing agent, there has been known poly (Sodium p-styrenesulfonate) (Patent Document 4). The hue is extremely important in this use, and it has been required to make the synthetic starch more colorless. However, the hue of poly(sodium p-styrenesulfonate) is not mentioned in any way.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">On the other hand, it has previously been known that sodium p-styrenesulfonate can be produced by the reaction of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide (see Patent Documents 5 and 6).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Patent Document 5 describes a method for producing a hemihydrate of sodium p-styrenesulfonate by charging a reactor with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution containing a slight amount of sodium nitrite as a polymerization inhibitor under a nitrogen atmosphere, performing the reaction at 90Â° C. while adding dropwise p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid thereto to obtain crystals of sodium p-styrenesulfonate, and thereafter performing cooling, centrifugal filtration and forced fluidization. It is only described that the particle size of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is usually from several micrometers to several millimeters, and no observed value is described. It is assumed to have a particle size equivalent to that of one on the market at present, that is to say, a median diameter of about 20 Î¼m. Further, the relationship among the particle size, water content, solubility and fluidity is not mentioned in any way.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Patent Document 6 describes a method for producing a hemihydrate of sodium p-styrenesulfonate by performing the reaction at 90Â° C. while concurrently feeding an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution containing a small amount of sodium nitrite as a polymerization inhibitor and p-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid to a reactor, continuously taking out a sodium p-styrenesulfonate crystal slurry formed, and performing centrifugal filtration and forced fluidization. It is described that the shape of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is scale-like and that the observed value of particle size is from 160 Î¼m to 760 Î¼m. Further, similarly to Patent Document 5, the relationship among the particle size, water content, solubility and fluidity is not mentioned in any way.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">However, conventional sodium p-styrenesulfonate having a median diameter of less than 25 Î¼m has had a problem with handling properties, such as the occurrence of clogging in a charging hopper at the time when used in large amounts in a plant. That is to say, it has been lacking in fluidity as a powder. On the other hand, when the median diameter of sodium p-styrenesulfonate exceeds 150 Î¼m, the rate of dissolution in water has decreased at the time when used in a plant to cause a problem such as clogging of a strainer, although satisfactory in fluidity. That is to say, sodium p-styrenesulfonate improved in fluidity without impairing the solubility of sodium p-styrenesulfonate has been required.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Further, in the above-mentioned detergents for production of semiconductors and hard disks, antistatic agents of films for electronic materials, dispersants for conductive polymers, photographic silver halide emulsifiers and the like, particularly in electronic material uses, it has recently been required to decrease impurities such as sodium bromide contained in p-styrene-sulfonic acid (salts) and p-styrenesulfonic acid (salt) polymers, nuclear bromides of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid and p-styrenesulfonic acid, and excess metals and bromine components. It has been known that the impurities such as sodium bromide can be decreased by washing or recrystallization with an aqueous solvent (for example, Patent Document 7). Although the purity is described in Patent Document 7, the contents of alkali metal halides are not clear, and there is no description for the other impurities at all. Further, an effect of the particle size of sodium p-styrenesulfonate before purification on the purification efficiency, namely the purity after purification, is not mentioned in any way.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and an object thereof is to provide high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate and a sodium styrenesulfonate (co)polymer (hereinafter also referred to as âsodium PSSâ or âPoly(Sodium p-Styrenesulfonate)â) with an excellent hue, which are useful for producing a polymer emulsion such as chloroprene rubber or synthetic starch for clothing finishing with an excellent hue.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0046">The present invention relates to high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate with an excellent hue in which the iron content in sodium p-styrenesulfonate is less than 3.00 Î¼g/g, the sodium bromide content is less than 2.50 wt %, and the peak area ratios of (a) sodium o-styrenesulfonate, (b) sodium p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonate, (c) sodium m-styrenesulfonate, (d) sodium bromostyrenesulfonate and (e) sodium p-Î²-hydroxyethylbenzenesulfonate, which are determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are (a) â¦0.40%, (b) â¦4.00%, (c) â¦8.00%, (d) â¦0.10% and (e) â¦0.80%, respectively (provided that the sum of peak areas of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and (a) to (e) is 100), and sodium PSS with an excellent hue having the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A or the above-mentioned repeating structural units A and B, which is produced using the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">The term âwith an excellent hueâ used herein means not colored and nearly white or colorless and transparent. However, in the present invention, it particularly means low in yellowness. Specifically, in the case of high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate, it means that the yellowness (YI value) of a crystal powder determined with a color-difference meter is small, that the whiteness (WI value) is high, and that the APHA value of an aqueous solution is small. Further, in the case of sodium PSS, it means that the APHA value, the yellowness (YI value) and the b value of an aqueous solution of sodium PSS, which are determined with a color-difference meter, are small.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0048">In the present invention, preferred are high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate in which the iron content in sodium p-styrenesulfonate is less than 3.00 Î¼g/g, the sodium bromide content is less than 2.50 wt %, and the peak area ratios of (a) sodium o-styrenesulfonate, (b) sodium p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonate, (c) sodium m-styrene-sulfonate, (d) sodium bromostyrenesulfonate and (e) sodium p-Î²-hydroxyethylbenzenesulfonate, which are determined by HPLC, are (a) â¦0.20%, (b) â¦0.50%, (c) â¦3.00%, (d) â¦0.10% and (e) â¦0.20%, respectively (provided that the sum of peak areas of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and (a) to (e) is 100), and sodium PSS having the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A or the above-mentioned repeating structural units A and B, which is produced using the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0049">Sodium PSS of the present invention is not limited to a homopolymer of sodium p-styrenesulfonate. That is to say, it is not particularly limited as long as it has the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A or the above-mentioned repeating structural units A and B, and may be a random copolymer, a block copolymer or a graft copolymer. The block copolymer as said herein is one in which a sodium PSS chain (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A) and a polymer chain (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit B) different from sodium PSS are linked with each other in block form by a covalent bond, and includes a type such as a di-block, tri-block or multi-block type. Further, the graft copolymer is one in which branches of polymer chains (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit B) different from sodium PSS are bonded to a stem of sodium PSS (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A), or branches of sodium PSS (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit A) are bonded to a stem of a polymer chain (the above-mentioned repeating structural unit B) different from sodium PSS, by covalent bonds in branch (graft) form.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0050">The present invention is characterized in that the monomer (sodium p-styrenesulfonate) used for the production of sodium PPS is highly purified, and will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0051">Commercially available sodium p-styrenesulfonate usually contains 5.0 to 10.0 wt % of water (crystallization water and adhesive water). This water is the greatest impurity contained in sodium p-styrenesulfonate. The points of the present invention are that in addition to sodium bromide (the case of M=sodium in the following formula) as a main impurity next to water, unreacted brominated intermediates, organic isomers and iron have been found to be contained as impurities, as can be seen from the following general production process of a p-styrenesulfonic acid salt, and that the hue of sodium p-styrenesulfonate has been found to be significantly improved by reducing these impurities.</p>

        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0052">As a result of detailed analysis of the impurities other than water, which are contained in sodium p-styrenesulfonate, it has become clear that small amounts of iron, (a) sodium o-styrenesulfonate, (b) sodium p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonate, (c) sodium m-styrene-sulfonate, (d) sodium bromostyrenesulfonate and (e) sodium p-Î²-hydroxyethylbenzenesulfonate are contained, in addition to sodium bromide as the main impurity.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0053">The present inventors have produced high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate in which the iron content is less than 3.00 Î¼g/g, the sodium bromide content is less than 2.50 wt %, and the peak area ratios of (a) sodium o-styrenesulfonate, (b) sodium p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonate, (c) sodium m-styrene-sulfonate, (d) sodium bromostyrenesulfonate and (e) sodium p-Î²-hydroxyethylbenzenesulfonate, which are determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), are (a) â¦0.40%, (b) â¦4.00%, (c) â¦8.00%, (d) â¦0.10% and (e) â¦0.80%, respectively (provided that the sum of peak areas of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and (a) to (e) is 100), by a method of partially dissolving sodium p-styrenesulfonate containing the above-mentioned impurities in an aqueous solvent, followed by recrystallization, a method of washing with pure water, or controlling production conditions such as the reaction temperature. As a result, it has been found that the hue of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is significantly improved. Further, the above-mentioned impurities have been reduced to (a) â¦0.20%, (b) â¦0.50%, (c) â¦3.00%, (d) â¦0.10% and (e) â¦0.20%, respectively (provided that the sum of peak areas of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and (a) to (e) is 100). As a result, it has been found that the hue of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is further improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0054">Furthermore, high-purity sodium PSS has been produced using the same by a conventional radical polymerization process. As a result, it has been found that the hue of sodium PSS is significantly improved. The high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate and sodium PSS have extremely excellent hues, so that the availability thereof in the above-mentioned industrial fields is extremely high. For example, (chloroprene rubber emulsion and) chloroprene rubber has been produced using the sodium PSS as a dispersant. As a result, it has been found that the hue of the chloroprene rubber is further improved, as compared to the case where conventional sodium PSS is used. Further, the sodium PSS has been used as synthetic starch for a clothing ironing agent. As a result, it has been found that the hue of cloth treated with the sodium p-styrenesulfonate is further improved, as compared to the case of cloth treated with conventional sodium PSS.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0055">Although the reason why the hue of sodium p-styrene-sulfonate has been improved is not necessarily clear, it is considered to be a synergistic effect due to reduction of iron and other impurities. The reason why the hue of sodium PSS has been improved is considered to be that the chemical stability of sodium PSS has been improved by reduction of isomers such as the meta form and the nuclear brominated form, and sodium p-Î²-haloethylbenzenesulfonate, in addition to these.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0056">Although there is no limitation on the weight average molecular weight of sodium PSS of the present invention, which is determined by GPC, it is preferably from 2,000 to 1,000,000. In the case where used as a dispersant in emulsion polymerization, a relatively low molecular weight is preferred, in view of emulsion viscosity, stability and the like. For example, it is preferably from 2,000 to 50,000. On the other hand, in the case where used for purposes other than emulsion polymerization, for example, as synthetic starch for clothing finishing, a high molecular weight body is better in terms of viscosity and water resistance after drying, and it is preferably from 50,000 to 600,000 in view of handling properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0057">This weight average molecular weight can be easily adjusted by the amount of a polymerization initiator or a chain transfer agent added to a monomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0058">There is no particular limitation on another monomer other than sodium p-styrenesulfonate, which is used in sodium PSS of the present invention, as long as radical polymerization thereof proceeds through sodium PSS radicals, or as long as it produces radicals that can act as a radical polymerization initiator to sodium p-styrenesulfonate (in other words, it is radically polymerizable with sodium p-styrenesulfonate).

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0063">(ii) a method of filtering off water-soluble ferrous hydroxide from sodium p-styrenesulfonate obtained by a reaction of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid with sodium hydroxide and crystallization,</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0064">(iii) a method of precipitating water-insoluble ferric hydroxide by blowing air into an aqueous alkali solution of sodium p-styrenesulfonate or adding a oxidizing agent thereto, and filtering off it, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0065">In the case of the purification method of (i), more specifically showing the method for removing iron, for example, a sulfonic acid type cation exchange resin regenerated with hydrochloric acid is placed in an aqueous p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid solution (70 to 80% of ion exchange capacity of the cation exchange resin), and slowly stirred at room temperature for 3 to 6 hours, followed by filtering off of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid, thereby being able to remove the iron ions.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0066">Incidentally, using high-purity p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid obtained, and then, according to the above-mentioned chemical reaction formula, vinylation may be performed by an ordinary method to obtain sodium p-styrenesulfonate. That is to say, as conditions of vinylation in this case, for example, there is a method of performing vinylation at 60 to 110Â° C. while concurrently feeding p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide in an amount of 2.0- to 3.0-fold moles, for example, 2-fold moles, based on that of p-Î²-bromoethyl-benzenesulfonic acid, to a stainless steel reaction tank provided with a jacket and equipped with a stirrer, over 2 to 5 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0067">Further, showing a specific example of the purification method of (ii), there is a method of removing impurities such as iron and sodium bromide from sodium p-styrenesulfonate crystals by subjecting a slurry containing crystals of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and water-soluble impurities such as ferrous hydroxide and sodium bromide to solid-liquid separation by centrifugal filtration.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0068">Furthermore, showing a specific example of the purification method of (iii), water-soluble ferrous hydroxide is precipitated as water-insoluble ferric hydroxide by blowing air into an aqueous alkali solution of sodium p-styrenesulfonate, and thereafter, sodium p-styrenesulfonate crystals having a high specific gravity are sedimented and colloidal ferric hydroxide is suspended, by centrifugation. Suspended ferric hydroxide and impurities such as sodium bromide dissolved in water can be removed by decantation.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0069">(2) Although a method for removing impurities other than iron is not particularly limited, the main impurities such as sodium bromide, the isomers and sodium p-Î²-haloethylbenzenesulfonate can be reduced, for example, by putting commercially available sodium p-styrene-sulfonate into pure water or a mixed solvent of a water-soluble solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile and water, followed by heating, stirring and partial dissolution at 40 to 70Â° C. for 30 minutes to 1 hour, thereafter, performing cooling to 30Â° C. or less over 30 minutes to 2 hours, and washing or recrystallizing sodium p-styrenesulfonate. The impurities other than iron can be reduced by repeating this operation. This recrystallization operation is performed at least once, and preferably 1 to 3 times in view of productivity and cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0070">More specifically showing the above-mentioned purification method of (2), high-purity sodium. p-styrene-sulfonate can be obtained, for example, by dissolving sodium p-styrenesulfonate in methanol by heating at a concentration of 5 to 6 wt % (usually, at 40 to 50Â° C. for about to 60 minutes), precipitating crystals of sodium p-styrenesulfonate by slow cooling to ordinary temperature to near 10Â° C., and performing drying and filtration.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0071">High-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate obtained by treatment according to the above purification method (1) may be further subjected to purification treatment according to the above-mentioned purification method (2). By this treatment, the amounts of the impurities such as iron and sodium bromide, particularly the amounts of (a) sodium o-styrenesulfonate, (b) sodium p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonate, (c) sodium m-styrene-sulfonate, (d) sodium bromostyrenesulfonate and (e) sodium p-Î²-hydroxyethylbenzenesulfonate, can be further reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0072">Another characteristic of the present invention is that the particle size, the water content and the like of sodium p-styrenesulfonate are specified within the specific ranges, and will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0073">That is to say, sodium p-styrenesulfonate (the case where M in [Chemical Formula 2] described above is sodium) is generally produced by the process of [Chemical Formula 2] described above, and the shape and grain size thereof are considered to be mainly influenced by conditions of the vinylation process (reaction crystallization).</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0074">It has been found that in the case where sodium p-styrenesulfonate is used in large amounts as a chemical raw material, when the median diameter is as small as less than 25.00 Î¼m, fluidity thereof is insufficient, although solubility in water is good, resulting in easy occurrence of clogging in a raw material charging hopper, whereas when the median diameter exceeds 150.00 Î¼m, the rate of dissolution thereof is significantly decreased, although fluidity is improved, resulting in easy occurrence of clogging of a strainer.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0075">Further, the present inventors have found that when the median diameter of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is less than 25.00 Î¼m, or when small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m exceeds 10.00%, filterability (liquid drainability) is deteriorated to fail to efficiently perform purification, in the case where the sodium p-styrenesulfonate is washed or purified by recrystallization using an aqueous solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0076">Thus, the present invention is sodium p-styrenesulfonate characterized in that it is composed of particles having a median diameter measured with a laser diffraction/scattering particle size analyzer of 25.00 to 150.00 Î¼m and a content of small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m of 10.00% or less, and has a water content of 10.00 wt % or less and a repose angle of 55 degrees or less. In terms of a balance between fluidity and solubility, more preferably, it is composed of particles having a median diameter of 40.00 to 90.00 Î¼m and a content of small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m of 3.00% or less, and has a water content of 8.00 wt % or less and a repose angle of 50 degrees or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0077">As described above, when the median diameter of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is less than 25.00 Î¼m, or when small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m exceeds 10.00%, filterability (liquid drainability) is deteriorated to fail to efficiently perform purification, in the case where the sodium p-styrenesulfonate is washed or purified by recrystallization using an aqueous solvent. On the other hand, when it exceeds 150.0 Î¼m (as a result of decreased water content), fluidity is good, and filterability in the case where washed or purified by recrystallization is also good. However, solubility is deteriorated.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0078">Here, in order to adjust the above-mentioned median diameter to the range of 25.00 to 150.00 Î¼m, preferably to the range of 40.00 to 90.00 Î¼m, the rate of crystallization may be controlled by adjusting the above-mentioned reaction crystallization conditions, that is to say, the feed conditions of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide as raw materials and the reaction temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0079">Further, in order to adjust the small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m to 10.00% or less, preferably to 3.00% or less, the median diameter may be adjusted so as to become 25.00 Î¼m or more by the above-mentioned method, whereby the small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m are necessarily decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0080">Sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention is composed of the particles having a median diameter within the above-mentioned specific range, which are preferably âelliptic disk-shaped secondary particles.â The âelliptic disk-shaped secondary particlesâ as used herein are elliptic disk-shaped particles as shown in an electron micrograph of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, and are aggregates of many crystals (primary particles) of sodium p-styrenesulfonate hemihydrate formed by physical force. In sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention, the reason why the particles obtained become the âelliptic disk-shaped secondary particlesâ is not clear. However, the reason for this is considered to be that aggregation occurs by the action of physical force such as the rate of crystallization during reaction crystallization, stirring conditions and forced fluidization described later.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0081">Sodium p-styrenesulfonate is preferably a hemihydrate because of its excellent storage stability, and water (crystallization water) in sodium p-styrenesulfonate hemihydrate is theoretically 4.18 wt %. Accordingly, water exceeding 4.18 wt % is adhesive water. The smaller the median diameter of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is, the more the adhesive water increases by an increase in the total surface area. As a result, fluidity is reduced. On the other hand, the larger the median diameter is, the more the adhesive water decreases by a decrease in the total surface area. As a result, fluidity is considered to have been improved. An increase in the adhesive water means not only a reduction in fluidity but also a decrease in purity (the sodium p-styrenesulfonate content per product wet weight) of sodium p-styrenesulfonate. This is therefore practically unfavorable.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0082">From this point, sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention is a hemihydrate having a water content of 10.00% by weight or less, preferably 8.0% by weight or less, and more preferably 4.5 to 7.0% by weight. When the water content exceeds 10% by weight, fluidity is reduced, regardless of the particle size of sodium p-styrenesulfonate. Further, it means a decrease in purity of wet products. This is therefore unfavorable. In order to obtain sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention as the hemihydrate having a water content of 10% or less, as described above, the median diameter may be adjusted to 25.00 Î¼m or more by adjusting the above-mentioned reaction crystallization conditions, that is to say, the feed conditions of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide as the raw materials and the reaction temperature, thereby controlling the rate of crystallization.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">Further, in sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention, the repose angle defined later is 55 degrees or less, and preferably 50 degrees or less. When it exceeds 55 degrees, fluidity is deteriorated. When the repose angle is 55 degrees or less, fluidity is excellent, and a trouble such as clogging in a hopper at the time when used in large amounts in a factory is solved. This is therefore preferred. In order to decrease the repose angle, fluidity of a powder may be increased. The relationship between the fluidity and the structure and composition of the sodium p-styrenesulfonate powder is not necessarily clear. However, the influence of water in the powder is considered to be significant. That is to say, the smaller the particle size of the powder is, the more the water content is increased by an increase in the total surface area. As a result, fluidity is considered to be reduced, and the water content can be adjusted by the above-mentioned particle size control.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">Incidentally, solubility of sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention in water (see âmeasurement of the rate of dissolutionâ described later) is preferably 200 seconds or less, and more preferably 160 seconds or less. There is no adverse effect due to excessively high solubility. However, when it exceeds 200 seconds, troubles such as a decrease in productivity and clogging of a strainer are liable to occur at the time when used in large amounts in a factory. This is therefore unfavorable. This solubility can be adjusted by the above-mentioned particle size control.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">The production method of sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention will be described below. Although the production method of sodium p-styrenesulfonate is not particularly limited, it is important to perform reaction crystallization at 60 to 110Â° C. for 1 to 7 hours, for example, while feeding so as to keep the concentration of sodium hydroxide in a reaction tank [(the weight of total sodium hydroxide fed/the weight of the total reaction solution in the reaction tank)Ã100] at 10.00 to 20.00 wt % and so as to increase the p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid concentration [(the weight of total p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid fed/the weight of the total reaction solution in the reaction tank)Ã100] from 0.00 wt % to 30.00 to 50.00 wt % over 1 to 7 hours. A slurry of sodium p-styrenesulfonate produced is preferably cooled to 10 to 40Â° C., and thereafter, subjected to solid-liquid separation, for example, using a centrifugal filter to obtain a wet cake of sodium p-styrenesulfonate. Then, the wet cake is forcedly fluidized using a single-screw type blender, for example, at 20 to 40Â° C. for 5 to 30 minutes, thereby being able to produce a hemihydrate of sodium p-styrenesulfonate of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">For example, when p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid is fed so as to have a concentration of 70 wt % to an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration exceeding 20 wt % in the whole reaction solution (for example, Japanese Patent No. 3601222), sodium p-styrenesulfonate crystals obtained become too small, so that sodium p-styrenesulfonate hemihydrate having a high water content and inferior in fluidity is obtained. Further, when washing or recrystallization purification is performed using an aqueous solvent, solid-liquid separability is deteriorated to degrade the purification efficiency. On the other hand, even when the concentration of sodium hydroxide in the whole reaction solution is 20 wt % or less, in the case where the feed rate of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid is too high (Japanese Patent No. 3890642), for example, in the case where the concentration of p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid in the whole reaction solution exceeds 40 wt % within one hour after the start of feed, the sodium p-styrenesulfonate crystals obtained become too large. Accordingly, sodium p-styrene-sulfonate hemihydrate that is good in fluidity but inferior in solubility is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">Sodium p-styrenesulfonate produced in the present invention is controlled in particle size by improvement of the reaction crystallization conditions, and improved in fluidity while keeping excellent solubility, so that handling properties thereof is good. Further, high-purity sodium p-styrenesulfonate can be efficiently produced. It is therefore useful in the above-mentioned industrial fields.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">The production method of sodium PSS of the present invention will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0089">Although the production method of sodium PSS is not particularly limited, a method according to ordinary radical polymerization is exemplified as a first example. For example, a reaction container is charged with a homogeneous solution of a mixture of water or an aqueous solvent, sodium p-styrenesulfonate and another monomer radically copolymerizable with sodium p-styrenesulfonate as needed, and a molecular weight regulator is added thereto as needed. The inside of the system is deoxidized, followed by heating to a specific temperature, and polymerization may be conducted while adding a radical polymerization initiator. In this case, in order to avoid rapid polymerization and in the case of considering molecular weight controllability in a low molecular weight region, it is preferred that the respective monomers are continuously added little by little to the reaction container, together with the polymerization initiator and molecular weight regulator, without charging the reaction container with the whole monomer mixture at first. Further, sodium PSS can also be produced by finely dispersing or emulsifying an aqueous solution of a water-soluble monomer such as sodium p-styrenesulfonate in oil, and thereafter performing polymerization while adding a radical polymerization initiator (so-called inverse emulsion polymerization).</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0090">The reaction solvent is not particularly limited. However, in view of solubility of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and the other copolymerizable monomer (comonomer), and use as the dispersant in emulsion polymerization and use as the synthetic starch in the clothing finishing agent, a mixture of water and an aqueous solvent is preferred. There is no limitation on the aqueous solvent as long as it dissolves a mixture of sodium p-styrenesulfonate and the comonomer. Examples thereof include acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, met hoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 2-butoxyethanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, propylene glycol-1-monomethylether-2-acetate, propylene glycol, glycerol, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and the like.

At that temperature, 2,000 kg of a 73 wt % aqueous p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid solution obtained in the same manner as in Example 1 and 950 kg of a 48 wt % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were separately introduced at a constant rate over 4 hours (the sodium hydroxide concentration in the reactor gradually increased from 11.66 wt % at the start of the reaction to 14.69 wt % after 4 hours from the start of the reaction (at the end of the reaction), and the p-Î²-bromoethylbenzenesulfonic acid concentration gradually increased from 0.00 wt % at the start of the reaction to 39.43 wt % after 4 hours from the start of the reaction (at the end of the reaction)), followed by reaction crystallization of sodium p-styrenesulfonate. A slurry thereof was cooled to 40Â° C. over 2 hours. Thereafter, solid-liquid separation was performed by centrifugation. Separation was extremely easy, and 940 kg of a high-purity wet cake having a sodium styrenesulfonate content of 88.5 wt % was obtained by shaking for 30 minutes. Using a uniaxial screw blender, this wet cake was forcedly fluidized at 40Â° C. and a rotational speed of 20 rpm for 60 minutes. Sodium p-styrenesulfonate obtained had a median diameter of 63.1 Î¼m, a content of small particles less than 10.00 Î¼m of 1.50%, a water content of 7.1 wt %, a repose angle of 47 degrees and a dissolution time in water of 160 seconds. This was slightly inferior in fluidity to Comparative Example 8, but far superior in solubility. It is therefore clear that this is excellent in the balance between fluidity and solubility.</p>
