      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">All publications herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. The following description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), collectively referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are relatively common inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which are chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorders. Histopathologically and anatomically, these two conditions are distinct, with CD characterized by transmural inflammation that can occur throughout the GI tract, and UC characterized by more superficial inflammation confined to the colon and rectum. Interestingly, both diseases are dependent upon factors present within the complex intestinal microbiota. Indeed, a unifying hypothesis has emerged that proposes that IBD results from a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the intestinal microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals (Strober W, Fuss I J, Blumberg R S. The immunology of mucosal models of inflammation. Annu Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20:495-549. Bouma G, Strober W. The immunological and genetic basis of inflammatory bowel disease. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3:521-533.).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">While the dependence of IBD on intestinal microbes is increasingly clear, the molecular mechanisms underlying this dependence are not. The intestinal mucosa is exposed to the largest concentration of foreign bacterial antigens of any tissue in the body, estimated to be up to 1012 organisms per gram of stool in the normal colon. An emerging concept is that there is an active âdialogueâ between the microbiota, intestinal epithelial cells, and mucosal immune cells, with each partner communicating with the others (McCracken V J, Lorenz R G. The gastrointestinal ecosystem: a precarious alliance among epithelium, immunity and microbiota. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3:1-11.). In this context, âinnateâ immune responses, which recognize conserved microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PG), are likely to be important in these microbial-host interactions and intestinal homeostasis. Critical to the host's âsensingâ of microbes are members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family that, alone or in combination, recognize a wide array of microbe-associated molecular patterns on either pathogens or commensals (Kopp E, Medzhitov R. Recognition of microbial infection by Toll-like receptors. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15:396-401. Akira S. Mammalian Toll-like receptors. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15:5-11. Sieling P A, Modlin R L. Toll-like receptors: mammalian âtaste receptorsâ for a smorgasbord of microbial invaders. Current Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5:70-75.). Various TLRs are expressed on intestinal epithelial cells (Cario E, Podolsky D K. Differential alteration in intestinal epithelial cell expression of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4 in inflammatory bowel disease. Infect. Immunol. 2000; 68:7010-7017. Gewirtz A T, Navas T A, Lyons S, Godowski P J, Madara J L. Cutting Edge: Bacterial flagellin activates basolaterally expressed TLR5 to induce epithelial proinflammatory gene expression. J. Immunol. 2001; 167:1882-1885. Abreu M T, et al. TLR4 and MD-2 expression is regulated by immune-mediated signals in human intestinal epithelial cells. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277:20431-20437. Hershberg R M. The epithelial cell cytoskeleton and intracellular trafficking V. Polarized compartmentalization of antigen processing and Toll-like receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2002; 283: G833-G839.) and more broadly on macrophages and dendritic cells in the lamina propria.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Given the involvement of innate immune mechanisms in the modulation of T cell responses, the bacterial dependence of IBD is likely to involve both bacterial products such as LPS, PG, and other TLR ligands, and specific bacterial antigens capable of stimulating CD4+ T cell responses. CD4+ T lymphocytes have been identified as the crucial effector cells in experimental models of IBD (Berg D J, et al. Enterocolitis and colon cancer in interleukin-10-deficient mice are associated with aberrant cytokine production and CD4+ TH1-like responses. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98:1010-1020. Powrie F, et al Inhibition of Th1 responses prevents inflammatory bowel disease in scid mice reconstituted with CD45RBhi CD4+ T cells. Immunity. 1994; 1:553-562. Cong Y, et al. CD4+ T cells reactive to enteric bacterial antigens in spontaneously colitic C3H/HeJBir mice: increased T helper cell Type 1 response and ability to transfer disease. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187:855-864.), and these pathogenic CD4+ T cell responses are directed against the enteric microbiota. Enteric bacterial antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells are able to induce colitis when adoptively transferred into immunodeficient recipients (Cong Y, et al. CD4+ T cells reactive to enteric bacterial antigens in spontaneously colitic C3H/HeJBir mice: increased T helper cell Type 1 response and ability to transfer disease. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187:855-864.). The in vitro data suggest that there is a relatively small number of immunodominant antigens that stimulate the pathogenic T cell responses (Brandwein S L, et al. Spontaneously colitic C3H/HeJBir mice demonstrate selective antibody reactivity to antigens of the enteric bacterial flora. J. Immunol. 1997; 159:44-52), but the complexity of the intestinal microflora has posed a significant challenge to their identification.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In humans, specific associations between particular bacterial species and the development of disease or its characteristics have not been established. Immune responses to commensal enteric organisms have been investigated in CD. It was been shown that CD patients have antibodies to specific bacterial antigens and that patients can be clustered into 4 groups depending on their antibody response patterns (Landers C J, Cohavy O, Misra R, Yang H, Lin Y C, Braun J, Targan S R. Selected loss of tolerance evidenced by Crohn's disease-associated immune responses to auto- and microbial antigens. Gastroenterology 2002; 123:689-99.). These clusters are (1) antibody responses against oligomannan (anti-<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>; ASCA), (2) antibody responses to both <i>Escherichia coli </i>outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC) and a CD-related protein from <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens </i>(anti-CD-related bacterial sequence {I2}), (3) antibody responses to nuclear antigens (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; pANCA), or (4) low or no serological response to any of the tested antigens. These distinct antibody response patterns may indicate unique pathophysiological mechanisms in the progression of this complicated disease. In addition, phenotypic associations with specific serological response patterns have been discovered (Landers C J, Cohavy O, Misra R, Yang H, Lin Y C, Braun J, Targan S R. Selected loss of tolerance evidenced by Crohn's disease-associated immune responses to auto- and microbial antigens. Gastroenterology 2002; 123:689-99. Vasiliauskas E A, Plevy S E, Landers C J, Binder S W, Ferguson D M, Yang H, Rotter J I, Vidrich A, Targan S R. Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease define a clinical subgroup. Gastroenterology 1996; 110:1810-9. Vasiliauskas E A, Kam L Y, Karp L C, Gaiennie J, Yang H, Targan S R. Marker antibody expression stratifies Crohn's disease into immunologically homogeneous subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Gut 2000; 47:487-96.

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Immunologic responses to bacterial products are key to the induction of inflammatory bowel disease in humans and in experimental models. The relationship of these immune responses to the underlying genetic and clinical phenotypes is just beginning to emerge. Thus, among patients with Crohn's disease, immune responses to different microbial antigens may be related to different pathophysiologic mechanisms, and may represent distinct genotypes and phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Thus, there is need in the art to associate clinical phenotypes of Crohn's disease with various antigens, as such determination can enable more appropriate treatments for the disease. Furthermore, there exists a need for the diagnosis and treatment of Crohn's disease and subtypes of Crohn's disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The two common forms of IBD, CD and UC, are chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Each has a peak age of onset in the second to fourth decades of life and prevalences in European ancestry populations that average approximately 100-150 per 100,000 (D. K. Podolsky, N Engl J Med 347, 417 (2002); E. V. Loftus, Jr., Gastroenterology 126, 1504 (2004)). Although the precise etiology of IBD remains to be elucidated, a widely accepted hypothesis is that ubiquitous, commensal intestinal bacteria trigger an inappropriate, overactive, and ongoing mucosal immune response that mediates intestinal tissue damage in genetically susceptible individuals (D. K. Podolsky, N Engl J Med 347, 417 (2002). Genetic factors play an important role in IBD pathogenesis, as evidenced by the increased rates of IBD in Ashkenazi Jews, familial aggregation of IBD, and increased concordance for IBD in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twin pairs (S. Vermeire, P. Rutgeerts, Genes Immun 6, 637 (2005)). Moreover, genetic analyses have linked IBD to specific genetic variants, especially CARD15 variants on chromosome 16q12 and the IBD5 haplotype (spanning the organic cation transporters, SLC22A4 and SLC22A5, and other genes) on chromosome 5q31 (S. Vermeire, P. Rutgeerts, Genes Immun 6, 637 (2005); J. P. Hugot et al., Nature 411, 599 (2001); Y. Ogura et al., Nature 411, 603 (2001); J. D. Rioux et al., Nat Genet 29, 223 (2001); V. D. Peltekova et al., Nat Genet 36, 471 (2004)). CD and UC are thought to be related disorders that share some genetic susceptibility loci but differ at others.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The replicated associations between CD and variants in CARD15 and the IBD5 haplotype do not fully explain the genetic risk for CD. Thus, there is need in the art to determine other markers, genes, allelic variants and/or haplotypes that may assist in explaining the genetic risk, predicting disease progression, diagnosing, and/or predicting susceptibility for or protection against inflammatory bowel disease including but not limited to CD and/or UC.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with compositions and methods which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Various embodiments of the present invention provide for methods for diagnosing Crohn's disease in a mammal. Additional embodiments provide for determining a subtype of Crohn's disease, such as a phenotypic feature associated with Crohn's disease. Further embodiments provide for treating Crohn's disease. In one embodiment, the mammal is a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In particular embodiments, diagnosing Crohn's disease may be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression, where the presence of anti-CBir1 expression indicates that the mammal has Crohn's disease. Determining a subtype of Crohn's disease, such as a phenotypic feature associated with Crohn's disease may also be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression, where the presence of anti-CBir1 indicates that the mammal has small bowel disease, internal penetrating/perforating disease or fibrostenosing disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may be accomplished by various techniques. For example, determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may be performed by determining the presence of an RNA sequence or a fragment of an RNA sequence that encodes an anti-CBir1 antibody; for example, using Northern blot analysis or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may also be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies; for example IgG anti-CBir1.

Lane, <i>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual </i>(Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor N.Y., 1988), provide one skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. Indeed, the present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described. For purposes of the present invention, the following terms are defined below.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">âFibrostenosisâ as used herein refers to a classification of Crohn's disease characterized by one or more accepted characteristics of fibrostenosing disease. Such characteristics of fibrostenosing disease include, for example, documented persistent intestinal obstruction or intestinal resection for an intestinal obstruction. The fibrostenosis can be accompanied by other symptoms such as perforations, abscesses or fistulae, and can be further characterized by persistent symptoms of intestinal blockage such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention and inability to eat solid food.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">âImmune complexâ and âcomplexâ as used herein refer to an aggregate of two or more molecules that result from specific binding between an antigen and an antibody.</p>

      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">Serological Factors</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Various embodiments of the present invention provide for methods for diagnosing Crohn's disease in a mammal. Additional embodiments provide for determining a subtype of Crohn's disease, such as a phenotypic feature associated with Crohn's disease. Further embodiments provide for treating Crohn's disease. In a one embodiment, the mammal is a human.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">In particular embodiments, diagnosing Crohn's disease may be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression, where the presence of anti-CBir1 expression indicates that the mammal has Crohn's disease. Determining a subtype of Crohn's disease, such as a phenotypic feature associated with Crohn's disease may also be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression, where the presence of anti-CBir1 indicates that the mammal has small bowel disease, internal penetrating/perforating disease or fibrostenosing disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">Determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may be accomplished by various means. For example, determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may be performed by determining the presence of an RNA sequence or a fragment of an RNA sequence that encodes an anti-CBir1 antibody; for example, using Northern blot analysis or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression may also be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies; for example IgG anti-CBir1. Anti-CBir1 antibodies are not limited to IgG, as IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE are also included in various embodiments of the present invention. These examples are not intended to be limiting, as one skilled in the art will recognize other appropriate techniques for determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">Determining the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies may be accomplished by a number of ways. For example, the determination may be made by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot analysis, and mass spectrometric analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">In other embodiments for the determination of the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies, an immune complex can be detected with a labeled secondary antibody, for example, that has specificity for a class determining portion of an anti-CBir1 antibody. One skilled in the art understands that, preferably, a secondary antibody does not compete with the CBir1 flagellin antigen for binding to the primary antibody. A secondary antibody can bind any epitope of an anti-CBir1 antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">It is understood that a useful secondary antibody is specific for the species from which the sample was obtained. For example, if human serum is the sample to be assayed, mouse anti-human IgG can be a useful secondary antibody. A combination of different antibodies, which can be useful in the methods of the invention, also is encompassed within the meaning of the term secondary antibody, provided that at least one antibody of the combination reacts with an antibody that specifically binds a CBir1 antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">A secondary antibody can be rendered detectable by labeling with an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), beta-galactosidase or urease. A secondary antibody also can be rendered detectable by labeling with a fluorochrome (such a fluorochrome emits light of ultraviolet or visible wavelength after excitation by light or another energy source), a chemiluminescent marker or a radioisotope.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">A signal from a detectable secondary antibody can be analyzed, for example, using a spectrophotometer to detect color from a chromogenic substrate; a fluorometer to detect fluorescence in the presence of light of a certain wavelength; or a radiation counter to detect radiation, such as a gamma counter for detection of iodine-125. For detection of an enzyme-linked secondary antibody, for example, a quantitative analysis can be made using a spectrophotometer. If desired, the assays of the invention can be automated or performed robotically, and the signal from multiple samples can be detected simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">These examples are not intended to be limiting, as one skilled in the art will recognize other appropriate techniques for determining the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">Additional embodiments of the present invention provide for methods of treating Crohn's disease in a human by the use of antigen-directed therapy. The target antigen in this antigen-therapy may be flagellin, and particularly CBir1 or an immunoreactive fragment thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">In other embodiments, methods are provided to diagnose a subset of CD patients that may have colitic disease, and/or colitic and small bowel disease. Defining this subset of CD patients may be performed by determining the presence of anti-CBir1 expression and determining the presence of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), where the presence of both is diagnostic of Crohn's disease with properties of colitic disease and/or colitic and small bowel disease. Determination of the presence of pANCA may also be accomplished using ELISA, SDS-PAGE, Western blot analysis, or mass spectrometric analysis. These examples are not intended to be limiting, as one skilled in the art will recognize other appropriate means for determining the presence of pANCA.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">Further embodiments of the present invention provide for methods of treating the subset of CD patients with colitic disease and/or colitic and small bowel disease. Treating colitic disease and/or colitic and small bowel disease may be performed by manipulating the bacterial flora in the colon and/or colon and small bowel. Manipulation of the bacterial flora may be performed by administering antibiotics and/or probiotics. Examples of probiotics include but are not limited to <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, including, <i>B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis</i>, and <i>B. longum; Lactobacillus</i>, including, <i>L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuiteri</i>, and <i>L. paracasei. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">Samples useful in various embodiments of the present invention can be obtained from any biological fluid having antibodies or RNA sequences or fragments of RNA sequences; for example, whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, or other bodily fluid or tissue. It is understood that a sample to be assayed according to the various embodiments of the present invention may be a fresh or preserved sample obtained from a subject to be diagnosed. Furthermore, the sample used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention may be removed from the mammal; for example, from drawn blood, aspirated fluids, or biopsies. Alternatively, the sample may be in situ; for example a tool or device may be used to obtain a sample and perform a diagnosis while the tool or device is still in the mammal.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">A CBir1 antigen, or immunoreactive fragment thereof, useful in the invention can be produced by any appropriate method for protein or peptide synthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">Other embodiments of the present invention use anti-idiotypic antibodies specific to the anti-CBir1 antibody or other antibody of interest. An anti-idiotypic antibody contains an internal image of the antigen used to create the antibody of interest. Therefore, an anti-idiotypic antibody can bind to an anti-CBir1 antibody or other marker antibody of interest. One skilled in the art will know and appreciate appropriate methods of making, selecting and using anti-idiotype antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">The present invention is also directed to kits for diagnosing and/or treating Crohn's disease and/or subtypes of Crohn's disease. The kit is useful for practicing the inventive methods of diagnosing and/or treating Crohn's disease and/or subtypes of Crohn's disease. The kit is an assemblage of materials or components.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">The exact nature of the components configured in the inventive kit depends on its intended purpose. For example, some embodiments are configured for the purpose of diagnosing Crohn's disease or subtypes of Crohn's disease. Subtypes include small bowel disease, internal perforating disease, fibrostenosing disease, colitic disease and colitic and small bowel disease. For instance, a quantity of CBir1 antigen may be included in the kit for determining the presence of anti-CBir1 antibodies in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Additional embodiments are configured for treating Crohn's disease or subtypes of Crohn's disease. Further embodiments are configured for treating Crohn's disease patients with colitic disease and/or colitic and small bowel disease. In one embodiment, the kit is configured particularly for the purpose of diagnosing human subjects. In another embodiment, the kit is configured particularly for the purpose of treating human subjects.</p>

      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Variety of Methods and Materials</heading>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0308">A variety of methods can be used to determine the presence or absence of a variant allele or haplotype. As an example, enzymatic amplification of nucleic acid from an individual may be used to obtain nucleic acid for subsequent analysis. The presence or absence of a variant allele or haplotype may also be determined directly from the individual's nucleic acid without enzymatic amplification.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0309">Analysis of the nucleic acid from an individual, whether amplified or not, may be performed using any of various techniques. Useful techniques include, without limitation, polymerase chain reaction based analysis, sequence analysis and electrophoretic analysis. As used herein, the term ânucleic acidâ means a polynucleotide such as a single or double-stranded DNA or RNA molecule including, for example, genomic DNA, cDNA and mRNA. The term nucleic acid encompasses nucleic acid molecules of both natural and synthetic origin as well as molecules of linear, circular or branched configuration representing either the sense or antisense strand, or both, of a native nucleic acid molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0310">The presence or absence of a variant allele or haplotype may involve amplification of an individual's nucleic acid by the polymerase chain reaction. Use of the polymerase chain reaction for the amplification of nucleic acids is well known in the art (see, for example, Mullis et al. (Eds.), The Polymerase Chain Reaction, Birkhauser, Boston, (1994)).</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0311">A TaqmanB allelic discrimination assay available from Applied Biosystems may be useful for determining the presence or absence of an IL23R variant allele. In a TaqmanB allelic discrimination assay, a specific, fluorescent, dye-labeled probe for each allele is constructed. The probes contain different fluorescent reporter dyes such as FAM and VICTM to differentiate the amplification of each allele. In addition, each probe has a quencher dye at one end which quenches fluorescence by fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET). During PCR, each probe anneals specifically to complementary sequences in the nucleic acid from the individual. The 5â² nuclease activity of Taq polymerase is used to cleave only probe that hybridize to the allele. Cleavage separates the reporter dye from the quencher dye, resulting in increased fluorescence by the reporter dye. Thus, the fluorescence signal generated by PCR amplification indicates which alleles are present in the sample. Mismatches between a probe and allele reduce the efficiency of both probe hybridization and cleavage by Taq polymerase, resulting in little to no fluorescent signal. Improved specificity in allelic discrimination assays can be achieved by conjugating a DNA minor grove binder (MGB) group to a DNA probe as described, for example, in Kutyavin et al., â3â²-minor groove binder-DNA probes increase sequence specificity at PCR extension temperature, âNucleic Acids Research 28:655-661 (2000)). Minor grove binders include, but are not limited to, compounds such as dihydrocyclopyrroloindole tripeptide (DPI).</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0312">Sequence analysis also may also be useful for determining the presence or absence of an IL23R variant allele or haplotype.</p>
      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0313">Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis may also be useful for determining the presence or absence of a particular allele (Jarcho et al. in Dracopoli et al., Current Protocols in Human Genetics pages 2.7.1-2.7.5, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York; Innis et al., (Ed.), PCR Protocols, San Diego: Academic Press, Inc. (1990)). As used herein, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis is any method for distinguishing genetic polymorphisms using a restriction enzyme, which is an endonuclease that catalyzes the degradation of nucleic acid and recognizes a specific base sequence, generally a palindrome or inverted repeat. One skilled in the art understands that the use of RFLP analysis depends upon an enzyme that can differentiate two alleles at a polymorphic site.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0314">Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization may also be used to detect a disease-predisposing allele. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization is based on the use of a labeled oligonucleotide probe having a sequence perfectly complementary, for example, to the sequence encompassing a disease-predisposing allele. Under appropriate conditions, the allele-specific probe hybridizes to a nucleic acid containing the disease-predisposing allele but does not hybridize to the one or more other alleles, which have one or more nucleotide mismatches as compared to the probe. If desired, a second allele-specific oligonucleotide probe that matches an alternate allele also can be used. Similarly, the technique of allele-specific oligonucleotide amplification can be used to selectively amplify, for example, a disease-predisposing allele by using an allele-specific oligonucleotide primer that is perfectly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of the disease-predisposing allele but which has one or more mismatches as compared to other alleles (Mullis et al., supra, (1994)). One skilled in the art understands that the one or more nucleotide mismatches that distinguish between the disease-predisposing allele and one or more other alleles are preferably located in the center of an allele-specific oligonucleotide primer to be used in allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. In contrast, an allele-specific oligonucleotide primer to be used in PCR amplification preferably contains the one or more nucleotide mismatches that distinguish between the disease-associated and other alleles at the 3â² end of the primer.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0315">A heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) is another well known assay that may be used to detect a SNP or a haplotype. HMA is useful for detecting the presence of a polymorphic sequence since a DNA duplex carrying a mismatch has reduced mobility in a polyacrylamide gel compared to the mobility of a perfectly base-paired duplex (Delwart et al., Science 262:1257-1261 (1993); White et al., Genomics 12:301-306 (1992)).</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0316">The technique of single strand conformational, polymorphism (SSCP) also may be used to detect the presence or absence of a SNP and/or a haplotype (see Hayashi, K., Methods Applic. 1:34-38 (1991)). This technique can be used to detect mutations based on differences in the secondary structure of single-strand DNA that produce an altered electrophoretic mobility upon non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Polymorphic fragments are detected by comparison of the electrophoretic pattern of the test fragment to corresponding standard fragments containing known alleles.</p>
      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0317">Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) also may be used to detect a SNP and/or a haplotype. In DGGE, double-stranded DNA is electrophoresed in a gel containing an increasing concentration of denaturant; double-stranded fragments made up of mismatched alleles have segments that melt more rapidly, causing such fragments to migrate differently as compared to perfectly complementary sequences (Sheffield et al., âIdentifying DNA Polymorphisms by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresisâ in Innis et al., supra, 1990).</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0318">Other molecular methods useful for determining the presence or absence of a SNP and/or a haplotype are known in the art and useful in the methods of the invention. Other well-known approaches for determining the presence or absence of a SNP and/or a haplotype include automated sequencing and RNAase mismatch techniques (Winter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82:7575-7579 (1985)). Furthermore, one skilled in the art understands that, where the presence or absence of multiple alleles or haplotype(s) is to be determined, individual alleles can be detected by any combination of molecular methods. See, in general, Birren et al. (Eds.) Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual Volume 1 (Analyzing DNA) New York, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1997). In addition, one skilled in the art understands that multiple alleles can be detected in individual reactions or in a single reaction (a âmultiplexâ assay). In view of the above, one skilled in the art realizes that the methods of the present invention for diagnosing or predicting susceptibility to or protection against CD in an individual may be practiced using one or any combination of the well known assays described above or another art-recognized genetic assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0319">There are many techniques readily available in the field for detecting the presence or absence of antibodies, polypeptides or other biomarkers, including protein microarrays. For example, some of the detection paradigms that can be employed to this end include optical methods, electrochemical methods (voltametry and amperometry techniques), atomic force microscopy, and radio frequency methods, e.g., multipolar resonance spectroscopy. Illustrative of optical methods, in addition to microscopy, both confocal and non-confocal, are detection of fluorescence, luminescence, chemiluminescence, absorbance, reflectance, transmittance, and birefringence or refractive index (e.g., surface plasmon resonance, ellipsometry, a resonant mirror method, a grating coupler waveguide method or interferometry).</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0320">Similarly, there are any number of techniques that may be employed to isolate and/or fractionate antibodies or protein biomarkers. For example, a biomarker and/or antibody may be captured using biospecific capture reagents, such as aptamers or other antibodies that recognize the antibody and/or protein biomarker and modified forms of it. This method could also result in the capture of protein interactors that are bound to the proteins or that are otherwise recognized by antibodies and that, themselves, can be biomarkers. The biospecific capture reagents may also be bound to a solid phase. Then, the captured proteins can be detected by SELDI mass spectrometry or by eluting the proteins from the capture reagent and detecting the eluted proteins by traditional MALDI or by SELDI. One example of SELDI is called âaffinity capture mass spectrometry,â or âSurface-Enhanced Affinity Captureâ or âSEAC,â which involves the use of probes that have a material on the probe surface that captures analytes through a non-covalent affinity interaction (adsorption) between the material and the analyte. Some examples of mass spectrometers are time-of-flight, magnetic sector, quadrupole filter, ion trap, ion cyclotron resonance, electrostatic sector analyzer and hybrids of these.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0321">Alternatively, for example, the presence of biomarkers such as polypeptides and antibodies may be detected using traditional immunoassay techniques. Immunoassay requires biospecific capture reagents, such as antibodies, to capture the analytes. The assay may also be designed to specifically distinguish protein and modified forms of protein, which can be done by employing a sandwich assay in which one antibody captures more than one form and second, distinctly labeled antibodies, specifically bind, and provide distinct detection of, the various forms. Antibodies can be produced by immunizing animals with the biomolecules. Traditional immunoassays may also include sandwich immunoassays including ELISA or fluorescence-based immunoassays, as well as other enzyme immunoassays.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0322">Prior to detection, antibodies and/or biomarkers may also be fractionated to isolate them from other components in a solution or of blood that may interfere with detection. Fractionation may include platelet isolation from other blood components, sub-cellular fractionation of platelet components and/or fractionation of the desired biomarkers from other biomolecules found in platelets using techniques such as chromatography, affinity purification, 1D and 2D mapping, and other methodologies for purification known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, a sample is analyzed by means of a biochip. Biochips generally comprise solid substrates and have a generally planar surface, to which a capture reagent (also called an adsorbent or affinity reagent) is attached. Frequently, the surface of a biochip comprises a plurality of addressable locations, each of which has the capture reagent bound there.</p>

      <p id="p-00325-en" num="0325">Chronic intestinal inflammation, as seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), results from an aberrant and poorly understood mucosal immune response to the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract in genetically susceptible individuals. Serological expression cloning to identify commensal bacterial proteins that could contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD was used. The dominant antigens identified were flagellins, molecules known to activate innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), and critical targets of the acquired immune system in host defense. Multiple strains of colitic mice had elevated serum anti-flagellin IgG2a responses and Th1 T cell responses to flagellin. In addition, flagellin-specific CD4 T cells induced severe colitis when adoptively transferred into naive SCID mice. Serum IgG to these flagellins, but not to the dissimilar <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>flagellin, was elevated in patients with Crohn's disease, but not in patients with ulcerative colitis or in controls. These results identify flagellins as a class of immunodominant antigens that stimulate pathogenic intestinal immune reactions in genetically diverse hosts and suggest new avenues for the diagnosis and antigen-directed therapy of patients with IBD.</p>
      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0326">A molecular technique known as serological expression cloning (SEC) was used to identify specific bacterial antigens driving experimental IBD. SEC involves the screening of DNA expression libraries in lambda phage with defined antisera.</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0327">Molecular cloning of antigens by SEC using sera from colitic C3H/HeJBir mice is described. The dominant antigens identified were a family of related, novel flagellins. Strong reactivity against specific flagellins was seen in multiple models of experimental colitis across several distinct MHC haplotypes. There was a clear IgG2a predominance to the anti-flagellin response, suggesting a concurrent Th1-biased T cell response against flagellin. Indeed, marked reactivity against flagellin was seen in mesenteric and splenic T cell cultures from colitic animals, and flagellin-specific T cells were able to induce colitis when adoptively transferred into immunodeficient animals. Surprisingly, the reactivity against these flagellins (but not against the dissimilar <i>Salmonella </i>flagellin) was also seen in human IBD sera, with significant reactivity in patients with CD but not UC or control patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0328">Using an unbiased molecular screen to search for bacterial antigens relevant to IBD, the dominant antigens identified were a family of related, novel flagellins. A strong, IgG2a-biased serological response to these specific flagellins was seen in multiple models of experimental colitis across several distinct MHC haplotypes. In addition, marked reactivity against these flagellins was seen at the T cell level, and flagellin-specific T cells were able to induce colitis when adoptively transferred into immunodeficient animals. Interestingly, while these flagellins were identified from mouse cecal bacteria, there was clear, specific reactivity against these molecules in patients with CD (but not in patients with UC or in NCs).</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0329">It has been observed that full-length flagellin Fla-X (endotoxin free) is capable of stimulating TNF-Î± production by human macrophages in vitro (M. J. Lodes and R. M. Hershberg). It is tempting to speculate that the intrinsic âadjuvanticityâ of flagellin is likely to contribute to its antigenicity. While flagellin molecules clearly have the capacity to stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines via TLR5, and while not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the B and T cell responses to flagellin contribute more directly to the chronic intestinal inflammation seen in IBD.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0330">The clinical data (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>) are consistent with the fact that the aberrant response in patients with CD is specific to the subgroup of flagellins identified in the inventive molecular screen. Specifically, there was no correlation between IBD and a response to flagellin from <i>Salmonella muenchen</i>, which is very similar (84-91%) in the NH<sub>2 </sub>conserved region to the flagellin from the commensal organism <i>Escherichia coli</i>. It must be emphasized that the flagellins identified were from a source of material devoid of known bacterial pathogens. The bacteria with genes that âencodeâ the flagellins CBir1 and Fla-X (the two dominant flagellins tested) are unknown; however, preliminary phylogenetic data suggest that these flagellins are most closely related to the flagellins of bacteria in the genera <i>Butyrivibrio, Rosburia, Thermotoga</i>, and <i>Clostridium </i>and fall within the <i>Clostridium </i>subphylum XIVa cluster of Gram-positive bacteria (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>). While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the aberrant response to the flagellin molecule(s) from these organisms is related to a combination of the intrinsic property of the molecules themselves (as immunogens and adjuvants) and an underlying genetic susceptibility. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against CBir1, the inventors have demonstrated that this antigen is present in the stool of wild-type strains (FVB, C57BL/6, BALB/c, and C3H/HeJ) and colitic strains (mdr1a<sup>â/â</sup>, B6.IL-10<sup>â/â</sup>, and C3H/HeJBir). These data indicate that the presence of the antigen itself does not strictly correlate with colitis. Still, the widespread presence of these antigens does not preclude the possibility of enhanced colonization of organisms expressing these flagellins in CD lesions.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0331">In general, the data are consistent with the belief that IBD is associated with a defect in tolerance to commensal organisms (Duchmann R, et al. Tolerance exists towards resident intestinal flora but is broken in active inflammatory bowel disease. <i>Clin. Exp. Immunol. </i>1995; 102:448-455.). The IgG2a-biased antibody against Fla-X and CBir1 highlights the Th1 bias of the T cell responses seen. The broad recognition of these flagellins in several different mouse models and in humans with CD indicates that these flagellins are among the immunodominant antigens of the microbiota. However, the exact role of these flagellins in the pathogenesis of IBD (e.g., whether they are predominant or obligatory for disease) compared with that of other microbial antigens remains to be defined. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that a T cell regulatory response to specific flagellins (and/or other bacterial antigens) may be selectively impaired in IBD. In this context, specific flagellin molecules may represent novel targets for antigen-directed therapy in IBD.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0332">As observed with the specific flagellins identified here, only a subset of patients with CD show specific seroreactivity against I2 (an antigen derived from <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0333">Antibody responses to certain microbial antigens define heterogeneous groups of Crohn's patients; multiple and high-level responses to these antigens are associated with aggressive clinical phenotypes. The flagellin, CBir1, identified by the inventors in the C3H/HeJBir mouse model, is a dominant antigen capable of inducing colitis in mice and eliciting antibody responses in a subpopulation of patients with Crohn's disease. Serum response to CBir1 flagellin in Crohn's disease patients was evaluated and compared to previously defined responses to oligomannan (ASCA), I2, OmpC and neutrophil nuclear autoantigens (pANCA), and to determine anti-CBir1 associated phenotypes.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0334">It was found that the presence and level of IgG anti-CBir1 were associated with Crohn's disease, independently. Anti-CBir1 was present in all antibody subgroups and expression increases in parallel with increases in the number of antibody responses. pANCA<sup>+</sup> Crohn's patients were more reactive to CBir1 than were pANCA<sup>+</sup> ulcerative colitis patients. Anti-CBir1 expression is independently associated with small bowel, internal-penetrating and fibrostenosing disease features.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0335">Thus, serum responses to CBir1 independently identify a unique subset of patients with complicated Crohn's disease. This is the first bacterial antigen identified in a murine model with a similar pattern of aberrant reactivity in a subset of Crohn's disease patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0336">Serologic expression cloning was used to identify an immunodominant antigen, CBir1 flagellin, to which strong B cell and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses occur in colitic mice. Transfer of CBir1 specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 T cells to C3H/SCID mice generated a severe colitis dependent on endogenous expression of CBir1 flagellin in the cecum and colon. These findings prove that CBir1 flagellin is an immunodominant antigen of the enteric microbial flora. Of note, approximately 50% of patients with CD had serum reactivity to CBir1, whereas patients with ulcerative colitis, patients with other inflammatory GI diseases, and control subjects had little or no reactivity to this flagellin. The inventors determined the relationship of serum reactivity to CBir1 and the previously defined responses to oligomannan (ASCA), OmpC, I2 and pANCA in patients with CD and to define distinct clinical phenotypes. Results show that antibodies to CBir1 are independently associated with CD, have no correlation to levels of previously defined antibodies, are expressed in ASCA-negative and pANCA<sup>+</sup> CD patients and are independently associated with aspects of complicated CD.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0337">Investigations have yielded compelling evidence that serum antibody to CBir1 flagellin, marks for an independent subset of patients with CD. It is shown that the level of response can vary widely, that these responses are relatively stable over time and do not correspond with active or remission disease states. It is believed that anti-CBir1 expression is independent of serologic responses to previously defined bacterial antigens and is independently associated with complicated CD. It is also the first antigen to be discovered with a role as ligand for activation of the innate immune response via Toll-like receptors and a strong immunogen for adaptive immunity. This dual effect provides a focus for investigations of the role of anti-CBir1 in the pathogenesis of this subset of patients with CD.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0338">It has been previously shown that groups of patients with unique disease characteristics can be distinguished by the presence and level of serum antibodies to one, two or all of the following antigens: oligomannan (ASCA); the novel Crohn's related bacterial sequence, I2; and <i>E. coli </i>outer-membrane porin-C(OmpC). While each of these reactivities may serve to subclassify phenotypes within CD, none of them have yet been shown to have any direct pathophysiologic significance. The dominant serologic immune response to CBir1 flagellin was found by serologic expression cloning using sera from colitic mice to screen a DNA phage library derived from mouse cecal bacteria. CBir1 flagellin was then used to generate a specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell line. Transfer of this Th1 cell line into SCID mice induced a colitis due to reactivity to endogenous CBir1 flagellin in the microbial flora indicating that CBir1 is an immunodominant antigen in mouse colitis. CBir1 is the first bacterial antigen capable of inducing colitis in animals that demonstrates a similar aberrant immune response in patients with CD.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0339">Interesting findings resulted from the examination of the relationship of anti-CBir1 to the previously defined antibodies to microbial antigens in patients with CD. The level of response to CBir1 is greater in patients who have increasing levels of reactivity to ASCA, OmpC, and I2 (with a peak occurring in those who respond to all three), which is consistent with the concept that this subset of patients has a propensity to respond to multiple bacterial antigens. However, high CBir1 reactivity was seen across all antibody-defined subsets, which is consistent with it being independent of the other antibody responses.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0340">The data presented herein show that the serotypic and phenotypic associations with anti-CBir1 expression, (small bowel, internal penetrating, and fibrostenosing disease) differ from those associated with any or a combination of responses to I2, OmpC, oligomannan, or neutrophil nuclear antibodies. The lack of relationship to small bowel surgery and to ulcerative colitis-like suggest that to define the true phenotype associated with this antibody response may require further more precise clinical groupings.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0341">Another seroreactivity that defines a subgroup of patients is pANCA, which is predominantly associated with ulcerative colitis and may reflect cross reactivity to bacteria (Seibold F, Brandwein S, Simpson S, Terhorst C, Elson C O. pANCA represents a cross-reactivity to enteric bacterial antigens. J Clin Immunol 1998; 18:153-60.); however, there is a subset of patients with CD who also express pANCA (Vasiliauskas E A, Plevy S E, Landers C J, Binder S W, Ferguson D M, Yang H, Rotter J I, Vidrich A, Targan S R. Perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease define a clinical subgroup. Gastroenterology 1996; 110:1810-9. Vasiliauskas E A, Kam L Y, Karp L C, Gaiennie J, Yang H, Targan S R. Marker antibody expression stratifies Crohn's disease into immunologically homogeneous subgroups with distinct clinical characteristics. Gut 2000; 47:487-96.). pANCA<sup>+</sup> CD patients have both colitic and left-sided disease with features similar to ulcerative colitis. Among the population of CD patients who express pANCA but do not react to the other known antigens, 40-44% expressed anti-CBir1, while anti-CBir1 expression was found in only 4% of pANCA<sup>+</sup> ulcerative colitis patients. Because anti-CBir1 expression appears to be associated with a specific CD subtype, it may prove to be useful in distinguishing among patients with indeterminate colitis; i.e, those that may be more Crohn's-like compared to those that may be more ulcerative colitis-like. Used in combination with pANCA, anti-CBir1 expression may also be used diagnose a subset of patients with colitic and/or colitic and small bowel disease, perhaps defining those patients potentially likely to respond to manipulation of bacteria using either antibiotics or probiotics.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0342">The expression of antibodies to CBir1 is indicative of an adaptive immune response to this antigen. Antibody reactivity to flagellin may provide an important tool to define potential differences in pathophysiologic immune mechanisms in innate and adaptive immunity in a subset of patients with CD. Anti-CBir expression defines a subgroup of CD patients not previously recognized by other serologic responses and is independently associated with aspects of the complicated CD phenotype. These results represent the first example of discovery from animal models having direct correlates in human disease.</p>

Sera were produced from standard phlebotomy blood specimens and were given an âanonymousâ number code, divided into aliquots, and stored at â80Â° C. until use. The UC and CD patient specimens were obtained from a genetic case-control study (Toyoda H, et al.

Invest. </i>1993; 92:1080-1084.). Each patient's diagnosis was confirmed by clinical history, endoscopic and radiologic examination, and histopathology findings. The NC group is a collection of environmental controls that contain sera from individuals with no symptoms/signs of disease (i.e., spouses). DC samples include sera from patients with presumed infectious enteritis (stool culture negative for specific pathogens), blastocystis, celiac disease, collagenous colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, radiation proctitis, and acute schistosomiasis. The UC group includes both pANCA-positive and -negative specimens, while the CD group contains samples that are marker-negative, ASCA+; I2+; OmpC+(I2-positive); OmpC+, I2+, and ASCA+; and pANCA+.

      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0357">Serologic expression cloning resulted in 55 clones that were sequenced and identified. Using the basic local alignment search tool to search the GenBank databases demonstrated that 15 (26.8%) of these clones were flagellin-like sequences. None of the sequences directly matched any flagellin in the GenBank database, and all flagellin sequences identified represented unique clones. Given the average insert size of 0.8 kb in the library, no full-length flagellin clones were identified. However, all of the flagellin clones contained sequences derived from the conserved NH<sub>2 </sub>terminus, with varying amounts of the hypervariable central domain, and only two clones contained partial sequence from the conserved carboxy domain. Sequences from the 15 flagellin clones identified (CBir1-CBir15) were aligned at the protein level to flagellin sequences available in the public domain using the Clustal program in DNAStar. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, these flagellins are most closely related to flagellins from <i>Butyrivibrio, Roseburia, Thermotoga</i>, and <i>Clostridium </i>species and appear to align, by similarity, in the <i>Clostridium </i>subphylum cluster XIVa of Gram-positive bacteria. Sequences from the remaining 40 clones (see Table 1) were also unique and were either related to known proteins (33 clones) or without significant homology to known proteins (7 clones).</p>

      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0359">Because of strong serum antibody reactivity to one particular flagellin clone, called CBir1, it was cloned and expressed its full-length gene. During this effort, the inventors also cloned a second, highly homologous and reactive flagellin (83.5% similarity to CBir1 at the NH<sub>2 </sub>conserved domain) and refer to it here as Fla-X (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>). Recombinant proteins representing full-length sequence and NH<sub>2 </sub>and carboxy fragments of both CBir1 and Fla-X were subsequently expressed in <i>E. coli </i>with a six-histidine tag to aid in protein purification (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, C and D, respectively).</p>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0000">Antibody Reactivity to Flagellin Directed Against the NH<sub>2 </sub>Terminus is of the IgG2a Subclass and Correlates with Disease</p>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0360">Western blot analyses using these purified recombinant flagellins and fragments with sera from the diseased C3H/HeJBir mice demonstrated the strong reactivity to flagellin, predominantly to the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragments (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). Little or no antibody reactivity was seen to the carboxy-terminal CBir1 or Fla-X recombinant fragments in the sera tested (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). This selective reactivity to the NH<sub>2 </sub>domain is consistent with the presence of an NH<sub>2 </sub>domain in all flagellin clones identified in the initial serological screen (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In addition, strong reactivity to both flagellins was seen using sera from two additional experimental models of colitis: mdr1a<sup>â/â</sup> mice (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>) and B6.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>mice. These last two models are on strains with different haplotypes from each other (H-2<sup>s </sup>and H-2<sup>b</sup>, respectively) and from the C3H/HeJBir strain (H-2<sup>k</sup>), and the sera were obtained from mice from geographically different mouse facilities. In addition, these additional colitic strains have very different mechanisms underlying the genetic predisposition to develop IBD; that is, epithelial barrier dysfunction in the mdr1a<sup>â/â </sup>mice and a defect in regulatory T cells in the B6.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>mice. Little or no reactivity was seen to CBir1 or Fla-X in noncolitic mouse serum from control MHC haplotype-matched noncolitic mice (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>, A and B). Interestingly, the inventors also saw a similar pattern of reactivity to the NH<sub>2 </sub>termini of both CBir1 and Fla-X with a serum pool from patients with CD (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0361">In order to generate more quantitative data with multiple IBD models at various time points in the course of disease, an antibody subclass ELISA against full-length or fragments of CBir1 or Fla-X was developed (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>, C and D). This assay confirmed Western blot data showing that the antibody reactivity observed was predominantly to the NH<sub>2 </sub>terminus (data not shown) and of the IgG2a subclass. High titers of anti-flagellin antibody were seen in the four genetically distinct models of IBD tested (colitic mice: C3H/HeJBir [<figref>FIG. 4</figref>], mdr1a<sup>â/â </sup>[<figref>FIG. 4</figref>], BALB/c.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>[not shown] and B6.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>[not shown]), while minimal to no reactivity was seen in serum from the H-2-matched, control, noncolitic mouse strains. Given the nonuniform incidence of colitis in the mdr1a<sup>â/â </sup>colony at varying time points, the inventors randomly chose 23 animals in the colony and assigned quantitative histopathological scores using a scale (from 0 to 60) that incorporates both the degree and extent of inflammation in the large intestine (Burich A, et al. <i>Helicobacter</i>-induced inflammatory bowel disease in IL-10- and T cell-deficient mice. <i>Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. </i>2001; 281:G764-G778.). The inventors measured antibodies against Fla-X and CBir1 by ELISA in a âblindedâ manner using sera from these animals and found that an increased titer of anti-flagellin IgG correlated positively with worsening IBD histopathology (r=+0.758 and +0.719, respectively; <figref>FIG. 5</figref>). Weak correlations were found between antibody and mouse age (r=+0.325) and between colitis score and mouse age (r=+0.372).</p>
      <heading id="h-00030-en" level="2">Anti-CBir1 Reactivity in CD Patient Sera but not Normal or UC Patient Sera</heading>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0362">Subsequently, a large panel of sera from controls and patients with IBD for reactivity against CBir1 and Fla-X using antigen-specific ELISAs was tested. It was found that a significantly higher level of serum anti-CBir1/Fla-X flagellin in CD patients than in NCs, disease controls (DCs), and UC patients (<figref>FIG. 6A</figref>). It should be noted that more than 50% of the UC sera were from patients with a modified Truelove and Witts severity index greater than 7, indicating moderate to active disease. The observation of serum responses to flagellins CBir1 and Fla-X in a group of CD patients, but not UC patients (<figref>FIG. 6A</figref>), highlights the possibility that anti-flagellin responses may be valuable in the diagnosis of IBD, in particular with regards to the more precise discrimination between UC and CD, and the definition of CD patient subsets.</p>
      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0363">Reactivity to the <i>Salmonella muenchen </i>flagellin (which is highly similar to the flagellin of <i>Eschericia coli [</i>84-91% at the conserved NH<sub>2 </sub>end]), however, showed no significant correlation to disease (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>). As shown in <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, the mean values for the anti-<i>Salmonella </i>response were nearly identical in the control, CD, and UC populations. In all populations, there appeared to be a minority of samples without significant reactivity and a majority of samples that were âpositive.â While these data may reflect the random exposure to <i>Salmonella </i>in humans due to prior infection (possibly subclinical) or a cross-reactivity to an undefined but closely related flagellin (probably from the Enterobacteriaceae family), it is clear that the serological response to the <i>Salmonella </i>flagellin molecule does not correlate with IBD. Similarly, there was no correlation between reactivity to <i>Salmonella </i>flagellin and colitis in the C3H/HeJBir or mdr1a<sup>â/â </sup>strains compared with the MHC haplotype-matched controls.</p>
      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0364">Marked reactivity against flagellin is seen at the T cell level, and flagellin-specific T cells are able to induce colitis when adoptively transferred. Given the strong IgG2a bias seen in the antibody response in the mouse IBD strains, and while not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that flagellin-specific Th1 T cells would be present in mice with IBD. To address this possibility, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from pooled spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes from colitic mdr1a<sup>â/â</sup>, C3H/HeJBir, and C3H/HeJ.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>mice (and haplotype-matched, noncolitic FVB and C3H/HeJ mice) were purified and tested the cells for reactivity against purified CBir1 and Fla-X in vitro in the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the colitic mdr1a<sup>â/â</sup>, C3H/HeJBir, and C3H/HeJ.IL-10<sup>â/â </sup>mice, but not from age-matched control FVB or C3H/HeJ mice raised in the same mouse facility, responded to CBir1, as assessed by proliferation (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). It was possible that the responses seen were due to the fact that the flagellin molecule was nonspecifically activating the cultured T cells via TLR5 or TLR4 activation (through endotoxin contamination of the recombinant protein). This possibility was excluded by the lack of stimulation in both the noncolitic T cell cultures (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) and in an independent T cell culture system that showed no influence of Fla-X or CBir1 on the ovalbumin-specific proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from DO11.10 ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor-transgenic animals (Table 2).</p>

      <p id="p-00368-en" num="0365">It has been previously shown that a T cell line specific for cecal bacterial protein/antigen (CBA), but not CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells polyclonally activated by anti-CD3, could induce mucosal inflammation when adoptively transferred into H-2-matched immunodeficient scid/scid mice (Cong Y, et al. CD4+ T cells reactive to enteric bacterial antigens in spontaneously colitic C3H/HeJBir mice: increased T helper cell Type 1 response and ability to transfer disease. <i>J. Exp. Med. </i>1998; 187:855-864.). To address the potentially pathogenic role of flagellin-specific T cells in the initiation of mucosal inflammation, a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line reactive with CBir1 flagellin from C3H/HeJBir mice was generated by repeated stimulation with antigen and APCs. This CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line strongly responded to CBir1 but not to Fla-X or a variety of other microbial, food, and epithelial antigens (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). These CBir1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were adoptively transferred into C3H/HeJ-scid/scid recipients. Control SCID mice received anti-CD3-activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a negative control or a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line reactive to CBA as a positive control. Quantitative histopathological scores were assigned at 8 weeks after transfer (<figref>FIG. 9A</figref>). The CBir1-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line induced colitis in all recipients of an intensity that was similar to or greater than that induced by the CBA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell line, whereas none of the recipients given anti-CD3-activated C3H/HeJBir CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells developed disease (representative histology is shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0366">Serum samples from 484 subjects (40 normal controls (NC), 21 disease controls (DC), 50 UC patients, and 373 CD patients) were selected from the serum archive of the Cedars-Sinai IBD Research Center. All research related activities were approved by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Institutional Review Board. Diagnosis for each patient was based on standard endoscopic, histologic, and radiographic features. The normal control (NC) group is a collection of environmental controls that contain sera from individuals with no symptoms/signs of disease (i.e. spouses of patients). Disease controls (DC) include sera from patients with presumed infectious enteritis (stool culture negative for specific pathogens), blastocystis, celiac disease, collagenous colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, radiation proctitis, and acute schistosomiasis. For UC, groups chosen were pANCAâ (n=25, seronegative) and pANCA<sup>+</sup> (n=25, pANCA EU&gt;45, no other antibody reactivity present). For CD, two cohorts were chosen: Cohort 1 (Lodes M J, Cong Y, Elson C O, Mohamath R, Landers C J, Targan S R, Fort M, Hershberg R M. Bacterial flagellin is a dominant antigen in Crohn disease. J Clin Invest 2004; 113:1296-306.) (n=100) was comprised of patients with select antibody expression to test CBir-1's specificity for CD and its relationship with other CD associated antibodies, Cohort 2 (n=303) was unbiased, previously well clinically and serologically characterized (Mow W S, Vasiliauskas E A, Lin Y C, Fleshner P R, Papadakis K A, Taylor K D, Landers C J, Abreu-Martin M T, Rotter J I, Yang H, Targan S R. Association of antibody responses to microbial antigens and complications of small bowel Crohn's disease. Gastroenterology 2004; 126:414-24.), with an overlap of 30 patients between the two. Within Cohort 1, groups chosen were seronegative (n=40), ASCA<sup>+</sup> (n=15, IgG ASCA EU&gt;40, IgA ASCA EU&gt;45, and no other antibody reactivity present), I2<sup>+</sup> (n=15, anti-I2 EU&gt;40, and no other antibody reactivity present), I2/OmpC<sup>+</sup> (n=15, OmpC EU&gt;30, and anti-I2 reactivity present), I2<sup>+</sup>/OmpC<sup>+</sup>/ASCA<sup>+</sup> (n=15, anti-I2, anti-OmpC, IgG and IgA ASCA all positive, but no ANCA reactivity allowed), and pANCA<sup>+</sup> (n=25, ANCA EU&gt;35, no other antibody reactivity present). Cohort 2 was used for determining antibody groups as well as for phenotype analysis using definitions of clinical subgroup previously reported (Mow W S, Vasiliauskas E A, Lin Y C, Fleshner P R, Papadakis K A, Taylor K D, Landers C J, Abreu-Martin M T, Rotter J I, Yang H, Targan S R. Association of antibody responses to microbial antigens and complications of small bowel Crohn's disease. Gastroenterology 2004; 126:414-24.). Serum samples from 44 CD patients diagnosed as above were analyzed for changes in antibody expression. Twenty of these patients were under treatment with infliximab and had experienced a CD Activity Index (CDAI) change of at least 70 (mean=Î181) at time points at least 4 months apart with serum drawn at both times. The other 24 patients were drawn at the time of surgery and once at least 6 months following surgery.</p>
      <heading id="h-00032-en" level="2">ELISA</heading>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0367">ELISA analysis of anti-CBir1 was performed as described in Lodes, et al. (Lodes M J, Cong Y, Elson C O, Mohamath R, Landers C J, Targan S R, Fort M, Hershberg R M. Bacterial flagellin is a dominant antigen in Crohn disease. J Clin Invest 2004; 113:1296-306.) but using NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of CBir1 (147aa) without knowledge of diagnosis or other serology results. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated overnight with 100 ng/well of CBir1, then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 hours. Plates were washed and serum was added at a 1:200 dilution in 1% BSA-PBS for a 30 minute incubation. After washing, horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG at a 1:10,000 dilution was added and incubated for 30 minutes. After another wash, the plates were incubated with tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped with 1 N sulfuric acid and read at 450 nm. Positive was defined as the mean+2 SD of the healthy controls. For Cohort 2 and the longitudinal cohorts and phenotype cohorts, this assay was modified to be more similar to the ANCA, OmpC and I2 protocols: alkaline phosphatase was substituted as the secondary conjugate and incubated for 1 hour followed by paranitrophenyl phosphate as substrate for 30 minutes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00033-en" level="2">Statistical Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0368">Differences between disease groups were tested with non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed rank) statistics for quantitative levels. To determine the associations between antibody responses (positivity) toward microbial antigens, auto-antigens, and disease phenotype characteristics, univariate analyses utilizing Ï<sup>2 </sup>tests were performed. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was utilized to test if there is a linear trend in the proportion of patients with positive anti-CBir1 expression as the number of antibody responses increased. A p-value (p trend)&lt;=0.05 suggests that the linear trend is statistically significant. A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to determine the association between anti-CBir1 and disease phenotypes. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression modeling was also performed to determine the primary associations among qualitative serological responses with disease phenotypes. All statistic tests were preformed using Statistical Analysis Software (Version 8.02; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00372-en" num="0000">Serum Reactivity to CBir1 Defines a Subset of Patients with Crohn's Disease</p>
      <p id="p-00373-en" num="0369">Serologic expression cloning of a cecal bacterial antigen phage library identified the flagellin, CBir1, as an immunodominant antigen recognized by colitic mice and by approximately half of patients with CD. Serum from two separate cohorts was used to investigate subgroups of CD patients. Cohort 1 consisted of sera from 100 CD patients selected on the basis of antibody profile. Newly tested sera from a group of 303 unselected patients that were studied and reported on in Mow et al (Mow W S, Vasiliauskas E A, Lin Y C, Fleshner P R, Papadakis K A, Taylor K D, Landers C J, Abreu-Martin M T, Rotter J I, Yang H, Targan S R. Association of antibody responses to microbial antigens and complications of small bowel Crohn's disease. Gastroenterology 2004; 126:414-24.) comprised Cohort 2. For antigen, the amino domain of CBir1 flagellin was used because most of the IgG reactivity was to this region of the molecule. In addition, this form of CBir1 had a lower baseline reactivity among inflammatory controls, patients with UC or CD, and healthy control subjects, compared to the full length construct. As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, 50% of CD patients from the Cohort 1 had serologic responses to this CBir1 construct, as compared to very low numbers and low levels of response among inflammatory controls, patients with UC, or healthy control subjects. Among the control subjects who did respond to CBir1, the level of response was much lower than that of the patients with CD. In the unselected cohort, Cohort 2, 55% (167 of 303) of sera were positive for antibodies to CBir1. Approximately half of CD patients, whether selected serologically or not, are reactive to CBir1.</p>
      <p id="p-00374-en" num="0000">Levels of Antibodies to CBir1 do not Correlate with Disease Activity</p>
      <p id="p-00375-en" num="0370">As had been done with the previously defined CD-related antigens (I2/OmpC, oligomannan; Landers C J, Cohavy O, Misra R, Yang H, Lin Y C, Braun J, Targan S R.

Association of antibody responses to microbial antigens and complications of small bowel Crohn's disease. Gastroenterology 2004; 126:414-24.), determining whether the level of anti-CBir1 expression changed in association with disease activity was sought. Serum samples from medically-resistant patients with CD, who were undergoing surgical removal of active disease were collected. Samples were taken again 6 months post-operatively and analyzed for differences in response. In general, there was very little change before and 6 months post surgery, when patients were in clinical and endoscopic remission (<figref>FIG. 11A</figref>). The same analysis was performed before, and 4 months after, treatment of CD with infliximab (<figref>FIG. 11B</figref>, C). Among patients who achieved complete remission as evidenced by mucosal changes and healing, similar stability in anti-CBir1 expression is seen (<figref>FIG. 11B</figref>, C). These findings are consistent with antibody responses to other microbial antigens (Landers C J, Cohavy O, Misra R, Yang H, Lin Y C, Braun J, Targan S R.

      <heading id="h-00034-en" level="2">Antibody Response to CBir1 and Other Crohn's Disease-Associated Anti-Microbial Immune Responses</heading>
      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0371">To determine the relationship of expression and level of anti-CBir1 expression to the previously defined antibodies to microbial antigens (anti-I2, anti-OmpC, ASCA), multiple logistic regression analysis with Cohort 1 was used, it was found that anti-CBir1 relates independently to CD when controlled for anti-I2, anti-OmpC and ASCA (p&lt;0.001). In addition, there is no relationship between the level of response to CBir1 and any one of the other four antibodies (<figref>FIG. 12A-D</figref>). Thus, reactivity to CBir1 defines another potentially pathophysiogically distinct subgroup of CD.</p>
      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0372">As previously described by Landers et al (Landers C J, Cohavy O, Misra R, Yang H, Lin Y C, Braun J, Targan S R. Selected loss of tolerance evidenced by Crohn's disease-associated immune responses to auto- and microbial antigens. Gastroenterology 2002; 123:689-99.), homogeneous groups of CD patients based on selective antibody responses to specific microbial antigens and associated clinical features were defined. Thus far, the largest subgroup of CD has been stratified based on expression of ASCA. Among patients selected for study based on their antibody profiles (Cohort 1), anti-CBir1 is expressed in bothASCA-negative (46%) and ASCA+(60%) CD patients (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>). Anti-CBir1 is also expressed by patients who do not react to ASCA, OmpC, I2, or ANCA (40%) as well as those who express ASCA exclusively (33%) and anti-I2 exclusively (40%) (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>). Anti-CBir1 expression and magnitude increases among patients reactive to both I2 and OmpC (60%), and increases more among those patients reactive to I2, OmpC and oligomannan (87%) (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>). These results were confirmed in Cohort 2, in which the inventors found anti-CBir1 expression in 46% (66/144) of ASCAâ, 64% (102/159) of ASCA<sup>+</sup>, and 38% (23/61) of seronegative CD patients. The frequency of anti-CBir1 expression increases as the number of positive antibody responses increases in patients with 0, 1, 2, and 3 antigens (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>, p&lt;0.001). Thus, in both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, anti-CBir1 expression is highest in sera from patients who react to all three other antigens, but is also found along with any other combination of 1, 2, or 3 antibody responses.</p>

Am J Gastroenterol 2004; 99:2376-84.). Anti-CBir1 expression appears to be independently associated with CD. Therefore, to determine whether a clinical phenotype is independently associated with anti-CBir1 expression, the serotypically- and phenotypically-defined Cohort 2 was used to assess the overall and specific phenotypes associated with anti-CBir1 expression. It was found that 61% of patients with complicated (internal penetrating, fibrostenosing disease features, and those with or without history of surgery) were anti-CBir1<sup>+</sup>, compared to 42% of patients with inflammatory-only CD (p=0.002). Anti-CBir1 expression was positively associated with small bowel disease, fibrostenosing and internal penetrating disease (see Table 3), regardless of the presence of antibodies to 1, 2, or all 3 other antigens. Unlike some of the other antibody responses, anti-CBir1 expression was neither associated with small bowel surgery, nor was it negatively associated with the UC-like CD population. To further assess the independent relationship of anti-CBir1 expression to CD phenotypes, the inventors performed a multivariate logistic regression model analysis with the four CD-associated antibodies. The results in Table 4 show that anti-CBir1 expression is independently associated with small bowel, internal penetrating and fibrostenosing disease. Consistent with this finding is the lower frequency of anti-CBir1 expression in the cohort of patients treated with infliximab (30%, <figref>FIG. 11</figref>), among whom internal penetrating and fibrostenosing disease features would not be prevalent. Thus, anti-CBir1 expression is independently associated with CD, but also selects for a specific phenotype.</p>

      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0375">While the description above refers to particular embodiments of the present invention, it should be readily apparent to people of ordinary skill in the art that a number of modifications may be made without departing from the spirit thereof. The accompanying claims are intended to cover such modifications as would fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The presently disclosed embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than the foregoing description. All changes that come within the meaning of and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00035-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00385-en" num="0376">The inventors performed a genome-wide association study testing autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the Illumina HumanHap300 Genotyping BeadChip. Based on these studies, the inventors found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes that are associated with increased or decreased risk for inflammatory bowel disease, including but not limited to CD and UC. These SNPs and haplotypes are suitable for genetic testing to identify at risk individuals and those with increased risk for complications associated with serum expression of Anti-<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>antibody, and antibodies to I2, OmpC, and Cbir. The detection of protective and risk SNPs and/or haplotypes may be used to identify at risk individuals, predict disease course and suggest the right therapy for individual patients. Additionally, the inventors have found both protective and risk allelic variants for Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis.</p>
      <p id="p-00386-en" num="0377">As disclosed herein, the inventors examined a case-control cohort consisting of 763 Crohn's Disease patients, 351 ulcerative colitis patients, and 254 control patients. The patients were genotyped using Illumina technology. SNPs were chosen to tag common Caucasian haplotypes using information from the Innate Immunity PGA.</p>
      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="2">NOD2: Serologic Analysis and Classification</heading>
      <p id="p-00387-en" num="0378">Sera were analyzed for expression of ASCA, anti-I2, anti-OmpC, in a blinded fashion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibody levels were determined and results expressed as ELISA units (EU/ml) that are relative to a Cedars-Sinai laboratory (IgA-I2, IgA-OmpC) or a Prometheus Laboratory standard (San Diego, Calif., IgA and IgG ASCA) derived from a pool of patient sera with well-characterized disease found to have reactivity to these antigens. Quantitation of IgG anti-Cbir1 reactivity was expressed in ELISA units derived based on a proportion of reactivity relative to a standardized positive control. As ASCA can be expressed in both an IgA and IgG class, positivity to ASCA was determined if either class of antibody was above the reference range. In determining a quantitative measure of ASCA, the reactivity was first log-transformed and standardized. The higher of two standardized units was then used to determine the quartile of reactivity. With the exception of determining variance (see statistical analysis), the magnitude of reactivity to the other three antigens was not standardized as each is represented by a single class of antibody. The magnitude of the serologic response to each antigen was divided into four equal quartiles in CD patients, unaffected relatives and healthy controls, evaluated as three separate cohorts, to determine quartile sum scores. <figref>FIG. 17</figref> shows the patients with the serologic response to each antigen broken down by quartiles and assigned scores of 1-4 on the basis of their designated quartile. By adding individual quartile scores for each microbial antigen, a quartile sum (QS) (range, 4-16) was derived that represents the cumulative semi-quantitative immune response toward all 4 antigens. The quartile ranking reflects the pool of individuals under study (i.e. CD patient or unaffected relative or healthy control) and is not directly comparable between groups.</p>
      <heading id="h-00037-en" level="2">NOD2: Genotyping</heading>
      <p id="p-00388-en" num="0379">Three NOD2 variants (R702W, G908R, and 1007fs), were adapted to the TaqMan MGB (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) genotyping platform.</p>
      <heading id="h-00038-en" level="2">NOD2: Statistical Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00389-en" num="0380">The inventors assessed the relationship between carriage of a NOD2, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 variant and collective sero-reactivity to microbial antigens both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively. The inventors then determined if any particular NOD2 variant was predominant and examined whether any particular antibody or combinations of antibodies was predominant in determining the relationship between NOD2 variants and sero-reactivity. The contribution of NOD2 to collective sero-reactivity was evaluated by calculating the percent of variance that could be attributed to the presence of NOD2 variants. Finally, the inventors examined whether the presence of a NOD2 variant was related to sero-reactivity to microbial antigens in unaffected relatives of CD patients and healthy controls.</p>
      <p id="p-00390-en" num="0381">To determine the significance of increasing frequency of carriage of any NOD2 variants with increasing numbers of qualitatively positive antibodies and with increasing quartile sum (range, 4-16), the Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed. To test for differences in the mean quartile sum between those individuals with no NOD2 variant versus those with any variant, the student's t-test was used since the distribution was approximately a normal distribution. One-way ANOVA analysis was done to test the linear trend of mean quartile sum among those with 0, 1, and 2 NOD2 variants. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to test for a difference in sero-reactivity associated with specific NOD2 variants and similarly when comparing mean quartile sum between differing TLR genotypes.</p>
      <p id="p-00391-en" num="0382">The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the level of seroreactivity between those individuals who carried versus those who did not carry a NOD2 variant for each antibody. To identify whether there is a significant difference in the frequency of carriage of a NOD2 variant among groups within each set with single, double and triple antibody positivity, chi-square analysis was performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0383">To determine what proportion of the variation in the sero-reactivity to microbial antigens was attributable to the presence of a NOD2 variant, a coefficient of determination (R2), defined as 1-SS (regression)/SS (total) in ANOVA was used. Sero-reactivity was defined, for this analysis, as the sum of the 4 standardized antibodies, where anti-OmpC=[log(anti-OmpC)-mean(log(anti-OmpC))]/SD(log(anti-OmpC)) and similarly for the other antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00393-en" num="0384">All analyses were performed using SAS computer software (version 8.2; SAS institute, Inc., Cary, N.C., USA, 1999).</p>
      <heading id="h-00039-en" level="2">NOD2</heading>
      <p id="p-00394-en" num="0385">As disclosed herein, the inventors studied the serologic and genetic (NOD2) characteristics of a 732 patient cohort (Table 5). ASCA is detected in 50.4%, anti-I2 in 58.1%, anti-OmpC in 37.2% and anti-Cbir1 in 56.4% (Table 5). Simple heterozygosity for a disease-predisposing NOD2 variant is detected in 194 patients (26.5%), compound heterozygosity for two NOD2 variants is detected in 23 patients (3.1%), and homozygosity for two NOD2 variants is detected in 16 patients (2.2%) (Table 5).</p>

      <p id="p-00396-en" num="0386">As disclosed herein, an example of a NOD2 genetic sequence is described as SEQ ID NO: 16. An example of a NOD2 peptide sequence is described herein as SEQ ID NO: 17. R702W, G908R, and 1007fs variant alleles are also described herein as SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, and SEQ ID NO: 20, respectively, wherein the position of the variant allele is marked within the sequence listing as a letter other than A, C, G or T.</p>
      <p id="p-00397-en" num="0387">As further disclosed herein, a Crohn's Disease patient cohort was divided into five groups based on the number of antibodies (from zero to four) for which they are qualitatively positive and the proportion of patients with NOD2 variant in each group is determined. NOD2 variants are present with increasing frequency in patients with reactivity to an increasing number of microbial antigens, especially when there is reactivity to two or more antibodies (<figref>FIG. 18</figref>). NOD2 variants are present in those with 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 positive antibodies at a frequency of 23%, 24%, 36% and 42% respectively (P for trend=0.0008) (<figref>FIG. 18</figref>). NOD2 variants are present at increasing frequency in patients with increasing cumulative semi-quantitative immune response as reflected by individual quartile sums (P for trend 0.0003) (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>). As the serologic response is increased, either qualitatively (by number of positive antibodies) or semi-quantitatively (by magnitude of the cumulative serological response), the likelihood of a patient carrying a NOD2 variant is increased (<figref>FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0388">As further disclosed herein, the inventors compared the serologic response of patients carrying a NOD2 variant to those carrying no variant. In patients carrying any NOD2 variant, the mean number of positive antibodies is higher than in those carrying no variant (2.24+/âversus 1.92+/â1.24, respectively; P=0.0008) (Table 6). Patients carrying any NOD2 variant have a higher mean quartile sum than those carrying no variant (10.60+/â3.03 versus 9.72+/â3.01, respectively; P=0.0003) (Table 6).</p>

      <p id="p-00403-en" num="0391">As further disclosed herein, the inventors divided Crohn's Disease patients into 16 mutually exclusive groups based on all possible permutations of antibody positivity: no positive antibodies, single antibody positivity (4 groups in set 1), double antibody positivity (6 groups in set 2), triple antibody positivity (4 groups in set 3), and all antibodies positive. The inventors tested whether there is a significant difference among groups within each set where the groups had the same number of antibody positivity. There is no statistically significant difference in the frequency of NOD2 variants among groups within each set, and no single antibody or combination of antibody positivity is wholly responsible for the association between sero-reactivity and variant status (<figref>FIG. 21</figref>). As disclosed herein, the inventors discovered that the relationship between NOD2 variants and serologic response to microbial antigens reflects a cumulative effect rather than being driven by any particular antibody or antibody combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0392">As further disclosed herein, the inventors calculated 2.7% as the proportion of variability in sero-reactivity that was attributable to the presence of a NOD2 variant.</p>
      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0393">As further disclosed, a quartile sum was derived in Crohn's Disease patients, unaffected relatives, and healthy controls, based on the distribution of the magnitude of sero-reactivity within each cohort, with the same quartile sum in a Crohn's Disease patient or in a relative or healthy control not representative of the same absolute magnitude of response and not directly comparable. The magnitude of serologic response is significantly lower in unaffected relatives and healthy controls, compared to cases, and generally fell within the normal range. Sera was utilized from 220 unaffected relatives of Crohn's Disease patients (92% first degree). In the unaffected relatives the mean quartile sum in those individuals carrying any NOD2 variant is higher than those carrying no variant (10.67+/â2.73 vs. 9.75+/â2.52; P=0.02) (<figref>FIG. 22</figref>). Sera was utilized from 200 healthy controls. The mean quartile sum in healthy controls carrying any NOD2 variant is higher than healthy controls carrying no variant (n=176) (10.79+/â2.95 vs. 9.69+/â2.71; P=0.07) (<figref>FIG. 23</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0394">NOD2 is a member of a family of intracellular cytosolic proteins important in mediating the host response to bacterial antigens and is found in epithelial cells of the small and large intestine as well as monocytes, macrophages, T and B cells, Paneth cells and dendritic cells (39-42). NOD2 senses MDP, a highly conserved component of bacterial peptidoglycan, which leads to the secretion of anti-bacterial substances such as alpha-defensins and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) (43-44).</p>
      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0395">The inventors examined serologic and genetic data in 748 Crohn's Disease patients. ASCA and antibodies of I2, OmpC, and Cbir were measured by ELISA. Antibody sums (AS) and overall quartile sums (QS) (ranging from 4-16) of levels for all four antibodies were calculated as previously described (Mow et al Gastro 2004; 126:414). Genotyping (TaqmanMGB) was performed for 3 CD-associated variants of the NOD2 gene, R702W, G908R, and 1007fs.</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0396">ASCA was detected in 51%, anti-I2 in 58%, anti-OmpC in 38%, and anti-Cbir1 in 56%. 250 of 748 Crohn's Disease patients (33.4%) had at least one NOD2 variant; 206 (27.5%) having one and 44 (5.9%) having two. NOD2 variants were present at increasing frequency in patients with reactivity to increasing numbers of antigens. Variants were present in those with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 positive antibodies in 24%, 25%, 36%, 36%, and 46%, respectively (p for trend, 0.0001). NOD2 variants were present at increasing frequency in patients with increasing cumulative quantitative immune response as reflected by individual QS (p for trend, 0.0001). QS were also clustered into four groups by increasing cumulative quantitative immune response (group 1=4-6, group 2=7-9, group 3=10-13, and group 4=14-16). The frequency of having at least one NOD2 variant in each of the four groups was 22%, 29%, 35%, and 49% in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p for trend, 0.0001). The mean AS (number of positive antibodies) and QS was higher for patients with at least one NOD2 variant versus those with no variant (2.28+/â1.21 and 10.70+/â2.99 vs. 1.90+/â1.23 and 9.68+/â2.97, respectively. P, 0.0001).</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0397">Individuals with Crohn's disease who have variants of the NOD2 gene as a marker of abnormal innate immunity are more likely to have an increased adaptive immune response to multiple enteric organisms. The data provides a pathophysiologic link to similar findings in rodent mucosal inflammation. This allows disease relevant crossover genetic and functional studies.</p>

      <p id="p-00410-en" num="0398">The inventors examined a case-control cohort consisting of 763 Crohn's Disease patients, 351 ulcerative colitis patients, and 254 control patients. The patients were genotyped using Illumina technology. SNPs were chosen to tag common Caucasian haplotypes using information from the Innate Immunity PGA.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0399">Both a âriskâ and a âprotectiveâ TLR8 haplotype were associated with CD in females (risk haplotype (H3): 18% of CD subjects had H3 compared with 8.9% of control subjects; protective haplotype (H2): 59% of CD subjects had H2 compared to 72% of control subjects). No significant association with TLR8 and CD in males was observed. H2 was also associated with UC in females (59% of UC females had H2 compared with 72% of controls, p=0.024) as well as males (32% of UC males had H2 compared with 47% of controls, p=0.009).</p>

      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0401">TLR8 is an X-linked IBD susceptibility gene, with common haplotypes predisposing and protecting. The associations further emphasize the importance of gene variation in innate immunity as genetic determinants, not only of CD, but of UC as well.</p>
      <heading id="h-00041-en" level="2">TLR2</heading>
      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0402">The inventors studied if the relationship between variants in innate immune receptors and sero-reactivity to microbial antigens differed in Jewish (J) versus non-Jewish (NJ) patients with CD. Sera from 731 CD patients (282 J, 449 NJ) was tested for ASCA, anti-I2, anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1 by ELISA while DNA was tested for five TLR2, two TLR4, and two TLR9 variants. The magnitude of responses to microbial antigens was examined according to variant status. Overall quartile sums (QS) (ranging from 4-16) of levels for all four antibodies were calculated as previously described (Mow et at Gastro 2004; 126:414).</p>
      <p id="p-00416-en" num="0403">There is no association between any TLR4 or 9 variant and sero-reactivity to microbial antigens in Jewish or non-Jewish patients with CD. There is an association between the non-synonymous, non-conservative P631H variant of TLR2 and ASCA positivity in Jewish patients (OR 2.75, p for interaction=0.01). There is an association between the P631H variant of TLR2 and cumulative quantitative response to microbial antigens in Jewish patients with CD. QS were clustered into four groups by increasing cumulative quantitative immune response (group 1=4-6, group 2=7-9, group 3=10-13, and group 4=14-16). The frequency of carriage of the P631H variant of TLR2 increased in parallel with QS cluster in Jewish patients; 2.86%, 3.70%, 7.02%, and 13.46% in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p for trend=0.03). No similar association is found in non-Jewish patients; 7.14%, 10.42%, 6.67%, and 5.45% in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p for trend=0.40).</p>
      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0404">Jewish, but not non-Jewish patients with CD who carry the P631H variant of TLR2 have increased sero-reactivity to microbial antigens. The data adds evidence to the paradigm that, in CD, innate immune defects lead to enhanced adaptive immune response to microbial antigens. The differential response to the same genetic variant in two different populations shows a possible gene-gene interaction consistent with the multigenic nature of CD.</p>

      <heading id="h-00043-en" level="1">Increased Immune Reactivity Predicts Aggressive Complicating Crohn's Disease in Children</heading>
      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0405">Crohn's disease (CD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by diverse clinical phenotypes (inflammatory, fibrostenosing [FS], internal penetrating [IP]) that appear to be influenced by genetic and immune factors. Children frequently manifest an aggressive disease course, and the ability to identify those at risk for complicated disease at diagnosis would be invaluable in guiding initial therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0406">The inventors examined the association of serological immune responses and CARD15 with CD phenotype in a large well-characterized pediatric collaborative cohort. Sera were collected from 797 prospectively followed pediatric CD cases and tested for immune responses to microbial antigens: anti-Cbir1 (flagellin), anti-outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC) and anti-<i>Saccharomyces</i>-<i>cerevisiae </i>(ASCA) using ELISA. Genotyping (TaqmanMGB) was performed for 3 CD-associated variants of CARD15 (SNPs 8, 12, 13). Disease phenotypes were determined blinded to genotype and immune responses. Associations between immune responses, CARD15 and clinical phenotype were evaluated.</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0407">CARD15 variants and immune responses were present in 34% and 78%, respectively. Small bowel (SB) location, IP and/or FS disease behavior were present in 68% (n=542) and 20% (n=152) of children after a median follow-up of 31 months. The odds of developing IP and/or FS disease were highest in patients positive for all 3 immune responses (Table 9). The highest level for each individual antibody was associated with IP and/or FS with the odds being highest when using the sum of all immune response levels (Table 10). Multivariate analysis confirmed the Anti-OmpC (p&lt;0.0002) and anti-Cbir1 (p=0.005) association with IP as well as ASCA (p=0.02) and anti-Cbir1 (p=0.04) with FS. CARD15 was associated with small bowel disease (OR=1.7; p&lt;0.0001) only, not with disease behavior. The rate of complicated CD increases in children as the number and magnitude of immune reactivity increases. Baseline immune response assessment may identify children at risk for complicating IP/FS phenotypes, for whom early, aggressive immunomodulatory therapy could be of benefit.</p>

      <p id="p-00423-en" num="0408">Crohn's disease (CD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by diverse clinical phenotypes. Childhood-onset CD has been described as a more aggressive phenotype. Genetic and immune factors may influence disease phenotype and clinical course. The inventors examined the association of immune responses to microbial antigens with disease behavior and prospectively determined the influence of immune reactivity on disease progression in pediatric CD patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00424-en" num="0409">Sera were collected from 196 pediatric CD cases and tested for immune responses: anti-I2, anti-outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC), anti-Cbir1 flagellin (anti-CBir1), and anti-<i>Saccharomyces</i>-<i>cerevisiae </i>(ASCA) using ELISA. Associations between Immune responses and clinical phenotype were evaluated.</p>
      <p id="p-00425-en" num="0410">Fifty-eight patients (28%) developed internal penetrating and/or stricturing (IP/S) disease after a median follow-up of 18 months. Both anti-OmpC (p&lt;0.0006) and anti-12 (p&lt;0.003) were associated with IP/S disease. The frequency of IP/S disease increased with increasing number of immune responses (p trend=0.002). The odds of developing IP/S disease were highest in patients positive for all four immune responses (OR (95% CI): 11 (1.5-80.4); p=0.03). Pediatric CD patients positive for â§1 immune response progressed to IP/S disease sooner after diagnosis as compared to those negative for all immune responses (p&lt;0.03).</p>
      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0411">The presence and magnitude of Immune responses to microbial antigens are significantly associated with more aggressive disease phenotypes among children with CO. This demonstrates that the time to develop a disease complication in children is significantly faster in the presence of immune reactivity, thereby predicting disease progression to more aggressive disease phenotypes among pediatric CD patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Immune Responses Predict Disease Progression: Patient Population</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0412">Pediatric CD patients were enrolled from participating sites of the Western Regional Pediatric IBD Research Alliance. In order to be eligible, all CD patients must have undergone complete colonoscopy with ileal intubation or complete colonoscopy and small bowel follow through. A diagnosis of CD for this study required at least two of the following: (1) history of abdominal pain, weight loss, short stature, malaise, rectal bleeding, or diarrhea; (2) characteristic endoscopic findings of discontinuous ulcerations, cobblestoning, fistula, or severe perianal disease; (3) radiologic features of stricture, fistula, or evidence of cobblestoning, or ulceration of the mucosa; (4) macroscopic appearance at laparotomy of typical bowel wall induration, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, or serosal involvement showing creeping fat, or other inflammatory changes; (5) histopathology showing transmural inflammatory cell infiltrate or epithelial granulomas and absence of identifiable infectious agents (16). Blood for serological analysis was drawn at each of the participating sites and sent via overnight FedEx to the Genotyping Core Facility of the Medical Genetics Institute/GCRC and the Immunobiology Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC). This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board at each participating site.</p>

      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0413">Subjects and their families completed patient demographic forms at the time of blood draw and physicians completed clinical information forms in reference to both date of diagnosis and date of last follow-up. Once collected, all data were then transferred and stored in a secure relational (Oracle) database for analysis. For the purpose of this study, key variables included date of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, date of last follow-up and duration of disease as of last follow-up, ethnicity, family history, disease location, disease behavior, granulomas, and surgical procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Immune Responses Predict Disease Progression: Phenotype</p>
      <p id="p-00432-en" num="0414">All phenotype assessments were performed by clinical investigators blinded to genetic and immune response analysis and based on the following uniform definitions:</p>
      <p id="p-00433-en" num="0415">Disease location at diagnosis was defined by the extent of the disease involvement at the time of initial presentation. Disease extent was based on endoscopic, histologic, and radiographic evidence of inflammation.</p>
      <p id="p-00434-en" num="0416">Disease location as of last follow-up was defined by the maximal extent of the disease involvement at the point of last follow-up or before a patient underwent first resection. Other than anal/perianal disease, location change was documented when clinically indicated investigations were performed anytime from diagnosis until the date of last follow-up. For the purpose of analysis, disease location as of last follow-up was used for all genotype/immune response-phenotype associations.</p>
      <p id="p-00435-en" num="0417">There were five disease locations that patients were categorized into (1) small bowel only: disease of the small bowel proximal to the cecum and distal to the ligament of treitz; (2) large bowel only: any colonic location between the cecum and rectum with no small bowel disease; (3) small and large bowel: disease of the small bowel and any location between the cecum and rectum; (4) upper digestive tract disease involving at least one of the following sites: esophagus, stomach. and duodenum; (5) anal: perianal and anal lesions including skin tags and anal ulcers. Patients could have been in more than one category such that patients with small and/or large bowel disease may also have concomitant upper tract and/or anal disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00436-en" num="0418">Disease behavior at diagnosis was defined by the behavior of the disease at presentation.</p>
      <p id="p-00437-en" num="0419">Disease behavior as of last follow-up was defined by the disease behavior observed as of last follow-up. At both time points, data may have been obtained after a patient underwent a surgical resection, as reliable data are often obtained at the time of surgery for defining complicated disease behaviors.</p>
      <p id="p-00438-en" num="0420">Disease behavior was divided into two broad categories: noncomplicating and complicating disease behaviors. Noncomplicating behavior referred to uncomplicated inflammatory disease without evidence of stricturing or penetrating disease behaviors (nonpenetrating nonstricturing [NPNS]). Complicating behaviors referred to penetrating and stricturing disease. (1) Stricturing disease was defined as the occurrence of constant Iuminal narrowing demonstrated by radiologic, endoscopic, or surgical examination combined with pre-stenotic dilatation and/or obstructive signs or symptoms. (2) Penetrating disease was defined as either IP if patients had evidence of entero-enteric or entero-vesicular fistulae, intraabdominal abscesses, or intestinal perforation, or perianal penetrating (PP) if patients developed either perianal fistulae or abscesses or recto-vaginal or ano-vaginal fistulae.</p>
      <p id="p-00439-en" num="0421">For the purpose of analysis, stricturing and IP complications were grouped into one outcome. PP and patients without complications (NPNS) comprised the other two comparison groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00440-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Immune Responses Predict Disease Progression: Immune Responses</p>
      <p id="p-00441-en" num="0422">All blood samples were taken at the time of consent and enrollment. Sera were analyzed for expression of ASCA, antiOmpC, anti-12, and anti-CBir1 antibodies in a blinded fashion by ELISA. Analysis and IgG and IgA ASCA were performed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center or Prometheus Laboratories using the same technology. All assays for anti-OmpC, anti-I2, and anti-CBir1 were performed at Cedars-Sinai. Antibody levels were determined and results expressed as ELISA units (EU/mL), which are relative to a Cedars-Sinai Laboratory (IgA-12, IgA-OmpC, and IgG CBir1) or a Prometheus Laboratories Standard (IgA and IgG ASCA), which is derived from a pool of patient sera with well-characterized disease found to have reactivity to this antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00442-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Immune Responses Predict Disease Progression: Statistical Analysis</p>
      <p id="p-00443-en" num="0423">To determine the associations between disease phenotype characteristics and antibody responses toward microbial antigens, univariate analyses using chi-squared tests were performed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the odds of positive serum reactivity toward the microbial antigens (CBir1,I2. OmpC. and ASCA) in the group of patients with a certain disease characteristic with the group of patients without such a characteristic. Quantitative comparison of immune response levels between groups (IP/S+vs IP/Sâ) for each antibody was performed using nonparametric Wilcoxin rank test. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression modeling was also performed to determine the primary associations among qualitative serological responses with disease phenotypes. To compare the length of time to the development of a disease complication between groups, Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probability was calculated to construct survival curves. The log-rank test was used to test if the survival curves were significantly different between subgroups of patients. All analyses were performed by using Statistical Analysis Software (Version 8.02. SAS Institute, Inc., Cary N.C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00444-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Patient Population Results</p>
      <p id="p-00445-en" num="0424">A total of 196 pediatric CD patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-five percent (168/196) were Caucasians and 28% were of Jewish background. The median age at diagnosis was 12 yr (1-18) and the median age at study was 13 yr (4-19). The cohort comprised 47% males and 53% females. A positive family history of IBD was reported in 29% of patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00446-en" num="0000">Serum Immune Responses Predict Rapid Disease Progression Among Children with Crohn's Disease: Clinical Phenotypes Results</p>
      <p id="p-00447-en" num="0425">A total of 38 (19%) patients had either a stricturing and/or penetrating complication at the time of diagnosis. After a median follow-up time (median disease duration as of last follow-up) of 18 months (1-200), the total number of pediatric CD patients who experienced a disease complication increased to 58 (30%). Table 11 details the clinical phenotypes of the pediatric CD cohort. Of the 35 patients with internal penetrating and/or stricturing (IP/S) disease, 18 had isolated stricturing disease, 11 had IP and 6 had both complications. Thirty-two of the 58 patients (55%) underwent a combined total of 53 surgeries related to disease complications, 38 (72%) of which were small bowel surgeries for IP/S disease complications. The remaining surgeries were for perianal perforating diseases. All but two patients (15/17) with IP disease and 45% of patients with isolated stricturing disease underwent small bowel surgery as of last follow-up.</p>

      <p id="p-00451-en" num="0427">Presence and magnitude of immune responses influence disease behavior. A statistically significant association was not found for any of the immune responses with family history, ethnicity, or the presence of granulomas. ASCA was the only antibody significantly associated with small bowel disease location; yet was not associated with disease behavior. Both anti-12 (p=0.0034) and anti-OmpC (p=0.0006) were associated with complicating disease behaviors, more specifically IP/S disease. The frequency of isolated perianal perforating disease was similar between immune response groups (Â±) for all four antibodies. In addition to the qualitative associations observed for anti-OmpC and anti-12, the magnitude of the immune response to OmpC and I2 also had an association with internal perforation and/or stricturing disease (p=0.008 and p=0.002 for anti-OmpC and anti-I2, respectively). The anti-OmpC association continued to be significant in the multivariate logistic regression, which showed that anti-OmpC (p&lt;0.02) was independently associated with IP/S disease. ASCA, anti-I2, and anti-Cbir1 did not show any independent association with disease behavior.</p>
      <p id="p-00452-en" num="0428">Cumulative influence of immune responses on disease behavior. Individually there is a clear association with individual immune responses I2 and OmpC with IP/S. The inventors then examined whether there was a cumulative influence of immune responses on disease behavior and determined if the odds of having complicating IP/S disease were greater in the presence of multiple immune responses. As demonstrated, the frequency of IP/S disease significantly increased (p trend=0.002) as the number of immune responses increased. The OR demonstrate that the odds of having IP/S disease was significantly increased in children positive for a combination of any three immune responses (OR [95Â° CI]; OR=5.5 [1.3-23.6]; p=0.02) and even more so in children positive for all four immune responses (OR [95% CI]; OR=11.0 [1.5-80.4]; p=0.03) as compared to those patients negative for all immune responses (baseline group).</p>

      <p id="p-00454-en" num="0429">Based on the cross-sectional data, immune responses are associated with the presence of disease complications. For the second aim of the study, the inventors set out to examine whether seropositive patients (â§1 immune response) have a greater risk to progress to IP/S as compared to seronegative patients (0 immune responses). The inventors used a longitudinal study to answer this question which included only those patients who did not have IP/S at diagnosis (NPNSÂ±PP) and continued to be uncomplicated (NPNSÂ±PP) at the time the serum was collected for immune response measurement so that we could be certain that when clinically recognizable IP/S occurred it was after the sera were collected for antibody measurement. The median time from diagnosis to serum draw was 9.2 months (0-142.3). Among those who developed IP/S (10/167) during the follow-up, the median time from diagnosis to the onset of IP/S was 48 months. As of last follow-up, 8.2% (8/97) of the seropositive group had IP/S versus only 2.9% (2./70) in the seronegative group. Because longer disease duration increases the chance of developing IP/S and not all patients are followed for the same amount of time, the inventors performed survival analysis to take the length of follow-up into consideration. The inventors first evaluated survival with OmpC, I2, and ASCA. Given the same length of follow-up, among those patients positive for at least one serology, more progressed to IP/S than those negative for the three serologies (p=0.03). Saying it differently, those patients positive for at least one serology progressed to IP/S faster than those negative for all three serologies. We then examined whether the addition of Cbir1 changed the survival outcome. Of significance is that the two patients who developed IP/S in the presumptive seronegative group, when measuring 12, OmpC, and ASCA only, were actually CBir1 positive. The inventors have fewer patients followed out long enough in those who had all four antibodies measured. Thus, when the inventors have adequate such numbers these anti-CBIR positive patients would be reclassified to the seropositive group. As of last follow-up, all seronegative patients remained complication free.</p>

      <p id="p-00456-en" num="0430">The inventors have demonstrated that immune reactivity to specific microbial antigens is associated with complicating disease behaviors. This study demonstrates that immune responses to an increasing number of microbial antigens are associated with complicating IP/S disease behaviors in pediatric CD patients. Moreover, disease progression to a more aggressive disease phenotype in children is accelerated in the presence of immune reactivity. Serum immune responses predict a more rapid disease progression from uncomplicated to complicated disease.</p>

      <p id="p-00458-en" num="0431">CARD proteins play an important role in apoptosis and cytokine regulation, including NfKB, processes which are important in the pathogenesis of IBD. CARD15/NOD2 was the first novel gene reported to confer Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility and influence disease phenotype. CARD4 has not been found to be associated with CD. McGovern et al reported a significant CD association with the CARD8/TUCAN/CARDINAL gene toured at 19q13.3 in adult patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00459-en" num="0432">The inventors investigated the association of the CARD8-T10C polymorphism with susceptibility to UC and CD in children. DNA was collected from 342 subjects (75 CD trios, 39 UC trios). Both parents and the affected child were genotyped for 3 allelic variants of the CARD15 gene (R702W. G908R, 1007insC, also referred to as SNP 8, 12 and 13) as an association control and 1 variant of the CARD gene (T10C) using Taqman technology. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to test association with either UC or CD using GENEHUNTER 2.0.</p>
      <p id="p-00460-en" num="0433">CARD8 allele T was present in 63% of CD patients and 77% of UC patients. CARD15 frequency (any variant) was 25% and 11% in CD and in UC, respectively. Similar frequencies were observed for parents for both genes. As expected, transmission distortion was seen for all CARD15 variants in CD, but not in UC. No association was observed between CARD8 and CD, however, in contrast, TDT showed a highly significant association with UC, with over transmission of the CARD8 common allele (Table 12).</p>
      <p id="p-00461-en" num="0434">This shows a CARD8 association with childhood-onset UC. The over transmission of the common allele in this analysis is similar to that which is seen with PPARgamma in type 2 diabetes and the insulin gene polymorphism in type 1 diabetes. These findings are in contrast to the adult CD association showing different mechanisms for pediatric IBD.</p>

      <p id="p-00463-en" num="0435">Approximately â of IBD patients are positive for antibodies to microbial and auto-antigens. A novel antibody, anti-Cbir1, may have unique diagnostic properties and phenotypic associations in children. The inventors examined the added utility of anti-Cbir1 in the diagnosis and differentiation of pediatric IBD patients as compared to previously defined antibodies: ASCA, OmpC, 12 and pANCA.</p>
      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0436">Sera from 331 pediatric IBD patients (111 UC, 220 CD) were tested by ELISA for anti-OmpC, anti-I2, ASCA, anti-Cbir1 and pANCA. Quantitative and qualitative expression of antibody markers was evaluated. Anti-Cbir1 was present in 55% of CD vs. 15% of UC (p&lt;0.001). 41% of anti-Cbir1 (+) UC patients were also positive for &gt;1 CD-related antibody. Anti-Cbir1 was present in 53% of ASCA(â) CD patients and in 52% (31/60) of patients negative for all antibodies. The most Cbir1 reactive CD subset was OmpC+/I2+(74% median=49) and least reactive was ASCA+(56%, median=31). 13.5% of pANCA (+) only UC patients were anti-CBir1 (+) as compared to 35% of pANCA(+) only CD patients (p=0.03). Both pANCA and anti-Cbir1 levels were higher in pANCA (+) CD vs. UC (median pANCA: 46.6 vs. 70.0: p=0.003, and median anti-Cbir1: 21 vs. 12 p&lt;0.0001).</p>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0437">Anti-Cbir1 increased detection of CD cases negative for all other antibodies. Cbir1 reactivity added to the differentiation of pANCA+ CD from pANCA+ UC and can minimize misdiagnosed CD colitis patients. Both the presence and magnitude of anti-Cbir1 reactivity adds to the clinical utility of presently known antibodies in pediatric IBD.</p>

      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0438">The inventors determined whether immune responses and/or CARD 15 variants are associated with complicated disease phenotypes and predict disease progression. Sera were collected prospectively from 796 pediatric CD cases and tested for anti-Cbir1 (flagellin), anti-outer membrane protein C (anti-OmpC), anti-<i>Saccharomyces</i>-<i>cerevisiae </i>(ASCA) and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) using ELISA. Genotyping (TaqmanMGB) was performed for 3 CARD15 variants (SNPs 8, 12, 13). Associations between immune responses (antibody sum (AS) and quartile sum score (QSS), CARD15, and clinical phenotype were evaluated.

The highest AS group and QSS group demonstrated the most rapid disease progression (p&lt;0.0001). Increased hazard ratio was observed for AS group 3 (7.8 [2.2-28.7] p&lt;0.002 and QSS group 4 (11.0 [1.5,83.0] p&lt;0.02).</p>

      <p id="p-00484-en" num="0456">To determine the associations between disease phenotype characteristics and antibody responses toward microbial antigens, univariate analyses using Ï<sup>2 </sup>tests were performed. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to compare the odds of positive serum reactivity (antibody sum, quartile sum score, quartile sum score group) towards the microbial antigens (CBir1, OmpC, and ASCA) in the group of patients with a certain disease characteristic with the group of patients without such a characteristic. For the OR calculations the minimum antibody sum of 0, the minimum quartile sum score of 3 and the minimal quartile sum score group 1 were set as baseline, i.e. OR of 1.0 Quantitative comparison of immune response levels between groups (IP/S+ vs. IP/Sâ) for each antibody was performed using non-parametric Wilcoxin Rank test. Stepwise multivariable analysis using logistic regression modeling was also performed to determine the primary associations among qualitative serological responses with disease phenotypes. To compare the length of time to the development of a disease complication between groups, Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival probability was calculated to construct survival curves. The log-rank test was used to test if the survival curves were significantly different between subgroups of patients. The hazard ratio (HR) of occurrence of complication or surgery among patients who were sera positive compared to those who were sera negative as well as who were in higher antibody sum or quartile sum group compared to those who were in baseline group were estimated from Cox's proportional hazards model and adjusted for all other covariates. All HRs were expressed as a point estimate with 95% confidence interval. Patients who only had sera data after the occurrence of complications or surgery were not included in the survival analysis. Age at diagnosis and gender were included as covariates in all the multivariable analyses. The OR/HR for age at diagnosis was explained as the times of odds/hazards increase (e.g. OR-1) per one year older at diagnosis. All analyses were performed by using Statistical Analysis Software (Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.).</p>

      <p id="p-00491-en" num="0463">Increased Immune Reactivity Predicts Aggressive Complicating Crohn's Disease in Children: Cross Sectional Analyses</p>
      <p id="p-00492-en" num="0464">Univariate analysis of immune responses and NOD2/CARD15 genotype demonstrated that NOD2/CARD15 (all variants individually or any variant) was only associated with small bowel disease location (OR [95% CI]1.9 [1.4-2.7] p&lt;0.0001) and had no association with disease behavior. ASCA was associated with small bowel disease (2.9 [2.1-4.0] P&lt;0.0001) and perianal disease (1.5 [1.1-2.2]&lt;0.02). C Bir1 was also associated with small bowel disease (1.6 [1.2-2.3] p=0.002) and OmpC had no significant association with any disease location. pANCA was associated with large bowel disease (4.0 [1.8-8.8] p&lt;0.0001). ASCA, anti-CBir1 and anti-OmpC were negatively associated with non-penetrating non stricturing disease (NPNS); in contrast all showed a positive association with complicating disease and surgery. The odds of having internal penetrating (IP), perianal penetrating (PP), stricturing (S) disease and surgery were highest in the presence of anti-OmpC. As disclosed herein, there was a cumulative influence of number of immune responses (antibody sum) as well as the magnitude of the immune response (quartile sum score group) on disease behavior. The frequency of internal penetrating, stricturing disease and surgery significantly increased (p trend&lt;0.0001) as the number of immune responses increased (antibody sum 0-3) and magnitude of immune response (quartile sum score group 1-4) increased. The odds ratios for the 3 disease behaviors and surgery associated with antibody sum and quartile sum score groups are disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00493-en" num="0465">Multivariable analysis confirmed the association of small bowel location with ASCA (OR [95% CI]:2.3 [1.6-3.2]; p&lt;0.0001), anti-CBir1 (OR 1.5 [1-1.2]; p=0.03), pANCA (OR: 0.6 [0.4-0.9]; p=&lt;0.007); and NOD2/CARD15 (OR; 1.7 [1.1-2.4]; p=0.007). Large bowel location was associated with pANCA (OR: 2.8 [1.4-5.4]; p&lt;0.004). Results of the multivariable analysis for the independent associations with disease behavior and surgery are disclosed herein. All individual antibodies were included in the model as well as a single unit change in antibody quartile sum score as a co-variable (e.g. increase in score of 3 to 4). There was a significant association seen with quartile sum score change and complicating disease behaviors as well as surgery, such that for each unit of quartile sum increase the OR increased by 1.3 for internal penetrating and stricturing disease and 1.2 for surgery. The difference between a score of the minimum 3 and the maximum score of 12 equates to an OR of 10.6 (=1.3)<sup>9 </sup>and 5.2 (=1.2)<sup>9</sup>, respectively. Quartile sum score was not independently associated with small bowel disease location as compared to the presence of the individual antibodies as noted above. These results show that disease location is associated more so with the presence of the immune responses and less so by the antibody levels, whilst disease behavior and surgery are more significantly associated with the magnitude of the immune response. Additional independent associations were found between female gender and older age at diagnosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00494-en" num="0466">Increased Immune Reactivity Predicts Aggressive Complicating Crohn's Disease in Children: Predictors of Disease Progression</p>
      <p id="p-00495-en" num="0467">The inventors' cross-sectional data demonstrate that both single and multiple immune responses are associated with the presence of disease complications and surgery. For the second aim of the study, the inventors set out to examine whether seropositive patients (1, 2, or 3 positive for ASCA, anti-OmpC and/or anti-CBir1) had a greater risk to progress to internal penetrating and/or stricturing (IP/S) disease as well as to surgery, as compared to seronegative patients (0 such immune responses). The inventors used a longitudinal study to answer this question which included only those patients who did not have IP/S or surgery at diagnosis (NPNS+/âPP) and continued to have uncomplicated disease status at the time the serum was collected for immune response measurement. Thus the inventors could be certain that in these individuals, when clinically recognizable IP/S or surgery occurred, it did so after the serum was collected. A total of 536 patients met these inclusion criteria. The median time from diagnosis to serum draw was 10 [0-211] months for the 536 patients included in the prospective analysis. A total of 90 of the entire prospective cohort of patients (n=536) developed IP/S in follow up; however 59% (53 patients) were eliminated from this analysis as they had immune responses collected after the complication occurred. Among the 37 patients who developed IP/S during the follow-up after serum was drawn, the median [range] time from diagnosis to the onset of IP/S was 26 [4-108] months. Thirty two of the 363 seropositive patients (9%) had IP/S vs. only 2.9% (5/173). in the seronegative group (p=0.01). Among the 61 patients who underwent surgery (any CD related surgery after serum was drawn) the median [range] time from diagnosis to surgery was 30 [1-105] months. Twelve percent (57/464) of the seropositive (at least one positive) patients had undergone surgery vs. only 2% (4/189) in the seronegative group (p=0.0001). Because longer disease duration increases the chance of developing IP/S as well as surgery, and not all patients were followed for the same amount of time, we performed survival analysis to take the length of follow-up into consideration. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, followed by the log-rank test for the different antibody sum and quartile sum score group comparisons, showed that overall survival times for IP/S and CD-related surgery were significantly lower for those positive for immune responses, and this was true when both the quantity of immune responses and magnitude of those responses were assessed. The first analyses examined antibody sum: 0 vs. 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 and time to development of IP and/or S as well as time to surgery. Given the same length of follow up, among those patients with antibody sum greater than 1, more progressed to IP/S than those negative for all 3 or positive for only 1 antibody (p=&lt;0.0001). In other words, those patients positive for at least 2 immune responses (antibody sum 2 or 3) progressed to IP/S faster that those negative for all or positive for only 1 antibody. The group positive for all 3 antibodies demonstrated the most rapid disease progression with a median [range] time to disease progression of 20 [4-65] months. The same rapid progression to surgery was seen among the higher antibody sum group. Like antibody sum, those patients in the highest quartile sum score group (group 4=Quartile sum score 10-12) progressed faster to IP/S and surgery and the median [range] time to IP/S and surgery was 21 [4-65] months and 27 [1-93] months, respectively. The survival curves were very similar when evaluating intestinal resection only (n=48) as compared to any CD surgery (n=61) (Log Rank: p&lt;0.0001 for the 4 antibody sum groups and p=0.001 when comparing survival among the 4 quartile sum groups). The most conservative way to evaluate the predictive abilities of immune response was to limit inclusion in the survival analysis to only patients whose serum was drawn before a complication or surgery. The inventors also performed survival analysis on all 90 patients who developed IP and/or S in follow up regardless of when serologies were drawn. For both antibody sum and quartile sum score group, the results showed a significantly higher number of patients progressing to complication faster in the face of seropositivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00496-en" num="0468">The predictive ability of immune responses for rapid progression to the first IP/S or surgical event was further evaluated by fitting Cox-proportional hazards models. OmpC (HR [95% CI]; p value) (2.4 [1.2-4.9]; p=0.01) and CBir1 (2.5 [1.2-5.2]; p&lt;0.02), but not ASCA, were associated with increased hazard of IP/S, as was older age at diagnosis (1.2 [1.1-1.3]; p=0.004). Lower hazards were observed with pANCA positivity (0.16 [0.04-0.70]; p&lt;0.02). Antibody sums 2 and 3 as well as quartile sum score groups 3 and 4 were associated with an increased hazard for developing disease complications (IP/S). Hazard Ratios for all CD related surgeries as well as for intestinal resections only were calculated controlling for both disease location and disease complication (IP, S and PP). OmpC was associated with increased hazard of any CD related surgery (2.2 [1.3-3.8;] p=0.004 or intestinal resection surgery (3.5 [1.9-6.4]; p=0.001). The Cox proportional hazard model also tested the predictive ability of antibody sum groups and quartile sum score groups for surgery. Results of any CD related surgery are disclosed herein. When examining intestinal resection surgery, an increased hazard was observed for antibody sum 3 (7.8 [2.2-28.7]; p&lt;0.002 and quartile sum score group 4 (11.0 [1.5-83.0]; p&lt;0.02).</p>

The presently disclosed embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive.</p>
      <p id="p-00526-en" num="0479">Various embodiments of the invention are described above in the Detailed Description. While these descriptions directly describe the above embodiments, it is understood that those skilled in the art may conceive modifications and/or variations to the specific embodiments shown and described herein. Any such modifications or variations that fall within the purview of this description are intended to be included therein as well. Unless specifically noted, it is the intention of the inventor that the words and phrases in the specification and claims be given the ordinary and accustomed meanings to those of ordinary skill in the applicable art(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00527-en" num="0480">The foregoing description of various embodiments of the invention known to the applicant at this time of filing the application has been presented and is intended for the purposes of illustration and description. The present description is not intended to be exhaustive nor limit the invention to the precise form disclosed and many modifications and variations are possible in the light of the above teachings. The embodiments described serve to explain the principles of the invention and its practical application and to enable others skilled in the art to utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed for carrying out the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00528-en" num="0481">While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of this invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is solely defined by the appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as âopenâ terms (e.g., the term âincludingâ should be interpreted as âincluding but not limited to,â the term âhavingâ should be interpreted as âhaving at least,â the term âincludesâ should be interpreted as âincludes but is not limited to,â etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases âat least oneâ and âone or moreâ to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles âaâ or âanâ limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases âone or moreâ or âat least oneâ and indefinite articles such as âaâ or âanâ (e.g., âaâ and/or âanâ should typically be interpreted to mean âat least oneâ or âone or moreâ); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of âtwo recitations,â without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).</p>
      <p id="p-00529-en" num="0482">Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
