    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A heart monitoring sensor having a printed circuit board with a depressed inner area, which, together with a flexible bulb extending from a perimeter for the depressed area, forms a sealed cavity. A sensor, such as a pressure sensor, is mounted within the sealed cavity. The bulb is releasably attached to the exterior of an animal near a heart pulse-detection point, and pressure changes within the cavity from the animal's heart pulse are sensed by the pressure sensor. The sensor output is provided outside the heart monitor by wired or wireless connection. In a particular embodiment, the sensor may be an active ranging sensor, and may range off of a reflective inner surface of the bulb. The active ranging sensor may be sonar, light reflective, (such as lidar), or Doppler. For a horse, the preferred location is in a natural depression underneath the horse's tail near the horse's dock.</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a left side elevation view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) installed on a horse <b>100</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Visible in this view is a wrap <b>104</b> for securing the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> to the underside of the tail <b>102</b> of the horse <b>100</b> near the horse's dock <b>106</b> to sense the pressure in the caudal vein or artery <b>108</b>. This positioning of the sensor reduces any distractions to the horse <b>100</b> as is common with neck-mounted sensors or difficulty in remaining connected, as is common with leg-mounted sensors. The uses and adaptations of the present invention are not limited to horses, which are used herein as an example, as the device can be useful with any mammal that has a heartbeat and a vein or artery near enough to the skin to allow a pulse to be detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a side elevation cross-sectional view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> discussed above in regard to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Printed circuit board (PCB) <b>202</b> has a lower, or depressed inner surface <b>212</b> that is covered by a flexible and resilient bulb <b>204</b> that extends from the PCB <b>202</b> to a point above the PCB <b>202</b> to form sealed cavity <b>206</b>. Bulb <b>204</b> may be seated and sealed on top of PCB <b>202</b>, as shown, or seated and sealed on depressed inner surface <b>212</b>: either perimeter will serve. Sealed cavity <b>206</b> contains, for example, a pressure transducer <b>208</b> that produces a signal which can be accessed at connector <b>210</b>. In exemplary operation, bulb <b>204</b> is secured against the underside of the horse's tail <b>102</b> such that pressure in the caudal vein or artery <b>108</b> compresses or releases pressure on bulb <b>204</b>, causing pressure transducer <b>208</b> to change the pressure-dependent signal it generates. The signals are processed into data elsewhere, and the data is used to evaluate the health of the horse <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In various embodiments, connector <b>210</b> may be located at various locations on the external surfaces of PCB <b>202</b>. The signal pathway through the PCB may be through an interplane connection and/or a plated though hole. In a particular embodiment, connector <b>210</b> may be omitted, and the signals may be transmitted wirelessly from inside the sealed cavity <b>206</b> using additional electronics (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). In another particular embodiment, the connector <b>210</b> may be a wireless antenna.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a top plan view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Bulb <b>204</b> is shown as transparent beyond the sealed edges. The relative size and shape of the pressure transducer <b>208</b> is not a limitation of the invention. Small size and weight is preferred for the entire heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a diagrammatic view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Additional electronics that may be mounted on the PCB <b>202</b> in addition to pressure transducer <b>208</b> include a preamplifier <b>402</b> for amplifying the signals produced by the pressure transducer <b>208</b>, a microcontroller <b>404</b> to control, for example, sampling rate and to, for further example, format signals for transmission, and a transceiver <b>406</b> for transmitting sampled signals to a data processing facility and for receiving instructions for the microcontroller <b>404</b>. The additional electronics <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b> may be mounted within the cavity <b>206</b> or on the external surface of PCB <b>202</b>. The listed additional electronics <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b> are merely exemplary and does not preclude other or additional electronics on the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a top plan view illustrating a second exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>500</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Heart monitoring sensor <b>500</b> illustrates that the shape of heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> is not a limitation of the invention. The oval heart monitoring sensor <b>500</b> uses a PCB <b>502</b> with a lowered, or depresses, inner surface <b>512</b> that is covered by bulb <b>504</b> to make a sealed cavity over pressure transducer <b>208</b>. Connector <b>410</b> has the same scope as with heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b>. A cross section AAâ² would look like <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, except for the placement of connector <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a side elevation view illustrating the exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the tail <b>102</b> has a natural depression <b>602</b> on the underside of the tail <b>102</b> and shaping the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> or <b>500</b> to fit conformally in this depression is preferred. In some embodiments, a conformal shape designed to fit horses <b>100</b> generally is within the scope of the present invention. In another embodiment, the shape may be customized to fit a particular horse <b>100</b> or other creature. Various sizes, adapted to various sizes or breeds of horses, are also within the scope of the invention, as a heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> for a Clydesdale may not be a good fit for an American Quarter Horse. Once emplaced in the depression <b>602</b>, the heart monitoring sensor <b>200</b> or <b>500</b> may be secured by wrap <b>104</b>, or similarly effective means.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a side elevation view illustrating another exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>700</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In yet another embodiment, the heart monitoring sensor may be optical or sonic and may use or omit the bulb <b>204</b>. In this illustrated optical embodiment, an optical sensor (transceiver <b>708</b>) measures pressure changes as the changes over time in the range from transceiver <b>706</b> to the surface of the horse <b>100</b> in cavity <b>602</b>. The frequency of the output signal <b>702</b> and the reflected signal <b>704</b> is naturally much higher than the frequency of the pulse of horse <b>100</b>. Consequently, good resolution of the pulse rate may be obtained. In a particular embodiment, the Doppler signature of the pulse may be exploited for remote vibration sensing.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a side elevation view illustrating yet another exemplary embodiment of the heart monitoring sensor <b>800</b>, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In this illustrated optical embodiment, a transparent membrane <b>802</b> may be used over cavity <b>804</b> to prevent contamination of the transceiver <b>708</b>. Membrane <b>802</b> may be rigid or flexible.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In yet another optical embodiment, the bulb <b>204</b> is used with an additional reflective surface on the underside of the bulb <b>204</b>. The distance between transceiver <b>708</b> and the underside of bulb <b>204</b> is repeatedly measured over time to determine the pulse rate. Again, the Doppler signature of the horse pulse may be exploited for remote vibration sensing.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In sonic embodiments, similar to the optic embodiment of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the collection of data regarding range changes over time are found by sound ranging. Preferably, the frequency of the air vibrations are above 25 KHz, to prevent distracting the horse <b>100</b> or the rider. As with the optical embodiments, the frequency of the sound is high compared to the frequency of a horse's pulse, and so good resolution can be obtained. The Doppler signature of the horse pulse may be exploited for remote vibration sensing. Sound ranging to the underside of the bulb <b>204</b> is also within the scope of the present invention, and has the advantage of reducing the risk of contamination of the transceiver.</p>
