    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a coating method and a coated article. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a method for applying a coating and a coated article wherein the coating includes at least one bond coating layer and at least one oxide coating layer.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Gas turbine and steam turbine components, particularly rear stage gas turbine compressor blades, rear stage gas turbine compressor stators, steam turbine high pressure buckets, steam turbine intermediate pressure buckets and steam turbine casings, are subjected to conditions that may cause corrosion, oxidation, deposition and/or erosion during service exposure.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The components may be formed from a variety of materials, including compositions such as, by weight percent: less than about 0.07% carbon, less than about 1.00% manganese, less than about 0.04% phosphorus, less than about 0.03% sulfur, less than about 1.0% sulfur, about 15.0% to about 17.5% chromium, about 3.0% to about 5.0% nickel, about 3.0% to about 5.0% copper, and about 0.15% to about 0.45% columbium and tantalum combined, balance iron (e.g., 17-4PH stainless steel available from AK Steel); less than about 0.05% carbon, about 14% to about 16% chromium, about 1.25% to about 1.75% carbon, less than about 1% manganese, about 0.5% to about 1% molybdenum, about 5% to about 7% nickel, less than about 0.03% phosphorous, less than about 1% silicon, less than about 0.03% sulfur, niobium present at least about 8 times the amount of carbon present, balance iron (e.g., stainless steel alloy 450); and about 0.13% to about 0.18% carbon, less than about 0.50% silicon, about 0.4% to about 0.6% manganese, less than about 0.025% phosphorous, less than about 0.01% silicon, less than about 13.0% chromium, less than about 0.2% molybdenum, less than about 0.6% nickel, about 0.15% to about 0.25% niobium, less than about 0.1% vanadium, less than about 0.005% lead, less than about 0.05% tin, less than about 0.05% aluminum, balance iron (e.g., stainless steel alloy 403Cb(ESR), available from Gloria Material Technology Corporation).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Operating conditions may result in undesirable increases in surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). For example, field data from exposed surfaces of known components have shown an observed surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) ranging from 40 to 160 micro inches under operating conditions. This observed surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) generally exceeds the recognized standard of a surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of 25 microinches or less for good aerodynamic performance.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Under operating conditions, particles are present which are believed to stem from upstream carbon steel and cast iron parts in the fluid path of the turbine. Water wash cycles are often performed to remove the particulates. However, the water wash cycles expose the components to increased amounts of moisture, and may further utilize chemicals, that may increase the surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of the components.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Undesirable increases in surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>), may decrease the efficiency of the turbine. Coated components and methods of coating components that do not suffer from one or more of the above drawbacks would be desirable in the art.</p>

    <heading id="h-00005-en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Provided are a coating method and a coated article. Embodiments of the present disclosure, in comparison to methods and articles not using one or more of the features disclosed herein, decrease component corrosion, decrease component oxidation, decrease component fouling, decrease component erosion, decrease the rate at which the surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of a component increases, decrease maintenance costs, increase efficiency, or a combination thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, a coated article 100 is depicted. The coated article 100 is a gas turbine compressor blade 102 (shown), a gas turbine compressor stator, a turbine high pressure bucket, a turbine intermediate pressure bucket, a turbine casing, or any other suitable component, or a combination thereof. The coated article 100 is a portion of any suitable system, for example, a power generation system or a turbine engine system.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, the coated article 100 includes a substrate 202 defining a substrate surface 204 having a substrate surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>), and a coating 206 on the substrate surface 204. The coating 206 includes at least one bond coating layer 208 and at least one oxide coating layer 212. The bond coating layer 208 defines a bond coating surface 210 having a bond coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). The at least one oxide coating layer 212 is applied to the bond coating surface 210. The at least one oxide coating layer 212 defines an oxide coating surface 214 having an oxide coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). The oxide coating layer 212 is more resistive to increasing the oxide coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) than either the bond coating layer 208 is resistive to increasing the bond coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) or the substrate 202 is resistive to increasing the substrate surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). Resistivity to increasing surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) is a material property representing the rate of a surface becoming roughened, for example due to corrosion, oxidation, deposition and/or erosion as a result of the operating conditions of a gas turbine.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In one embodiment, the roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) of the oxide coating surface 214 is less than about 0.64 µm (25 µin), alternatively between about 0.13 µm (5 µin) to about 0.64 µm (25 µin), alternatively between about 0.38 µm (15 µin) to about 0.64 µm (25 µin), alternatively between about 0.25 µm (10 µin) to about 0.51 µm (20 µin), alternatively between about 0.13 µm (5 µin) to about 0.38 µm (15 µin).</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In one embodiment, the at least one bond coating layer 208 is a sacrificial coating and is anodic with respect to the substrate 202. In a further embodiment, the at least one bond coating layer 208 includes a mixture of Ni<sub>80%</sub>Al<sub>20%</sub> (wt%) and Ni<sub>95%</sub>Al<sub>5%</sub> (wt%), cobalt and aluminum particles in a chromate/phosphate binder, a sacrificial metallic undercoat with a ceramic overcoat, a metallurgically bonded aluminide with an aluminum surface layer, a chemically bonded aluminide with an aluminum surface layer, a mechanically bonded aluminide with an aluminum surface layer, or a combination thereof. The at least one bond coating layer 208 is operative to protect the substrate surface 204 from corrosion during downtime, which may occur in peaking machines or even in base loaded machines.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In one embodiment, the at least one oxide coating layer 212 includes at least one oxide prevention phase, at least one deposit prevention phase, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the at least one oxide prevention phase includes alumina, a mixture of alumina and between about 3% to about 30% by weight titania, zirconia, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the at least one deposit prevention phase includes ceria, cerium-zirconium oxide, barium-cerium oxide, or a combination thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In one embodiment, the method of forming the coating 206 includes providing the substrate 202 having the substrate surface 204, forming the at least one bond coating layer 208 on the substrate surface 204, and forming the at least one oxide coating layer 212 on the bond coating surface 210. Forming the at least one bond coating layer 208 on the substrate surface 204, and forming the at least one oxide coating layer 212 on the bond coating surface 210 may be accomplished by any suitable coating techniques, such as, but not limited to, thermal spray, sol-gel, slurry coating or a combination thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In an alternate embodiment, the method of forming the coating 206 further includes at least one of grinding and polishing the oxide coating surface 214 with a fine slurry to reduce the oxide coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). Grinding or polishing of the oxide coating surface 214 may be accomplished using any suitable techniques, such as, but not limited to, a tumbling based mass finishing technique. The fine slurry may include particles of cubic boron nitride, diamond, silicon carbide, pumice stone, or combinations thereof. The particle size in the fine slurry is generally less than about five microns.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment, the at least one oxide layer 212 includes at least one oxide prevention phase 302 and at least one deposit prevention phase 304.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In one embodiment, the at least one oxide prevention phase 302 is operative to provide greater resistance to increases in the oxide coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) caused by oxidation than either the bond coating layer 208 would provide to increases in the bond coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) or the substrate 202 would provide to increases in the substrate surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). In another embodiment, the at least one oxide prevention phase 302 includes alumina, a mixture of alumina and between about 3% to about 30% by weight titania, zirconia, or a combination thereof. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that because the oxide prevention phase 302 includes materials which are oxides, these materials will not undergo further oxidation.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In one embodiment, the at least one deposit prevention phase 304 is operative to provide greater resistance to increases in the oxide coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) caused by deposition than either the bond coating layer 208 would provide to increases in the bond coating surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>) or the substrate 202 would provide to increases in the substrate surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>). In another embodiment, the at least one deposit prevention phase 304 includes ceria, cerium-zirconium oxide, barium-cerium oxide, or a combination thereof. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the stoichiometry of the at least one deposit prevention phase 304 renders the oxide coating surface 214 somewhat electrostatically positive, thereby reducing the tendency of the oxide coating surface 214 to attract carbonaceous deposits. Also without being bound by theory, it is further believed that rare earth modified oxides tend to have oxygen vacancies resulting in surfaces which are oxygen deficient, and polar molecules are less likely to adsorb onto such oxygen deficient surfaces which are as a result considered to be anti-stick surfaces.</p>

In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
