      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to agricultural vehicles with residue spreaders. More particularly the invention relates to sensing systems for determining a distribution of residue from the residue spreader.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Agricultural vehicles such as agricultural harvesters sever crop plants from the ground, gather the severed crop plants together, separate the grain in the crop plants from the remainder of the plant (âmaterial other than grainâ or MOG), chop the MOG, and then spread the MOG over the ground to evenly cover the ground from which the MOG was gathered.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">An agricultural harvester harvests crop using a harvesting head supported on the front of the vehicle. The harvesting head may be 10 or 15 m wide. The chopped MOG typically leaves the agricultural harvester through a 1 to 2 m wide channel at the rear of the agricultural harvester. Immediately after it leaves the chute, it must be spread considerably to cover the 10 or 15 m wide swathe of ground harvested by the harvesting head.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">This even spreading of the MOG is not easy. The MOG may be light or heavy. It may be blown easily by the wind or fall quickly to the ground. If the wind is blowing strongly across the path of the agricultural harvester, the entire swath of MOG may be shifted to the left or to the right. This will leave uncovered some regions of the field due to poor distribution of the MOG.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In order to improve the distribution of MOG, sensing means have been suggested to sense the distribution of MOG at the rear the machine. With this knowledge, the operator can manually (or automatically) adjust the angle of the steering members that steer the MOG leaving the agricultural harvester.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One of these sensing means is a digital camera disposed at the rear of the agricultural harvester to picture the swath of MOG as it leaves the agricultural harvester and spreads out to cover the ground. The operator can look at this camera image in the operator cabin and determine whether the MOG is being properly steered. With this information, the operator can adjust (either manually or automatically) the steering members.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Another of these sensing means is a wind vane and/or wind velocity sensor. Typically these sensors are disposed on top of the agricultural harvester. The sensor data provides the operator with an indirect measurement of how well his MOG is being spread. With this information, the operator can adjust (either manually or automatically) the steering members.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">These sensing means are less than ideal.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is often difficult to tell what is in an image. This can lead an operator to over- or under-correct when he adjusts the MOG steering members.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Furthermore, a strong wind may have a large effect in steering the MOG leaving the agricultural harvester in certain crops and little or no effect in others. Thus, the wind speed and wind direction alone may not be enough to determine the actual distribution of MOG behind the agricultural harvester.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">What is needed, therefore, is a better way of determining the lateral distribution of the MOG behind the agricultural harvester. It is an object of this invention to provide such a system.</p>

      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, an agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, here shown as a combine, comprises a chassis <b>102</b> that is supported on wheels <b>104</b> to be driven over the ground and harvest crops. A feederhouse <b>106</b> extends from the front of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. An agricultural harvesting head <b>108</b> is supported on the front of the feederhouse <b>106</b>. When the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> operates, it carries the feederhouse <b>106</b> through the field harvesting crops. The feederhouse <b>106</b> conveys crop gathered by the agricultural harvesting head <b>108</b> rearward and into the body of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. Inside the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, the crop is threshed, separated, and cleaned by mechanisms <b>109</b>. The now-clean grain falls downward into an auger trough <b>110</b>. An auger <b>112</b> disposed in the auger trough <b>110</b> carries the material to the right side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> and deposits the grain in the lower end of a grain elevator <b>114</b>. The grain lifted by the vertical grain elevator <b>114</b> is carried upward until it reaches the upper exit of the grain elevator <b>114</b>. The grain is then released from the grain elevator <b>114</b> and falls into a grain tank <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The agricultural harvester <b>100</b> is periodically unloaded by pivoting an unloading auger <b>118</b> away from the side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, and conveying the grain into a grain cart or grain wagon (not shown) traveling alongside the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. After the MOG is separated from the grain, it falls into a conduit <b>120</b> which steers the MOG rearward and into a chopper <b>122</b>. The chopper chops and accelerates the MOG, and blows the chopped MOG rearward into several MOG steering members <b>124</b> (here shown as steering vanes). The steering members spread the MOG laterally (e.g. to the left and to the right) as it is ejected from the rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. The MOG then falls on the ground and covers the swath just harvested by the agricultural harvesting head <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, steering members <b>124</b> are supported for pivoting movement from the rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. The steering members <b>124</b> can be pivoted to the left and to the right to selectively steer the MOG exiting the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. An actuator <b>202</b> is coupled to the steering members <b>124</b> to steer them. The actuator <b>202</b> may be, for example, a rotary actuator or linear actuator. It may be, for example, an electric actuator or a hydraulic actuator.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">A first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> is coupled to the left rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> in a position to view the MOG leaving the left rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. A second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> is coupled to the right rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> in a position to view the MOG leaving the right rear of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> is positioned to the left of the steering members <b>124</b>. The second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> is positioned to the right of the steering members <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a MOG sensing system <b>300</b> comprises the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> and the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> coupled to an electronic control unit (ECU) <b>302</b>. The ECU <b>302</b> comprises an ALU and a memory circuit. The memory circuit includes digital instructions that are executed by the ALU and control the ECU <b>302</b>. The ECU <b>302</b> also comprises signal conditioning circuits configured to receive the signals from the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> and the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> and condition the signals. The ECU <b>302</b> also comprises a driver circuit configured to convert commands from the ALU into a form and at a level that can be applied to the actuator <b>202</b> sufficient to move the actuator <b>202</b> and the steering members <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, an ECU <b>302</b> is shown. In other arrangements, a plurality of ECUs <b>302</b> can be used in place of the single ECU <b>302</b>. The ECUs comprising this plurality of ECUs <b>302</b> can be connected to one another in a communications network (e.g. in a CAN bus arrangement). Further, any of the sensors described herein can be connected to any of the plurality of ECUs <b>302</b>. Further, all the ECUs <b>302</b> can be connected in the communication network to share any sensor or actuator information with any other ECU <b>302</b>. Further, each ECU <b>302</b> of the plurality of ECUs can be programmed to provide one, more than one, or all of the ECU functions described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the steps performed by the MOG sensing system <b>300</b>. These steps are stored in the memory circuit of the ECU <b>302</b> as a series of programmed instructions. In the case of a multiple ECUs system, some of these steps can be performed by one ECU <b>302</b> and others of these steps can be performed by another ECU <b>302</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In step <b>400</b>, the process starts.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In step <b>402</b>, the ECU <b>302</b> reads a signal from the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In operation, the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> emits an ultrasonic signal. This ultrasonic signal is directed toward and travels outward into the cloud of MOG flying through the air on the left side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>. A portion of the ultrasonic signal is reflected back to the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> by the cloud of MOG. The magnitude of this portion depends upon the thickness and/or density of the cloud of MOG. The greater the thickness and/or density of the cloud of MOG, the greater the magnitude of the reflected portion. First ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> is configured to receive this reflected portion and convert it into a computer readable form. Hence, the signal produced by the first ultrasonic sensor and transmitted to the ECU <b>302</b> is indicative of the thickness and/or density of the cloud of MOG on the left side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In step <b>404</b>, the ECU <b>302</b> reads a signal from the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b>. The second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> is constructed the same as the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b>, and therefore produces a signal that it transmits to the ECU <b>302</b> that is indicative of the thickness and/or density of the cloud of MOG on the right side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">If the MOG leaving the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> is being spread evenly across the ground behind the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, the signal transmitted by the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> to the ECU <b>302</b> and the signal transmitted by the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> to the ECU <b>302</b> will be the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">If more of the MOG is being spread on the left side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, then the signal transmitted by the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> to the ECU <b>302</b> will be greater than the signal transmitted by the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> to the ECU <b>302</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Likewise, if more of the MOG is being spread on the right side of the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>, then the signal transmitted by the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> to the ECU <b>302</b> will be smaller than the signal transmitted by the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> to the ECU <b>302</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In step <b>406</b>, the ECU <b>302</b> compares the signals from the first ultrasonic sensor <b>204</b> in the second ultrasonic sensor <b>206</b> and determines, based upon this comparison, whether the MOG is spread more to the right or more to the left behind the agricultural harvester <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In step <b>408</b>, the ECU <b>302</b> calculates a signal to be applied to the actuator <b>202</b> based upon the comparison performed in step <b>406</b>. The signal is calculated to direct the flow of MOG leaving the agricultural harvester <b>100</b> to spread more evenly across the swath harvested by the agricultural harvesting head <b>108</b>. Thus, if the ultrasonic sensors indicate that too much MOG is going to the left, the ECU <b>302</b> signals the actuator to steer the MOG more to the right. Likewise, if the ultrasonic sensors indicate that too much MOG is going to the right, the ECU <b>302</b> signals the actuator to steer the MOG more to the left. In another arrangement, the ECU <b>302</b> calculates a signal to be applied to the actuator <b>202</b> based upon the comparison performed in step <b>406</b> to achieve an unequal distribution of the MOG on the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In step <b>410</b>, the process stops.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The ECU <b>302</b> is configured to automatically and repeatedly execute the process of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> at regular intervals. The intervals (i.e. the time between each execution of the process of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) may be from a few milliseconds to a few minutes long.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The Figures herein illustrate one embodiment of the invention. The invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment, however. To one skilled in the art of agricultural vehicle design and operation, other embodiments of the invention are also possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">For example, rather than the vanes shown herein, vanes can be provided on the rotors of spreading fans such as those shown in US2013263565, US2010120482, and US2014066148, (which are all incorporated herein by reference for all that they teach). In this arrangement, rather than (as illustrated herein) turning vanes to the left or the right to direct MOG flow more to the left or more to the right, the ECU <b>302</b> can be coupled to and drive the spreading fan motors to accelerate the left side spreading fan (and its vanes) and/or decelerate the right side spreading fan (and its vanes) to spread crop more to the left; or alternatively accelerate the right side spreading fan (and its vanes) and/or decelerate the left side spreading fan (and hence its vanes) to spread crop more to the right. In this example, the spreading fan motors constitute the actuator <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As another example, a plurality of choppers may be provided, such as the two choppers shown in US2014/0031096, which is incorporated herein by reference for all that it teaches. In this arrangement, the chopper blades function is vanes to steer and direct the crop laterally outward away from the agricultural harvester. The ECU <b>302</b> in this arrangement can be coupled to the chopper motors to vary the relative speeds of the motors and therefore the relative distribution of MOG to the left and to the right. The chopper motors in this arrangement collectively constitute the actuator <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As another example, multiple actuators <b>202</b> can be provided to control one or more individual vanes. In this manner, one or more vanes on one side of the agricultural harvester can be steered by the ECU <b>302</b> independently of vanes on the other side of the agricultural harvester.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As another example, the ECU <b>302</b> may be programmed to achieve an unequal distribution of MOG on the ground behind the agricultural harvester such that more MOG is distributed on one side of the agricultural harvester that is spread on the other side of the agricultural harvester. In this case, the ECU <b>302</b> would be programmed to compare the signals from the first and second ultrasonic sensors and to maintain a nonzero difference between the signals. This nonzero difference between the signals would result in more MOG being spread on one side of the agricultural harvester than is spread on the other side of the agricultural harvester.</p>
