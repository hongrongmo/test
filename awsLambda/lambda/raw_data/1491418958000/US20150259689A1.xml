    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The present invention related to miR145, miR132, miR212, and the genes or gene products regulated by these miRNAs. miR145 is downregulated in cells infected with HCMV. This downregulation modulates expression of miR145 target genes, including IRS-1. Transfection of cells with a miR145 agent, such as a miR145 mimetic, reduces HCMV replication and protein expression. miR132 and miR212 are upregulated in cells infected with HCMV. This upregulation modulates expression of miR132 and miR212 target genes, including MeCP2 and RICS. Transfection of cells with a miR132 and/or a miR212 antagonist reduces HCMV replication and protein expression. Accordingly, the invention provides methods of attenuating HCMV replication by modulating, for example, miR145, miR132, and/or miR212, and targets thereof. Also provided are methods of detecting an HCMV infection, and compositions and kits useful for attenuating HCMV replication.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">RNAs that do not function as messenger RNAs, transfer RNAs or ribosomal RNAs are collectively termed non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs can range in size from 21-25 nucleotides (nt) up to &gt;10,000 nt, and estimates for the number of ncRNAs per genome range from hundreds to thousands. The functions of ncRNAs, although just beginning to be revealed, appear to vary widely from the purely structural to the purely regulatory, and include effects on transcription, translation, mRNA stability and chromatin structure (G. Storz, <i>Science </i>(2002) 296:1260-1262). Two recent pivotal discoveries have placed ncRNAs in the spotlight: the identification of large numbers of very small ncRNAs of 20-24 nucleotides in length, termed micro RNAs (miRNAs), and the relationship of these miRNAs to intermediates in a eukaryotic RNA silencing mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">RNA silencing refers to a group of sequence-specific, RNA-targeted gene-silencing mechanisms common to animals, plants, and some fungi, wherein RNA is used to target and destroy homologous mRNA, viral RNA, or other RNAs. RNA silencing was first observed in plants, where it was termed posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS). A similar phenomenon observed in Fungi was termed quelling. These phenomena were subsequently found to be related to a process in animals called RNA interference (RNAi). In RNAi, experimentally introduced double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) leads to loss of expression of the corresponding cellular gene. A key step in the molecular mechanism of RNAi is the processing of dsRNA by the ribonuclease Dicer into short dsRNAs, called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), of Ë21-23 nt in length having specific features including 2 nt 3â²-overhangs, a 5â²-phosphate group and 3â²-hydroxyl group. siRNAs are incorporated into a large nucleoprotein complex called an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). A distinct ribonuclease component of RISC uses the sequence encoded by the antisense strand of the siRNA as a guide to find and then cleave mRNAs of complementary sequence. The cleaved mRNA is ultimately degraded by cellular exonucleases. Thus, in PTGS, quelling, and RNAi, the silenced gene is transcribed normally into mRNA, but the mRNA is destroyed as quickly as it is made. In plants, it appears that PTGS evolved as a defense strategy against viral pathogens and transposons. While the introduction of long dsRNAs into plants and invertebrates initiates specific gene silencing (Hannon, 2002; Hutvagner, 2002), in mammalian cells, long dsRNA can induce the potent translational inhibitory effects of the interferon response (Samuel, 2001). Short dsRNAs of &lt;30 bp, however, evade the interferon response and are successfully incorporated into RISC to induce RNAi (Zamore et al., Cell, 101(1):25-33 (2000); Elbashir, 2001).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Another group of small ncRNAs, called micro RNAs (miRNAs), are related to the intermediates in RNAi and appear to be conserved from flies to humans (Lau, 2001; Lagos-Quintana, 2001; Rhoades, 2002). To date, all metazoans examined have been found to encode miRNAs. MicroRNAs are initially transcribed as a long, single-stranded miRNA precursor known as a pri-miRNA, which may contain one or several miRNAs, and these transcripts are then processed to Ë70 nt pre-miRNAs having a predicted stem-loop structure. The enzyme Dicer cleaves pre-miRNA to produce Ë20-25 nt miRNAs that function as single-stranded RNAi mediators capable of directing gene silencing (Hutvagner, 2002; McManus, 2002). These small transcripts have been proposed to play a role in development, apparently by suppressing target genes to which they have some degree of complementarity. The canonical miRNAs lin-4 and let-7 influence gene expression by binding to sequences of partial complementarity in the 3â² UTR of mRNA, thereby preventing mRNA translation (McCaffrey, 2002). In recent studies, however, miRNAs bearing perfect complementarity to a target RNA could function analogously to siRNAs, specifically directing degradation of the target sequences (Hutvagner, 2002b; Llave, 2002). Thus, the degree of complementarity between an miRNA and its target may determine whether the miRNA acts as a translational repressor or as a guide to induce mRNA cleavage. The discovery of miRNAs as endogenous small regulatory ncRNAs may represent the tip of an iceberg, as other groups of regulatory ncRNAs likely remain to be discovered.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Numerous recent studies have highlighted the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression. miRNAs can âfine-tuneâ gene expression by binding to nearly perfect complementary sequences in mRNAs, thus preventing their translation. The importance of miRNAs in the regulation of specific genes has been demonstrated in a variety of organisms, where their function impacts such universal cellular pathways as cell death, development, proliferation, and hematopoiesis (Ambros, 2004). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that several animal viruses encode their own miRNAs, which target either cellular or viral mRNAs (Cullen, 2006; Nair, 2006; Sarnow, 2006). Recent studies have further underscored the critical role of miRNAs in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis by demonstrating that miRNAs are misregulated in various forms of cancer. Furthermore, specific tumor types have been found to have specific patterns of miRNA expression, or âmiRNA signaturesâ (Calin, 2006; Calin, 2002; Volinia, 2006; Yanaihara, 2006).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The discovery of particular miRNAs that display altered patterns of expression during other disease conditions would help elucidate the role of specific cellular miRNAs and their corresponding target genes is pathogenesis. Such miRNAs could be used, for example, as therapeutic and diagnostic targets.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The present invention is based in part on the discovery that miR145 is significantly downregulated during HCMV infection, and miR132 and miR212 are significantly upregulated during HCMV infection. The instant inventors further discovered that transfection of fibroblasts with a miR145 mimic prior to HCMV infection reduced HCMV replication, and likewise reduced expression of the HCMV proteins Immediate Early 2 (IE-2), the Early (E) protein pp65, and the Late (L) protein gB55. In addition, transfection of fibroblasts with a miR132 antagonist and/or a miR212 antagonist prior to HCMV infection reduced HCMV replication, and reduced expression of the HCMV proteins Immediate Early 2 (IE-2), the Early (E) protein pp65, and the Late (L) protein gB55. This discovery implicates miR145, miR132, and miR212 during HCMV IE, E, and L gene expression, indicating that the foregoing microRNAs have a role in HCMV pathogenesis and replication. HCMV infection was shown to upregulate the miR145 target molecule Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) in fibroblasts, and to alter IRS-1 localization, implicating downstream targets of miR145 in HCMV pathogenesis. HCMV infection was also shown to downregulate the miR132 and miR212 target molecule MeCP2 in fibroblasts, implicating downstream targets of miR132 and miR212 in HCMV pathogenesis. These findings indicate that miR145, miR132, and miR212 are important cellular mediator of HCMV infection. Misregulation of these miRNAs by HCMV also indicates that the cellular or viral targets of these miRNAs will likewise be aberrantly regulated during infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The concept that HCMV specifically modifies cellular miR145, miR132, and miR212 expression represents a hitherto unidentified mechanism by which HCMV produces an environment conducive to infection. The finding that disruption of miR145 downregulation, and/or miR132 or miR212 upregulation, results in attenuation of viral infection thus provides novel anti-viral approaches.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Cellular and/or viral genes or gene products whose expression is altered as a consequence of miR145 downregulation following HCMV infection make attractive targets for novel therapeutic anti-viral strategies. Such strategies include, for example, administration of a compound that increases or mimics expression of miR145. Such a compound may include, for example, an expression vector, a recombinant miRNA, or a miRNA mimic Likewise, cellular and/or viral genes or gene products whose expression is altered as a consequence of miR132 or miR212 upregulation following HCMV infection make attractive targets for novel therapeutic anti-viral strategies. Such strategies include, for example, administration of a compound that antagonizes or reduces expression of miR132 and/or miR212. Such a compound may include, for example, an antisense miR132 LNA, an antisense miR212 LNA, an antagomir, a 2â²O-methyl antisense miR132 RNA, or a 2â²O-methyl antisense miR212 RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As the genes or gene products targeted by miR145 are expressed at elevated levels in HCMV infected cells due to the HCMV-mediated reduction in expression of miR145, such anti-viral strategies also include, for example, administration of a compound that inhibits or reduces expression of a gene or gene product that is targeted by miR145. Such a compound may include, for example, an siRNA, an miRNA, a shRNA, an antisense nucleic acid molecule, or a ribozyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">As the genes or gene products targeted by miR132 and/or miR212 are expressed at reduced levels in HCMV infected cells due to the HCMV-mediated increase in expression of miR132 and miR212, such anti-viral strategies also include, for example, administration of a compound that increases, upregulates, or mimics expression of a gene or gene product that is targeted by miR132 or miR212. Such a compound may include, for example, an expression vector encoding a miR132 target or a miR212 target, an RNA transcript encoding a miR132 target or a miR212 target, a miR132 target polypeptide, a miR212 target polypeptide, a recombinant miR132 target polypeptide, a recombinant miR212 target polypeptide, or an active domain thereof.</p>

In exemplary embodiments, a miR145 target is a component of an HCMV replication pathway, e.g., a signaling pathway, that, when altered, modulates HCMV replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The term âmiR132 target,â as used herein, refers to a gene, gene transcript, or gene product (e.g., a polypeptide) whose expression is altered (e.g., downregulated) by miR132. miR132 may alter the expression of a miR132 target by interacting with an RNA transcript, and preventing translation of a polypeptide encoded by the RNA transcript. miR132 may alternatively alter the expression of a miR132 target by interacting with an RNA transcript, and directing degradation or destabilization of the RNA transcript. miR132 targets can be identified based on having a region of sequence complementarity to a portion of miR132.

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">A miRNA seed, as used herein, refers to a region of about 6-8 contiguous nucleotides (e.g., 5-9, preferably 6-8 contiguous nucleotides) in a miRNA having perfect or near perfect complementarity with about 6-8 contiguous nucleotides in a target RNA. In a preferred embodiment, a miRNA seed encompasses about nucleotides 2-7 (e.g., nucleotides 3-8, nucleotides 1-6, preferably nucleotides 2-7) of a mature miRNA sequence. In exemplary embodiments, a miRNA seed has perfect complementarity with about 6-8 contiguous nucleotides in the 3â²UTR of a target RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The term âRNA silencing,â as used herein, refers generally to a sequence-specific or selective process by which a target molecule (e.g., a target gene, protein or RNA) is downregulated. In some embodiments, the process of RNA silencing features post-transcriptional repression of RNA translation triggered by an RNA silencing agent (e.g., a miRNA). In other embodiments, the process of RNA silencing includes âRNA interferenceâ or âRNAi,â which features degradation of RNA molecules, e.g., RNA molecules within a cell, said degradation being triggered by an RNA silencing agent (e.g., a siRNA). Degradation is catalyzed by an enzymatic, RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RNAi occurs in cells naturally to remove foreign RNAs (e.g., viral RNAs). Natural RNAi proceeds via fragments cleaved from free dsRNA which direct the degradative mechanism to other similar RNA sequences. Alternatively, RNAi can be initiated by the hand of man, for example, to silence the expression of target genes.</p>

A RNA silencing agent having a âsequence sufficiently complementary to a target RNA sequence to direct RNA silencingâ means that the RNA silencing agent has a sequence sufficient to repress translation of a polypeptide encoded by the target RNA, or that the RNA silencing agent has a sequence sufficient to trigger destruction of the target RNA by the RNAi machinery (e.g., the RISC complex). RNA silencing agents can include, for example, siRNA, shRNA, antisense RNA, miRNA, or other RNA-based or RNA-like silencing agents.</p>

Accordingly, a miRNA agent can include, for example, a miRNA, a miRNA mimic, a synthetic miRNA oligonucleotide, or an expression vector encoding a miRNA. A miRNA agent may also include a miRNA precursor that is capable of being cleaved by cellular machinery to form a miRNA, e.g., a pre-RNA a pri-RNA, or a miRNA stem-loop. Accordingly, a miRNA agent can include, for example, a pre-miRNA, a pri-miRNA, a miRNA stem-loop, an expression vector encoding a pre-miRNA, an expression vector encoding a pri-miRNA, or an expression vector encoding a miRNA stem-loop. An expression vector encoding a miRNA agent can include, for example, a plasmid expression vector or a viral expression vector. As with RNAi agents, miRNA agents act on target RNA via RISC.</p>

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The term RNA includes noncoding (âncRNAsâ) and coding RNAs (i.e., mRNAs). ncRNAs are single- or double-stranded RNAs that do not specify the amino acid sequence of polypeptides (i.e., do not encode polypeptides). By contrast, ncRNAs affect processes including, but not limited to, transcription, gene silencing, replication, RNA processing, RNA modification, RNA stability, mRNA translation, protein stability, and/or protein translation. ncRNAs include, but are not limited to, bacterial small RNAs (âsRNAâ), microRNAs (âmiRNAsâ), and/or small temporal RNAs (âstRNAsâ).</p>

Preferred nucleotide analogs are modified at any position so as to alter certain chemical properties of the nucleotide yet retain the ability of the nucleotide analog to perform its intended function. Examples of positions of the nucleotide which may be derivitized include the 5 position, e.g., 5-(2-amino)propyl uridine, 5-bromo uridine, 5-propyne uridine, 5-propenyl uridine, etc.; the 6 position, e.g., 6-(2-amino)propyl uridine; the 8-position for adenosine and/or guanosines, e.g., 8-bromo guanosine, 8-chloro guanosine, 8-fluoroguanosine, etc. Nucleotide analogs also include deaza nucleotides, e.g., 7-deaza-adenosine; O- and N-modified (e.g., alkylated, e.g., N6-methyl adenosine, or as otherwise known in the art) nucleotides; and other heterocyclically modified nucleotide analogs such as those described in Herdewijn, <i>Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev., </i>2000 Aug. 10(4):297-310.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Nucleotide analogs may also comprise modifications to the sugar portion of the nucleotides.

      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">The term âoligonucleotideâ refers to a short polymer of nucleotides and/or nucleotide analogs. The term âRNA analogâ refers to an polynucleotide (e.g., a chemically synthesized polynucleotide) having at least one altered or modified nucleotide as compared to a corresponding unaltered or unmodified RNA but retaining the same or similar nature or function as the corresponding unaltered or unmodified RNA. As discussed above, the oligonucleotides may be linked with linkages which result in a lower rate of hydrolysis of the RNA analog as compared to an RNA molecule with phosphodiester linkages. For example, the nucleotides of the analog may comprise methylenediol, ethylene diol, oxymethylthio, oxyethylthio, oxycarbonyloxy, phosphorodiamidate, phophoroamidate, and/or phosphorothioate linkages. Preferred RNA analogues include sugar- and/or backbone-modified ribonucleotides and/or deoxyribonucleotides. Such alterations or modifications can further include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as to the end(s) of the RNA or internally (at one or more nucleotides of the RNA). An RNA analog need only be sufficiently similar to natural RNA that it has the ability to mediate (mediates) RNA interference.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">As used herein, the term ânuclease-resistant oligonucleotideâ refers to any oligonucleotide that has been modified to inhibit degradation by enzymes such as, for example, the exonucleases known to be present in the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell. RNA molecules (e.g., RNA oligonucleotides) are particularly at risk of degradation when combined with a composition comprising a cell extract or when introduced to a cell or organism, and a âribonuclease-resistantâ oligonucleotide is thus defined as an antisense moleculeagent that is relatively resistant to ribonuclease enzymes (e.g., exonucleases), as compared to an unmodified form of the same oligonucleotide. Preferred antisense moleculesagents of the invention include those that have been modified to render the oligonucleotide relatively nuclease-resistant or ribonuclease-resistant. In a preferred embodiment, the antisense agents and/or oligonucleotides of the invention have been modified with a 2â²-O-methyl group (e.g., 2â²-O-methylcytidine, 2â²-O-methylpseudouridine, 2â²-O-methylguanosine, 2â²-O-methyluridine, 2â²-O-methyladenosine, 2â²-O-methyl) and additionally comprise a phosphorothioate backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">The terms â2â²-O-methyl modificationâ and âphosphorothioate modificationâ as used herein, possess their art-recognized meanings.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">The term âlocked nucleic acid (LNA),â as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid analogue containing one or more LNA nucleotide monomers with a bicyclic furanose unit locked in an RNA mimicking sugar conformation. The ribose moiety of an LNA nucleotide is modified with an extra bridge (e.g., a 2â²-O,4â²-C methylene bridge) connecting the 2â² and 4â² carbons. The bridge âlocksâ the ribose in the 3â²endo structural conformation, which is often found in the A-form of RNA. LNA oligonucleotides display unprecedented hybridization affinity toward complementary single-stranded RNA, including miRNA. Structural studies have shown that LNAs are effective RNA mimics that induce an A-type (RNA-like) duplex geometry. The locked ribose conformation of LNAs enhances base stacking and significantly increases the thermal stability of oligonucleotides containing LNAs. Additional properties of LNAs have been described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050227256A1 (U.S. Ser. No. 10/998,364), the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. LNAs have been shown to be highly effective in silencing miRNAs.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">The term âantagomir,â as used herein, refers to small synthetic RNA-like oligonucleotides that are complementary to a specific miRNA target (i.e., miR132), and that harbor various modifications for RNAse protection. Antagomirs have beneficial pharmacologic properties such as enhanced tissue and cellular uptake. Antagomirs differ from normal RNA by complete 2â²-O-methylation of sugar, phosphorothioate backbone and a cholesterol-moiety at 3â²-end. In some embodiments, antagomirs can have either mispairing at the cleavage site of Ago2, or a base modification at this site to inhibit Ago2 cleavage. Antagomirs are believed to silence miRNA by irreversibly binding to miRNA molecules, rendering them nonfunctional.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">The terms âmorpholinosâ or âmorpholino oligos,â as used herein, refers to nucleic acid analogs having standard nucleic acid bases that are bound to morpholine rings, rather than to deoxyribose rings, and are linked through phosphorodiamidate groups, rather than phosphates. Based on the similarity to natural nucleic acid structure, morpholinos bind to complementary sequences of mRNA by standard Watson-Crick base pairing. Instead of degrading their target RNA molecules, morpholinos act by steric blocking, binding to a target sequence within an RNA (e.g., a miRNA, i.e., miR132) and inhibiting interaction of molecules which might otherwise interact with the RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The term âantisenseâ refers generally to any approach reliant upon agents, e.g., oligonucleotides, that are sufficiently complementary to a target sequence to associate with the target sequence in a sequence-specific manner (e.g., hybridize to the target sequence). Exemplary uses of antisense in the instant application involve use of an oligoribonucleotide agent that hybridizes to a target RNA and blocks an activity/effect of the targeted RNA sequence, but antisense approaches commonly are used to target DNA or RNA for transcriptional inhibition, translational inhibition, degradation, etc. Antisense is a technology that can be initiated by the hand of man, for example, to modulate splicing and/or silence the expression of target genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">As used herein, the term âisolated RNAâ (e.g., âisolated mRNAâ, âisolated miRNAâ or âisolated RNAi agentâ) refers to RNA molecules which are substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">The term âin vitroâ has its art recognized meaning, e.g., involving purified reagents or extracts, e.g., cell extracts. The term âin vivoâ also has its art recognized meaning, e.g., involving living cells, e.g., immortalized cells, primary cells, cell lines, and/or cells in an organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">As used herein, the term âdruggable targetâ refers to a target (i. e, gene or gene product) having certain desired properties which indicate a potential for drug discovery, i.e., for use in the identification, research and/or development of therapeutically relevant compounds. A druggable target is distinguished based on certain physical and/or functional properties selected by a person skilled in the art of drug discovery. A druggable target (i.e., gene or gene product) of the instant invention, for example, is distinguished from other genes and/or gene products based on the fact that that it is regulated by miR145, miR132, and/or miR212.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">Based on the fact that these targets are regulated by HCMV infection, it is believed that the targets are important in essential cellular processes, for example, maintenance of cellular homeostasis, host cell defense mechanisms, and the like, or in essential viral processes, for example, processes involved in viral replication. Control of such processes, including situations in which such processes are misregulated (i.e., in the biology of a disease), has obvious therapeutic appeal. Additional criteria for identifying and/or selecting druggable targets include, but are not limited to (1) cellular localization susceptible to systemically administered (e.g., orally administered) drugs; (2) homology or similarity to other genes and/or gene products (e.g., members of a gene family) previously successfully targeted; and (3) data (e.g., expression and/or activity data) indicating a role for the gene/gene product at a critical intervention points in a disease pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">The term âantiviral drug targetâ, as used herein, refers to a target (i.e, gene or gene product) having certain desired properties which indicate a potential for antiviral drug discovery, i.e., for use in the identification, research and/or development of compounds useful in antiviral therapies. A druggable target (i.e., gene or gene product) of the instant invention, for example, is indicated as an antiviral drug target based on the fact that miR145, miR132, miR212, and targets thereof, are regulated by HCMV expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">A gene âinvolvedâ in a disorder includes a gene, the normal or aberrant expression or function of which effects or causes or contributes to a disease or disorder or at least one symptom of said disease or disorder.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Various methodologies of the instant invention include step that involves comparing a value, level, feature, characteristic, property, etc. to a âsuitable controlâ, referred to interchangeably herein as an âappropriate controlâ. A âsuitable controlâ or âappropriate controlâ is any control or standard familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art useful for comparison purposes. In one embodiment, a âsuitable controlâ or âappropriate controlâ is a value, level, feature, characteristic, property, etc. determined prior to performing a given methodology, as described herein. For example, a transcription rate, mRNA level, translation rate, protein level, biological activity, cellular characteristic or property, genotype, phenotype, etc. can be determined prior to introducing a compound (e.g., a compound that increases or mimics expression of miR145; a compound that inhibits or reduces expression of a gene or gene product that is targeted by miR145; a compound that antagonizes miR132 and/or miR212; a compound that increases, upregulates, enhances or mimics expression of a gene or gene product that is targeted by miR132 and/or miR212, etc.) of the invention into a cell or organism.

      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0000">II. miRNAs and RNA Interference</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0124">MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (e.g., 10-50 nucleotides), single-stranded noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes at the level of translation. MicroRNAs are initially transcribed as a long, single-stranded miRNA precursor known as a pri-miRNA, which may contain one or several miRNAs. These pri-miRNAs typically contain regions of localized stem-loop hairpin structures that contain the mature miRNA sequences. Pri-miRNAs are processed into 60-150 nucleotide pre-miRNAs in the nucleus by the double-stranded RNA-specific nuclease Drosha. These pre-miRNAs typically adopt a hairpin conformation with at least one stem-loop structure. The 60-150 nucleotide pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm, where they are processed by the enzyme Dicer into single-stranded mature miRNAs of about 10-50 nucleotides (more preferably, 15-25 nucleotides). This is in contrast with siRNAs, which are of a similar size but are double-stranded, and are usually processed from a double-stranded RNA precursor.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0125">Following processing, mature miRNAs are incorporated into an effector complex termed miRISC (miRNA-Induced Silencing Complex), which participates in RNA silencing. miRNAs can pair with target mRNAs that contain sequences only partially complementary (e.g., 30%, 35%, 40%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90% or more) to the miRNA. Such pairing typically occurs in the 3â²untranslated regions (3â²UTR) of mRNA, and results in repression of mRNA translation without altering mRNA stability. Alternatively, miRNAs with a substantial degree of complementarity to their targets can effect gene silencing by mediating mRNA degradation, e.g., via RNAi (Hutvagner and Zamore (2002) <i>Science </i>297:2056-2060). As expression of precursor microRNAs (i.e., pri-miRNAs) is often developmentally regulated, miRNAs are often referred to interchangeably in the art as âsmall temporal RNAsâ or âstRNAsâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">
        <i>C. elegans </i>contains approximately 100 endogenous miRNA genes, about 30% of which are conserved in vertebrates. Mammalian genomes are predicted to encode at least 200 to 1000 distinct miRNAs, many of which are estimated to interact with 5-10 different mRNA transcripts. Accordingly, miRNAs are predicted to regulate up to one-third of all genes. miRNAs are differentially expressed in various tissues, such that each tissue is characterized by a specific set of miRNAs. miRNAs have been shown to be important modulators of cellular pathways including growth and proliferation, apoptosis, and developmental timing. Given the pathways over which miRNAs exert a regulatory effect, it is not surprising that alterations in miRNA expression have been detected in several types of cancer, including breast and lung carcinomas. These recognized pathways likely represent the tip of an iceberg, however, as the abundance of miRNAs within eukaryotic cells indicates that many downstream effects of miRNA-induced silencing remain to be identified.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0000">III. Viral Modulation of Cellular miRNA Expression</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">Viruses possess small genomes made up of nucleic acid. Examples of viruses possessing genomes made up of DNA are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, poxvirus, herpes virus, adenovirus, papillomavirus, and parvovirus. Examples of viruses possessing genomes made up of RNA are likewise known in the art and include, but are not limited to, influenza virus, rotavirus, mumps virus, rabies virus, HIV/AIDS virus, corona virus, LCM virus and poliovirus. The viral genome can be either single- or double-stranded, and is packaged in a capsid, or protein coat, which in enveloped viruses is further enclosed by a lipid envelope. Nonenveloped viruses leave an infected cell by lysing and thereby killing the cell. Enveloped viruses can leave the cell by budding, without disrupting the plasma membrane and, therefore, without killing the cell. Enveloped viruses can thus cause chronic infections, in some cases helping transform an infected cell into a cancer cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">All viruses use the basic host cell machinery for most aspects of their reproduction, including transcription and translation. Many viruses encode proteins that modify the host transcription or translation apparatus to modulate expression of host cell genes to create an environment that favors the synthesis of viral proteins over those of the host cell. Some viruses, including HCMV, additionally encode miRNAs. These miRNAs may likewise modify expression of host cell factors to create an environment favorable for viral replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0129">If cellular miRNAs are involved in inhibition of viral replication, it is possible that viruses counter this process by interfering with cellular miRNA expression. Indeed, PFV-1 has been shown to encode the protein Tas, which broadly suppresses miRNA activity. Remarkably, instances of positive regulation of cellular miRNA expression by viruses have also been reported. Human miRNA miR-122 interacts with the 5â²-non-coding region of HCV and increases viral RNA production, through a mechanism which remains to be elucidated (Jopling (2005) <i>Science </i>309:1577-1581). In addition, latency type III Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infections have been associated with induction of miR-155 in human B cells (Nair (2006) <i>TRENDS in Microbiology </i>14:169-175), indicating that this miRNA is beneficial for EBV replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0000">IV. HCMV Specifically Modulates Expression of miR145</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0130">The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that miR145 is significantly downregulated following infection with HCMV, indicating that miR145 is an important cellular mediator of HCMV infection. HCMV is a herpesvirus that has developed mechanisms to modify the cellular environment. One of its strategies is to alter the cellular miRNA expression pattern. Microarray analysis indicated that 48 hours after HCMV infection of Human Embryonic Lung (HEL) fibroblasts, cellular miRNA expression pattern changed significantly with no unidirectional trend, suggesting that HCMV specifically utilizes this pathway, rather than inhibits it. Without wishing to be bound by theory, HCMV may be reprogramming cells through miRNA expression. The discovery that HCMV modulates expression of cellular miRNAs including miR145 indicates that HCMV alters cellular miRNA expression to enhance its replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0131">The data set forth herein demonstrate that miRNA 145 expression is significantly downregulated during HCMV infection. miR145 regulates expression of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1). In particular, miR145 binds to the 3â²UTR of IRS-1, causing translational repression. IRS-1 plays a fundamental role in the Insulin Receptor signaling pathway. Upon activation by phosphorylation, IRS-1 functions as a scaffolding protein that mediates downstream signaling events, which lead to upregulation of cellular metabolic activity, such as mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidyl inositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K) pathways. miR145 downregulation was confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, a differential localization of IRS-1 protein was observed in infected cells by immunofluorescence, indicating that HCMV induces relocalization of this protein. To counteract the effect of HCMV-induced miR145 downregulation, a miR145 mimic was transfected into fibroblast cells, which were subsequently infected with HCMV. Decreased levels of the viral proteins at Immediate Early (IE), Early (E), and Late (L) stages of HCMV replication (e.g., IE2, pp65, and gB55), in addition to &gt;1 log reduction in viral titers, were observed in cells transfected with the miR145 mimic, indicating that the specific reduction of cellular miR145 by HCMV enhances viral replication. Reduction of cellular miR145 can also alter signaling pathways downstream of IRS-1, such as MAPK and PI3K. Modulation of these downstream signaling pathways may further promote HCMV replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0132">The foregoing discoveries pertaining to the downregulation of cellular miR145 following HCMV infection can provide relevant information about the cellular mechanisms modified by this virus that may enhance its replication and pathogenicity. These discoveries indicate that miR145 agents (i.e., miR145 or an agent, e.g., an oligonucleotide agent mimicking the activity of miR145 as a translational repressor of one or more miR145 targets) may be used to inhibit HCMV, or to treat an infection caused by HCMV. In addition, these discoveries reveal that miR145 targets, and signaling pathways involving miR145 targets, are attractive druggable targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HCMV infections. Particular targets include, for example, genes or gene products whose expression is regulated by miR145, and signaling pathways involving genes or gene products regulated by miR145. Such targets include, for example, IRS-1 and IRS-1 signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K. Moreover, since miR145 is downregulated in certain cancers and malignancies (Akao et al., 2007), downstream targets of miR145 that are useful for treatment of HCMV infections may also be useful therapeutic targets in other diseases mediated by aberrant miR145 regulation, e.g., cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0000">V. HCMV Specifically Modulates Expression of miR132 and miR212</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0133">The present invention is also based, at least in part, on the discovery that miR132 and miR212 are significantly upregulated following infection with HCMV, indicating that miR132 is an important cellular mediator of HCMV infection. As noted above, the data set forth herein indicates that HCMV may be reprogramming cells through miRNA expression. The discovery that HCMV modulates expression of cellular miRNAs including miR132 and miR212 indicates that HCMV alters cellular miRNA expression to enhance its replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0134">The data set forth herein demonstrate that miRNA 132 and miR212 expression is significantly upregulated during HCMV infection. miR132 regulates expression of methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). miR212 is encoded by a gene located adjacent to miR212, and both miR132 and miR212 share a common seed sequence. miR212 also regulates expression of MeCP2. Methylation of CpG residues is associated with gene silencing. MeCP2 binds to methyl-CpGs, where it functions as a transcriptional repressor. MeCP2 plays a major role in brain development, and mutations in MeCP2 are largely responsible for the development of mental retardation in a severe form of autism known as Retts Syndrome. In addition, mis-expression of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) by MeCP2 in neuron cultures affects dendritic and axonal arborization. The data set forth herein indicates that MeCP2 expression is downregulated in fibroblasts during HCMV infection, consistent with the observed increase in miR132 and/or miR212 expression. Moreover, transfection with an antisense miR132 LNA oligonucleotide, an antisense miR212 LNA oligonucleotide, and combinations thereof, increased intracellular levels of MeCP2, indicating that miR132 and miR212 are targeting MeCP2. Another target of miR132 and miR212 is Rho GTPase-activating protein (RICS; also known in the art as p250GAP). Like MeCP2, RICS is also involved in neuronal development and maturation. RICS is expressed at high levels in the Central Nervous System (CNS), where it regulates neurite outgrowth. Increases in miR132 resulting in altered levels of RICS have been shown to lead to exaggerated arborization of cultured neurons. Accordingly, alterations in RICS and MEcP2 expression resulting from upregulation of miR132 during HCMV infection likely contribute to the pathology of HCMV disorders. The data set forth herein demonstrate that inhibition of miR132 function by transfection of cells with an antisense miR132 LNA oligonucleotide and/or a miR212 LNA oligonucleotide attenuates viral replication, evidenced by reduction in virus release, and reduction in expression of viral proteins IE2, pp65, and gB55. This finding implicates HCMV-induced upregulation of miR132 and miR212 in viral replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0135">Taken together, it is likely that upregulation of miR132 and/or miR212 is one mechanism by which HCMV infection contributes to HCMV pathogenesis. For example, upregulation of miR132 and/or miR212 is one mechanism by which HCMV infection may cause neurological disorders, including birth defects. HCMV is currently the leading cause of birth defects associated with an infectious agent. Anomalies include CNS malformations, mental retardation, inflammatory diseases, and organ dysfunction. In addition, HCMV is the leading cause of nonfamilial hearing loss in children. The findings set forth herein demonstrate that treatment modalities based on inhibiting miR132 and/or miR212 upregulation, and the corresponding downregulation of miR132 and miR212 targets, in HCMV infected cells can be effective to inhibit HCMV replication and HCMV infection. Accordingly, such treatment modalities can be used to treat or ameliorate the symptoms of HCMV-mediated disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0136">The foregoing discoveries pertaining to the upregulation of cellular miR132 and miR212 following HCMV infection can provide relevant information about the cellular mechanisms modified by this virus that may enhance its replication and pathogenicity. These discoveries indicate that miR132 or miR212 antagonists (i.e., an agent that reduces or inhibits the expression, stability, or activity or miR132 and/or miR212) may be used to inhibit HCMV, or to treat an infection caused by HCMV. In addition, these discoveries reveal that miR132 and/or miR212 targets, and signaling pathways involving these targets, are attractive druggable targets for therapeutic intervention for the treatment of HCMV infections. Particular targets include, for example, genes or gene products whose expression is regulated by miR132 and/or miR212, and signaling pathways involving genes or gene products regulated by miR132 and/or miR212. Such targets include, for example, MeCP2 and MeCP2 signaling pathways, and RICS and RICS signaling pathways.</p>

      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0137">As described herein, miR145 and miR145 target molecules (e.g., IRS-1) have therapeutic and diagnostic utility. miR145 and miR145 target molecules (e.g., IRS-1) can further be used experimentally, for example, in identifying antiviral agents that are effective in the treatment of HCMV infection. Likewise, miR132 and miR212, and target molecules thereof (e.g., MeCP2 and RICS) have therapeutic and diagnostic utility. miR132, miR212, and target molecules thereof (e.g., MeCP2 and RICS) can further be used experimentally, for example, in identifying antiviral agents that are effective in the treatment of HCMV infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0000">A. Inhibition of HCMV Replication and Treatment of HCMV Infection Using miR145 Agents</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0138">In one aspect, the invention provides methods of inhibiting HCMV replication in a cell, comprising contacting the cell with a miR145 agent in an amount effective to decrease the level of one or more miR145 targets, or a gene product (e.g., a polypeptide) encoded by one or more miR145 targets, such that HCMV replication is inhibited. A miR145 agent, as used herein, is miR145, or an agent (e.g., an oligonucleotide agent) mimicking, replicating or simulating the activity of miR145 as a translational repressor of one or more miR145 targets. Accordingly, a miR145 agent includes, for example, miR145, a miR145 mimic, a synthetic miR145 oligonucleotide, or an expression vector encoding miR145. In an exemplary embodiment, a miR145 agent comprises a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleic acid sequence of the stem-loop form of miR145, as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1: 5â²CACCUUGUCCUCACGGUCCAGUUUUCCCAGGAAUCCCUUAGAUGCUAA GAUGGGGAUUCCUGGAAAUACUGUUCUUGAGGUCAUGGUU 3â² (miRNA ID No: hsa-mir-145; Accession No: MI0000461).

Contacting a cell with a miR145 agent compensates for the decrease in miR145 that occurs during HCMV infection, thereby negating any beneficial effect derived by HCMV as a consequence of miR145 downregulation. The foregoing methods may additionally comprise measuring the level of HCMV replication in a cell after contacting the cell with a miR145 agent, and comparing the level of HCMV replication to a suitable control. In this embodiment, a preferred miR145 agent, or a preferred quantity of a miR145 agent, is one which decreases the level of HCMV replication when compared to a suitable control, e.g., a comparable cell not contacted with a miR145 agent.</p>

A LNA is a nucleic acid analogue containing one or more LNA nucleotide monomers with a bicyclic furanose unit locked in an RNA mimicking sugar conformation. The ribose moiety of an LNA nucleotide is modified with an extra bridge (e.g., a 2â²-O,4â²-C methylene bridge) connecting the 2â² and 4â² carbons. The bridge âlocksâ the ribose in the 3â²endo structural conformation, which is often found in the A-form of RNA. LNA oligonucleotides display unprecedented hybridization affinity toward complementary single-stranded RNA, including miRNA. Structural studies have shown that LNAs are effective RNA mimics that induce an A-type (RNA-like) duplex geometry. The locked ribose conformation of LNAs enhances base stacking and significantly increases the thermal stability of oligonucleotides containing LNAs. A triplet of LNA nucleotides surrounding a single-base mismatch site can maximize LNA binding specificity. miR132 and/or miR212 antagonists may also comprise chimaeric LNA2â² -O-methoxyethyl oligonucleotides.

An antagomir is a small synthetic RNA-like oligonucleotide that is complementary to a specific miRNA target (e.g., miR132, miR212), and harbors various modifications for RNAse protection and pharmacologic properties such as enhanced tissue and cellular uptake. Antagomirs differ from normal RNA by complete 2â²-O-methylation of sugar, phosphorothioate backbone and a cholesterol-moiety at 3â²-end. Antagomirs efficiently silence miRNAs in most tissues after three injections at approximately 20-1000 mg/kg body/weight (b/w) (e.g., 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 125 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, 175 mg/kg 200 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, 700 mg/kg, or 1000 mg/kg) on consecutive days. The synthesis and use of antagomirs is described further in Krutzfeldt, J. et al., Silencing of microRNAs in vivo with âantagomirsâ <i>Nature. </i>2005; 438:685-689 and Krutzfeldt, J. et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Research, </i>2007, Vol. 35, No. 9 2885-2892, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0156">In some embodiments, the foregoing miR132 and/or miR212 antagonists can comprise morpholino oligos (i.e., phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligos). Morpholino oligos are nucleic acid analogs having standard nucleic acid bases that are bound to morpholine rings, rather than to deoxyribose rings, and are linked through phosphorodiamidate groups, rather than phosphates. Based on the similarity to natural nucleic acid structure, morpholinos bind to complementary sequences of mRNA by standard Watson-Crick base pairing. Instead of degrading their target RNA molecules, morpholinos act by steric blocking, binding to a target sequence within an RNA (e.g., a miRNA, i.e., miR132 or miR212) and inhibiting interaction of molecules which might otherwise interact with the RNA. Morpholino oligos can be used to effectively inhibit the function of miR132 and/or miR212, thus serving as miR132 or miR212 antagonists.</p>

      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0000">VII. miRNA Targets</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0163">A miRNA target (e.g., a miR145 target, a miR132 target, a miR212 target), as used herein, refers to a gene, gene transcript, or gene product whose expression is altered (e.g., downregulated) by a given miRNA (e.g., miR145, miR132, or miR212). miRNAs may alter the expression of a miRNA target by interacting with an RNA transcript, and preventing translation of a polypeptide encoded by the RNA transcript. In this case, the level of expression of a polypeptide encoded by the RNA transcript is decreased in the presence of the miRNA, while the level of the RNA transcript remains substantially unaltered. miRNAs may alternatively alter the expression of a miRNA target by interacting with an RNA transcript, and directing degradation or destabilization of the RNA transcript. In this case, the level of expression of the RNA transcript, and the level of a polypeptide encoded by the RNA transcript, are decreased in the presence of the miRNA (e.g., miR145, miR132, or miR212). In some embodiments, miRNA targets a non-coding RNA. In preferred embodiments, miR145, miR132, and miR212 target a mRNA encoding a polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0164">miRNA targets are identified based on having a region of sequence complementarity to a portion of miR145, miRNA132, or miRNA 212. In order to mediate post-transcriptional repression or degradation of targets, miRNAs must recognize their targets by complementary base pairing. miRNA targets typically have conserved Watson-Crick base pairing to a 5â² region of a miRNA, known as the miRNA seed. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, miRNA targets contain a region that is complementary to 6-8 nucleotides in the miRNA seed. Four types of miRNA seed types are useful for miRNA target identification: the 6mer site, which perfectly matches the 6-nucleotide miRNA seed; the 7mer-m8 site, which comprises the seed match supplemented by a Watson-Crick base pair match to miRNA nucleotide 8, the 7mer-A1 site, which contains the seed match supplemented by an A across from miRNA nucleotide 1, and the 8-mer site, which contains the seed match supplemented by both the m8 and the A1 (Friedman et al., <i>Genome Res. </i>(2009) 19:92-105). The region within a miRNA target that is complementary to the miRNA seed may be located at any point within the gene transcript, but is preferably located within the 3â²untranslated region (3â²UTR) or within an open reading frame of a mRNA transcript.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0165">Methods useful for identifying a miRNA target are known in the art, and are described, for example, in Friedman et al., <i>Genome Res. </i>(2009) 19:92-105, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Tools that are useful for identifying a miRNA target are maintained through the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (see, for example, www.targetscan.org). miRNA targets identified according to the foregoing methods can be confirmed experimentally using techniques known in the art for determining whether the expression of a miRNA target is modulated (e.g., downregulated) by a miRNA. As will be apparent to a person of skill in the art, such experiments can be performed in vivo, e.g., in a cell or organism, or in vitro, e.g. using a cell extract or recombinant nucleic acids and/or polypeptides. If levels of an RNA (e.g., an mRNA) decrease following exposure to a miRNA, the gene or gene product corresponding to the RNA may be a miRNA target. Likewise, if levels of an RNA (e.g., an mRNA) increase following disruption of an miRNA, the gene or gene product corresponding to the RNA may be a miRNA target. Similarly, if levels of a polypeptide encoded by a mRNA decrease following exposure to a miRNA, the gene or gene product corresponding to the RNA is a miRNA target. Likewise, if levels of a polypeptide encoded by a mRNA increase following disruption of a miRNA, the gene or gene product corresponding to the RNA is a miRNA target.</p>

For example, when contacting a cell with a miR145 agent in an amount effective to decrease the level of one or more miR145 targets, a decrease in the level of one or more miR145 targets may be compared with the level of the miR145 target in a like cell that is not contacted with a miR145 agent (e.g., a mock-transfected cell). When determining the decrease in the level of one or more miR145 targets in response to a miR145 agent, a suitable control may include, for example, a cell infected with HCMV that is not contacted with a miR145 agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0169">In another example, when contacting a cell with a miR132 and/or miR212 antagonist in an amount effective to increase the level of one or more miR132 or miR212 targets, an increase in the level of one or more targets may be compared with the level of the target in a like cell that is not contacted with a miR132 or miR212 antagonist (e.g., a mock-transfected cell). When determining the increase in the level of one or more miR132 or miR212 targets in response to a miR132 or miR212 antagonist, a suitable control may include, for example, a cell infected with HCMV that is not contacted with a miR132 or miR212 antagonist.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0170">When contacting a cell with an RNA silencing agent capable of mediating expression of a miR145 target (e.g., by RNA interference), a decrease in the level of the miR145 target may be compared with the level of the miR145 target in a like cell that is not contacted with the RNA silencing agent (e.g., a mock-transfected cell). When determining the decrease in the level of a miR145 target in response to an RNA silencing agent, a suitable control may include, for example, a cell infected with HCMV that is not contacted with an RNA silencing agent. Likewise, when contacting a cell with a miR132 or miR212 target activating agent capable of increasing or upregulating expression of a gene or gene product that is targeted by miR132 and/or miR212, an increase in the level of the miR132 or miR212 target may be compared with the level of the target in a like cell that is not contacted with the activating agent (e.g., a mock-transfected cell). When determining the increase in the level of a miR132 or miR212 target in response to a miR132 or miR212 target activating agent, a suitable control may include, for example, a cell infected with HCMV that is not contacted with the agent.</p>

Accordingly, the present invention provides compositions comprising a miR145 agent and/or an RNA silencing agent as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention further provides methods of treating or attenuating HCMV infection in an organism by administering compositions that include a miR145 agent and/or an RNA silencing agent as described herein, or a pharmaceutical composition including the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0172">miR132 antagonists, miR212 antagonists, miR132 target activating agents, and miR212 target activating agents can be used therapeutically or prophylactically either alone or in combination. Accordingly, the present invention provides compositions comprising a miR132 antagonist, a miR212 antagonist, a miR132 target activating agent, a miR212 target activating agent, and combinations thereof, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention further provides methods of treating or attenuating HCMV infection in an organism by administering compositions that include a miR132 antagonist, a miR212 antagonist, a miR132 target activating agent, a miR212 target activating agent, and combinations thereof as described herein, or a pharmaceutical composition including the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0173">The invention pertains to uses of the above-described agents for therapeutic treatments as described infra. Accordingly, the agents of the present invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. As used herein the language âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0174">A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0175">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELâ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0176">Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0177">Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.</p>

Such methods include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,798.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0179">Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.</p>

      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0182">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein (and other optional pharmacological agents) can be delivered directly via a pump device. For example, in some embodiments, the compositions are delivered directly by infusion into a diseased tissue, e.g. a tissue that is infected with HCMV.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0183">The compounds can also be administered by any method suitable for administration of nucleic acid agents, such as a DNA vaccine. These methods include gene guns, bio injectors, and skin patches as well as needle-free methods such as the micro-particle DNA vaccine technology disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,389, and the mammalian transdermal needle-free vaccination with powder-form vaccine as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,168,587. Additionally, intranasal delivery is possible, as described in, inter alia, Hamajima et al. (1998), Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol., 88(2), 205-10. Liposomes (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,375) and microencapsulation can also be used. Biodegradable targetable microparticle delivery systems can also be used (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,471,996).</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0184">In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Such formulations can be prepared using standard techniques. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0185">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD<sub>50</sub>/ED<sub>50</sub>. Compounds which exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0186">The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC<sub>50 </sub>(i.e., the concentration of the compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.</p>

Higher percentages, e.g., 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 100 percent or higher may be preferred in certain embodiments. Exemplary doses include milligram or microgram amounts of the molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100 micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram. The compositions can be administered one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, e.g., between 2 to 8 weeks, or between about 3 to 7 weeks, or for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks.

Sambrook et al., eds., 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, Chapters 10 and 11, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0202">For example, the nucleic acid probe can be labeled with, e.g., a radionuclide such as <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>33</sup>P, <sup>14</sup>C, or <sup>35</sup>S; a heavy metal; or a ligand capable of functioning as a specific binding pair member for a labeled ligand (e.g., biotin, avidin or an antibody), a fluorescent molecule, a chemiluminescent molecule, an enzyme or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0203">Probes can be labeled to high specific activity by either the nick translation method of Rigby et al. (Rigby (1977), <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>113:237-251), or by the random priming method of Fienberg et al. (Fienberg (1983), <i>Anal. Biochem. </i>132:6-13, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The latter is the method of choice for synthesizing <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes of high specific activity from single-stranded DNA or from RNA templates. For example, by replacing preexisting nucleotides with highly radioactive nucleotides according to the nick translation method, it is possible to prepare <sup>32</sup>P-labeled nucleic acid probes with a specific activity well in excess of 10<sup>8 </sup>cpm/microgram. Autoradiographic detection of hybridization can then be performed by exposing hybridized filters to photographic film. Densitometric scanning of the photographic films exposed by the hybridized filters provides an accurate measurement of miRNA gene transcript levels. Using another approach, miRNA gene transcript levels can be quantified by computerized imaging systems, such the Molecular Dynamics 400-B 2D Phosphorimager available from Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0204">Where radionuclide labeling of DNA or RNA probes is not practical, the random-primer method can be used to incorporate an analogue, for example, the dTTP analogue 5-(N-(N-biotinyl-epsilon-aminocaproyl)-3-aminoallyl)deoxyuridine triphosphate, into the probe molecule. The biotinylated probe oligonucleotide can be detected by reaction with biotin-binding proteins, such as avidin, streptavidin, and antibodies (e.g., anti-biotin antibodies) coupled to fluorescent dyes or enzymes that produce color reactions.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0205">In addition to Northern and other RNA blotting hybridization techniques, determining the levels of miRNA transcripts can be accomplished using the technique of in situ hybridization. This technique requires fewer cells than the Northern blotting technique, and involves depositing whole cells onto a microscope cover slip and probing the nucleic acid content of the cell with a solution containing radioactive or otherwise labeled nucleic acid (e.g., cDNA or RNA) probes. This technique is particularly well-suited for analyzing tissue biopsy samples from subjects. The practice of the in situ hybridization technique is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,916, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable probes for in situ hybridization of a given miRNA gene product can be produced using the nucleotide sequence of an miRNA. In an exemplary embodiment, probes are produced using the nucleic acid sequence of human miR145 (SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2). In another exemplary embodiment, probes are produced using the nucleic acid sequence of human miR132 (SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4). In another exemplary embodiment, probes are produced using the nucleic acid sequence of human miR212 (SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6).</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0206">The relative number of miRNA gene transcripts in cells can also be determined by reverse transcription of miRNA gene transcripts, followed by amplification of the reverse-transcribed transcripts by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The levels of miRNA gene transcripts can be quantified in comparison with an internal standard, for example, the level of mRNA from a âhousekeepingâ gene present in the same sample. A suitable âhousekeepingâ gene for use as an internal standard includes, e.g., myosin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The methods for quantitative RT-PCR and variations thereof are within the level of skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0207">In some embodiments, it is desirable to simultaneously determine the expression level of a plurality of different of miRNAs in a sample. Assessing expression levels for multiple miRNAs is time consuming and requires a large amount of total RNA (at least 20 Î¼g for each Northern blot) and autoradiographic techniques that require radioactive isotopes. To overcome these limitations, an oligolibrary in microchip format may be constructed containing a set of probe oligonucleotides specific for a set of miRNA genes. In one embodiment, the oligolibrary contains probes corresponding to all known miRNAs from the human genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0208">The nucleic acid sequences corresponding to miRNA, miRNA* and hairpin miRNAs of miR145, miR132, and miR212 are suitable for use in designing probes, oligonucleotides, primers, etc. for use in the methods and applications of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0209">Cells or biological samples obtained from a normal cell, tissue, or organism (e.g., one which exhibits normal traits), as described above, can comprise suitable controls for the diagnostic methods set forth herein. The relative miRNA expression in the control or normal samples can further be determined with respect to one or more RNA expression standards. The standards can comprise, for example, a zero miRNA gene expression level, the miRNA gene expression level in a standard cell line, or the average level of miRNA gene expression obtained for a population of normal human controls. Alternatively, a feature of a control sample, for example, a value, level, characteristic, property, etc., has been predefined (e.g., a level of expression of an miRNA, a hybridization signal profile, etc.). In this embodiment, the miRNA expression levels present in a sample are compared with the pre-determined features of a control sample.</p>

      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">miR145 is Downregulated Following HCMV Infection</heading>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0216">Microarray analysis was performed to determine the miRNA expression pattern changes after HCMV infection. HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (Multiplicity of infection (MOI)=5). RNA from mock-infected cells, together with RNA from cells infected with HCMV (48 hours post infection (hpi)), were hybridized to miRNA microarrays (LC Sciences). Hybridization signal intensities for individual miRNAs (average of six replicates) were plotted as mock versus virus-infected. Statistical analysis was performed at LC Sciences, and an additional Golub analysis was performed for maximum confidence. The results of the microarray analysis are depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Red dots indicate statistically significant values (p&lt;0.01). Greater than two-fold changes in miRNA expression appear outside of the diagonal lines. The arrow indicates that miR145 is significantly downregulated following HCMV infection (2.31 fold decrease). These data suggest that miR145 is involved in the pathogenesis of HCMV.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0217">miR145 downregulation during HCMV infection was confirmed by Northern blot. HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (MOI=1), and pellets were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi. RNA was extracted and 5 Î¼g of RNA from each sample was loaded and electrophoresed in a 15% acrylamide gel. RNA was transferred to a nylon-hybond membrane and a Northern blot was performed. The results of Northern blot analysis are depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel is shown as a loading control. These data show a sustained downregulation of miR145 levels throughout the time course of infection. These results confirm that HCMV downregulates miR145 expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0218">The infection-induced decrease in miR145 levels determined by microarray and Northern blot was further confirmed by quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR). HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (MOI=1), and cell pellets were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpi. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 5 ng of RNA was used for qRT-PCR (TaqManÂ® MicroRNA Assays, Applied Biosystems). As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, miR145 levels are downregulated, as noted by the increase in the cycle threshold (AACT). A 2-fold decrease at 24 hpi followed by a Ë3-fold decrease at 48 hpi (which was sustained until 72 hpi) was detected during the time course infection. These results indicate that mature miR145 levels are reduced from 24 hpi to 72 hpi, further demonstrating that miR145 expression is decreased during HCMV infection. These data are in agreement with data obtained from microarray and Northern blot, indicating that miR145 has a role in HCMV pathogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0219">A microarray time course analysis was also performed to determine changes in miR145 levels after HCMV infection. HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (MOI=5). RNA from mock-infected cells, together with RNA from cells infected with HCMV, was hybridized to miRNA microarrays (LC Sciences). Hybridization signal intensities for miR145 (average of 3 replicates) are plotted during the mock and virus-infected time course (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Statistical analysis was performed at LC Sciences. The results, shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, indicate that miR145 levels are significantly and consistently downregulated during HCMV infection.

      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="1">Transfection with a miR145 Mimic Leads to Decreased Levels of IRS-1 Protein</heading>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0220">This experiment was performed to determine whether a miR145 mimic targets Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) mRNA, which is a target of miR145, in HEL fibroblasts. HEL fibroblasts were transfected with either a control miRNA (ct) or miR145 mimic (145) (Dharmacon). Cell pellets were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post transfection and lysed. Western blot was performed using an anti IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biothechnology). Actin is shown as a loading control. Downregulation of the IRS-1 protein was observed at 48, 72 and 96 hours post transfection with the miR145 mimic, when compared to control transfected cells, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. This downregulation is not observed in the cells transfected with a control miRNA, or the mock-transfected cells. These data suggest that miR145 targets IRS-1 mRNA in HEL fibroblasts. Since miR145 is downregulated during HCMV infection, it is likely that IRS-1 is upregulated during HCMV infection.</p>

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Transfection with a miR145 Mimic Reduces Viral Replication</heading>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0221">This experiment was performed to determine whether altered regulation of miR145 following viral infection affects viral replication. HEL fibroblasts were transfected with either a control (ct) miRNA or a miR145 mimic (145) (Dharmacon). The cells were infected with HCMV (MOI=1) 24 hours after transfection. Supernatants were collected at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hpi and examined for viral titers by plaque assay. These results show decreased viral titers in the supernatants of HEL fibroblasts previously transfected with miR145, when compared to those transfected with the control miRNA, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. A 10-fold difference can be observed from 72 to 96 hpi. At 144 hpi, viral titers are similar in the control and miR145 mimic transfected cells. This result may be due either to miR145 mimic turnover or to HCMV overcoming the effects of miR145 mimic transfection. These data suggest that miR145 transfection decreases viral replication in HEL fibroblasts, and implies a role for miR145 supporting viral replication. This is consistent with the hypothesis that downregulation of miR145 contributes to HCMV pathogenesis by enhancing its replication.</p>

      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">miR145 Leads to Decreased HCMV Protein Expression</heading>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0222">These experiments were performed to establish the role of miR145 on HCMV protein expression. HEL fibroblasts were transfected with either a control miRNA or miR145 mimic (Dharmacon). The cells were infected with HCMV (MOI=1) 24 hours after transfection. Cell pellets were collected at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hpi, lysed and examined for viral protein expression by western blot. Decreased levels of the Immediate Early (IE) 2 protein, the Early (E) protein pp65, and the Late (L) protein gB55 could be seen in those cells transfected with miR145, when compared to the cells transfected with a control miRNA, as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. Increased IE1 levels were also observed, likely due to the decreased levels of IE2, as IE2 reduces IE1 expression (Hermiston et al 1990). Actin is shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> as a loading control. These results indicate that miR145 transfection regulates the HCMV gene expression in HEL fibroblasts. These data implicate miR145 during HCMV IE, E and L gene expression. In agreement with the data in the previous figures, these results suggest that miR145 mediates HCMV pathogenesis and replication.</p>

      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="1">HCMV Infection Upregulates IRS-1 Protein Levels</heading>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0223">This experiment was performed to determine the effects of HCMV infection on IRS-1 protein levels. Fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (MOI=1). Cell pellets were collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post infection and lysed. Western blot was performed using an anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biothechnology), the results of which are shown in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>. Actin is shown in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> as a loading control. IRS-1 protein levels were normalized to actin and then compared to the mock-infected IRS-1 levels at each time point. These results show an upregulation in the IRS-1 protein levels at 72 and 96 hpi in the cells infected with HCMV. These data indicate that HCMV is upregulating expression of IRS-1 protein, likely by downregulating expression of miR145. These findings implicate overexpression of IRS-1 in HCMV pathogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0224">An extended time course was performed to determine the levels of IRS-1 protein during HCMV infection from 24-120 hours. HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (MOI=1) or mock-infected, as a control. This <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows that IRS-1 levels decreased in the uninfected cell time course. However, a gradual increase in the expression of this protein was observed during HCMV infection, starting at 72 hpi (hours post infection). Actin is shown as a loading control. These results suggest that HCMV infection induces IRS-1 upregulation in Hel fibroblasts.</p>

      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="1">IRS-1 is Relocalized During HCMV Infection</heading>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0225">IRS-1 is known to translocate to the plasma membrane after insulin-mediated stimulation of the insulin receptor (Jacobs et al. 2001). This experiment was performed to determine whether IRS-1 is differentially localized after HCMV infection. HEL fibroblasts were grown on coverslips and were either mock infected or infected with HCMV (MOI=1). Cells were fixed at 24, 48 and 72 hpi and stained with primary antibodies against IRS-1, a fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (green fluorescence), and 4â²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue fluorescence), for nuclei staining. The fluorescence signal intensity relocalized after HCMV infection when compared to the mock infection, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. These results indicate that a differential localization of IRS-1 occurs during HCMV infection, and that this virus may be altering the distribution of IRS-1 throughout the cell.</p>

      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0226">Microarray analysis was performed to determine changes in miRNA expression patterns after HCMV infection. HEL fibroblasts were infected with HCMV (Multiplicity of infection (MOI)=5).

Greater than two-fold changes in miRNA expression appear outside of the diagonal lines. The arrow indicates that miR132 is significantly upregulated following HCMV infection (5 fold increase). These data suggest that miR132 is involved in the pathogenesis of HCMV. The absence of a uni-directional trend in miRNA expression during virus infection suggests that the virus is specifically impacting the expression of particular miRNAs to control the expression of genes required for efficient virus replication.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0227">A microarray time course was performed to determine changes in miRNA expression patterns at multiple time points post-infection. HEL cells were either mock or infected with HCMV at an MOI=5, and RNA was extracted with TrizolÂ® (Invitrogen) at the time points indicated in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. RNA was hybridized to a microarray (LC Sciences) that harbored probes to all known cellular and viral miRNAs, and the expression of each miRNA was determined by relative quantitation at the respective mock and infected time-points. An ANOVA analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of the change in expression of each miRNA. Results are shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. Extrapolation of the data corresponding to miR132 and miR212 from the plots shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref> allowed visualization of the expression of miR132 and miR122 over the time course of infection, based on the changes in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) from the respective mock and infected time points (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0228">miR132 upregulation during HCMV infection was confirmed by quantitative Real Time PCR (qRT-PCR). Total RNA purified from HEL fibroblasts and U373MG glioblastoma-astrocytoma cells infected with HCMV (MOI=1) was used for Taqman qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems). Expression of miR132 was normalized to GAPDH. This data, as shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, validates the &gt;5-fold increase in miR132 expression observed using miRNA microarray, and indicates that HCMV infection results in upregulation of miR132 expression. This phenomenon is further supported by the observation that miR132 expression is similarly regulated in multiple permissive cell lines during infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0229">The observation that miR132 expression increases during HCMV infection was confirmed by Northern blot. Total RNA purified from HEL fibroblasts and U373MG glioblastoma-astrocytoma cells infected with HCMV (MOI=1) analyzed by Northern Blot. The expression of miR132 was quantitated relative to ethidium bromide staining, shown as a loading control. The results depicted in <figref>FIG. 15</figref> validate the observation that HCMV infection results in the upregulation of miR132 expression. The effect seen in U373 cells is less dramatic than that seen in HEL cells, likely due to the fact that there is less mature miR132 natively present in this cell line (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0230">TaqMan miRNA assay (Applied Biosystems) further confirmed that miR132 expression was upregulated during HCMV infection, and also indicated that miR212 is upregulated in HEL and U373MG cells during HCMV infection. HEL and U373MG cells were infected with HCMV at MOI=1, and cells were harvested at 24 hour intervals. RNA was then purified from infected cells using TrizolÂ® (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol, and 5 ng of RNA was used to generate cDNA via reverse transcription. miRNA expression was quantitated using TaqManÂ® miRNA assay (Applied Biosystems). The histograms in <figref>FIG. 16</figref> show the increase in expression of miR-132 and miR-212 relative to GAPDH.</p>

Nuclear enriched lysates were prepared and 100 Î¼g of protein lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein was transferred to PVDF membrane, and MeCP2 and hn RNP_K proteins were detected by Western blot using polyclonal antibodies (Millipore and Santa Cruz). As expected, a decrease in MeCP2 protein levels was observed in HCMV-infected HEL cells (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>) and U373MG cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with the increase in miR132 and miR212 expression that occurs during HCMV infection. hnRNPK expression is show as a loading control.</p>

To test the efficacy of the LNAs, HEL cells were transfected with 500 pmol of scramble, miR132, or miR212 specific locked nucleic acid (Exiqon) to inhibit miRNA function. Nuclear enriched extracts were prepared, and protein levels were determined by Western blot. Transfection with miR132 LNA resulted in a modest increase in MeCP2 protein levels in HEL cells (<figref>FIG. 18</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>), demonstrating that a miR132 antagonist can be used to increase expression of a miR132 target. Likewise, transfection with miR212 LNA resulted in a modest increase in MeCP2 protein levels in HEL cells (<figref>FIG. 18</figref><i>a</i>), demonstrating that a miR212 antagonist can be used to increase expression of a miR212 target.</p>

      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0233">To determine the role of miR132 on HCMV replication, HEL cells were transfected with antisense miR132 LNA, and were infected with HCMV. The amount of virus released from infected cells was quantitated by plaque assay, and viral protein accumulation was analyzed by Western blot of protein lysates from infected cells. As shown in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, expression of viral proteins IE2, pp65, and gB55 was reduced in cells transfected with an antisense miR132 LNA Inhibition of miR132 resulted in a 3-fold decrease in virus replication, as determined by measuring attenuated virus release and viral protein expression. Taken together with the previous data, this experiment confirms that miR132 is necessary for efficient HCMV replication, and that HCMV replication can be effectively attenuated by inhibition of miR132.</p>
