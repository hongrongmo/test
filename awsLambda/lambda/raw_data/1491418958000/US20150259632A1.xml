      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-017772 filed on 29 Jan. 2010 and entitled âCleaning Agent for Semiconductor Provided with Tungsten Wiringâ Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-072824 filed on 26 Mar. 2010 and entitled âCleaning Agent for Semiconductor Provided with Copper Wiring,â both of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cleaning agent used for cleaning a surface subsequent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) in a manufacturing process of a microelectronic device, and particularly relates to a post-CMP cleaning agent for a microelectronic device provided with metal wiring (e.g., tungsten or a tungsten alloy, copper or a copper alloy) on the surface thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Market needs such as high performance and miniaturization has resulted in the need for more integrated semiconductor elements on microelectronic devices. For example, a high-level planarization technique for forming a finer circuit pattern is necessary, wherein a CMP step of polishing a wafer surface using a polishing slurry (hereinafter, abbreviated to a CMP slurry) containing particulates of alumina or silica is effectuated.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In this CMP step, however, various substances remain on the device after polishing, for example: polishing particulates such as alumina and silica in the CMP slurry (hereinafter, abrasive grains), iron nitrate aqueous solutions added to accelerate polishing, anticorrosive added to suppress corrosion of a metal, and residues of a polished metal wiring and zinc and magnesium metals used on a side of said metal wiring. These residues can have an adverse effect on electrical properties of the semiconductor such as shorting. Accordingly, it is necessary to remove these residues prior to proceeding to the next manufacturing step.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the related art for tungsten CMP, post-CMP methods typically use an ammonia and hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution or a hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution in combination with a diluted hydrofluoric acid aqueous solution. In such a method, however, the wiring metal can be substantially corroded. Accordingly, the method cannot be applied to modern microelectronic devices having fine patterns. In order to avoid this corrosion, a cleaning process using a cleaning agent containing an organic acid that is less corrosive to tungsten, such as citric acid and oxalic acid, and a chelating agent such as amino polycarboxylic acid has been proposed (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 10-72594).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In the related art for copper CMP, post-CMP methods typically use acidic cleaning agents containing an organic acid such as citric acid and oxalic acid as a principal component (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2001-7071). However, while these cleaning agents have an excellent ability to remove metallic residues, the cleaning agents are highly corrosive to the copper wiring. In order to improve this corrosiveness, alkaline cleaning agents containing an alkanolamine as a principal component are known (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-74243). These cleaning agents have low corrosivity to the copper wiring and have an excellent ability to remove organic residues derived from the anticorrosive added in the CMP slurry. That said, these cleaning agents have a poor ability to remove metallic residues. Alternatively, alkaline cleaning agents having an ability to remove metallic residues are known, said cleaning agents including an organic acid, such as succinic acid and oxalic acid, and an alkanolamine as the principal component (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2003-536258). However, while these cleaning agents have an excellent ability to remove metallic and organic residues, the cleaning agents are highly corrosive to the copper wiring. Accordingly, such cleaning agents cannot be applied to modern microelectronic devices having fine patterns.</p>

      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0083">The first compositions (D-1) to (D-5) and the comparative compositions (Dâ²-1) to (Dâ²-4) were tested for anticorrosiveness to tungsten, an ability to remove metallic residues, and an ability to remove abrasive grains and evaluated. Table 1 summarizes the results.</p>

      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0101">Evaluation of an ability to remove abrasive grains was performed. A wafer having a silicon nitride single layer film was immersed in a CMP slurry used at a CMP step for a tungsten wiring to be contaminated. Then, the wafer was immersed in the cleaning agent of Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 for a semiconductor provided with a tungsten alloy wiring. After the wafer after washing was dried, a degree of remaining abrasive grains per visual field was observed using an SEM (scanning electron microscope). It was determined that an ability to remove abrasive grains was higher as the number of the remaining abrasive grains per visual field was smaller.</p>

      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0128">Evaluation of an ability to remove organic residues using the cleaning agents of Examples 6 to 11 and Comparative Examples 5 to 12 was made according to the following procedure:</p>
      <heading id="h-00044-en" level="2">(1) Washing of Copper-Plated Silicon Wafer </heading>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0129">A wafer obtained by performing copper plating on a silicon wafer (made by Advanced Materials Technology Inc., âCu plated 10000 A Wafer,â thickness of copper plating=1.0 Î¼m) was cut into a piece 1.5 cm long by 1.5 cm wide. The cut wafer was immersed for 1 minute in a 10% acetic acid aqueous solution, and washed with water.</p>
      <heading id="h-00045-en" level="2">(2) Preparation of Organic Residue Liquid</heading>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0130">0.4 g of benzotriazole, 0.6 g of a hydrogen peroxide solution at a concentration of 30%, and 200 g of water were mixed, and adjusted with chloride so that the pH was about 3.0, thus preparing an organic residue liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0000">(3) Production of Copper Plated Wafer to which Organic Residues Adhere</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0131">The copper plated wafer was immersed in the organic residue liquid prepared in (2) for 60 seconds. Then, the wafer was immersed in water for 60 seconds to produce a copper plated wafer to which organic residues adhered.</p>
      <heading id="h-00046-en" level="2">(4) Check of Amount of Organic Residues Adhering to Copper Plated Wafer</heading>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0132">The amount of organic residues adhering to the copper plated wafer was checked by measuring an amount of nitrogen derived from benzotriazole, which was an organic residue product, using an X ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) apparatus (made by ULVAC-PHI, Inc., ESCA-5400 type).</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0133">Specifically, using XPS, the number of photoelectrons was measured at a binding energy from 397 eV to 399 eV, and a peak area value at a binding energy from 397.5 to 398.4 eV derived from nitrogen was determined. MgK Î± rays (1253.6 eV) were used as a soft X ray.</p>
      <heading id="h-00047-en" level="2">(5) Removal of Organic Residue Adhering to Copper Plated Wafer</heading>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0134">In 50 g of each of the second compositions, the copper plated wafer produced in (3) to which organic residues adhered was immersed for 3 minutes to remove the organic residues from the copper plated wafer. Then, the copper plated wafer was immersed in 1 L of water for 60 seconds, and the wafer surface was dried by a nitrogen stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0000">(6) Check of Amount of Organic Residues that Remained in Copper Plated Wafer</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0135">Similarly to the case of (4), the amount of the organic residues that remained on the copper plated wafer was checked by measuring an amount of nitrogen derived from benzotriazole, which was an organic residue product, using XPS.</p>
      <heading id="h-00048-en" level="2">(7) Evaluation and Determination of Ability to Remove Organic Residues</heading>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0136">Two peak area values measured in (4) and (6) were substituted into the following equation (3), and an organic residue removal rate was calculated:</p>
