      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to catheters that have an active distal portion, including a tip electrode, particularly useful for ablation and sensing electrical activity of heart tissue.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Electrode catheters have been in common use in medical practice for many years. They are used to stimulate and map electrical activity in the heart and to ablate sites of aberrant electrical activity. In use, the electrode catheter is inserted into a major vein or artery, e.g., femoral artery, and then guided into the chamber of the heart of concern. A typical procedure involves the insertion of a catheter having a tip electrode at its distal end into a heart chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A typical mapping or ablation catheter has an elongated catheter body comprising a flexible lumened tubing, a more distal section comprising another flexible lumened tubing, and a tip electrode at distal end of the second tubing. Bonding adhesive is applied to affix the tip electrode to the second tubing. As a tissue contact area of the catheter, the tip electrode is subjected to a variety of stresses and strains during mapping and ablation. Repeated exposure to axial and lateral loads can weaken the bond between the tip electrode and the catheter. As the distal-most component of a catheter and hence the last component of the catheter to exit the patient's body, extra care and attention is given to its attachment to the catheter as detachment of the tip electrode would be a significant safety breach for the patient. Many catheter designs make use of a primary adhesive bond supplemented by additional structural joints in the form of a puller wire attachment directly to the tip electrode. The tip electrode may also be tethered by a lead wire or thermocouple wires. However, design failure mode effects analysis (DFMEA) requires redundant safety structures to reduce the risk of detachment.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Conventional catheters may provide a safety line that is tied or attached to the tip electrode. Typically an eyelet or loop of stainless steel or the like is soldered to a distal end or stem of the tip electrode and a distal end of the safety line is fed through the eyelet and knotted. However, eyelets are expensive and very time-consuming to manufacture. Moreover, crimping, tie offs, and tight bends in the safety line around the eyelet and within the knot induce stress concentrations causing premature wear and tear which can significantly reduce the tensile load carrying capability of the safety line. Additionally, the eyelet-knot arrangement occupies precious space in the tight quarters of a distal tip.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Accordingly, it is desirable that a catheter provide a tip configuration that can better accommodate a safety line and reduce the stress and strain so the safety line can more fully utilize its tensile load carrying capability. It is also desirable that the tip configuration make more efficient use of the space in the distal tip while accommodating the safety line without interfering with the housing and function of other components of the distal tip.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention is directed to a catheter having a tip configuration that mitigates stress concentrations found in safety line attachments to a catheter tip electrode. The tip configuration advantageously provides a U-shaped passage or conduit having an inlet, a U-turn and an outlet through which a flexible safety line is threaded. Two proximal portions of the safety line exit from the U-shaped passage and pass through the catheter and enter a control handle where the ends of the safety lines are anchored. The looping of the safety line around the U-shaped passage generally behaves as a rope over a pulley where the effective lifting strength at the pulley is twice that of the tension on the rope. Accordingly, the effective load-carrying capacity of the safety line in securing the tip electrode is about twice that of the tensile strength of an individual safety line.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one embodiment of the present invention, the catheter has an elongated catheter body, a tip electrode distal to the catheter body and a safety tensile member or safety line. The tip electrode has a support member having a passage portion defining a rounded distal surface, and a shell mounted on the support member, wherein the safety line has a line portion positioned in the passage portion to pass around the rounded distal surface. Securing the tip electrode, the safety line has two ends, at least one of which is anchored to the catheter, for example, a control handle proximal of the catheter body. The passage portion is U-shaped, such that the safety line has two proximal portions extending proximally from the support member to pass in parallel through the catheter body.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In a detailed embodiment, the shell and the support member define a cavity and the support member has at least one additional passage providing fluid communication between the catheter body and the cavity. The shell has at least one fluid port configured to allow fluid communication between the cavity and outside the shell. The support member has at least one additional passage configured to receive at least one component passing between the catheter body and the tip electrode. The at least one component may include a lead wire, a thermocouple wire, an irrigation tubing and/or a position sensor cable.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a detailed embodiment, the at least one component has an enlarged distal end and the at least one additional passage has a wider distal portion to receive and anchor the enlarged distal end. This arrangement allows the components to be installed distally into the tip electrode and the components to be efficiently housed and arranged in the space-confined distal tip region without interfering with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention also includes a method of manufacturing a catheter tip electrode comprising providing a tip electrode support member and a shell, forming in the support member a passage defining a rounded distal surface, extending a safety tensile member in the passage to pass around the rounded distal surface, the safety tensile member having two portions extending proximally of the rounded distal surface, and mounting the shell on the support member.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The method may include providing an exposed rounded distal surface and sealing the rounded distal surface prior to mounting the shell on the support member. The method may also include forming in the support member at least one additional passage configured to receive an irrigation tubing, a lead wire, a thermocouple wire and/or a position sensor cable.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The method may further include providing an enlarged distal portion in the at least additional passage, and providing an enlarged distal end in the component for anchoring in the enlarged distal portion of the at least additional passage.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a catheter <b>10</b> with an improved distal tip configuration to accommodate a safety tensile member or line that secures a tip electrode with reduced stress and strain on the safety line. In accordance with a feature of the present invention, the safety line is threaded through or looped around a member of the tip electrode to secure the tip electrode. The catheter <b>10</b> has an elongated catheter body <b>12</b> with proximal and distal ends, an intermediate deflectable section <b>14</b> at the distal end of the catheter body <b>12</b>, and a distal section <b>15</b> with a tip electrode <b>17</b> adapted for mapping and/or ablation with irrigation. The catheter also includes a control handle <b>16</b> at the proximal end of the catheter body <b>12</b> for controlling deflection (single or bi-directional) of the intermediate section <b>14</b> relative to the catheter body <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C, the catheter body <b>12</b> comprises an elongated tubular construction having a single, axial or central lumen <b>18</b>. The catheter body <b>12</b> is flexible, i.e., bendable, but substantially non-compressible along its length. The catheter body <b>12</b> can be of any suitable construction and made of any suitable material. A presently preferred construction comprises an outer wall <b>20</b> made of polyurethane or PEBAX. The outer wall <b>20</b> comprises an imbedded braided mesh of stainless steel or the like to increase torsional stiffness of the catheter body <b>12</b> so that, when the control handle <b>16</b> is rotated, the intermediate section <b>14</b> of the catheter <b>10</b> will rotate in a corresponding manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The outer diameter of the catheter body <b>12</b> is not critical, but is preferably no more than about 8 french, more preferably 7 french. Likewise the thickness of the outer wall <b>20</b> is not critical, but is thin enough so that the central lumen <b>18</b> can accommodate puller members (e.g., puller wires), lead wires, and any other desired wires, cables or tubings. If desired, the inner surface of the outer wall <b>20</b> is lined with a stiffening tube <b>22</b> to provide improved torsional stability. A disclosed embodiment, the catheter has an outer wall <b>20</b> with an outer diameter of from about 0.090 inch to about 0.94 inch and an inner diameter of from about 0.061 inch to about 0.065 inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Distal ends of the stiffening tube <b>22</b> and the outer wall <b>20</b> are fixedly attached near the distal end of the catheter body <b>12</b> by forming a glue joint <b>23</b> with polyurethane glue or the like. A second glue joint (not shown) is formed between proximal ends of the stiffening tube <b>20</b> and outer wall <b>22</b> using a slower drying but stronger glue, e.g., polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Components that extend between the control handle <b>16</b> and the deflectable section <b>14</b> pass through the central lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. These components include lead wires <b>30</b>T and <b>30</b>R for the tip electrode <b>17</b> and any ring electrodes <b>21</b> carried on the distal section <b>15</b>, an irrigation tubing <b>38</b> for delivering fluid to the tip electrode, a cable <b>33</b> for a position location sensor <b>34</b> carried in the distal section <b>15</b>, puller wires <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b </i>for deflecting the intermediate section <b>14</b>, and a pair of thermocouple wires <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> to sense temperature at the distal section <b>15</b>, and a safety tensile member or safety line <b>47</b> securing the tip electrode <b>17</b> to the catheter.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C is an embodiment of the intermediate section <b>14</b> which comprises a short section of tubing <b>19</b>. The tubing also has a braided mesh construction but with multiple lumens, for example lumens <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b, </i><b>27</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>29</b>. The first lumen <b>26</b><i>a </i>is off axis and carries a puller wire <b>32</b><i>a </i>for deflection of the intermediate section. For bi-directional deflection, the diametrically opposing off-axis second lumen <b>26</b><i>b </i>carries a second puller wire <b>32</b><i>b. </i>The third lumen <b>27</b> is also off-axis and carries the lead wires <b>30</b>T and <b>30</b>R, the thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, and the sensor cable <b>33</b>. The fourth lumen <b>28</b> is centered and on axis and carries the irrigation tubing <b>38</b>. The fifth lumen <b>29</b>, also off-axis, carries the safety line <b>47</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The tubing <b>19</b> of the intermediate section <b>14</b> is made of a suitable non-toxic material that is more flexible than the catheter body <b>12</b>. A suitable material for the tubing <b>19</b> is braided polyurethane, i.e., polyurethane with an embedded mesh of braided stainless steel or the like. The size of each lumen is not critical, but is sufficient to house the respective components extending therethrough.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">A means for attaching the catheter body <b>12</b> to the intermediate section <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The proximal end of the intermediate section <b>14</b> comprises an outer circumferential notch <b>25</b> that receives an inner surface of the outer wall <b>20</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. The intermediate section <b>14</b> and catheter body <b>12</b> are attached by glue or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">If desired, a spacer (not shown) can be located within the catheter body between the distal end of the stiffening tube (if provided) and the proximal end of the intermediate section. The spacer provides a transition in flexibility at the junction of the catheter body and intermediate section, which allows this junction to bend smoothly without folding or kinking. A catheter having such a spacer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,964,757, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Each puller wire <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>is preferably coated with TeflonÂ®. The puller wires can be made of any suitable metal, such as stainless steel or Nitinol and the Teflon coating imparts lubricity to the puller wire. The puller wire preferably has a diameter ranging from about 0.006 to about 0.010 inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>, portion of each puller wire in the catheter body <b>12</b> passes through a compression coil <b>35</b> in surrounding relation to its puller wire. Each compression coil <b>35</b> extends from the proximal end of the catheter body <b>12</b> to at or near the proximal end of the intermediate section <b>14</b>. The compression coils are made of any suitable metal, preferably stainless steel, and are tightly wound on themselves to provide flexibility, i.e., bending, but to resist compression. The inner diameter of the compression coil is preferably slightly larger than the diameter of the puller wire. Within the catheter body <b>12</b>, the outer surface of the compression coil <b>35</b> is also covered by a flexible, non-conductive sheath <b>39</b>, e.g., made of polyimide tubing. Each portion of the puller wires distal of the compression coil <b>35</b> may extend through a respective protective sheath <b>37</b> to prevent the puller wire from cutting into the tubing <b>19</b> of the intermediate section <b>14</b> during deflection.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Proximal ends of the puller wires <b>32</b> are anchored in the control handle <b>16</b>. Distal ends of the puller wires <b>32</b> are anchored in the distal section <b>15</b>, for example, by T-bars <b>43</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Separate and independent longitudinal movements of the puller wires relative to the catheter body <b>12</b>, which results in, respectively, deflection of the intermediate section <b>14</b> along a plane, are accomplished by suitable manipulation of a deflection member of the control handle <b>16</b>. [update] Suitable deflection members and/or deflection assemblies are described in co-pending U.S. Publication No. US2010/0168827 A1, published Jul. 1, 2010, entitled DEFLECTABLE SHEATH INTRODUCER, and U.S. Publication No. US2008/0255540 A1, published Oct. 16, 2008, entitled STEERING MECHANISM FOR BI-DIRECTIONAL CATHETER, the entire disclosures of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, at the distal end of the intermediate section <b>14</b> is the distal tip section <b>15</b> that includes the tip electrode <b>17</b> and a relatively short piece of non-conductive connector tubing or covering <b>24</b> between the tip electrode <b>17</b> and the intermediate section <b>14</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the connector tubing <b>24</b> has a single lumen <b>44</b> which houses the position sensor <b>34</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) and allows passage of components including the tip electrode lead wire <b>30</b>T, the sensor cable <b>33</b>, thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, the safety line <b>47</b> and the irrigation tubing <b>38</b> into the tip electrode <b>17</b>. The single lumen <b>44</b> of the connector tubing <b>24</b> allows these components to reorient themselves as needed from their respective lumens in the intermediate section <b>14</b> toward their location within the tip electrode <b>17</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, the tubing <b>24</b> is a protective tubing, e.g., PEEK tubing, having a length ranging between 6 mm and 12 mm, more preferably about 11 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The tip electrode <b>17</b> defines a longitudinal axis <b>46</b> and is of at least a two-piece configuration that includes an electrically conductive dome shell <b>50</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> and an electrically conductive internal support member <b>52</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, which jointly define a cavity or chamber <b>51</b> surrounded and enclosed by the shell <b>50</b> and the support member <b>52</b>. The shell <b>50</b> is a hollow tubular or cylindrical shape and has a closed and rounded atraumatic distal end <b>36</b> and an open proximal end <b>54</b> defined by a rim <b>55</b> that is sealed by the support member <b>52</b> as described further below. Formed in the shell are a plurality of fluid ports <b>56</b> that allow fluid communication between the cavity <b>51</b> and outside the shell.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">As show in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, the support member <b>52</b> forms a fluid-tight seal at the proximal end <b>54</b> of the shell <b>50</b>. The support member <b>52</b> seals the interior cavity <b>51</b> of the shell <b>50</b>, and the shell <b>50</b> and the support member <b>52</b> facilitate the provision of a plenum condition within the cavity; that is, where fluid is forced or delivered into it for a more uniform distribution through fluid ports <b>56</b> formed in the shell.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A-4I</figref>, the support member <b>52</b> along its length has circular cross-section of varying sizes. The member <b>52</b> includes a plug mid-portion <b>52</b>M, a narrower rod-like distal portion <b>52</b>D (with a smaller radius) and a wider proximal hollow cylindrical portion <b>52</b>P or âskirtâ (with a larger radius). Each of the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the rod-like distal portion <b>52</b>D is generally of a solid form. A distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D is recessed such that an annular ring <b>65</b> surrounds the surface <b>53</b>. The plug portion <b>52</b>M sits with a snug fit in the open proximal end <b>54</b> of the shell <b>50</b> surrounded by the rim <b>55</b> so as to plug the end <b>54</b>. The rod-like distal portion <b>52</b>D extends into the cavity <b>51</b> inside the shell. A raised annular, flange <b>58</b> provided on an outer surface of the plug portion <b>52</b> abuts with the proximal end <b>54</b> of the shell <b>50</b> to limit the extent to which the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the rod portion <b>52</b>D can extend into the cavity <b>51</b> inside the shell <b>50</b>. The shell is attached to the support member <b>52</b> along the annular flange <b>58</b>. The hollow cylindrical portion <b>52</b>P is received in a distal end of the tubing <b>24</b> of the distal section <b>15</b>. The portion <b>52</b>P receives components extending from the tubing <b>24</b> and into the tip electrode <b>17</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">To accommodate the components passing into the tip electrode, the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the rod portion <b>52</b>D have a plurality of axial passages extending therethrough, including a center fluid passage <b>60</b>, two off-axis diametrically-opposing passages <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B, third and fourth off-axis passages <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. Each of the passages <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B, <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> occupies a quadrant in the circular cross-sectional space of the plug and rod portions <b>52</b>M and <b>52</b>D. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4E</figref>, the passages <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B occupy one pair of opposing quadrants (e.g., Quadrants I and III) and passages <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> occupy another pair of opposing quadrants (e.g., Quadrants II and IV). As such, there is efficient use of the space within the tip electrode <b>17</b> with minimal interference between components extending through each passage.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The center fluid passage <b>60</b> is formed as a blind hole that extends from a proximal surface <b>59</b> of the plug portion <b>52</b>M and distally into the rod portion <b>52</b>D by a predetermined distance D. In the illustrated embodiment, the distance is about â of a length L of the rod portion <b>52</b>. At a distal end of the blind hole transverse fluid passages <b>66</b> are arranged radially about the blind hole. The passage <b>66</b> receives a distal end of the irrigation tubing <b>38</b> for passing fluid delivered by the irrigation tubing <b>38</b> to the tip electrode <b>17</b> for perfusion inside the cavity <b>51</b> and to outside the tip electrode <b>17</b> via the fluid ports <b>56</b>. Distal portion of the irrigation tubing <b>38</b> may be surrounded by a protective tubing <b>77</b>, for example, polyimide tubing.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The third passage <b>63</b> extends between the proximal surface <b>59</b> of the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D. From the tubing <b>24</b>, the thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> extend through the third passage <b>63</b> with their distal ends anchored near the distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D. Distal ends of the thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> may be covered in a nonconductive cover or sheath <b>75</b>, for example, a polyester heat shrink sleeve. The sheath <b>75</b> is an electrically insulating, second protective covering over the thermocouple wires (proximal to thermocouple junction <b>80</b>, <figref>FIG. 7</figref>) to prevent abrasion against the support member <b>52</b>. Surrounding a distal portion of the sheath <b>75</b> may be another nonconductive tubing <b>76</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>), for example, a polyimide tubing. The tubing <b>76</b> is constructed of a thermally conductive material which provides electrical isolation between the thermocouple junction <b>80</b> and the support member <b>52</b> which is energized with RF potential.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The fourth passage <b>64</b> also extends between the proximal surface <b>59</b> of the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D. From the tubing <b>24</b>, the lead wire <b>30</b>T for the tip electrode <b>17</b> extends through the passage <b>64</b> with its distal end anchored near the distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">For a wrap-around safety line configuration, the passages <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B are connected and in communication with each other at their distal ends via a curved transverse passage <b>62</b> forming a rounded distal surface defining an outwardly radiused distal end <b>57</b>. Accordingly, the passages <b>61</b>A, <b>61</b>B and <b>62</b> form a U-shaped passage in the support member <b>52</b> that passes through the plug portion <b>52</b>M and the rod portion <b>52</b>D where it defines and forms an outwardly convex distal end <b>57</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the passages <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B extend sufficiently distally such that the transverse passage <b>62</b> and the distal end <b>57</b> are exposed and accessible at the distal end of the rod portion <b>52</b>D. The U-shaped passage generally encircles or wraps around the distal end <b>57</b>. Thus, with the safety line <b>47</b> passing through the U-shaped passage and around the distal end <b>57</b>, the safety line <b>47</b> reliably secures the support member <b>52</b>, and the shell <b>50</b> affixed thereon, to the catheter. That is, the support member <b>52</b> is directly secured by the safety line. There is no intermediate structure or parts between the safety line and the member <b>52</b>, and there are no knots or tight bends in the safety line that can induce stress concentrations. To protect the safety line, a friction-reducing protective sleeve <b>68</b> covers the section of the safety line extending over the curved transverse passage <b>62</b>. The sleeve <b>68</b> may be of any suitable nonconducting material, for example, polyimide.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The radiused distal end <b>57</b> circumscribed by the transverse passage <b>62</b> of the U-shaped passage has a uniform curvature defined by a predetermined diameter so that the safety line can be redirected by 180 degrees (âdouble backâ on itself) to form a secure attachment to the tip electrode with minimal stress concentrations. In accordance with a feature of the present invention, a ratio of no less than about 3:1 of the diameter of the uniform curvature to a diameter of the safety line minimizes, if not avoids, inducement of stress concentration on the safety line. For example, where the safety line <b>47</b> has a diameter of about 0.004 inch, the diameter defining the curvature of the transverse passage <b>62</b> should be at least about 0.012 inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The present invention is also directed to a method of assembly of the tip electrode <b>17</b>, which includes feeding or installing various components into the tip electrode <b>17</b> from its distal end. The method includes providing the support member <b>52</b>, without the shell <b>50</b> mounted, with at least a distal portion of the U-shaped passage or the radiused distal end exposed and accessible to an assembly person. As such, the passages <b>61</b>A/<b>61</b>B, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> can be accessed from the distal end of the support member <b>52</b>, and component(s), including, for example, the lead wire <b>30</b>T, the thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> and/or the safety line <b>47</b> can be fed into the support member <b>52</b> from its distal end. For example, each end of the safety line <b>47</b> is fed into a respective one of passages <b>61</b>A and <b>61</b>B, whereupon a mid-section of the safety line straddles the radiused distal end. Moreover, proximal ends of the thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are fed proximally into the passage <b>63</b> from the distal surface <b>53</b>. Likewise, a proximal end of the lead wire <b>30</b> is fed proximally into the passage <b>64</b> from the distal surface <b>53</b>. With respect to passages <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>, their respective distal ends <b>63</b>D and <b>64</b>D may have openings with a greater width or diameter to accommodate enlarged distal ends of the lead wire <b>30</b>T and/or thermocouple wires <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> for purposes of anchoring the distal ends in the support member <b>52</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a distal end of the lead wire <b>30</b>T has an enlarged coil <b>30</b>D and distal ends of the thermocouple wires have an enlarged crimped foldback <b>41</b>/<b>42</b>D. Advantageously, the passage distal ends <b>63</b>D and <b>64</b>D are sufficiently large to receive the coil <b>30</b>D and the crimped foldback <b>41</b>/<b>42</b>D, whereas the proximal remainder of the passages <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> are sufficiently narrow to abut and anchor the coil and the crimped foldback. It is noted that the enlarged ends <b>63</b>D and <b>64</b>D of the passages <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> are longitudinally offset relative to the transverse fluid passages <b>66</b> so that the ends <b>63</b>D and <b>64</b>D and the fluid passages <b>66</b> need not compete with each other for space in the circular cross-sectional area of the support member <b>52</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the enlarged ends <b>63</b>D and <b>64</b>D are distal of the transverse fluid passages <b>66</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">When the components, including the lead wire, thermocouple wires and safety line have been installed in the internal support member <b>52</b>, the recessed distal surface <b>53</b> of the rod portion <b>52</b>D may be filled or packed with a suitable adhesive so as to seal the distal end of the rod portion against fluid leakage from the cavity <b>51</b> into the passages <b>61</b>A/<b>61</b>B, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>. The shell <b>50</b> is then mounted on the rod portion <b>52</b>D with the rod portion <b>52</b>D extending into the cavity <b>51</b> with the rim <b>55</b> abutting the raised annular flange <b>58</b>. The rim and the flange are soldered to fixedly attach the shell to the support member <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In one embodiment, the safety line <b>47</b> is made of a high modulus fiber material, preferably having a tensile modulus substantially in the range of 5,000 ksi (35,000 MPa) to about 20,000 ksi (140,000 MPa), more preferably about 9,750 ksi (68,000 MPa), such as High Molecular Density Polyethylene (e.g., Spectraâ¢ or Dyneemaâ¢), a spun para-aramid fiber polymer (e.g., Kevlarâ¢) or a melt spun liquid crystal polymer fiber rope (e.g., Vectranâ¢), or a high strength ceramic fiber (e.g., Nextelâ¢). These materials tend to be flexible, providing suitable durability. Further, they are substantially non-stretching and nonmagnetic so that they generally appear transparent to an MRI. The low density of the material causes it to be generally transparent to an x-ray machine. The materials can also be nonconductive to avoid shorting. Vectranâ¢, for example, has high strength, high abrasion resistance, is an electrical insulator, nonmagnetic, is polymeric, and has low elongation under a load.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Preferably, the safety line <b>47</b> has a tensile strength ranging between about 300 ksi (2,000 MPa) to 1,500 ksi (10,400 MPa), more preferably around 450 ksi (3,100 MPa). This would allow the safety line to have a higher strength than conventional steel wires as well as a reduced cross-section. In one embodiment, the high modulus fiber material is braided.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The shell <b>50</b> and the internal support member <b>52</b> are constructed of a biocompatible metal, including a biocompatible metal alloy. A suitable biocompatible metal alloy includes an alloy selected from stainless steel alloys, noble metal alloys and/or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the shell is constructed of an alloy comprising about 80% palladium and about 20% platinum by weight. In an alternate embodiment, the shell <b>50</b> and the member <b>52</b> are constructed of an alloy comprising about 90% platinum and about 10% iridium by weight. The shell can formed by deep-drawing manufacturing process which produces a sufficiently thin but sturdy shell wall that is suitable for handling, transport through the patient's body, and tissue contact during mapping and ablation procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Ring electrodes <b>21</b> (<figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>) may be mounted on the connector tubing <b>24</b> of the distal section <b>15</b>. They may be made of any suitable solid conductive material, such as platinum or gold, preferably a combination of platinum and iridium. The ring electrodes can be mounted onto the connector tubing <b>24</b> with glue or the like. Alternatively, the ring electrodes can be formed by coating the tubing <b>24</b> with an electrically conducting material, like platinum, gold and/or iridium. The coating can be applied using sputtering, ion beam deposition or an equivalent technique. The number of the ring electrodes on the tubing <b>24</b> can vary as desired. The rings may be monopolar or bi-polar. In the illustrated embodiment, there is a distal monopolar ring electrode and a proximal pair of bi-polar ring electrodes. Each ring electrode is connected to a respective lead wire <b>30</b>R. A ring electrode <b>21</b> may be mounted immediately proximal of the exposed portion of the tip electrode <b>17</b>. As such, a notch <b>70</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) may be formed in the skirt <b>52</b>P of the support member <b>52</b> to allow lead wire <b>30</b>R to be connected to the ring electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, each lead wire <b>30</b>R is attached to its corresponding ring electrode by any suitable method. A preferred method for attaching a lead wire to a ring electrode involves first making a small hole through the wall of the tubing <b>24</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). Such a hole can be created, for example, by inserting a needle through the non-conductive covering and heating the needle sufficiently to form a permanent hole. The lead wire is then drawn through the hole by using a microhook or the like. The end of the lead wire is then stripped of any coating and welded to the underside of the ring electrode, which is then slid into position over the hole and fixed in place with polyurethane glue or the like. Alternatively, each ring electrode is formed by wrapping a lead wire <b>30</b>R around the non-conductive tubing <b>24</b> a number of times and stripping the lead wire of its own insulated coating on its outwardly facing surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The tip electrode <b>17</b> is electrically connected to a source of ablation energy (not shown) by the lead wire <b>30</b>T. The ring electrodes <b>21</b> are electrically connected to an appropriate mapping or monitoring system by respective lead wires <b>30</b>R.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The lead wires <b>30</b>T and <b>30</b>R pass through the lumen <b>27</b> (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) of the tubing <b>19</b> of the deflectable intermediate section <b>14</b> and the central lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>. The portion of the lead wires extending through the central lumen <b>18</b> of the catheter body <b>12</b>, and proximal end of the lumen <b>27</b> can be enclosed within a protective sheath (not shown), which can be made of any suitable material, preferably polyimide. The protective sheath is anchored at its distal end to the proximal end of the intermediate section <b>14</b> by gluing it in the lumen <b>27</b> with polyurethane glue or the like. Each electrode lead wire has its proximal end terminating in a connector at the proximal end of the control handle <b>16</b>.</p>
