      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a metal sheet having an alloy plated layer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Heretofore, there has been known a method of forming an alloy plated layer comprising some metals such as nickel and cobalt on a metal sheet such as a steel sheet by means of electroplating (see Patent Document 1, for example).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Problems to be Solved by Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A method of industrially manufacturing such a metal sheet having an alloy plated layer may ordinarily be such that a metal strip is continuously fed into a plating bath and electroplating is continuously performed in the plating bath. According to such a method, an alloy plated layer can be continuously formed on the metal strip. In such a method, however, concentrations of metal ions in the plating liquid included in the plating bath may have to be suppressed from varying in order to keep constant the composition of the alloy plated layer to be obtained by continuously forming the alloy plated layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A method of suppressing the variations of the concentrations of metal ions in the plating liquid included in the plating bath may be mentioned as a method in which metal salt compound powders are added to the plating liquid and dissolved therein in order to supplement metal ions consumed by forming the alloy plated layer, for example. However, this method may be difficult to continuously carry out the addition of powders. If the powders are preliminarily dissolved in water and the obtained liquids are continuously added, an adjustment may be necessary with consideration for the balance of liquid volumes when suppressing the variations of the concentrations of metal ions because in this case the water is also added to the plating liquid. In addition, even though the consumed metal ions can be supplemented, the counterpart anions also increase in the plating liquid as the metal salt compound powders are added. This may result in a trouble that a target composition and desired properties of the alloy plated layer cannot be obtained. Furthermore, such metal salt compound powders are expensive in general, leading to a problem in that the manufacturing cost will be high.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Another method of suppressing the variations of the concentrations of metal ions in the plating liquid included in the plating bath may be considered as a method in which plural anodes comprising respective metals that constitute the alloy plated layer are used as the anodes (positive electrodes). For example, when a nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is formed, a method may be exemplified in which nickel electrodes and cobalt electrodes are used as the anodes, i.e., as supply sources for nickel and cobalt ions. According to this method, however, the ratio of nickel ions and cobalt ions to be supplied from these electrodes is determined depending on the number of nickel electrodes and the number of cobalt electrodes, and a problem may arise in that an alloy plated layer having a specific ratio can only be formed. In addition, this method requires a plurality of anodes to be used, and the electric current may have to be controlled for each anode. However, it may be considerably difficult to continue to uniformly flow an electric current through each anode, and a problem may arise in that the alloy plated layer cannot be stably formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Still another method of suppressing the variations of the concentrations of metal ions in the plating liquid included in the plating bath may be considered as a method in which pellets comprising an alloy of respective metals that constitute the alloy plated layer are used as the anode (positive electrode). However, there is a problem in that manufacturing of pellets comprising an alloy may not be easy, and in particular, manufacturing of alloy pellets containing a metal of a high melting point may be considerably difficult. In addition, the method using alloy pellets may require using the alloy pellets with a composition ratio depending on a desired alloy plated layer. Problems in this case may be that the alloy pellets are required to be prepared depending on the metal ratio of a desired alloy plated layer and that, when the desired alloy plated layer is changed, the alloy pellets filled in an anode basket may have to be entirely replaced, which will require complicated operation. Furthermore, the method using alloy pellets involves a problem in that the ratio of each metal dissolving from the alloy pellets (dissolution ratio) may not be stabilized depending on the kinds of metals that constitute the alloy pellets, so that the desired alloy plated layer cannot be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention has been made in consideration of such actual circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a metal sheet having an alloy plated layer in which method, when the metal sheet having the alloy plated layer is manufactured, the concentrations of metal ions in the plating liquid included in the plating bath can be suppressed from varying and the composition of the alloy plated layer to be obtained can thereby be stabilized.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Means for Solving Problems</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">As a result of intensive studies to achieve the above object, the present inventors have found that the above object can be achieved by, when passing a metal strip continuously through a plating bath, which comprises an anode and a plating liquid that contains two or more kinds of metal ions for forming the alloy plated layer, to perform electroplating in the plating bath, using an anode obtained by mixing two or more kinds of metal pellets for forming the alloy plated layer as the anode, and controlling a total surface area ratio of each metal pellet, so that a dissolution ratio of each metal pellet that constitutes the anode is constant, thereby to suppress the concentrations of the metal ions in the plating liquid from varying. The inventors have thus accomplished the present invention. Note that âeach metal pelletâ as used in the present invention refers to a metal pellet or metal pellets comprising each metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">That is, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a metal sheet having an alloy plated layer. The method comprises a step of passing a metal strip continuously through a plating bath to perform electroplating in the plating bath. The plating bath comprises a plating liquid and an anode. The plating liquid contains two or more kinds of metal ions for forming the alloy plated layer. The method is characterized in that an anode obtained by mixing two or more kinds of metal pellets is used as the anode. The metal pellets are formed of respective metals that form the alloy plated layer. The method is also characterized in that a mixing ratio of each metal pellet that constitutes the anode is determined based on a total surface area ratio of each metal pellet in the anode so that a dissolution ratio of each metal pellet that constitutes the anode is a dissolution ratio corresponding to a weight ratio of each metal that constitutes the alloy plated layer.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0025">Embodiments according to the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing an example of a plating line to be used in the present embodiment. The plating line according to the present embodiment is a line for forming alloy plated layers on a metal strip <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, as the metal strip <b>10</b> is continuously fed into a plating bath <b>20</b> comprising a plating liquid <b>30</b> by means of a conductor roll <b>40</b>, electroplating is performed in the plating bath <b>20</b> so that the alloy plated layers are continuously formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0027">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the plating line according to the present embodiment comprises: <b>10</b> the conductor roll <b>40</b> for carrying the metal strip <b>10</b> into the plating bath <b>20</b>; a sink roll <b>50</b> for turning the traveling direction of the metal strip <b>10</b> in the plating bath <b>20</b>; and a conductor roll <b>60</b> for pulling out the metal strip <b>10</b> from the plating bath <b>20</b>. In the present embodiment, among these rolls the conductor rolls <b>40</b> and <b>60</b> are electrically connected to rectifiers <b>80</b><i>a </i>and <b>80</b><i>b</i>, and a cathode current is supplied to the conductor rolls <b>40</b> and <b>60</b> from an external power source (not shown) via the rectifiers. This allows a direct current from the external power source to be applied to the metal strip <b>10</b> via the conductor rolls <b>40</b> and <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0028">Four anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>are immersed in the plating bath <b>20</b>. Among these four anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>71</b><i>d </i>are electrically connected to the rectifier <b>80</b><i>a</i>, and the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>are electrically connected to the rectifier <b>80</b><i>b</i>. Anode currents are thus supplied from the external power source (not shown) to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>via the rectifiers <b>80</b><i>a </i>and <b>80</b><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0029">The current flows along the metal strip <b>10</b> due to the action of the conductor rolls <b>40</b> and <b>60</b>. In this current flowing state, the metal strip <b>10</b> is carried into the plating liquid <b>30</b> in the plating bath <b>20</b> thereby to allow the four anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>to act to perform alloy plating, and the alloy plated layers are formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0030">In the present embodiment, the metal strip <b>10</b> is not particularly limited. Examples of the metal strip <b>10</b> to be used include various metals, such as steel sheet, tin-free steel, aluminum alloy sheet, zinc plated steel sheet, zinc-cobalt-molybdenum composite plated steel sheet, zinc-nickel alloy plated steel sheet, zinc-iron alloy plated steel sheet, alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel sheet, zinc-aluminum alloy plated steel sheet, zinc-aluminum-magnesium alloy plated steel sheet, nickel plated steel sheet, copper plated steel sheet, and stainless steel sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0031">In the present embodiment, the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b> is also not particularly limited. In view of availability of metal pellets for forming the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>to be described later and the stability of the metal pellets, etc, examples of the alloy plated layer include nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer, nickel-tin alloy plated layer, nickel-zinc alloy plated layer, copper-nickel alloy plated layer, tin-zinc alloy plated layer, tin-copper alloy plated layer, tin-cobalt alloy plated layer, copper-zinc alloy plated layer, and copper-cobalt alloy plated layer. Among them, the nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is preferable because a high conductivity can be ensured when it is used for a container for batteries. In this case, it is preferred that the nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer has a content ratio of cobalt (z(Co)) within a range of 40 to 60 wt % (40â¦z(Co)â¦60). The content ratio of cobalt being within the above range allows to ensure a high conductivity while preventing the dissolution of cobalt into an electrolytic liquid when the nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is used for a container for batteries.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0032">An appropriate plating liquid may be used as the plating liquid <b>30</b> depending on the type and/or the alloy composition of the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>. There may ordinarily be used a plating liquid containing ions of respective metals that constitute the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>. For example, when the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b> is a nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer, the plating liquid <b>30</b> to be used may be a plating bath based on a Watts bath which contains nickel sulfate, nickel chloride, cobalt sulfate, and boric acid. The compounding amounts in this case may be within ranges of nickel sulfate: 10 to 300 g/L, nickel chloride: 20 to 60 g/L, cobalt sulfate: 10 to 250 g/L, and boric acid: 10 to 40 g/L. The present embodiment may be modified such that: a larger amount of the plating liquid <b>30</b> than the volume of the plating bath <b>20</b> is prepared; a part of the prepared plating liquid <b>30</b> is stored in a plating liquid bath (not shown) placed outside the plating bath <b>20</b>; and electrolytic treatment is performed while circulating the plating liquid between the plating liquid bath and the plating bath <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0033">In the present embodiment, an anode obtained by mixing two or more kinds of pellets of metals for forming the alloy plated layer on the metal strip <b>10</b> is used as each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d</i>. That is, when the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b> comprises an alloy of two kinds of metals, i.e., a metal M<sub>1 </sub>and a metal M<sub>2</sub>, for example, a mixture of pellets of the metal M<sub>1 </sub>and pellets of the metal M<sub>2 </sub>may be used. Details of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>will be described later.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0034">The rectifiers <b>80</b><i>a </i>and <b>80</b><i>b </i>are not particularly limited. Known rectifiers may be used depending on the magnitudes of currents to be supplied to the conductor rolls <b>40</b> and <b>60</b> and the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>and/or the voltages.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0035">According to the present embodiment, electroplating is performed for the metal strip <b>10</b> and the alloy plated layers are formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>, as will be described below.</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0060">Thus, as apparent from the specific numerical ranges when the weight ratio z(Co) of cobalt in the nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is set to z(Co)=50, for example, in order to form a stable alloy plated layer in the present embodiment, the mixing ratios (weight ratios) of the metal pellets that constitute the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>may have to be in a relationship that satisfies the above expressions rather than corresponding necessarily to the metal ratios (weight ratios) of the alloy plated layer.

A method of obtaining the mixing ratios (weight ratios) of the nickel pellets and the cobalt pellets from the total surface area ratio x(Co) of the cobalt pellets may be mentioned as a method of using values of the surface areas per unit weight of the nickel pellets and the cobalt pellets.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0061">The above description is exemplified mainly with reference to the case in which the nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>, but the present invention is not limited to such an embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0062">In the present embodiment, the shape and the mixing ratio of each of the plural kinds of metal pellets used as the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>may be within the above-described ranges. However, it may be inevitable that the metal pellets used as the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>are dissolved and consumed as the plating process proceeds, in general.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0063">In particular, when the densities of respective kinds of metal pellets are not significantly different and the target dissolution ratios are the same (1:1), the variations in the total surface area ratios of the respective kinds of metal pellets due to consumption can be suppressed and a stable alloy plated layer can thereby be formed if the respective kinds of metal pellets have the same shape and the same size. Therefore, it is preferred that the respective kinds of metal pellets have the same shape and the same size. However, even if metal pellets having the same shape and the same size are not available, or the densities of metals that constitute the respective kinds of metal pellets are different, or the target dissolution ratios are not the same (1:1), it is not necessarily required to use metal pellets having the same shape and the same size. In such a case, it is preferred to select and use metal pellets having shapes and sizes that can reduce the variations in the total surface area ratios of the respective kinds of metal pellets due to consumption. In particular, by adjusting the shapes and the sizes of the respective kinds of metal pellets, the variation in the surface area of each metal pellet due to consumption can be predicted even if the respective kinds of metal pellets do not necessarily have the same shape and the same size. Therefore, if such variations in the surface areas are synchronized between the respective kinds of metal pellets, the variations in the total surface area ratios of the respective kinds of metal pellets due to consumption can be effectively suppressed, and a stable alloy plated layer can thereby be formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0064">In addition to the above method, according to the present embodiment, also by regularly supplementing the respective kinds of metal pellets at predetermined ratios in order to supplement the consumed metal pellets as will be described later, it is possible to suppress the variations in the total surface area ratios of the respective kinds of metal pellets due to the effect of the metal pellets which have already been consumed.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0065">In the present embodiment, with consideration for stabilizing the composition of the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b>, it is preferred that the current density when performing the electroplating is 1 to 40 A/dm<sup>2 </sup>and the pH of the plating liquid <b>30</b> is 1.5 to 5. It is also preferred that the temperature of the plating liquid <b>30</b> (bath temperature) is 40Â° C. to 80Â° C. If the current density when performing the electroplating is unduly high or unduly low, or the pH of the plating liquid <b>30</b> is unduly high or unduly low, or the temperature of the plating liquid <b>30</b> is unduly high or unduly low, the composition of the alloy plated layer to be formed may possibly be unstable.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0066">In the present embodiment, as the plating process proceeds, the respective kinds of metal pellets will be dissolved and consumed. Therefore, it is preferred to regularly supplement the respective kinds of metal pellets into the anode basket. The supplemental ratio of each kind of metal pellets when supplementing the metal pellets may preferably be, but is not particularly limited to, a ratio corresponding to the weight ratio of each metal that constitutes the alloy plated layer. For example, the alloy plated layer to be formed on the metal strip <b>10</b> is a nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer with a content ratio of cobalt of 50 wt %, the ratio of each kind of metal pellets may be set such that a weight ratio of ânickel pellets:cobalt pelletsâ is 1:1. In particular, each kind of metal pellets in the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>dissolves with a weight ratio corresponding to the composition ratio of the alloy plated layer to be formed. Therefore, when supplementing the metal pellets according to the present embodiment, the supplement may preferably be performed with a ratio corresponding to the weight ratio of each metal that constitutes the alloy plated layer, thereby to allow the alloy plated layer to be formed stably. Thus, when supplementing the metal pellets according to the present embodiment, each kind of metal pellets may be supplemented with a ratio corresponding to the weight ratio of each metal that constitutes the alloy plated layer. Therefore, even if the metal pellets are consumed as the plating proceeds, the metal pellets can be readily supplemented.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0067">The timing of performing the supplement of metal pellets is not particularly limited. However, if the metal pellets dissolve to reduce the total surface area, i.e., the surface area of all the metal pellets that constitute the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>decreases, the current density of the anodes or the cathode may deviate from a set range. Therefore, the pellets may preferably be supplemented continuously.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0068">In the present embodiment, the metal pellets to be used as the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>are not particularly limited, but each metal pellet to be used may preferably have a representative length (which refers to the diameter in a case of spherical pellets, or in a case of other shape, refers to the maximum length of the shape) of 5 to 50 mm (preferably 5 to 40 mm) and a volume of 60 to 5,000 mm<sup>3</sup>. According to the present embodiment, by using the pellets having such representative length and volume, the metal pellets can be continuously supplemented with desired weight ratios when supplementing the metal pellets, while stabilizing the total surface area ratios without significant variations. Moreover, the specific surface area can be suppressed from varying due to consumption thereby to suppress the variation in the total surface area of each kind of metal pellets, and the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets can thus be suppressed from varying. Furthermore, by using the pellets having such representative length and volume, the metal pellets added during the supplement can suppress the variation in the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets due to the effect of the metal pellets which have already been consumed, and a sufficient stability can thus be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0069">In particular, if the representative length of the metal pellets is unduly large, the total surface area significantly varies when the metal pellets are added for supplement, so that the total surface area is unlikely to be stable, because the weight and the surface area of each metal pellet are large. In particular, when metal pellets having different sizes are used as the respective kinds of metal pellets, if the supplement of the metal pellets is performed in terms of the weight ratios as described above, the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets readily varies, which may be undesirable. In such circumstances, as a result of intensive studies with consideration for the plating rate and the size of anode basket which are industrially available; the size of the metal strip <b>10</b> to be plated with coating; and the scale of the plant, the inventors have found that the metal pellets having a representative length and a volume within the above ranges can be used thereby to suppress the variations in the total surface areas and the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets due to the supplement. Therefore, in view of suppressing such variations in the total surface areas and the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets due to the supplement, it is preferred in the present embodiment to use the metal pellets having a representative length and a volume within the above ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0070">However, if the size or volume of the metal pellets to be used (the initial size before being consumed) is unduly large, the difference between the specific surface area of the initial metal pellets before being consumed and that of the metal pellets after being consumed will be large. This may cause the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets to considerably vary due to consumption. As a result of the above, the composition of the alloy plated layer to be formed will be unstable, which may not be desirable. In addition, unduly large representative length of the metal pellets may make it difficult to fill the anode basket with the metal pellets with no spaces so that the filling rate is reduced, and there will possibly be hollow spaces in which no pellets exist. In this case, the solubility into the plating liquid <b>30</b> may also deteriorate.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0071">If, on the other hand, the representative length is unduly small or the volume is unduly small, the pellets may bound or drop when filling the anode basket, causing poor handling ability, and the pellets may come out from the mesh of the anode basket and get jammed to project between the anode basket and an anode bag which is provided outside the anode basket. Unduly large representative length may make it difficult to fill the anode basket with the metal pellets with no spaces so that the filling rate is reduced, and there will possibly be hollow spaces in which no pellets exist. In this case, the solubility into the plating liquid <b>30</b> may also deteriorate.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0072">In contrast, by using the metal pellets having a representative length of 5 to 50 mm and a volume of 60 to 5,000 mm<sup>3</sup>, the metal pellets can be continuously supplemented with desired weight ratios when supplementing the metal pellets, while stabilizing the total surface area ratios without significant variations. Moreover, the specific surface area can be suppressed from varying due to consumption thereby to suppress the variation in the total surface area of each kind of metal pellets. Furthermore, by using the metal pellets having such representative length and volume, the metal pellets added during the supplement can suppress the variation in the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets due to the effect of the metal pellets which have already been consumed, and a sufficient stability can thus be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0073">In the present embodiment, the shape of metal pellets used for the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>is not particularly limited, but there may preferably be used spherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical, coin-like or other such shapes. In particular, by using the metal pellets of such a shape to fill the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d</i>, even when the metal pellets are consumed (dissolved) and become small as the electroplating proceeds, the initial shape can be maintained to some extent of size. In addition, when dissolution further proceeds, the shape of metal pellets comes finally to spherical shape, and hence, calculation or prediction of the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets due to consumption can be easily performed. This may be advantageous because the total surface area ratio of each kind of metal pellets can be easily stabilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0074">In the present embodiment, metal salt compound powder may appropriately be added to the plating liquid in order to adjust the concentration of the plating liquid. Preferably, the additive amount of the metal salt compound powder may appropriately be set within a range that does not impair the action and effect of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0075">In the present embodiment, when the alloy plated layer is formed on the metal strip <b>10</b> by means of electroplating, an anode obtained by mixing two or more kinds of metal pellets for forming the alloy plated layer is used as each of the anodes (positive electrodes) <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the metal ion concentrations in the plating liquid included in the plating bath can be suppressed from varying. This allows the alloy plated layer to be formed stably on the metal strip <b>10</b>. In particular, according to the present embodiment, there may not occur a trouble that the counterpart anions increase, which would occur when employing a method of adding metal salt compound powders to the plating liquid and dissolving them in the plating liquid. It is therefore possible to effectively prevent the problem in association with the above trouble, i.e., the problem in that a target composition and desired properties of the plated film cannot be stably obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0076">In addition, according to the present embodiment, by varying the compounding ratios of the metal pellets for forming the alloy plated layer, the dissolution ratios of the anodes can be finely set. This allows the alloy plated layer to have an alloy composition which can be finely selected from a wide variety of composition ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0077">In particular, when a nickel-cobalt alloy plated layer is formed, there may be exemplified a method in which nickel electrodes and cobalt electrodes are used as anodes and these electrodes act as supply sources for nickel ions and cobalt ions. This method may involve problems as below.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0078">For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the plating line shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> may be configured such that: the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d </i>that constitute a part of the plating line are provided as nickel electrodes; the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>that constitute a part of the plating line are provided as cobalt electrodes; and a current of 1,000 A flows through each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>in order to form nickel-cobalt alloy plated layers having a ratio of nickel and cobalt of 1:1 in molar ratio. In this example, one surface of the metal strip <b>10</b> (the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d</i>) will be formed thereon with an alloy layer having a nickel-rich composition while the other surface (the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c</i>) will be formed thereon with an alloy layer having a cobalt-rich composition, thus causing a composition variation.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0079">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, another example may be used such that: the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>are configured as with the example shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>; a current to flow through each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d </i>is set to 1,333 A; and a current to flow through each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>is set to 666 A, in order to form nickel-cobalt alloy plated layers having a ratio of nickel and cobalt of 2:1 in molar ratio. In this example, one surface of the metal strip <b>10</b> (the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d</i>) will be formed thereon with an alloy layer having a nickel-rich composition while the other surface (the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c</i>) will be formed thereon with an alloy layer having a cobalt-rich composition, thus causing a composition variation, as with the above example shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. In addition, in this example shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a trouble may occur that the ratio of the thickness of the alloy layer formed on the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d </i>and the thickness of the alloy layer formed on the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>is a ratio that depends on the current amounts, i.e., a ratio of 2:1. Furthermore, a coating film may not possibly be obtained with desired properties because of the different current densities.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0080">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a further example may be used such that: the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>d </i>that constitute a part of the plating line are provided as nickel electrodes; the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>that constitute a part of the plating line are provided as cobalt electrodes; and nickel-cobalt alloy plated layers are formed to have a ratio of nickel and cobalt of 2:1 in molar ratio as with the above example shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. In this case, different from the above case of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the ratio of the thickness of the alloy layer formed on the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d </i>and the thickness of the alloy layer formed on the surface close to the anodes <b>70</b><i>b </i>and <b>70</b><i>c </i>can be even, but the problem of causing a composition variety still remains. Also in this case, a coating film may not possibly be obtained with desired properties because of the different current densities.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0081">In addition, in the examples shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the current amount to be supplied to each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>may have to be controlled independently. Therefore, different from the example shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, respective rectifies are required to be used for the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>to <b>70</b><i>d </i>(i.e., four rectifiers are required in the examples shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Thus, a problem may arise in that the manufacturing cost increases compared with the example shown in FIG. I.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0082">To overcome such a problem, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, it may be proposed to provide two rectifiers in the example shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, for example. A possible trouble in this case will be explained with reference to the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d</i>, for example. That is, despite the intention to flow a current of 1,000 A evenly through each of the anodes <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d</i>, the current of 1,000 A cannot flow evenly through each anode because of being affected by the resistance of a current line to each anode or the like. Accordingly, the composition of the alloy layer to be obtained may not be appropriately controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0083">In contrast, according to the present embodiment, the compounding ratios of respective kinds of metal pellets for forming the alloy plated layer can be varied thereby to finely set the dissolution ratios of the anodes. In addition, the ratio of metal ions supplied from each anode can be even. Therefore, the troubles as in the above examples shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> to <figref>FIG. 5</figref> can be effectively prevented from occurring.</p>
