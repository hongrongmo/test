  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150924" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The present invention is a method for growing and distributing living food crops to an intended recipient prior to harvesting that includes the utilization of a production unit to grow the food crops and a transportation cart to efficiently deliver the production units. This method prevents critical losses of nutritional content resulting from extended periods of non-consumption subsequent to harvesting. Additionally, the foods created and distributed by this method have increased aesthetic appeal to the consumer and enhanced natural taste. The novel method includes planting and growing the desired food crops in production units, transporting the production units to an intended recipient once the crop reaches a predetermined ripeness, and mounting the production units at a recipient desired location. The food crops remain in the production units until ready for use, purchase, or consumption, at which point the food crops are harvested.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention relates, generally, to food production and distribution. More specifically, it relates to growing and distributing food crops before harvesting.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Recent concerns in diet-related health problems have increased the interest in the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables. According to Diane M. Barrett in Maximizing the Nutritional Value of Fruits &amp; Vegetables, most food crops are subject to high respiration rates, resulting in moisture loss, quality and nutrient degradation, and potential microbial spoilage, once separated from their nutritional source.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Conventional cultivation systems lack mobility and accessibility. Accordingly, the crops must be harvested and refrigerated until delivered. This adds significant expense and reduces food qualityânutritional value and aesthetic appeal to the consumer. Accordingly, what is needed is a method for distributing food crops before harvesting. However, in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the field of this invention how the shortcomings of the prior art could be overcome.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">All referenced publications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Furthermore, where a definition or use of a term in a reference, which is incorporated by reference herein, is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein, the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in the reference does not apply.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">While certain aspects of conventional technologies have been discussed to facilitate disclosure of the invention, Applicants in no way disclaim these technical aspects, and it is contemplated that the claimed invention may encompass one or more of the conventional technical aspects discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention may address one or more of the problems and deficiencies of the prior art discussed above. However, it is contemplated that the invention may prove useful in addressing other problems and deficiencies in a number of technical areas. Therefore, the claimed invention should not necessarily be construed as limited to addressing any of the particular problems or deficiencies discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In this specification, where a document, act or item of knowledge is referred to or discussed, this reference or discussion is not an admission that the document, act or item of knowledge or any combination thereof was at the priority date, publicly available, known to the public, part of common general knowledge, or otherwise constitutes prior art under the applicable statutory provisions; or is known to be relevant to an attempt to solve any problem with which this specification is concerned.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for method of live food distribution is now met by a new, useful, and nonobvious invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The novel method includes planting growing a food crop in a production unit, wherein the production unit has a front wall, a back wall, two side walls, a growth medium, a growth outlet, and is adapted to be mounted in a vertical plane. Once the food crops have reached a desired ripeness, the production units containing the food crops are transported to an intended recipient. The transportation of the production units includes the use of a transportation cart having a mounting support on which the production unit may be mounted. Before mounting the production units in the recipient's display unit or hanging storage, any previously left production units lacking food crops are removed from the recipient's display unit. The just delivered production units containing the food crops are then mounted in the recipient's display unit. The mounted production units are left with the recipients and the food crops remain in the production units until harvested for use.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In a certain embodiment, the harvesting of the food crops from the production unit takes place in view of the potential consumers. Such an embodiment may also include the step of the consumer choosing the particular food crop to be harvested.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The growth medium is preferably a hydroponic medium selected from the group consisting of coconut chips, rock-wool, grow rocks, and any combination of the foregoing.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">These and other important objects, advantages, and features of the invention will become clear as this disclosure proceeds.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the disclosure set forth hereinafter and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part thereof, and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The present invention is a method for distributing living/growing food crops to an intended recipient prior to harvesting that utilizes a production unit to grow the food crops, a transportation cart to efficiently deliver the production units, and a display system to store the production units at the recipient's facility. The method prevents critical losses of nutritional content that results from extended periods of non-consumption subsequent to harvesting. Additionally, the foods created and distributed by this method have increased aesthetic appeal to the consumer and enhanced natural taste.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The method includes planting a predetermined food crop in the production unit. The production units are vertical food crop growing containers having a back wall, a front wall, a bottom, and two sides. The production unit is adapted, preferably with a hanger on the back wall, to be mounted in a generally vertical plane on a wall, a post, or other substantially vertical, upstanding support structure. The walls create an interior in which a growing medium can be inserted. The growing medium is preferably a hydroponic medium that may include coconut chips, rock-wool, grow rocks and the like. Moreover, the growing medium is preferably a non-granular medium that will remain in the production unit during transportation and harvesting. The front wall includes at least one growth outlet providing the food crops with an opening to extend outwardly from the growing medium. The production units may include additional features to aid in the growing process as is known by a person having ordinary skill in the art, such as a drip line access and drainage apertures.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Once the food crops are planted in the production unit, the production unit is mounted on a vertical support structure. A subsistence management system is employed to optimize and sustain crop growth while the production unit is mounted in its vertical orientation. Such a system may include hydration, fertilization, aeration, illumination, and/or any other techniques for crop growth optimization known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. In a certain embodiment of the subsistence management system, the system may be smaller than the area requiring subsistence management and therefore have the ability to travel, preferably automatically, throughout the area requiring subsistence management.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Upon the food crop reaching a predetermined ripeness or maturity, the production unit is removed from the vertical support structure and transported to an intended recipient. A unique transportation cart is used to improve the ease and speed of transportation. The transportation cart contains a mounting support allowing multiple production units to be carried in a similar vertical orientation as to when production units were mounted during the crop growing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The production units are hung in a vertical orientation at a predetermined location of the recipient's choosing. The production units take the place of any previously left production units that no longer contain food crops. The removed production units are placed on the transportation cart and removed from the recipient's facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The transportation cart improves the speed at which a delivery person can enter the recipient's facility, remove empty production units, hang the new set of production units, and exit the facility. Improving the delivery time reduces potential disruptions of the flow of recipient's business, which improves the business relationship between the recipient and the grower. The transportation cart also enables the delivery person to complete more deliveries in less time than would be possible without the transportation cart.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The food crop remains in the production unit until the food is purchased or harvested for consumption. In a certain embodiment, the production units are displayed in the recipient's facility at a location such that potential consumers of the food crops may view the food crops. Such an embodiment allows the consumer to select the particular food crop he/she may want and view the harvesting of the food crop. Consequently, the consumer knows that the harvested food is extremely fresh and never frozen.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in an embodiment generally denoted by reference numeral <b>10</b>, the method of distributing live food crops includes planting and growing the desired food crops in production units (step <b>20</b>). The production units are transported to an intended recipient once the crop reaches a predetermined ripeness (step <b>30</b>). A transportation cart is used to deliver the production units inside the recipient's facility (step <b>40</b>). Any production units that were previously delivered to the recipient and are lacking food crops, are removed from a recipient's display unit (step <b>50</b>). The newly delivered production units are then mounted in the recipient's display unit (step <b>60</b>). The food crops remain in the production units until ready for use, purchase, or consumption, at which point one or more of the food crops are harvested (step <b>70</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a certain embodiment, generally denoted by reference numeral <b>80</b>, of steps <b>60</b> and <b>70</b>âmounting the production units in the display unit and leaving the food crops in the production unit until harvesting. Display unit <b>90</b> includes base portion <b>100</b> and back wall <b>110</b> on which vertical support members <b>120</b> are attached. Two horizontal beams <b>130</b> extend the length of display unit <b>90</b> and are attached on the front of vertical support members <b>120</b> resulting in a gap between horizontal beams <b>130</b> and back wall <b>110</b>. The gap allows for the hangers (not shown) on the back wall of production units <b>140</b> to be mounted on horizontal beams <b>130</b>. Food crops <b>300</b> grow through growth outlets <b>150</b> in production unit <b>140</b> and are displayed to potential consumers.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Base portion <b>100</b> may include slits <b>102</b> on top surface <b>104</b> of base portion <b>100</b> to collect fallen debris. Base portion <b>100</b> may also be used as a step to aid in the mounting of production units <b>140</b> and harvesting of food crops <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides an isolated view of an embodiment of the production unit generally denoted by reference numeral <b>140</b>. Production unit <b>140</b> includes front wall <b>160</b>, back wall <b>170</b>, and two side walls <b>180</b>. Additionally, production unit <b>140</b> contains three growth outlets <b>150</b> disposed on front wall <b>160</b>. The four walls (<b>160</b>, <b>170</b>, and <b>180</b>) create interior <b>190</b> in which a growing medium can be inserted.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In a certain embodiment of the production unit, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> and generally denoted by reference numeral <b>200</b>, the production unit may include lid <b>210</b> and/or additional growth outlets <b>150</b>. Certain embodiments may employ any number of growth outlets such that the number of growth outlets does not increase the size of the production unit to an unmovable size, as is known by a person having ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> exemplifies a certain embodiment of hanger <b>220</b> disposed on back wall <b>170</b> of production unit <b>140</b>. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows hanger <b>220</b> mounted to horizontal beam <b>130</b>. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows bottom <b>230</b> of production unit <b>140</b>. Bottom <b>230</b> contains drainage apertures <b>240</b> to allow water to exit bottom <b>230</b>. In a certain embodiment, production units <b>140</b> are arranged so that any water exiting bottom <b>230</b> of a certain production unit may enter the top of a production unit mounted below the certain production unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> exemplifies a certain embodiment of the transportation cart, generally denoted by reference numeral <b>250</b>, used to easily transport multiple production units. Transportation cart <b>250</b> includes handles <b>260</b> to aid in maneuvering transportation cart <b>250</b> and mounting supports <b>270</b> to mount production units <b>140</b> (see <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>). Transportation cart <b>250</b> includes base <b>280</b> to catch any falling debris from the production units. Base <b>280</b> is a crucial component to maintain the cleanliness necessary in typical food establishments. As shown in <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, the top mounting support provides a beam on which hanger <b>220</b> can mount and the bottom mounting support prevents production units <b>140</b> from swinging off the top mounting support. In a certain embodiment, mounting supports <b>270</b> may utilize any design known to a person having ordinary skill in the art that allows one or more production units to be mounted to the transportation cart. Moreover, a certain embodiment may have additional mounting supports to secure multiple rows of production units or taller production units.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In a certain embodiments, the production unit may be any shape as long as it includes at least one growth outlet on a vertical surface. Opposite the growth outlet would include a hanger or any other mounting known to a person having ordinary skill in the art. For example, if the production unit had a cylindrical shape, a growth outlet would be preferably about <b>180</b> degrees in circumference from the mounting. However, depending on the design of the display unit, the production unit may have a hanger, or any other mounting, located on any point on the production unit such that the production unit can be mounted to the display unit with the food crop accessible and viewable to consumers and the recipient.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">For example, the present invention may utilize a hanger extending from the top of the production unit. Such an embodiment of the production unit may include two sets of growth outlets on the vertical surfaces (or surface when the production unit is cylindrical) of the production unit such that the two sets are located on surfaces opposite each other (or with 180 degree in separation around the circumference of a cylindrical production unit). The display unit to accompany this production unit would likely act as a partition wall in which people could walk on both the front and back sides of the display unit. The production units would preferably mount to beams extending the length of the display unit and the production units would be oriented so that the growth outlets would be facing roughly perpendicular to the length of the display unit and therefore be accessible and visible to people on either side of the display unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In a certain embodiment, the display unit may have more or less horizontal beams to account for the height of the display unit and the height of the production units to maximize space. There may be multiple rows of production units or a single row of taller production units. In a certain embodiment, the vertical support members may be attached to the top and bottom of the display unit or there may be no vertical support members and the horizontal beams may be attached to the sides of the display unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In a certain embodiment of the transportation cart, the cart may include notches or any other structural features in the mounting supports to prevent the production units from sliding in the longitudinal direction of the cart.</p>
