      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to an ink composition and a recording apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A resin emulsion in the related art is a core-shell type resin emulsion. A study on a core-shell type resin emulsion having a structure in which core part is made of a thermoplastic resin and shell part is made of a resin having a three-dimensional crosslinked structure has been conducted in order that the storage stability of a recorded image is excellent, if necessary, the recorded image can be easily erased from a recording medium, and the recording medium can be suitably repeatedly used (JP-A-2002-12802). In addition, a study on a core-shell type resin emulsion having a structure in which a core made of an acryl-based resin is covered with a polycarbonate-based urethane resin shell has been conducted in order to obtain an ink having excellent ejection stability and storage stability and excellent image toughness such as marker resistance, abrasion resistance, or the like (JP-A-2012-25947). Further, a study on a resin emulsion having a core-shell structure in which an outer layer is made of a urethane resin and an inner layer is made of an acrylic resin has been conducted in order to obtain an ink capable of being printed even on an ink non-absorptive material such as plastic, metal, or the like and having excellent adhesivity, film forming properties, and chemical resistance (JP-A-2012-92224). Furthermore, a study on a tri-block polymer, although different from a core-shell type resin emulsion, has been conducted in order to provide an aqueous ink for an ink jet having excellent storage stability and ejection stability and high abrasion resistance of an image (JP-A-2012-72354).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, in the ink disclosed in JP-A-2002-12802, fixability cannot be obtained because the shell part has a crosslinked structure, and in the ink disclosed in JP-A-2012-25947, it is difficult to improve fixability and obtain clogging recovery properties because the shell part is made of a polycarbonate-based urethane resin. Even in the ink disclosed in JP-A-2012-92224, it is difficult to improve fixability and obtain clogging recovery properties because the shell part is made of urethane. Moreover, since the ink disclosed in JP-A-2012-72354 has a tri-block structure, ejection stability is obtained selectively, but it is difficult to obtain clogging recovery properties.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An advantageous of some aspects of the invention is to provide an ink composition having excellent fixability and frictional resistance and having excellent clogging recovery properties to improve ejection stability, and a recording apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present inventors have conducted intensive studies. As a result, the invention has been completed by defining the particle diameter of a monomer or core-shell.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, there is provided an ink composition, including: a color material; water; and a polymer particle, in which the polymer particle has a core-shell structure including a core polymer and a shell polymer, the polymer particle has an average particle diameter of 10 nm to 80 nm, the core polymer has a glass transition temperature of lower than 60Â° C., the shell polymer has a glass transition temperature of higher than or equal to 60Â° C., and the core polymer includes an aromatic monomer having at least a vinyl group as a constitutional unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to the ink composition of the aspect of the invention, it is difficult to form a large lump even when this ink composition is aggregated, and thus it is possible to suppress the clogging of nozzles.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In addition, by setting the glass transition temperature of the core polymer to be lower than 60Â° C., the core polymer can be easily discharged after the shell polymer is softened, and thus there is a tendency of the ink composition to have more excellent adhesivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Further, by setting the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer to be higher than or equal to 60Â° C., when the ink composition is ejected under a high-temperature environment, it is possible to eject the polymer particles from a recording head without disrupting a core-shell type structure, and it is possible to further suppress the deposition of the polymer particles in nozzles, so that the clogging of nozzles can be prevented, and the stability of the ink composition in intermittent printing tends to become more excellent. When a film is formed on the recording medium, the ink composition on the recording medium is heated to a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer, and thus the core polymer is discharged from the softened shell polymer, thereby forming a film on the recording medium by the core polymer and the shell polymer. At this time, the softened core polymer spreads and adheres onto the recording medium, thereby forming a film having excellent fixability.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Moreover, since the core polymer includes an aromatic monomer having at least a vinyl group as a constitutional unit, the core polymer can form a hydrophobic film, thereby improving the frictional resistance, more specifically, water friction resistance of the recorded image.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Preferably, the ink composition of the aspect of the invention is recorded on the heated recording medium. Particularly, even when recording is performed in a heated state, ejection stability can be improved, and simultaneously the fixability and printing durability of the recorded image can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the shell polymer includes an aromatic monomer as a constitutional unit. The shell polymer has an acid value, and the core polymer does not have an acid value. When the shell polymer includes an aromatic monomer as a constitutional unit, a detailed action mechanism is unknown, but ejection bending is prevented. In particular, in the case of small dots, ink droplets easily bend. Therefore, according to the aspect of the invention, ejection bending is suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Preferably, the polymer particle is synthesized without substantially using an emulsifier. Here, the âemulsifierâ means a surfactant used in synthesis. The ink composition containing the polymer particles synthesized using such an emulsifier is problematic in that foaming easily occurs, the gloss of an image hardly appears, and foreign matter is easily generated. According to the aspect of the invention, the ink composition for overcoming the above problem is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Preferably, the ink composition includes a cyclic nitrogen compound or an aprotic polar solvent, and the recording medium is made of polyvinyl chloride. When the ink composition includes a cyclic nitrogen compound or an aprotic polar solvent, it is possible to shift the glass transition temperature of the apparent polymer particles to a low-temperature region, and it is possible to soften the core polymer and the shell polymer at a temperature lower than the original temperature, thereby improving the fixability of the ink composition onto the recording medium. Thus, in particular, when the recording medium is made of polyvinyl chloride, it is possible to improve the fixability of the ink composition onto the recording medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">For example, the core polymer includes a nitrogen-containing monomer, and the recording medium is made of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon, or polyethylene. When the core polymer includes a nitrogen-containing monomer, it is possible to increase the polarity of the core polymer. In particular, when the recording medium is made of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon, or polyethylene, it is possible to improve the fixability of the film of the core polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">For example, the shell polymer includes (meth)acrylic acid as a constitutional unit. Therefore, a hydrophilic shell polymer can be formed by polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Preferably, the shell polymer has an acid value of 20 mgKOH/g to 120 mgKOH/g. When the acid value of the shell polymer is within the above range, sufficient hydrophilicity necessary for the shell polymer can be secured.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a recording apparatus, including: the above-described ink composition; and an ejection head for ejecting this ink composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">For example, the ejection head includes nozzles for ejecting the ink composition, and dots of the ink composition can be ejected in a multi-size from one of the nozzles.</p>

Examples of water include pure water, such as ion exchange water, ultrafiltered water, reverse osmosis water, and distilled water; and ultrapure water which is obtained by completely removing ionic impurities as much as possible. In addition, when water sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation or addition of hydrogen peroxide is used, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of mold and bacteria in the case where a pigment dispersion liquid and an ink using the same are stored for a long period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The content of water is not particularly limited, and may be appropriately determined as necessary.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Polymer Particle</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The polymer particle has a core-shell structure including a core polymer and a shell polymer and has an average particle diameter of 10 nm to 80 nm. Here, the core polymer has a glass transition temperature of lower than 50Â° C., and the shell polymer has a glass transition temperature of higher than or equal to 50Â° C. Further, the core polymer includes an aromatic monomer having at least a vinyl group as a constitutional unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The core-shell structure refers to a structure in which a core polymer is formed in the void of a shell polymer. Therefore, the core-shell structure includes not only a structure in which the surface of the core polymer is covered with the shell polymer, but also a structure in which a part of the void of a three-dimensional network structure caused by the shell polymer is filled with the core polymer. Accordingly, the core-shell structure in the present specification includes a structure of a polymer particle in which the boundary between the core part and the shell part are not exactly clear.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The glass transition temperature of the core polymer is lower than 60Â° C., and preferably higher than or equal to 0Â° C. and lower than 60Â° C. When the glass transition temperature of the core polymer is lower than 60Â° C., the core polymer can be easily discharged after the shell polymer is softened, and thus the ink composition has more excellent adhesivity. In addition, when the glass transition temperature of the core polymer is higher than or equal to 0Â° C., the storage stability of the ink composition is excellent.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The glass transition temperature of the shell polymer is higher than or equal to 60Â° C., and preferably higher than or equal to 60Â° C. and lower than or equal to 150Â° C. When the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer is higher than or equal to 60Â° C., in the case where the ink composition is ejected under a high-temperature environment, it is possible to eject the polymer particles from a recording head without disrupting a core-shell type structure, and it is possible to further suppress the deposition of the polymer particles in nozzles, so that the clogging of nozzles can be prevented, and the stability of the ink composition in intermittent printing tends to become more excellent. In the case where a film is formed on the recording medium, the ink composition on the recording medium is heated to a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer, and thus the core polymer flows out from the shell polymer, thereby forming a film on the recording medium by the core polymer and the shell polymer. At this time, the softened core polymer spreads and adheres onto the recording medium, thereby forming a film having excellent fixability. Further, when the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer is lower than or equal to 150Â° C., the shell polymer on the recording medium is easily softened, and thus the adhesivity of the ink composition tends to become excellent. Meanwhile, when the glass transition temperature of the shell polymer is higher than 150Â° C., the thermal deformation property of the emulsion type resin becomes poor, thus making a negative influence such as thickening or the like on the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">When the average particle diameter of the polymer particles is 10 nm to 80 nm, which is relatively small, the ink composition is characterized in that the gloss of the recorded image easily appears, and excellent film forming properties are exhibited. In addition, when the average particle diameter of the polymer particles is relatively small, a large lump is hardly formed even when the polymer particles are aggregated, and thus it is possible to suppress the clogging of nozzles. Further, when the average particle diameter of the polymer particles is small, the viscosity of the ink composition can be increased relatively high, and thus it is possible to prevent the viscosity of the ink composition from being lowered to such a degree that ink ejection properties becomes unstable, even when the temperature of the ink composition rises in the recording head. Moreover, in the present specification, the average particle diameter is based on volume unless otherwise specified. For example, the average particle diameter may be measured by a particle size distribution analyzer using a laser diffraction scattering method as a measurement principle. An example of the particle size distribution analyzer includes a particle size distribution meter (for example, Microtrac UPA, manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd.) using a dynamic light scattering method as a measurement principle.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Glass transition temperature (hereinafter, referred to as âTgâ) is calculated by using an analysis method such as viscoelasticity measurement, thermal analysis or the like, or by using a calculation formula based on Tg of homopolymer of commonly known polymerizable monomers. When the resin included in the core polymer and the following shell polymer is a copolymer, the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the copolymer can be calculated by the following FOX Equation based on Tg<sub>n </sub>(unit: K) of hompolymer and mass fraction (W<sub>n</sub>) of monomer.</p>

In addition, when a polymer is a copolymer, the glass transition temperature thereof can be controlled by considering Tg of the above homopolymer and the above FOX Equation.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">The core polymer is designed to be a highly hydrophobic polymer. Therefore, it is preferred that the core polymer do not have an acid value. In addition, the core polymer includes an aromatic monomer having at least a vinyl group as a constitutional unit. Therefore, the core polymer becomes hydrophobic, and thus a hydrophobic film can be formed. As a result, it is possible to improve water friction resistance that is one of the frictional resistances of a recorded image.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0048">The aromatic monomer having a vinyl group is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include styrene, Î±-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, chlorostyrene, and divinyl benzene.</p>

When the core polymer includes a nitrogen-containing monomer, it is possible to increase the polarity of the core polymer, and particularly, the fixability of the film of the core polymer can be improved when the recording medium is made of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon, or polyethylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0050">The nitrogen-containing monomer is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include (meth)acrylamide, (meth)acrylonitrile, N-alkoxymethyl (meth)acrylamide, alkyl (meth)acrylamides, dialkyl (meth)acrylamide, dialkylaminopropyl (meth)acrylamide, and hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylamide.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0051">The shell polymer is not particularly limited in its raw material if its glass transition temperature is lower than 60Â° C., but preferably it includes an aromatic monomer as a constitutional unit. When the shell polymer includes an aromatic monomer as a constitutional unit, a detailed action mechanism is unknown, but the ejection bending is prevented. In particular, in the case of small dots, ink droplets easily bend, and thus ejection bending is suppressed according to an aspect of the invention. Therefore, the ink composition according to an aspect of the invention is particularly suitable for a head that can eject ink dots in a multi-size from one nozzle.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0052">The aromatic monomer is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include styrene, Î±-methyl styrene, p-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, chlorostyrene, and divinyl benzene, each of which is an aromatic monomer having a vinyl group. In addition, the aromatic monomer may be an aromatic monomer having no vinyl group.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0053">Preferably, the shell polymer includes (meth)acrylic acid as a constitutional unit. Therefore, hydrophilicity becomes high to improve the dispersion stability of polymer particles, and simultaneously the viscosity of the ink composition becomes relatively low to improve the ejection stability of the ink composition. In addition, the polymer particles according to the present embodiment are synthesized without substantially using an emulsifier as described later. When the shell polymer includes (meth)acrylic acid as a constitutional unit, it is possible to form a hydrophilic shell polymer having a void, and it is possible to form a hydrophobic core polymer in this void.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0054">The shell polymer has an acid value because it is hydrophilic. Preferably, the shell polymer has an acid value of 20 mgKOH/g to 120 mgKOH/g. When the acid value of the shell polymer is within the above range, sufficient hydrophilicity necessary for the shell polymer can be secured.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0055">The weight average molecular weight of the shell polymer is not particularly limited, but is, for example, more than or equal to 10,000 and less than or equal to 100,000.</p>

Still more preferably, the mass of the core polymer is 40% to 80% when the mass of the shell polymer is 100%. For this reason, the balance between the mass of the core polymer and the mass of the shell polymer becomes good, so that the fixability of the ink composition is good, the ejection stability of the ink composition is excellent, and vertical misalignment tends to hardly occur. The vertical misalignment refers to a phenomenon that, in the continuous ejection of ink, ink is partially solidified around a nozzle by long-term ejection, and thus clear vertical lines cannot be printed due to curved ejection direction.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Method of Forming Polymer Particles</heading>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0058">There is no limitation to the formation method of the above-mentioned polymer particles, but preferably, the polymer particles are formed by soap-free polymerization without substantially using an emulsifier. The soap-free polymerization refers to a polymerization process for forming a core-shell polymer without substantially using an emulsifier. Here, the âemulsifierâ means a surfactant used in synthesis. Further, an example of the soap-free polymerization includes a process of polymerizing polymer particles under the condition of the content of an emulsifier in a solution being less than or equal to 1 mass %. In the related art, the ink composition containing the polymer particles synthesized using such an emulsifier is problematic in that foaming easily occurs, the gloss of an image is difficult to appear, and foreign matter is easily generated. According to an aspect of the invention, an ink composition that suppresses the occurrence of such problems can be obtained. In the soap-free polymerization, for example, a shell polymer containing (meth)acrylic acid as a constitutional unit is formed, and a core polymer is formed in the shell polymer. Moreover, when polymer particles are formed using soap-free polymerization, the average particle diameter of the polymer particles becomes very small, and the ejection stability and glossiness of an ink composition are improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0059">The surfactant used in synthesis is not particularly limited, but an anionic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant are preferable. Examples of the anionic surfactant include sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, sodium laurate, and ammonium salts of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate. Examples of the nonionic surfactant include polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, polyoxyethylene alkyl amines, and polyoxyethylene alkyl amides. The core-shell polymer used in the present embodiment is prepared without using these surfactants.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0060">The polymerization initiator used in the soap-free polymerization is not particularly limited, but is preferably a hydrophilic polymerization initiator. Examples thereof include potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0061">An example of the soap-free polymerization method will be described, but a synthesis method is not limited to the following method. For example, ion exchange water and a polymerization initiator are put into a polymerization reactor provided with a jacket, and the pressure in the polymerization reactor is reduced to remove oxygen, and then the pressure therein is set to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen to make a nitrogen atmosphere. First, under the nitrogen atmosphere, the temperature in the polymerization reactor is set to predetermined temperature, and then a pre-emulsion solution containing monomers (to become a constituent of a shell polymer) is dropped by a predetermined amount to perform a polymerization reaction to thus synthesize a shell polymer. Next, a core polymer is obtained by polymerizing the monomers using the void of the obtained shell polymer as a polymerization field, thereby synthesizing the polymer particles according to the present embodiment. Specifically, a monomer mixture containing the above-mentioned hydrophobic monomers is dropped into an aqueous dispersion medium containing a shell polymer to obtain a core polymer by polymerization, and the obtained core polymer is formed into polymer particles. As such, when a shell polymer is used as the polymerization field of a core polymer, there is no need to use an emulsifier in the monomer mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0062">According to such a soap-free polymerization, the content of an emulsifier in the ink composition can be easily set to 0.01 mass % or less, and the average particle diameter of the polymer particles can also be adjusted very small.</p>

Thus, in particular, when the recording medium is made of polyvinyl chloride, it is possible to improve the fixability of the ink composition onto the recording medium.</p>

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">In addition, when the IR heater <b>3</b> is used, the recording medium can be heated from the side of the ejection head <b>2</b>. Therefore, the ejection head <b>2</b> is also heated simultaneously, but the temperature of the recording medium can be increased without being affected by the thickness of the recording medium, compared to when the recording medium is heated from the back side thereof by the platen heater <b>4</b> or the like. Further, when the platen heater <b>4</b> is used, the recording medium can be heated from the side opposite to the side of the ejection head <b>2</b>. Thus, the ejection head <b>2</b> becomes relatively difficult to heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0089">Preferably, at the time of ejecting the ink composition onto the recording medium, the recording apparatus <b>1</b> further includes a recording medium heating unit for heating a recording medium such that the surface temperature of the recording medium is higher than or equal to 35Â° C. More preferably, the surface temperature thereof is higher than or equal to 35Â° C. and lower than or equal to 60Â° C. The recording medium heating unit is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include the IR heater <b>3</b> and a platen heater <b>4</b>. When the recording apparatus <b>1</b> includes the recording medium heating unit, the ink composition adhered to the recording medium can be rapidly dried, and bleeding can be further suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0090">The drying unit serves to heat and dry the recording medium coated with the ink composition for ink jet. The drying unit is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include the curing heater <b>5</b>, a hot air mechanism (not shown), and a thermostatic bath (not shown). When the drying unit heats the recording medium on which an image is recorded, moisture or the like contained in the ink composition is more rapidly volatilized and scattered, and thus a film is formed by the polymer particles contained in the ink composition. In this way, dried ink matter is strongly fixed (adhered) on the recording medium, and thus a high-quality image having excellent frictional resistance can be obtained in a short time. The temperature of the drying unit is preferably higher than that of the recording medium heating unit, more preferably higher than or equal to 70Â° C., and still more preferably higher than or equal to 70Â° C. and lower than or equal to 110Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0091">In addition, the above described âheating the recording mediumâ refers to raising the temperature of the recording medium to desired temperature, and is not limited to directly heating the recording medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0092">The recording apparatus <b>1</b> may have the cooling fan <b>6</b>. When the ink composition on the recording medium is cooled by the cooling fan <b>6</b> after the drying, a film having excellent adhesivity can be formed on the recording medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0093">In addition, the recording apparatus <b>1</b> may include the preheater <b>7</b> for previously heating (preheating) the recording medium before the ejection of the ink composition onto the recording medium. Further, the recording apparatus <b>1</b> may include the ventilation fan <b>8</b> for more efficiently drying the ink composition adhered to the recording medium.</p>

      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0111">From test results of the ink compositions for ink jet recording of Examples 1 to 9, it was found that the ejection stability thereof from the nozzle of a recording head become good, and the frictional resistance of the image recorded on a recording medium becomes good. In addition, the fact that the frictional resistance in the ink compositions of Examples was improved shows that the fixability thereof was also improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0112">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 1, unlike Example 1, polymer particles having a large particle diameter of 150 nm are obtained, and thus sufficient frictional resistance and ejection stability cannot be obtained, because commonly known emulsion polymerization, in which an emulsifier (sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate) is added to the raw materials of Example 1 in an amount of 1 part to perform polymerization, is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0113">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 2, polymer particles has a large particle diameter of 85 nm, and thus sufficient frictional resistance and ejection stability cannot be obtained, because the amount of a polymerization initiator is reduced to â to increase polymerization time by three times although using soap-free polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0114">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 3, polymer particles has a small particle diameter of 9 nm, and thus sufficient frictional resistance and ejection stability cannot be obtained, because the amount of a polymerization initiator is increased by ten times to reduce polymerization time to â.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0115">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 4, sufficient frictional resistance cannot be obtained, and ejection stability is poor, because a core polymer has an acid value.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0116">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 5, frictional resistance is good, but sufficient ejection stability cannot be obtained, because Tg of any one of core polymer and shell polymer is higher than or equal to 60Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0117">In the ink composition for ink jet recording of Comparative Example 6, sufficient frictional resistance cannot be obtained, and ejection stability is also poor, because Tg of any one of core polymer and shell polymer is lower than 60Â° C.</p>
