The disclosure also provides cDNA, recombinant DNA constructs, recombinant DNA vectors, and recombinant host cells comprising the OsAlba1 cDNA.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Availability of water is the most crucial factor that limits the productivity potential of higher plants and is a serious threat to sustainable crop production. In order to improve the agricultural productivity under water-deficit condition or dehydration, it is required to first understand the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which plants tolerate such stress. Extensive investigations at the molecular level of plant response to environmental stresses have led to the cloning of various stress inducible genes (Ingram et al., Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 1996, 47, 377-403; Bray, Trends Plant Sci., 1997, 2, 48-54). Nevertheless, the significance of these genes in stress tolerance is incomplete without the knowledge of their function. Most studies on stress adaptation have mainly focused on the changes in gene expression, while far less information is available on their protein counterparts. Rice is the most important food cereal, with nearly half of the world's population relying on its successful harvests. While rice is the first crop plant to have its complete genome sequenced (Goff et al., Science, 2002, 296, 92-100; Yu et al., Science, 2002, 296, 79-92), the functions of most of the predicted genes are unknown. Therefore, characterization of these unknown genes is one of the major challenges of the rice functional genomics.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The nucleus is a highly organized organelle that contains specific functional domains essential for the regulated expression of proteins in eukaryotes. The fact that nearly one-fourth of total cellular proteins are localized in the nucleus implies a variety of function in this compartment (Kumar et al., Genes Dev. 2002, 16, 707-719). Though it is an attractive target for the study of cellular homeostasis and determination of genomic response to stress, the plant nuclear proteomics is still in its infancy, particularly with respect to stress tolerance. Of the few plant nuclear matrix proteins characterized, no obvious homology was found with known nuclear proteins in yeast and mammals (Gindullis et al., Plant Cell, 1999, 11, 1117-1128; Gindullis et al., Plant Cell, 1999, 11, 1755-1768). Interestingly, Alba (acetylation lowers binding affinity) proteins, first identified as DNA-binding proteins in archaea, and then in association with nuclear RNase P/MRP in yeast and mammalian cells, are part of a superfamily that spans through three domains of life (Mani et al., 2011). The members of Alba family proteins have been reported to play important role in transcriptional regulation by maintaining chromatin architecture (Aravind et al., Genome Biol. 4, 2003, R64). The dimeric protein, formerly named Sso10b, is conserved in most sequenced archaeal genomes (Forterre et al., Mol. Microbiol., 1999, 32, 669-670) and binds double-stranded DNA tightly, but without apparent sequence specificity (Grote et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1986, 873, 405-413; Xue et al., J. Bacteriol., 2000, 182, 3929-3933; Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151). As evident from its name, Alba is controlled by acetylation and deacetylation, where acetylation at specific N-terminal lysine residue lowers its binding affinity toward double-stranded DNA (Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151; Zhao et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278, 26071-26077). In <i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i>, Alba was found to be reversibly acetylated at Lys-16 by a homolog of Pat (protein acetyltransferase) and deacetylated by Sir2 protein, a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase belonging to sirtuin family (Bell et al., Science, 2002, 296, 148-151; Starai et al., J. Mol. Biol., 2004, 340, 1005-1012; Marsh et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280, 21122-21128). The best-studied eukaryotic members of the family are the human and yeast proteins Rpp20/Pop7 and Rpp25/Pop6 (Perederina et al., RNA, 2010, 13, 1648-1655 2007; Hands-Taylor et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2010, 38, 4052-4066). A recent study suggested that they are only transiently associated with RNase MRP in vivo and are not present in the catalytically active complex (Welting et al., RNA, 2006, 12, 1373-1382). By and large, however, their function remains far from understood.</p>

It can be seen that GFP expression shows accumulation in nucleus (<figref>FIG. 3D</figref>), and sparsely in the cytoplasm, compared to control GFP alone (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). <figref>FIGS. 3B</figref>, and <b>3</b>E are phase contrast images of same cells as <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, D. <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, F are merged images of <figref>FIGS. 3A</figref>, B and D, E respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0123">To determine the organ-specific expression of OsAlba1, transcript abundance in roots, stems, leaves, flag leaves, sheaths and panicles of rice seedlings were compared. The transcripts were abundantly and constantly transcribed in flag leaves. The expression in other major vegetative organs was substantially low (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Next, the protein abundance in all these tissues was examined by immunoblot analysis (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). The results showed the presence of OsAlba1 in leaves and flag leaves, corroborating the mRNA profile. The predominant expression of OsAlba1 in the flag leaves seems to support the growing panicles which might be crucial during grain filling. The rice flag leaves are essential in providing photosynthates (Xu et al., <i>PloS One, </i>2011, 6, e176133) and has been reported to play an important role in grain yield (Wan et al., <i>Scienctia Agricultura Sinica, </i>1981, 6, 21-28; Raj et al., <i>Indian J. Plant Physiol., </i>2000, 5, 293-295) and in enhancing productivity (Padmaja, <i>Indian J. Plant Physiol., </i>1991, 34, 339-348). These results may have important implications, since such organ-specific gene expression is closely related to harvest yield, and perhaps crucial for driving agronomic trait/s.</p>

      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">Complementation Study in Yeast</heading>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0124">
        <i>S. cerevisiae </i>wild-type (BY4743) and ΔPop6 (YGR030c) strains were used for complementation assay. ΔPop6 was transformed with pYES2 vector and pYES2 vector containing the OsAlba1 ORF. Yeast strains were grown in YPD broth and serial dilutions [OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5, as 10° to 10<sup>−3 </sup>for ΔPop6] were prepared and plated. The plates were incubated at 30° C. for 48 h. The growth of wild-type (WT), ΔPop6:pYES2, ΔPop6, and ΔPop6+OsAlba1 strains were checked under normal conditions, as well as under H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0125">Ribonuclease P/MRP subunit Pop6, a component of ribonuclease P, is an Alba domain containing protein involved in RNA processing (Mani et al., <i>PLoS One., </i>2011, 6, e22463). However, the role of Alba super family proteins in stress tolerance remains unexplored. It is well known that oxidative stress is caused by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage various cellular components, including proteins, lipids and DNA. We thought that OsAlba1, being a DNA-binding protein, might be involved in defense against oxidative damage and therefore, its role in oxidative stress tolerance was investigated. We examined whether OsAlba1 could complement yeast ΔPop6 mutant under oxidative stress.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows that the growth of wild-type (WT), ΔPop6:pYES2, ΔPop6 and complemented (ΔPop6+OsAlba1) strains was monitored in presence of different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The complemented strains grew rapidly and displayed resistance when compared with that of ΔPop6 and ΔPop6:pYES2, and the effect was more prominent at higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These results indicate the role of Alba proteins in oxidative stress tolerance, besides their classical role as DNA/RNA-binding proteins.</p>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">Example 7</heading>
      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="1">Plant Growth Conditions and Stress Treatments</heading>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0127">Rice (<i>Oryza sativa </i>L. ssp. <i>indica</i>) seedlings were grown in pots containing a mixture of soil and soilrite (2:1, w/w; 10 plants/5.6-l-capacity pot) in an environmentally controlled growth room. The seedlings were maintained at 28±2° C., 70±5% relative humidity under a 16 h photoperiod (270 μmol/m<sup>2</sup>/second light intensity). The pots were provided with 300 ml of water every day to maintain the soil moisture content at ˜30%. Dehydration stress was imposed on the 4-week-old seedlings by withdrawing water, and tissues were harvested up to 120 h.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0128">In a separate set of experiment, the seedlings were supplemented with half-Hoagland's medium until 4 weeks, followed by treatment with 250 mM NaCl in the medium. The tissues were harvested until 24 h of the treatment. The ABA treatment was carried out by spraying the seedlings with 100 μM ABA, and tissues were harvested at specified intervals. The unstressed seedlings were sprayed with water, referred to as 0 h. For cold treatment, seedlings were kept at 4° C. for a period of 24 h.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0129">In order to investigate transcriptional regulation of OsAlba1 under dehydration, we carried out Northern blot analysis (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). The OsAlba1 transcripts were induced during 48-96 h, but dropped to steady state level at 120 h of dehydration (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>). The discrepancy between the transcript abundance and the protein profile (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) is not unprecedented and suggests posttranscriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of OsAlba1 during stress. Because dehydration-responsive pathway often overlaps with that of ABA, and dehydration represents a common stress challenge to plant cells under high salinity and cold conditions (Thomashow, <i>Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. </i>1999, 50, 571-599, Shinozaki et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. </i>3, 2000, 217-223; Xiong et al., <i>Plant Cell Environ., </i>2002, 25, 131-139), the expression of OsAlba1 transcripts was investigated triggered by each of these conditions. A persistent induction of OsAlba1 was observed under cold, with maximum transcript accumulation at 12 h of stimulation. Even at 24 h of cold treatment, the mRNA level remained elevated when compared with the unstressed condition (<figref>FIG. 5D</figref>). Treatment with 250 mM NaCl resulted in somewhat more transient mRNA elevation that declined within 24 h (<figref>FIG. 5C</figref>). Next, we examined whether OsAlba1 transcription was affected by ABA, and it appeared to be induced until 12 h of treatment (<figref>FIG. 5E</figref>). These results altogether suggest that OsAlba1 may actively participate in osmotic and hyper-osmotic stress, and this participation may, in part, depend on ABA.</p>
      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Example 8</heading>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="1">Structural Organization of OsAlba1</heading>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0130">To investigate the genomic organization of OsAlba1, the NCBI sequence database was reviewed. It revealed the presence of an incomplete transcript with a coding region of 0.407 kb, identical to Alba protein from <i>Oryza sativa </i>ssp. <i>japonica</i>. The corresponding sequence was used to design primers and full-length cDNA was cloned from <i>O. sativa </i>ssp. <i>indica</i>. The analysis revealed a 52 bp sequence missing at 3′-end, identical to <i>O. sativa </i>ssp. <i>japonica</i>. The complete OsAlba1 genomic sequence is thus 1.514 kb, excluding 3′-UTR region, and interrupted by 4 introns. The coding region of OsAlba1 encodes a protein of 152 amino acids with molecular mass of 16.72 kDa.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0131">The domain architecture and putative post translational modifications were examined using NCBI CDD server for domain prediction and NetPhos 2.0 for predicting the phosphorylation sites. The deduced protein sequence analysis and domain search indicated that OsAlba1 comprises of 64 amino acid residue Alba domain (Pfam Accession: PF01918). OsAlba1 showed a high score phosphorylation, both within the Alba domain (Thr-50, Tyr-57 and Ser-104) and outside it (Ser-40 and Ser-129) (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>). Phosphorylation has previously been observed in Alba proteins of Pop7 and RPP25 family from mouse and human and is documented in UniProt database. Using ASEB server, acetylation and deacetylation sites (acetylation, 136; deacetylation, 107) in OsAlba1 were also predicted. Acetylation and deacetylation events have earlier been reported to have important roles in differential regulation (Chene et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res., </i>2012, 40, 3066-3077) and a similar mechanism of differential regulation of OsAlba1 by PTM could therefore be suggested.</p>

        <i>Agrobacterium </i>Mediated Callus Transformation and Regeneration</heading>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0134">The 2-week-old rice calli were collected and Agro-infected by immersing them in the <i>Agrobacterium </i>culture for 20-25 min with intermittent gentle shaking. The Agro-infected calli were dried on sterile Whatman filter paper for 5 min. Calli were then transferred to the co-cultivation medium containing 30 g/L sucrose, 150 μM acetosyringone and incubated at 27±1° C. in the dark for 3 d. Once slight growth of <i>Agrobacterium </i>appeared around most of the calli, the calli were rinsed 8-10 times with 250 mg/L cefotaxime. They were then dried on sterile Whatman filter paper and transferred onto first selection shooting medium (MS medium, BAP 3 mg/l, NAA 1 mg/l, 250 mg/l cefotaxime and 50 mg/l hygromycin and incubated for 12 d at 26±1° C. in dark. After the first selection, brown or black calli were removed, and only creamish healthy calli were transferred to the second selection and maintained at 26±1° C. in dark. After second selection for 10 d, microcalli could be observed which were finally transferred to fresh MS shooting media for third selection and allowed to proliferate for 5 d at 27±1° C. in dark.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0135">Healthy shoots with defined stem were transferred to rooting medium (MS medium supplemented with IBA 1 mg/l, 50 mg/l hygromycin, 500 mg/l cefotaxime, pH 5.6) and incubated at 28° C. under continuous light. The plantlets with well-developed root system were planted in 250 ml plastic pots containing autoclaved mud, collected from rice fields. The plantlets were established in such a way that the clump of plantlets, originated from each callus, was separated carefully and planted in several pots. Out of different transgenic lines obtained, five independent transgenic lines harbouring OsAlba1 were screened for further analyses.</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0136">The wild type and the transgenic plants are being studied in parallel in the same growth room for comparative morpho-anatomical, molecular, and physiological analyses. The rice seedlings have been grown in pots containing a mixture of soil and soilrite (2:1, w/w; 5.6-liter-capacity pot) in an environmentally controlled growth room. The seedlings are maintained at 28±2° C., 70±5% relative humidity under a 16 h photoperiod (270 μmol m<sup>−2 </sup>s<sup>−1 </sup>light intensity). The pots are provided with 300 ml of water every day that maintained the soil moisture content at 30%. Dehydration is imposed on the 4-week-old seedlings by withdrawing water, and tissues will be harvested up to 120 h. The harvested tissues will be instantly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C. unless otherwise described. In a separate set of experiment, the seedlings have been supplemented with half-Hoagland's medium for 3 weeks, followed by treatment with 250 mM concentration of NaCl in the same medium. The tissues will be harvested 24 h after the treatment. The treatment of ABA will be carried out by spraying the seedlings with 100 μM ABA, and tissues will be harvested at specified intervals. For cold treatment, seedlings have been kept at 4° C. for 24 h. The transcript analysis of OsAlba1 for its differential expression under various stresses will be carried out by Northern blot and quantitative real-time PCR.</p>
