      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to devices for monitoring or measuring vital signs of patients in a treatment setting, and more particularly to a portable, self-contained device capable of rapidly measuring selected key vital signs of an injured or sick patient in one operation in an emergency or triage setting.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention and Description of the Prior Art:</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Vital physiological signs that are key measures of the state of health of medical patients, especially in emergency situations include blood pressure and pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation level, and temperature. The measurements of these four parameters provide important indicators of a patient's condition along with the patient's description thereof. Blood pressure, typically measured by a sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope, provides the pressure values when the heart contracts (systolic) and when the heart relaxes (diastolic), a reliable indicator of the health of the blood circulatory system and its condition or state at the time of the measurement. Pulse rate is a measure of the number of times the heart beats per minute.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Blood hemoglobin saturation level, measured non-invasively with a pulse oximeter, is a measure of the proportion of oxygen bound up in the blood hemoglobin. This measurement is an indirect indicator of the oxygenation efficiency of the respiratory system (ârespiratory sufficiencyâ) of a patient. The body temperature of a patient, traditionally measured with a thermometer, indicates whether the ability of the body to eliminate or generate heat to maintain the correct temperature is functioning correctly. Temperature is another primary indicator of the body's condition or state when experiencing injury or illness.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Patients brought into triage in emergency room settings, or requiring assessment of injuries or illness at the scene of an accident or the onset of acute or severe symptoms, need to have their vital signs measured accurately, rapidly, and in some cases repeatedly, to provide an initial assessment of the patient's condition. In most situations, the key vital sign measurements are blood pressure, pulse rate, the saturation of oxygen in the blood (pulse oximetry), and the temperature. Traditionally, these measurements were obtained manually using separate instruments, and usually not all at the same time. Often, the complete vital sign data is not available at the time the physician arrives at the bedside to begin the examination and diagnosis, and to assess the patient's need for treatment. More recently, but typically in patient care areas other than emergency or transport facilities, electronic monitor equipment installed next to the patient's bedside is connected to the patient through cables and wiring for taking continuous measurements and displaying them to the care givers. Such monitoring equipment is unwieldy and limits the ability of the patient to shift position or to be moved. These shortcomings make such monitoring unsuitable in emergency or triage situations where taking vital signs rapidly and with minimum operating inconvenience is crucial to the treatment assessment and delivery required in these situations. This is equally evident if not more so in the pre-hospital care setting. What is needed is a rapid way to measure these vital sign parameters in a single process and to enable such rapid measurements repetitively to establish trend lines, thus facilitating processing of the patient as rapidly as possible into the appropriate care environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another problem with the traditional methods, whether using manual instruments or the conventional bedside monitors, is the lack of the ability to quickly and automatically transmit vital sign data to an electronic medical record (EMR) and to quickly access those patient's records, to facilitate performing a preliminary diagnostic analysis, virtually as soon as the vital signs are obtained. The lack of such information close to the time the vital signs are known could impair the ability to provide the correct initial treatment, and perhaps even mean the difference between life and death of a patient in a severe trauma circumstance. What is needed is a way to report or convey this information to a physician as a complete set of both initial and repetitive data, to enable access to this type of information with minimal delay, and preferably to make the data known at the same time that the vital signs are known.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Of further great functional importance is the ability, typically not readily available, is the listing of all available vital sign data displayed chronologically from the time vital signs were taken pre-hospital through the entire patient journey including the emergency department, surgery, recovery, intensive care unit (ICU), etc. What is needed is a system and suitable device to have vital sign data immediately available to the caregiver at all times, accompanied by the time the data was taken and other pertinent information.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Introduction</heading>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">A medical diagnostic device and system that advances the state of the art is disclosed. The system, in broad terms includes a portable or handheld rapid vital signs (âRVSâ) instrument that is operable in contact with a patient undergoing evaluation to quickly produce a vital sign data set; a communications interface in the vital signs instrument for wirelessly connecting and communicating with a database via a remote server over a network; a depository of patient medical history records in the database and accessible via a server connected to the network for providing a medical history data set; and a processor in communication with the rapid vital signs instrument and the database that may be operable in some embodiments to apply selected algorithms to the vital sign and the medical history data sets to produce a preliminary diagnosis of the patient connected to the rapid vital signs instrument.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The concept of the invention may be considered as a precursor to a system of initial diagnoses that relies on accurate vital signs data and algorithms for analysis of the vital signs data, the circumstances and appearance of the patient, and other patient medical record data to determine most likely avenues for treatment and/or further tests. When a patient is brought into an emergency room time is often of the essence, and processing of incoming cases is often complicated by the number of patients awaiting examination and evaluation. The present invention is directed toward apparatus, and systems and methods for accurate and rapid assessment and diagnosis of patient illness or injury leading to appropriate treatment as soon as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The rapid vital signs instrument for use in the above described system preferably includes a processor having analog-to-digital convertors (ADC) for converting input sensor data to digital form, a memory for program and data storage, a display, programs for controlling operation of the device and its display, and a communications interface. Sensor data may be supplied to the processor from sensors, preferably configured for measuring blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Sensor data converted in the ADC is input to the processor may be processed for display, and also output via the communications interface to a physician's location in the system, generally an emergency facility. In one embodiment the RVS instrument may be enclosed in a single housing having designated contact positions for sensing the patient's blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Although the preferred embodiment is configured as a cuffless instrument, in some embodiments an inflatable cuff device operable with the RVS device for measuring the patient's blood pressure may be attached to enable measurement of blood pressure when a patient's finger is not accessible. The housing may be configured as a small portable cabinet having a display for reading out the sensor data, a keypad or similar device for entering instructions or requests, and a wireless transmitter for sending data through a network to caregivers. In other embodiments the housing may be a small, cylindrical device that may be carried in a caregiver's pocket. In some embodiments the display may be configured or adjusted so that it is or is not readily visible to the patient. In yet other embodiments the RVS may be configured for operation with or without a cuff for measuring blood pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The invention provides a single, combination RVS instrument, which may be coupled via wireless link to supply a vital signs data set to an EMR (electronic medical record) stored at a remote location. The RVS instrument (also known as a portable instrument herein) is designed to take accurate vital signs of the patient at the earliest examination point, including mobile emergency care in a field setting remote from a caregiver's location in a minimum of time. In some environments it may be possible to receive an assessment of likely problems causing the patient to need treatment. Sensors may be selected to provide vital signs data very rapidlyâon the order of 15 seconds or lessâas compared with conventional sphygmomanometers that typically take up to a minute or more to obtain a stable reading of blood pressure. The RVS instrument and system provides an early and fast assessment in a triage circumstance, enabling a minimum of lost time to take vital signs, assess the results, and more quickly determine the emergency care that needs to be administered as soon as possible.</p>

The Send <b>30</b> button may be used to transmit the data set to a remote server or caregiver computer or to an EMR (Electronic Medical Record) database to add to a patient record being compiled there. An indicator light <b>32</b> may be provided on the front panel <b>14</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b> to indicate power ON, a Ready condition, a Low Power or Battery condition, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">The front panel <b>14</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b> preferably includes position indicia on the surface of the front panel <b>14</b> for placement of the patient's fingers to sense blood flow parameters for measurements of blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation. For example, a pad <b>34</b> may be delineated as the position for measuring oxygen saturation (O<sub>2</sub>) and the pad <b>36</b> may be delineated as the position for measuring systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse. These positions may preferably be placed close to the respective sensors (to be described). In the depicted embodiment the sensors, which are configured for sensing blood flow in the patient's finger tipsâi.e., the flow of blood through the capillary bed within the finger tipsâare located directly below the designated positions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. A temperature sensor <b>40</b> may be located in a forward end of the RVS device <b>10</b>, as indicted by an arrowhead <b>42</b>. Such a sensor <b>40</b> is preferably one that senses body temperature by contact with a patient's skin, for example on the forehead of the patient over the temporal artery just above the eyebrow. The RVS device <b>10</b> may also include a USB port connector <b>44</b> along or near an edge of the housing <b>12</b> for connecting a bar code reader, a blood pressure cuff sign, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">A variety of physical configurations are possible. A blood pressure cuff (not shown because it is a well-known component used with conventional devices for measuring blood pressure), which may be operable in the conventional manner in some embodiments, may be connected to the RVS device <b>10</b>. For example, blood pressure may be measured with cuffs adapted to different positions on a person's upper arm, wrist, or the fingers of the person's hand. The cuff may include other types of sensors as, for example, a skin contact sensor for sensing body temperature. In all cases, the RVS device <b>10</b> includes the capability in a portable and compact instrument for rapidly measuring and reporting blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">The sensor portions of the RVS device <b>10</b>, except in some cases the blood pressure cuff, are preferably accessed merely by touchâthat is, by placing and holding the patient's hand in contact with the device. In an alternate embodiment (not shown) may be a feature for illuminating the patient's hand, or alternatively the sensor contact areas of the RVS device <b>10</b> with ultraviolet light to sanitize them. In another alternate embodiment, the RVS device <b>10</b> may be incorporated in a glove (not shown) such that the patient's hand is slipped into the glove. The glove may have a wrist gauntlet portion that includes an embedded blood pressure cuff and temperature sensor. The pulse, O2 and (alternately) temperature sensors may be included in the finger portions of the glove.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">In other configurations, small finger or hand sensors may be devised that combine all of the sensor elements into a single unit. Some RVS devices <b>10</b> may be linked to a smart phone or wrist phone (not shown) equipped with an application program (âAPâ) for convenience. Such a configuration is compact and readily carried in a pocket by a care giver. Like the larger configurations described above, the smaller ones may include the transceiver and interface (to be described) necessary for communicating with an EMR (Emergency Medical Record) system.</p>

The light signal, typically in the infra-red or visible portion of the spectrum, may be reflected from a portion of the vascular system such as a capillary bed or temporal artery, and the reflected signal detected by an photo detecting diode or transistor. Such reflected signals can correspond to the pressure changes in the capillary bed, providing a clear waveform of the heart rhythm. The detecting element may form part of a conversion or other circuit that may be integrated on a single chip. Thus, these elements can be manufactured in very small packagesâon the order of a few millimeters squareâthus enabling exceedingly compact sensors suitable for finger-tip applications. The small size of these sensor elements permits construction of RVS devices in a variety of small, portable, pocket-sized packages. The sensor elements may include amplifying, filtering, and other conversion circuitry to produce a signal compatible with external processing circuitry. The processing circuitry preferably includes suitable algorithms for interpreting the raw signal data produced by the sensors, including operations to average multiple readings taken over a span of time; to infer, from peak values of the pulse waveform the values of systolic and diastolic pressure within the capillary bed of a finger-tip; and further enabling estimation of the average time between peak events to determine pulse rate, etc.</p>

Further, as experience with the data in numerous instances of its use accumulate, the ability to refine the use of the RVS becomes an important by-product that will naturally improve its utility. In one example, the system may be operable to construct tables of vital sign data for an individual patient that lists the vital sign data along with an initial assessment based on comparison of the individual vital sign data with established normal ranges and indicating via a readout in a portion of the table whether an out-of-range vital sign is irregular, abnormal, critical, etc. to indicate to a caregiver that special attention is required. Such condition may also be used to trigger an alert, alarm, or flag to call attention to a vital sign data set that includes at least one questionable reading.

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a simplified flow chart of one embodiment of the RVS device <b>10</b> in operation as a stand-alone vital signs instrument. The reader will recognize the similarity between the process illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and the âExample of Useâ set forth previously. The process starts at step <b>204</b> and advances to step <b>206</b> to enter patient ID into the RVS device <b>10</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Pressing the ID button <b>20</b> may be operable to condition the processor or CPU <b>60</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to receive the ID information in barcode form. In step <b>210</b> the patient's middle and ring fingers are placed in contact with the areas designated Middle <b>34</b> and Ring <b>36</b> on the front panel <b>14</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b>, followed by pressing the RESET button <b>22</b> on the device <b>10</b> to initialize the sensors.

The sequence may, of course vary from that shown depending on the particular architecture of the RVS device <b>10</b> (or RVS device <b>102</b>) and its relationship with the hospital or clinic <b>104</b> and other elements in the system <b>100</b>. As depicted, the process begins at step <b>304</b> to turn ON the RVS device <b>10</b>, which may follow preliminary access to the EMR and other patient data in steps <b>300</b> and <b>302</b>, including but not limited to identification, insurance, medical history and the like. This step <b>304</b> may be accompanied by illumination of the ON indicator light <b>32</b> (See <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The entry point for patient identification may be via a bar code reader (for reading a patient's bracelet ID device having a bar code) connected to the RVS device <b>10</b> and a check, as in step <b>308</b> to determine if the EMR data is available. In an alternate embodiment, a keyboard or keypad on the RVS device <b>10</b> (if so equipped) may be used to enter a patient ID.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0069">At step <b>310</b> the patient's hand is applied to the RVS device <b>10</b>, which may be configured as a small portable unit hanging from the bedside or gurney frame, a pocket-sized instrument, or a glove-like device. In any case placing the hand on the front panel <b>14</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b>, or attaching the RVS device <b>10</b> to the patient's hand if so configured, or a B/P cuff to the patient's arm in step <b>310</b>, setting a READY indicator (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> or <b>2</b> for clarity, but may be a signal on the display <b>16</b>), followed by pressing the RESET button <b>22</b> to initialize the sensors (in step <b>312</b>) prepares the RVS device <b>10</b> to sense the respective vital signs data when the READ button <b>24</b> is pressed at step <b>322</b> as will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">Continuing with <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, a test query provides in step <b>314</b> to select connecting to the server <b>130</b> (in the system <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) to retrieve a patient record. If it is known that the patient may have a record in the facility <b>104</b> then the flow is along the YES path to access the record in step <b>316</b>, download the vital sign history (for example) in step <b>318</b>, and store the vital sign history in the local non-volatile memory <b>62</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b> in step <b>320</b>. If, on the other hand a patient's vital sign history or other pertinent medical record is not in the database <b>134</b> of the facility <b>104</b>, the flow advances along the NO path to step <b>322</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">Step <b>322</b> initiates the measurement process in the RVS device <b>10</b> when the READ button <b>24</b> is pressed to âreadâ the outputs of the sensors for the vital signs of the patient. Here again, the sequence may be to perform a measurement of blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic values), blood oxygen saturation, pulse, and body temperature in this example. The measured values appear in the display <b>16</b> in the designated regions of the display. Blood pressure is recorded as two values, the systolic (contraction of the heart) and diastolic (relaxation of the heart), blood oxygen saturation is indicated as a percentage (%) figure, pulse is indicated in beats per minute (bpm), and body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (Â° F.) or, in some units if the scale is selectable, degrees Centigrade (Â° C.). In step <b>322</b> the vital sign data may be time stamped to enable correlation of the vital sign data with the passage of time form the first measurement to later measurements on the same patient. This information is useful in monitoring trend linesâpatterns of data that may in themselves indicate medical conditions not otherwise detectable with a single set of vital sign data.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0072">Continuing with <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, a check is made at step <b>324</b> for valid readings, and if NO, an error occurs, the error type may be indicated in step <b>326</b>, the reading discarded.

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates one example of a typical vital signs profile chart or display of the type that may be used and displayed by a display <b>142</b> coupled to the server <b>130</b> in the system of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> in reporting the results of measurements performed by the RVS device <b>10</b>. The display <b>142</b> displays a graphic image <b>402</b> includes a patient identifier <b>404</b> and sections configured as separate graphs or plots of blood pressure <b>410</b>, pulse <b>416</b>, blood oxygen saturation <b>418</b>, and body temperature <b>420</b>. The blood pressure graph <b>410</b> includes a sequence of histograms showing the systolic <b>412</b> and diastolic <b>414</b> values recorded at specified times marked on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis is preferably marked in units of mmHg. The graph for pulse <b>416</b> may display the pulse recorded at the same times as the blood pressure readings in graph <b>410</b>, on a vertical scale marked in beats per minute. Similarly, the graph for blood oxygen saturation (âO<sub>2 </sub>Satâ) may be recorded at the same time intervals as the blood pressure and pulse, with their percentage values corresponding to the percent numbers marked on the vertical scale. Finally, the body temperature graph <b>420</b>, with its vertical scale marked in degrees F. or degrees C. (for example, degrees F. on the left vertical axis and degrees C. marked on the right vertical axis) may be shown at each of the same times that the other vital sign data is displayed. In this way each graph displays a sequence of readings over time at intervals marked on the horizontal axis, allowing trends to be spotted and correlations identified among the individual vital signs. Such information about trends or patterns or correlations may disclose particular conditions of interest to the caregiver or physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0079">In a hypothetical example of the use of vital sign data provided by the RVS device <b>10</b>, such as for a 27 year old male patient of average height and weight and apparently in âgreatâ physical condition, four sets of vital signs parameters may be obtained. The state of the patient may be estimated by an algorithmic process and estimated according to the data reported by the RVS device <b>10</b>. In this example the state may be identified as Normal (regular/normal, good condition), Abnormal (not normal/alarming, cause for concern), Critical (Abnormal for several minutes and or continue to worsen), and Irregular (sensors disconnected, providing false readings?). These âStateâ conditions may thus be interpreted as an initial, preliminary assessment to draw the attention of the care giver to the RVS results. As additional RVS readings are taken at selected intervals, a pattern (such as provided by the display of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>) of âstatesâ may emerge to clarify these initial assessments or to indicate the effects of treatment. These chart sets may be stored in the local memory <b>62</b> of the RVS device <b>10</b> as described in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, step <b>320</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0080">To summarize, the present invention provides the ability to (1) take all vital sign readings at one time, and repetitively at intervals and locations during the patient's movement through the hospital system, thus providing a continuous, timely record; (2) format the vital sign data and send it wirelessly to the EMR system for ready access and retrieval as needed by care givers; (3) provide automated preliminary analyses of the data along with other patient information to determine or indicate the most likely possible explanations of the illness or injury experienced by the patient; (4) assist the hospital determine the tests to be ordered to minimize lost time; (5) reduce the number of vital sign data input errors by formatting the data and transmitting it directly from the RVS instrument; and (6) ensure correct association of the patient ID and vital sign data.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0081">The foregoing descriptions and illustrations of embodiments of the invention are representative examples of possible implementations of the concept of a small portable instrument for rapidly and accurately measuring at least four vital signs of a patient experiencing trauma or illness, whether mild or severe, and of the transmission and integration of the instrument's data via communication links with the computer system and network of a medical treatment location whether it be a hospital, clinic, triage center, temporary field hospital, and the like to medical personnel engaged in treating patients, particularly in an âemergency departmentâ setting. The scope of the invention is not limited to these particular illustrations but may include various combinations thereof that may occur to persons of skill in the art. The concept of the invention is a precursor to a system of initial diagnosis that relies on rapid and accurate vital signs data and algorithms for analysis of the vital signs data, the circumstances and appearance of the patient, and other patient medical record data to determine most likely avenues for treatment and/or further tests. When a patient is brought to an Emergency Room time is often of the essence, and processing of incoming cases is often complicated by the number of patients awaiting examination and evaluation. The present invention is directed toward apparatus, and systems and methods for accurate and rapid assessment and diagnosis of patient illness or injury leading to appropriate treatment as soon as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0082">While the invention has been shown in only one of its forms, it is not thus limited but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof.</p>
