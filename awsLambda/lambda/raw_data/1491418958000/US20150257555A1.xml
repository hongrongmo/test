      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Not Applicable.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention relates to pillows, and more particularly to a travel pillow.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Travel pillows are well known for helping people rest or sleep when in a seated position. However, prior art travel pillows suffer from common drawbacks such being bulky, trapping heat and moisture between the pillow and the user's neck and head, and generally being unable to adequately or comfortably support the person's head.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,686 to Cheatham on Aug. 9, 2005, discloses a travel pillow with some of these drawbacks. Little air is allowed to circulate between the pillow and the person's neck with this type of product, often resulting in an uncomfortably hot and sweaty neck. Further, this type of travel pillow causes the user's head to tilt forward due to a relatively large back portion that, when contacting the seat, puts pressure on the rear of the person's neck. U.S. Design Pat. D619,402 to Sternlight et al. on Jul. 13, 2010 teaches a similar device. PCT Application PCT/US2013/035646, published on Oct. 17, 2013 to Sternlight et al., teaches a similar device, albeit with a thinner back portion. However, low air circulation is also a drawback of this device.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for a travel pillow that promotes air flow between the pillow and the person's neck for reducing sweat and increasing comfort. Such a needed device would comfortably maintain the user's head in an upright, neutral position during use, and would support the user's head even if tilted to one side or back. Reducing points of contact between such a needed travel pillow and the person's neck and head, while improving air circulation, further would improve comfort and allow for a wider range of accommodated neck sizes. Such a needed invention would be contoured and internally supported to better retain the user's head in a comfortable position while seated. Such a needed device would further be relatively inexpensive to manufacture, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. The present invention accomplishes these objectives.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present device is a travel pillow for a person. A preferably U-shaped resilient inner frame includes a rear portion and two side portions. Each side portion, and optionally the rear portion, includes at least one lateral, transverse air apertures therethrough. Each side portion of the inner frame further includes a forward end.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A U-shaped outer cushion is fixed about the inner frame and includes a rear portion and two side portions. Each side portion, and optionally the rear portion, includes at least one lateral, transverse air apertures therethrough that are each aligned with one of the air apertures of the inner frame. Each side portion of the outer cushion further includes a forward end.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one embodiment, an upper front portion of the side portions extends upward for contacting the person's jaw and cheek areas to support the person's head in a neutral position. The upper front portion of each side portion is padded such that the cushion compresses at least slightly for continuous support of the person's head when the person's head is in the neutral position, upright and balanced from side-to-side.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The air apertures provide for an abundance of air flow through to the person's neck. The relative size of each of the apertures may vary in size to allow different compression characteristics along the top of the travel pillow. Pillars defined between each aperture are provided to control flexion of the top portion of the outer cushion and inner frame, improve support of the person's head, and provide for a wide range of sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">For example, apertures, at the rear portions, may be relatively large so that the top side of the cushion at the rear portion may flex more than, for example, along areas of the side portion. Alternately, larger apertures towards the front of the side portions allow for greater air flow and flexing at the front area of the travel pillow, while smaller apertures and more rigid pillars in the back portion provide for greater support at the back of the person's head.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The travel pillow preferably further includes a closure mechanism fixed with the side portions of the inner frame and outer cushion. Preferably the side portions each include a drawstring aperture at a forward end, thereof. The closure mechanism may include, for example, a drawstring traversing the drawstring apertures of each side portion. Such a drawstring is adapted to selectively and adjustably hold the forward ends mutually together. Alternately, the closure mechanism may be the drawstring traversing at least one of the air apertures, instead of the drawstring apertures.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The drawstring preferably includes two halves, each of which is fixed at a proximal end thereof to the side portions at one of the drawstring apertures thereof. Each drawstring half is mutually and selectively fixable at a distal end thereof at one part of a two-part mechanical fastener. Such a two-part mechanical fastener preferably includes at least one magnet for holding each part together. Each part of the two-part mechanical fastener further preferably includes a spring-biased drawstring cinch mechanism for selectively fixing the part to one of the drawstring halves at a selected position along the length of the drawstring half.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In one embodiment of the invention, each side portion of the outer cushion includes an ear depression formed in a top side thereof. Such an ear depression is adapted to reduce the chance of contact between the top side of the outer cushion with the person's ears, earphones, ear buds, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The inner frame is preferably C-shaped in cross section at least along part of the side portions. As such, the top portion of the inner frame may flex under the weight of the person's head as the lower part of the inner frame resists flexing. Each side portion of the outer cushion may further include a jawbone depression formed in the top side thereof, such that the travel pillow generally fits under and around a person's jaw to support his head.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">A flexible, preferably elastic chin sling may be fixed between the forward ends of each side portion of the outer cushion. Such a chin sling is adapted to support the person's chin to keep the person's head in a substantially upright position. The sling may be removable, adjustable in length and elasticity, include cooling and forming materials such as gel or micro beads, and may also function as the closure mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In one embodiment, the travel pillow further includes a flexible cover that has an opening therethrough into which the inner frame and the outer cushion are inserted. The cover includes at least one ventilation area through which air may travel. Preferably the cover includes a flexible 4-way stretch fabric.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The present invention is a travel pillow that has a dynamic compression frame and cushioning that has superior support architecture. The present device allows proper flexion for load distributions and dissipations, adjusts to the person's particular anatomy, promotes air flow between the pillow and the person's neck for reducing sweat and increasing comfort. The present device comfortably maintains the user's head in an upright, neutral position during use, and supports the user's head even if tilted to one side or back. The present invention is contoured and internally supported to better retain the user's head in a comfortable position while seated. The present device is further relatively inexpensive to manufacture, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

Each part <b>131</b> of the two-part mechanical fastener <b>130</b> further preferably includes a spring-biased drawstring cinch mechanism <b>150</b> for selectively fixing the part <b>131</b> to one of the drawstring halves <b>125</b> at a selected position along the length of the drawstring half <b>125</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A pair of drawstring anchors <b>180</b> (<figref>FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B) may be included, each having a tube <b>190</b> fixed with a center portion <b>205</b> of a disk <b>200</b>. The tube <b>190</b> is adapted for fitting within one of the drawstring apertures <b>110</b>, and the disk <b>200</b> is large enough to prevent the anchor <b>180</b> from traversing the drawstring aperture <b>110</b>. The proximal end <b>124</b> of each drawstring half <b>125</b> terminates at a T-shaped anchor <b>210</b> which is able to traverse each drawstring apertures <b>110</b> when aligned with the end <b>124</b> of the drawstring half <b>125</b>, but when flipped 90-degrees is retained by the disk <b>200</b> and prevented from being pulled back through the drawstring aperture <b>110</b>. As such, the drawstring <b>121</b> may not be pulled through the inner frame <b>30</b> or outer cushion <b>70</b>. Both the inner frame <b>30</b> and the outer cushion <b>70</b> may further include a thicker anchor reinforcement area <b>111</b> about the drawstring apertures <b>110</b> to further inhibit the drawstring <b>120</b> from being pulled through or ripping the outer cushion <b>70</b> or the inner frame <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In one embodiment of the invention, each side portion <b>90</b> of the outer cushion <b>70</b> includes an ear depression <b>160</b> (<figref>FIG. 8A</figref>) formed in a top side <b>71</b> thereof. Such an ear depression <b>160</b> is adapted to reduce the chance of contact between the top side <b>71</b> of the outer cushion <b>70</b> with the person's ears <b>28</b>, earphones (not shown), ear buds (not shown), or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Preferably, at least a portion of an inside surface <b>74</b> of the outer cushion <b>70</b> at the top side <b>71</b> thereof or a center portion <b>75</b> thereof (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>) is sloped inwardly with respect to a bottom side <b>79</b> thereof, preferably at an angle Î± of between 2 and 85-degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Preferably, along the inside surface <b>74</b>, the center portion <b>75</b> protrudes inwardly along at least one portion of its length with respect to the top and bottom sides <b>71</b>,<b>79</b> of the outer cushion. This angle Î± may vary along the length of the side portions <b>90</b> and rear portion <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In such an embodiment, the inner frame <b>30</b> is preferably C-shaped in cross section (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>), preferably at least along part of the side portions <b>50</b>. As such, the top portion <b>39</b> of the inner frame <b>30</b> may flex under the weight of the person's head <b>25</b> as the lower part of the inner frame <b>30</b> resists flexing.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In one embodiment, an outside surface <b>76</b> of the outer cushion <b>70</b> at the top side <b>71</b> thereof is sloped outwardly with respect to the bottom side <b>79</b> thereof, preferably at an angle Î² of between 2 and 30-degrees (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). As such, contact between the outer cushion <b>70</b> and a seat (not shown) urges the travel pillow <b>10</b> to tilt forward rather than backward, a forward tilt of the travel pillow <b>10</b> being more comfortable to the person <b>20</b> and reducing the choking effect caused when such a travel pillow is tilted upward. That notwithstanding, the rear portions <b>40</b>,<b>80</b> are thin enough to minimize pressure transmitted from the seat through the rear portions <b>40</b>,<b>80</b> to the back of the person's head <b>25</b>.</p>
