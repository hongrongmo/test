      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates, generally, to an apparatus and, more specifically, to an attachable headrest with an eye cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A headrest may provide a user with neck and head support during times of rest. In some circumstances, the headrest may be used while the user is sitting upright. For example, the user may be sitting on a seat while traveling (e.g., on a seat while traveling in an airplane or bus). If the user falls asleep while sitting upright, the user's head may deviate from the headrest. For example, the user's head may move to the left, right, or forward such that their head is no longer supported by the headrest. Further, as the user's head moves, left, right, or forward, the headrest may also move because the headrest is no longer secured in place by the weight or force from the user's head. Accordingly, certain problems may exist in existing designs of headrests.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An eye cover may block substantial amounts of light while the user is resting. However, existing eye covers may not help to prevent movement of the user's head during times of rest. Accordingly, the problems described supra with respect to movement of the user's head during times of rest may not be overcome by existing eye covers. Therefore, a need exists for an attachable headrest with eye cover that reduces movement of the user's head during times of rest.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One aspect of an apparatus is disclosed. An apparatus may include a headrest configured to accommodate a head of a user and attach to a seat, and an eye cover connected to the headrest and configured to cover eyes of the user, wherein the headrest and eye cover are collectively configured to limit movement of the head of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Another aspect of an apparatus is disclosed. An apparatus may include means for accommodating a head of a user and attaching to a seat, and means for covering eyes of the user, wherein the means for covering eyes is connected to the means for accommodating, wherein the means for accommodating and means for covering eyes are collectively configured to restrain movement of the head of the user.</p>

This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms by those skilled in the art and should not be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented herein. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Based on the teachings herein, one skilled in the art should appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of this disclosure, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the disclosure. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover such an apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure and/or functionality in addition to or instead of other aspects of this disclosure. It should be understood that any aspect of the disclosure disclosed herein may be embodied by one or more elements of a claim.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Although particular aspects will be described herein, many variations and permutations of these aspects fall within the scope of the disclosure. Although some benefits and advantages of the preferred aspects are mentioned, the scope of the disclosure is not intended to be limited to particular benefits, uses, or objectives. Rather, aspects of the disclosure are intended to be broadly applicable to different circuits, technologies, systems, networks, and methods, some of which are illustrated by way of example in the drawings and in the following description. The detailed description and drawings are merely illustrative of the disclosure rather than limiting, the scope of the disclosure being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a side perspective view of an example of an attachable headrest <b>112</b> with eye cover <b>102</b>. The headrest <b>112</b> may be formed from a material that is sufficiently rigid to form the shape of the headrest <b>112</b> but sufficiently soft and malleable to provide comfort to the user. For example, the material forming the headrest <b>112</b> may be foam, memory foam, cotton, fabric, polyfil, pellets, microbeads, beanbag filler, feathers, polyester, plastic, wool, rubber, buckwheat, seeds, herbs, any combination of any one or more of the foregoing, and/or any other material suitable for forming the headrest <b>112</b>. If the headrest <b>112</b> is an inflatable headrest, the material forming at least a portion of the headrest <b>112</b> may be air.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The headrest <b>112</b> may have a top portion <b>114</b>, a bottom portion <b>118</b>, side portions <b>116</b>, and a front portion <b>120</b>. The front portion <b>120</b> of the headrest <b>112</b> may be configured to accommodate a head of a user. For example, an indentation <b>122</b> in the front portion <b>120</b> of the headrest <b>112</b> may be shaped substantially similar to at least a portion of the head of the user. Accordingly, the head of the user may fit comfortably within the indentation <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In some embodiments, the edge(s) of the indentation <b>122</b> may form the shape of a “U”. In such embodiments, the indentation <b>122</b> may have three regions. A first region of the indentation <b>122</b> is the portion of the indentation <b>122</b> that is closest to the bottom portion of the U-shaped edge. The first region of the indentation <b>122</b> may be configured to contact and/or conform to a bottom portion of the back of the user's head. A second region of the indentation <b>122</b> is the portion of the indentation <b>122</b> that is closest to the right-side portion of the U-shaped edge. A third region of the indentation <b>122</b> is the portion of the indentation <b>122</b> that is closest to the left-side portion of the U-shaped edge.

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In some embodiments, the depth throughout the indentation <b>122</b> may be uniform. In some other embodiments, the depth throughout the indentation <b>122</b> may be non-uniform. Because the shape of the back of the user's head is round (e.g., has a curve/curvature), non-uniformity with respect to the depth of different regions of the indentation may increase the surface area in contact with (and therefore providing comfort to) the head of the user. In the embodiments where the depth throughout the indentation <b>122</b> is non-uniform, the depth of the first region of the indentation <b>122</b> (e.g., the region of the indentation <b>122</b> that is closest to the bottom portion of the U-shaped edge) may be less than the depth of the second region and/or third region of the indentation <b>122</b> (e.g., the region(s) of the indentation <b>122</b> that is/are closest to the right side and/or left side of the U-shaped edge).</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The bottom portion <b>118</b> of the headrest <b>112</b> may be wedge-shaped. The wedged-shaped bottom portion <b>118</b> may contact the shoulder(s) of the user. More specifically, the wedge-shaped bottom portion <b>118</b> may fit in the space between the back of the user's shoulder(s) and a seat against which the user may be leaning. In some embodiments, the wedge-shaped bottom portion <b>118</b> has no curves. For example, the bottom portion has only straight edges. In some other embodiments, the bottom portion <b>118</b> has one or more curvatures. As such, the edges of the bottom portion <b>118</b> have one or more curves. For example, a first portion of the edges of the bottom portion <b>118</b> may form a convex curve, and a second portion of the edges of the bottom portion <b>118</b> may form a concave curve. The first and second portions of the edges of the bottom portion <b>118</b> may be connected together or may be separated by a non-curved portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The headrest <b>112</b> may be configured to attach to the seat.

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The eye cover <b>102</b> may have a perimeter region <b>106</b> and a central region <b>104</b>. The material forming the perimeter region <b>106</b> may be different from the material forming the central region <b>104</b>. For example, the material forming the central region <b>104</b> may have a higher density, thereby providing improved light-blocking, relative to the material forming the perimeter region <b>106</b>. As another example, the material forming the perimeter region <b>106</b> may have some elastic properties, thereby creating a tight seal between the user's face and the eye cover <b>102</b> to provide improved light-blocking, relative to the material forming the central region <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The various aspects described herein may have various dimensions. In some embodiments, the vertical height of the headrest <b>112</b> (e.g. the distance from the top of the top portion <b>114</b> of the headrest <b>112</b> to the bottom of the wedge-shaped bottom portion <b>118</b> of the headrest <b>112</b>) is approximately 30 inches.
