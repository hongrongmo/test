      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention generally relates to systems, methods and compositions used for the control of gene expression involving sequence targeting, such as genome perturbation or gene-editing, that may use vector systems related to Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and components thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Recent advances in genome sequencing techniques and analysis methods have significantly accelerated the ability to catalog and map genetic factors associated with a diverse range of biological functions and diseases. Precise genome targeting technologies are needed to enable systematic reverse engineering of causal genetic variations by allowing selective perturbation of individual genetic elements, as well as to advance synthetic biology, biotechnological, and medical applications. Although genome-editing techniques such as designer zinc fingers, transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs), or homing meganucleases are available for producing targeted genome perturbations, there remains a need for new genome engineering technologies that are affordable, easy to set up, scalable, and amenable to targeting multiple positions within the eukaryotic genome.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There exists a pressing need for alternative and robust systems and techniques for sequence targeting with a wide array of applications. This invention addresses this need and provides related advantages. The CRISPR/Cas or the CRISPR-Cas system (both terms are used interchangeably throughout this application) does not require the generation of customized proteins to target specific sequences but rather a single Cas enzyme can be programmed by a short RNA molecule to recognize a specific DNA target, in other words the Cas enzyme can be recruited to a specific DNA target using said short RNA molecule. Adding the CRISPR-Cas system to the repertoire of genome sequencing techniques and analysis methods may significantly simplify the methodology and accelerate the ability to catalog and map genetic factors associated with a diverse range of biological functions and diseases. To utilize the CRISPR-Cas system effectively for genome editing without deleterious effects, it is critical to understand aspects of engineering and optimization of these genome engineering tools, which are aspects of the claimed invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention provides a vector system comprising one or more vectors. In some embodiments, the system comprises: (a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a tracr mate sequence and one or more insertion sites for inserting one or more guide sequences upstream of the tracr mate sequence, wherein when expressed, the guide sequence directs sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a cell, e.g., eukaryotic cell, wherein the CRISPR complex comprises a CRISPR enzyme complexed with (1) the guide sequence that is hybridized to the target sequence, and (2) the tracr mate sequence that is hybridized to the tracr sequence; and (b) a second regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding said CRISPR enzyme comprising a nuclear localization sequence; wherein components (a) and (b) are located on the same or different vectors of the system. In some embodiments, component (a) further comprises the tracr sequence downstream of the tracr mate sequence under the control of the first regulatory element. In some embodiments, component (a) further comprises two or more guide sequences operably linked to the first regulatory element, wherein when expressed, each of the two or more guide sequences direct sequence specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a different target sequence in a eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, the system comprises the tracr sequence under the control of a third regulatory element, such as a polymerase III promoter. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence exhibits at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of sequence complementarity along the length of the tracr mate sequence when optimally aligned. In some embodiments, the CRISPR complex comprises one or more nuclear localization sequences of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of said CRISPR complex in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that a nuclear localization sequence is not necessary for CRISPR complex activity in eukaryotes, but that including such sequences enhances activity of the system, especially as to targeting nucleic acid molecules in the nucleus. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a type II CRISPR system enzyme. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a Cas9 enzyme. In some embodiments, the Cas9 enzyme is <i>S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes</i>, or <i>S. thermophilus </i>Cas9, and may include mutated Cas9 derived from these organisms. The enzyme may be a Cas9 homolog or ortholog. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is codon-optimized for expression in a eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme directs cleavage of one or two strands at the location of the target sequence. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme lacks DNA strand cleavage activity. In some embodiments, the first regulatory element is a polymerase III promoter. In some embodiments, the second regulatory element is a polymerase II promoter. In some embodiments, the guide sequence is at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 nucleotides, or between 10-30, or between 15-25, or between 15-20 nucleotides in length. In general, and throughout this specification, the term âvectorâ refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. Vectors include, but are not limited to, nucleic acid molecules that are single-stranded, double-stranded, or partially double-stranded; nucleic acid molecules that comprise one or more free ends, no free ends (e.g. circular); nucleic acid molecules that comprise DNA, RNA, or both; and other varieties of polynucleotides known in the art. One type of vector is a âplasmid,â which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments can be inserted, such as by standard molecular cloning techniques. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein virally-derived DNA or RNA sequences are present in the vector for packaging into a virus (e.g. retroviruses, replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses, replication defective adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses). Viral vectors also include polynucleotides carried by a virus for transfection into a host cell. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) are integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively-linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as âexpression vectors.â Common expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Recombinant expression vectors can comprise a nucleic acid of the invention in a form suitable for expression of the nucleic acid in a host cell, which means that the recombinant expression vectors include one or more regulatory elements, which may be selected on the basis of the host cells to be used for expression, that is operatively-linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be expressed. Within a recombinant expression vector, âoperably linkedâ is intended to mean that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory element(s) in a manner that allows for expression of the nucleotide sequence (e.g. in an in vitro transcription/translation system or in a host cell when the vector is introduced into the host cell).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The term âregulatory elementâ is intended to include promoters, enhancers, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), and other expression control elements (e.g. transcription termination signals, such as polyadenylation signals and poly-U sequences). Such regulatory elements are described, for example, in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). Regulatory elements include those that direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in many types of host cell and those that direct expression of the nucleotide sequence only in certain host cells (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory sequences). A tissue-specific promoter may direct expression primarily in a desired tissue of interest, such as muscle, neuron, bone, skin, blood, specific organs (e.g. liver, pancreas), or particular cell types (e.g. lymphocytes). Regulatory elements may also direct expression in a temporal-dependent manner, such as in a cell-cycle dependent or developmental stage-dependent manner, which may or may not also be tissue or cell-type specific. In some embodiments, a vector comprises one or more pol III promoter (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol III promoters), one or more pol II promoters (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol II promoters), one or more pol I promoters (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more pol I promoters), or combinations thereof. Examples of pol III promoters include, but are not limited to, U6 and H1 promoters. Examples of pol II promoters include, but are not limited to, the retroviral Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) LTR promoter (optionally with the RSV enhancer), the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (optionally with the CMV enhancer) [see, e.g., Boshart et al, Cell, 41:521-530 (1985)], the SV40 promoter, the dihydrofolate reductase promoter, the Î²-actin promoter, the phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) promoter, and the EF a promoter. Also encompassed by the term âregulatory elementâ are enhancer elements, such as WPRE; CMV enhancers; the R-U5â² segment in LTR of HTLV-I (Mol. Cell. Biol., Vol. 8(1), p. 466-472, 1988); SV40 enhancer; and the intron sequence between exons 2 and 3 of rabbit 3-globin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., Vol. 78(3), p. 1527-31, 1981). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector can depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression desired, etc. A vector can be introduced into host cells to thereby produce transcripts, proteins, or peptides, including fusion proteins or peptides, encoded by nucleic acids as described herein (e.g., clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) transcripts, proteins, enzymes, mutant forms thereof, fusion proteins thereof, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Advantageous vectors include lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, and types of such vectors can also be selected for targeting particular types of cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one aspect, the invention provides a vector comprising a regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme comprising one or more nuclear localization sequences. In some embodiments, said regulatory element drives transcription of the CRISPR enzyme in a eukaryotic cell such that said CRISPR enzyme accumulates in a detectable amount in the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, the regulatory element is a polymerase II promoter. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a type II CRISPR system enzyme. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme is a Cas9 enzyme.

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In one aspect, the invention provides a eukaryotic host cell comprising (a) a first regulatory element operably linked to a tracr mate sequence and one or more insertion sites for inserting one or more guide sequences upstream of the tracr mate sequence, wherein when expressed, the guide sequence directs sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a eukaryotic cell, wherein the CRISPR complex comprises a CRISPR enzyme complexed with (1) the guide sequence that is hybridized to the target sequence, and (2) the tracr mate sequence that is hybridized to the tracr sequence; and/or (b) a second regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding said CRISPR enzyme comprising a nuclear localization sequence.

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The terms âpolynucleotideâ, ânucleotideâ, ânucleotide sequenceâ, ânucleic acidâ and âoligonucleotideâ are used interchangeably. They refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or analogs thereof. Polynucleotides may have any three dimensional structure, and may perform any function, known or unknown. The following are non limiting examples of polynucleotides: coding or non-coding regions of a gene or gene fragment, loci (locus) defined from linkage analysis, exons, introns, messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, short interfering RNA (siRNA), short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), micro-RNA (miRNA), ribozymes, cDNA, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes, and primers. A polynucleotide may comprise one or more modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs. If present, modifications to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In aspects of the invention the terms âchimeric RNAâ, âchimeric guide RNAâ, âguide RNAâ, âsingle guide RNAâ and âsynthetic guide RNAâ are used interchangeably and refer to the polynucleotide sequence comprising the guide sequence, the tracr sequence and the tracr mate sequence. The term âguide sequenceâ refers to the about 20 bp sequence within the guide RNA that specifies the target site and may be used interchangeably with the terms âguideâ or âspacerâ. The term âtracr mate sequenceâ may also be used interchangeably with the term âdirect repeat(s)â.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">As used herein the term âwild typeâ is a term of the art understood by skilled persons and means the typical form of an organism, strain, gene or characteristic as it occurs in nature as distinguished from mutant or variant forms.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As used herein the term âvariantâ should be taken to mean the exhibition of qualities that have a pattern that deviates from what occurs in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The terms ânon-naturally occurringâ or âengineeredâ are used interchangeably and indicate the involvement of the hand of man. The terms, when referring to nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides mean that the nucleic acid molecule or the polypeptide is at least substantially free from at least one other component with which they are naturally associated in nature and as found in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">âComplementarityâ refers to the ability of a nucleic acid to form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid sequence by either traditional Watson-Crick base-pairing or other non-traditional types. A percent complementarity indicates the percentage of residues in a nucleic acid molecule which can form hydrogen bonds (e.g., Watson-Crick base pairing) with a second nucleic acid sequence (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 out of 10 being 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementary). âPerfectly complementaryâ means that all the contiguous residues of a nucleic acid sequence will hydrogen bond with the same number of contiguous residues in a second nucleic acid sequence. âSubstantially complementaryâ as used herein refers to a degree of complementarity that is at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% over a region of 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or more nucleotides, or refers to two nucleic acids that hybridize under stringent conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">As used herein, âstringent conditionsâ for hybridization refer to conditions under which a nucleic acid having complementarity to a target sequence predominantly hybridizes with the target sequence, and substantially does not hybridize to non-target sequences. Stringent conditions are generally sequence-dependent, and vary depending on a number of factors. In general, the longer the sequence, the higher the temperature at which the sequence specifically hybridizes to its target sequence. Non-limiting examples of stringent conditions are described in detail in Tijssen (1993), Laboratory Techniques In Biochemistry And Molecular Biology-Hybridization With Nucleic Acid Probes Part I, Second Chapter âOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid probe assayâ, Elsevier, N.Y.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">âHybridizationâ refers to a reaction in which one or more polynucleotides react to form a complex that is stabilized via hydrogen bonding between the bases of the nucleotide residues. The hydrogen bonding may occur by Watson Crick base pairing, Hoogstein binding, or in any other sequence specific manner. The complex may comprise two strands forming a duplex structure, three or more strands forming a multi stranded complex, a single self hybridizing strand, or any combination of these. A hybridization reaction may constitute a step in a more extensive process, such as the initiation of PCR, or the cleavage of a polynucleotide by an enzyme. A sequence capable of hybridizing with a given sequence is referred to as the âcomplementâ of the given sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">As used herein, âstabilizationâ or âincreasing stabilityâ with respect to components of the CRISPR system relate to securing or steadying the structure of the molecule. This may be accomplished by introduction of one or mutations, including single or multiple base pair changes, increasing the number of hair pins, cross linking, breaking up particular stretches of nucleotides and other modifications. Modifications may include inclusion of at least one non naturally occurring nucleotide, or a modified nucleotide, or analogs thereof. Modified nucleotides may be modified at the ribose, phosphate, and/or base moiety. Modified nucleotides may include 2â²-O-methyl analogs, 2â²-deoxy analogs, or 2â²-fluoro analogs. The nucleic acid backbone may be modified, for example, a phosphorothioate backbone may be used. The use of locked nucleic acids (LNA) or bridged nucleic acids (BNA) may also be possible. Further examples of modified bases include, but are not limited to, 2-aminopurine, 5-bromo-uridine, pseudouridine, inosine, 7-methylguanosine. These modifications may apply to any component of the CRISPR system. In a preferred embodiment these modifications are made to the RNA components, e.g. the guide RNA or chimeric polynucleotide sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As used herein, âexpressionâ refers to the process by which a polynucleotide is transcribed from a DNA template (such as into and mRNA or other RNA transcript) and/or the process by which a transcribed mRNA is subsequently translated into peptides, polypeptides, or proteins. Transcripts and encoded polypeptides may be collectively referred to as âgene product.â If the polynucleotide is derived from genomic DNA, expression may include splicing of the mRNA in a eukaryotic cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The terms âpolypeptideâ, âpeptideâ and âproteinâ are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation, such as conjugation with a labeling component. As used herein the term âamino acidâ includes natural and/or unnatural or synthetic amino acids, including glycine and both the D or L optical isomers, and amino acid analogs and peptidomimetics.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The terms âsubject.â âindividual,â and âpatientâ are used interchangeably herein to refer to a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human. Mammals include, but are not limited to, murines, simians, humans, farm animals, sport animals, and pets. Tissues, cells and their progeny of a biological entity obtained in vivo or cultured in vitro are also encompassed. In some embodiments, a subject may be an invertebrate animal, for example, an insect or a nematode; while in others, a subject may be a plant or a fungus.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The terms âtherapeutic agentâ, âtherapeutic capable agentâ or âtreatment agentâ are used interchangeably and refer to a molecule or compound that confers some beneficial effect upon administration to a subject. The beneficial effect includes enablement of diagnostic determinations; amelioration of a disease, symptom, disorder, or pathological condition; reducing or preventing the onset of a disease, symptom, disorder or condition; and generally counteracting a disease, symptom, disorder or pathological condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">As used herein, âtreatmentâ or âtreating,â or âpalliatingâ or âamelioratingâ are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant any therapeutically relevant improvement in or effect on one or more diseases, conditions, or symptoms under treatment. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a subject at risk of developing a particular disease, condition, or symptom, or to a subject reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though the disease, condition, or symptom may not have yet been manifested.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The term âeffective amountâ or âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to the amount of an agent that is sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon one or more of: the subject and disease condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will provide an image for detection by any one of the imaging methods described herein. The specific dose may vary depending on one or more of: the particular agent chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to be imaged, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The practice of the present invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of immunology, biochemistry, chemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genomics and recombinant DNA, which are within the skill of the art. See Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL, 2nd edition (1989); CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (F. M. Ausubel, et al. eds., (1987)); the series METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY (Academic Press, Inc.): PCR 2: A PRACTICAL APPROACH (M. J. MacPherson, B. D. Hames and G. R. Taylor eds. (1995)), Harlow and Lane, eds. (1988) ANTIBODIES, A LABORATORY MANUAL, and ANIMAL CELL CULTURE (R. I. Freshney, ed. (1987)).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Several aspects of the invention relate to vector systems comprising one or more vectors, or vectors as such. Vectors can be designed for expression of CRISPR transcripts (e.g. nucleic acid transcripts, proteins, or enzymes) in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. For example, CRISPR transcripts can be expressed in bacterial cells such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, insect cells (using baculovirus expression vectors), yeast cells, or mammalian cells. Suitable host cells are discussed further in Goeddel, GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press. San Diego, Calif. (1990). Alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can be transcribed and translated in vitro, for example using T7 promoter regulatory sequences and T7 polymerase.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Vectors may be introduced and propagated in a prokaryote. In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell or as an intermediate vector in the production of a vector to be introduced into a eukaryotic cell (e.g. amplifying a plasmid as part of a viral vector packaging system). In some embodiments, a prokaryote is used to amplify copies of a vector and express one or more nucleic acids, such as to provide a source of one or more proteins for delivery to a host cell or host organism. Expression of proteins in prokaryotes is most often carried out in <i>Escherichia coli </i>with vectors containing constitutive or inducible promoters directing the expression of either fusion or non-fusion proteins. Fusion vectors add a number of amino acids to a protein encoded therein, such as to the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. Such fusion vectors may serve one or more purposes, such as: (i) to increase expression of recombinant protein; (ii) to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein; and (iii) to aid in the purification of the recombinant protein by acting as a ligand in affinity purification. Often, in fusion expression vectors, a proteolytic cleavage site is introduced at the junction of the fusion moiety and the recombinant protein to enable separation of the recombinant protein from the fusion moiety subsequent to purification of the fusion protein. Such enzymes, and their cognate recognition sequences, include Factor Xa, thrombin and enterokinase. Example fusion expression vectors include pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc; Smith and Johnson, 1988<i>. Gene </i>67: 31-40), pMAL (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.) and pRIT5 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.) that fuse glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose E binding protein, or protein A, respectively, to the target recombinant protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Examples of suitable inducible non-fusion <i>E. coli </i>expression vectors include pTrc (Amrann et al., (1988) <i>Gene </i>69:301-315) and pET 11d (Studier et al., GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGY: METHODS IN ENZYMOLOGY 185, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990) 60-89).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In some embodiments, a vector is a yeast expression vector. Examples of vectors for expression in yeast <i>Saccharonces cerivisae </i>include pYepSec1 (Baldari, et al., 1987<i>. EMBO J. </i>6: 229-234), pMFa (Kuijan and Herskowitz, 1982<i>. Cell </i>30: 933-943), pJRY88 (Schultz et al., 1987<i>. Gene </i>54: 113-123), pYES2 (Invitrogen Corporation, San Diego, Calif.), and picZ (InVitrogen Corp, San Diego, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">In some embodiments, a vector drives protein expression in insect cells using baculovirus expression vectors. Baculovirus vectors available for expression of proteins in cultured insect cells (e.g., SF9 cells) include the pAc series (Smith, et al., 1983<i>. Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>3: 2156-2165) and the pVL series (Lucklow and Summers, 1989. <i>Virology </i>170: 31-39).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In some embodiments, a vector is capable of driving expression of one or more sequences in mammalian cells using a mammalian expression vector. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include pCDM8 (Seed, 1987<i>. Nature </i>329: 840) and pMT2PC (Kaufman, et al., 1987<i>. EMBO J. </i>6: 187-195). When used in mammalian cells, the expression vector's control functions are typically provided by one or more regulatory elements. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, adenovirus 2, cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40, and others disclosed herein and known in the art. For other suitable expression systems for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells see, e.g., Chapters 16 and 17 of Sambrook, et al., MOLECULAR CLONING: A LABORATORY MANUAL. 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">In some embodiments, the recombinant mammalian expression vector is capable of directing expression of the nucleic acid preferentially in a particular cell type (e.g., tissue-specific regulatory elements are used to express the nucleic acid). Tissue-specific regulatory elements are known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable tissue-specific promoters include the albumin promoter (liver-specific; Pinkert, et al., 1987. <i>Genes Dev. </i>1: 268-277), lymphoid-specific promoters (Calame and Eaton, 1988<i>. Adv. Immunol. </i>43: 235-275), in particular promoters of T cell receptors (Winoto and Baltimore, 1989. <i>EMBO J. </i>8: 729-733) and immunoglobulins (Baneiji, et al., 1983<i>. Cell </i>33: 729-740; Queen and Baltimore, 1983<i>. Cell </i>33: 741-748), neuron-specific promoters (e.g., the neurofilament promoter; Byrne and Ruddle, 1989<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86: 5473-5477), pancreas-specific promoters (Edlund, et al., 1985. <i>Science </i>230: 912-916), and mammary gland-specific promoters (e.g., milk whey promoter; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316 and European Application Publication No. 264,166). Developmentally-regulated promoters are also encompassed, e.g., the murine hox promoters (Kessel and Gruss, 1990. <i>Science </i>249: 374-379) and the Î±-fetoprotein promoter (Campes and Tilghman, 1989. <i>Genes Dev. </i>3: 537-546).</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In some embodiments, a regulatory element is operably linked to one or more elements of a CRISPR system so as to drive expression of the one or more elements of the CRISPR system. In general, CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), also known as SPIDRs (SPacer Interspersed Direct Repeats), constitute a family of DNA loci that are usually specific to a particular bacterial species. The CRISPR locus comprises a distinct class of interspersed short sequence repeats (SSRs) that were recognized in <i>E. coli </i>(Ishino et al., J. Bacteriol., 169:5429-5433 [1987]; and Nakata et al., J. Bacteriol., 171:3553-3556 [1989]), and associated genes. Similar interspersed SSRs have been identified in <i>Halojerax mediterranei, Streptococcus pyogenes, Anabaena</i>, and <i>Mycobacteriumn tuberculosis </i>(See, Groenen et al., Mol. Microbiol., 10:1057-1065 [1993]; Hoe et al., Emerg. Infect. Dis., 5:254-263 [1999]; Masepohl et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1307:26-30 [1996]; and Mojica et al., Mol. Microbiol., 17:85-93 [1995]). The CRISPR loci typically differ from other SSRs by the structure of the repeats, which have been termed short regularly spaced repeats (SRSRs) (Janssen et al., OMICS J. Integ. Biol., 6:23-33 [2002]; and Mojica et al., Mol. Microbiol., 36:244-246 [2000]). In general, the repeats are short elements that occur in clusters that are regularly spaced by unique intervening sequences with a substantially constant length (Mojica et al., [2000], supra). Although the repeat sequences are highly conserved between strains, the number of interspersed repeats and the sequences of the spacer regions typically differ from strain to strain (van Embden et al., J. Bacteriol., 182:2393-2401 [2000]). CRISPR loci have been identified in more than 40 prokaryotes (See e.g., Jansen et al., Mol. Microbiol., 43:1565-1575 [2002]; and Mojica et al., [2005]) including, but not limited to <i>Aeropyrum, Pyrobaculunm, Sulfolobus, Archaeoglobus, Halocarcula, Methanobacterium, Methanococcus, Methanosarcina, Methanopyrus, Pyrococcus, Picrophilus, Thermoplasma, Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium, Streptomyces, Aquifex, Porphyromonas, Chlorobium, Thermus, Bacillus, Listeria, Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Thermoanaerobacter, Mycoplasma, Fusobacterium, Azarcus, Chromobacterium, Neisseria, Nitrosomronas, Desulfrvibrio, Geobacter, Mvxococcus, Canmpylobacter, Wolinella, Acinetobacter, Erwinia, Escherichia, Legionella, Methylococcus, Pasteurella, Photobacterium. Salmhnonella, Xanthomonas, Yersinia, Treponenma, and Thermotoga. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In general, âCRISPR systemâ refers collectively to transcripts and other elements involved in the expression of or directing the activity of CRISPR-associated (âCasâ) genes, including sequences encoding a Cas gene, a tracr (trans-activating CRISPR) sequence (e.g. tracrRNA or an active partial tracrRNA), a tracr-mate sequence (encompassing a âdirect repeatâ and a tracrRNA-processed partial direct repeat in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system), a guide sequence (also referred to as a âspacerâ in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system), or other sequences and transcripts from a CRISPR locus. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a CRISPR system is derived from a type I, type II, or type III CRISPR system. In some embodiments, one or more elements of a CRISPR system is derived from a particular organism comprising an endogenous CRISPR system, such as <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. In general, a CRISPR system is characterized by elements that promote the formation of a CRISPR complex at the site of a target sequence (also referred to as a protospacer in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system). In the context of formation of a CRISPR complex, âtarget sequenceâ refers to a sequence to which a guide sequence is designed to have complementarity, where hybridization between a target sequence and a guide sequence promotes the formation of a CRISPR complex. Full complementarity is not necessarily required, provided there is sufficient complementarity to cause hybridisation and promote formation of a CRISPR complex. A target sequence may comprise any polynucleotide, such as DNA or RNA polynucleotides. In some embodiments, a target sequence is located in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a cell. In some embodiments, the target sequence may be within an organelle of a eukaryotic cell, for example, mitochondrion or chloroplast. A sequence or template that may be used for recombination into the the targeted locus comprising the target sequences is referred to as an âediting templateâ or âediting polynucleotideâ or âediting sequenceâ. In aspects of the invention, an exogenous template polynucleotide may be referred to as an editing template. In an aspect of the invention the recombination is homologous recombination.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Typically, in the context of an endogenous CRISPR system, formation of a CRISPR complex (comprising a guide sequence hybridized to a target sequence and complexed with one or more Cas proteins) results in cleavage of one or both strands in or near (e.g. within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 50, or more base pairs from) the target sequence. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the tracr sequence, which may comprise or consist of all or a portion of a wild-type tracr sequence (e.g. about or more than about 20, 26, 32, 45, 48, 54, 63, 67, 85, or more nucleotides of a wild-type tracr sequence), may also form part of a CRISPR complex, such as by hybridization along at least a portion of the tracr sequence to all or a portion of a tracr mate sequence that is operably linked to the guide sequence. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence has sufficient complementarity to a tracr mate sequence to hybridise and participate in formation of a CRISPR complex. As with the target sequence, it is believed that complete complementarity is not needed, provided there is sufficient to be functional. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence has at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% of sequence complementarity along the length of the tracr mate sequence when optimally aligned. In some embodiments, one or more vectors driving expression of one or more elements of a CRISPR system are introduced into a host cell such that expression of the elements of the CRISPR system direct formation of a CRISPR complex at one or more target sites. For example, a Cas enzyme, a guide sequence linked to a tracr-mate sequence, and a tracr sequence could each be operably linked to separate regulatory elements on separate vectors. Alternatively, two or more of the elements expressed from the same or different regulatory elements, may be combined in a single vector, with one or more additional vectors providing any components of the CRISPR system not included in the first vector. CRISPR system elements that are combined in a single vector may be arranged in any suitable orientation, such as one element located 5â² with respect to (âupstreamâ of) or 3â² with respect to (âdownstreamâ of) a second element. The coding sequence of one element may be located on the same or opposite strand of the coding sequence of a second element, and oriented in the same or opposite direction. In some embodiments, a single promoter drives expression of a transcript encoding a CRISPR enzyme and one or more of the guide sequence, tracr mate sequence (optionally operably linked to the guide sequence), and a tracr sequence embedded within one or more intron sequences (e.g. each in a different intron, two or more in at least one intron, or all in a single intron). In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme, guide sequence, tracr mate sequence, and tracr sequence are operably linked to and expressed from the same promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In some embodiments, a vector comprises one or more insertion sites, such as a restriction endonuclease recognition sequence (also referred to as a âcloning siteâ). In some embodiments, one or more insertion sites (e.g. about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more insertion sites) are located upstream and/or downstream of one or more sequence elements of one or more vectors. In some embodiments, a vector comprises an insertion site upstream of a tracr mate sequence, and optionally downstream of a regulatory element operably linked to the tracr mate sequence, such that following insertion of a guide sequence into the insertion site and upon expression the guide sequence directs sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence in a eukaryotic cell. In some embodiments, a vector comprises two or more insertion sites, each insertion site being located between two tracr mate sequences so as to allow insertion of a guide sequence at each site. In such an arrangement, the two or more guide sequences may comprise two or more copies of a single guide sequence, two or more different guide sequences, or combinations of these. When multiple different guide sequences are used, a single expression construct may be used to target CRISPR activity to multiple different, corresponding target sequences within a cell. For example, a single vector may comprise about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or more guide sequences. In some embodiments, about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more such guide-sequence-containing vectors may be provided, and optionally delivered to a cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">In some embodiments, a vector comprises a regulatory element operably linked to an enzyme-coding sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme, such as a Cas protein. Non-limiting examples of Cas proteins include Cas1, Cas B, Cas2, Cas3, Cas4, Cas5, Cas6, Cas7, Cas8, Cas9 (also known as Csn1 and Csx12), Cas10, Csy1, Csy2, Csy3, Cse1, Cse2, Csc1, Csc2, Csa5, Csn2, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, Csm5, Csm6, Cmr1, Cmr3, Cmr4, Cmr5, Cmr6, Csb1, Csb2, Csb3, Csx17, Csx14, Csx10, Csx16, CsaX, Csx3, Csx1, Csx15, Csf1, Csf2, Csf3, Csf4, homologs thereof, or modified versions thereof. These enzymes are known; for example, the amino acid sequence of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 protein may be found in the SwissProt database under accession number Q99ZW2. In some embodiments, the unmodified CRISPR enzyme has DNA cleavage activity, such as Cas9. In some embodiments the CRISPR enzyme is Cas9, and may be Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes </i>or <i>S. pneumoniae</i>. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme directs cleavage of one or both strands at the location of a target sequence, such as within the target sequence and/or within the complement of the target sequence. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme directs cleavage of one or both strands within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, or more base pairs from the first or last nucleotide of a target sequence. In some embodiments, a vector encodes a CRISPR enzyme that is mutated to with respect to a corresponding wild-type enzyme such that the mutated CRISPR enzyme lacks the ability to cleave one or both strands of a target polynucleotide containing a target sequence. For example, an aspartate-to-alanine substitution (D10A) in the RuvC I catalytic domain of Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes </i>converts Cas9 from a nuclease that cleaves both strands to a nickase (cleaves a single strand). Other examples of mutations that render Cas9 a nickase include, without limitation, H840A, N854A, and N863A. In some embodiments, a Cas9 nickase may be used in combination with guide sequenc(es), e.g., two guide sequences, which target respectively sense and antisense strands of the DNA target. This combination allows both strands to be nicked and used to induce NHEJ. Applicants have demonstrated (data not shown) the efficacy of two nickase targets (i.e., sgRNAs targeted at the same location but to different strands of DNA) in inducing mutagenic NHEJ. A single nickase (Cas9-D10A with a single sgRNA) is unable to induce NHEJ and create indels but Applicants have shown that double nickase (Cas9-D10A and two sgRNAs targeted to different strands at the same location) can do so in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The efficiency is about 50% of nuclease (i.e., regular Cas9 without D10 mutation) in hESCs.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">As a further example, two or more catalytic domains of Cas9 (RuvC I. RuvC II, and RuvC III) may be mutated to produce a mutated Cas9 substantially lacking all DNA cleavage activity. In some embodiments, a D10A mutation is combined with one or more of H840A, N854A, or N863A mutations to produce a Cas9 enzyme substantially lacking all DNA cleavage activity. In some embodiments, a CRISPR enzyme is considered to substantially lack all DNA cleavage activity when the DNA cleavage activity of the mutated enzyme is less than about 25%, 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, or lower with respect to its non-mutated form. Other mutations may be useful; where the Cas9 or other CRISPR enzyme is from a species other than <i>S. pyogenes</i>, mutations in corresponding amino acids may be made to achieve similar effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In some embodiments, an enzyme coding sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme is codon optimized for expression in particular cells, such as eukaryotic cells. The eukaryotic cells may be those of or derived from a particular organism, such as a mammal, including but not limited to human, mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, or non-human primate. In general, codon optimization refers to a process of modifying a nucleic acid sequence for enhanced expression in the host cells of interest by replacing at least one codon (e.g. about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more codons) of the native sequence with codons that are more frequently or most frequently used in the genes of that host cell while maintaining the native amino acid sequence. Various species exhibit particular bias for certain codons of a particular amino acid. Codon bias (differences in codon usage between organisms) often correlates with the efficiency of translation of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is in turn believed to be dependent on, among other things, the properties of the codons being translated and the availability of particular transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The predominance of selected tRNAs in a cell is generally a reflection of the codons used most frequently in peptide synthesis. Accordingly, genes can be tailored for optimal gene expression in a given organism based on codon optimization. Codon usage tables are readily available, for example, at the âCodon Usage Databaseâ, and these tables can be adapted in a number of ways. See Nakamura, Y., et al. âCodon usage tabulated from the international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000â Nucl. Acids Res. 28:292 (2000). Computer algorithms for codon optimizing a particular sequence for expression in a particular host cell are also available, such as Gene Forge (Aptagen; Jacobus, Pa.), are also available. In some embodiments, one or more codons (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, or more, or all codons) in a sequence encoding a CRISPR enzyme correspond to the most frequently used codon for a particular amino acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In some embodiments, a vector encodes a CRISPR enzyme comprising one or more nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), such as about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs. In some embodiments, the CRISPR enzyme comprises about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the amino-terminus, about or more than about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more NLSs at or near the carboxy-terminus, or a combination of these (e.g. one or more NLS at the amino-terminus and one or more NLS at the carboxy terminus). When more than one NLS is present, each may be selected independently of the others, such that a single NLS may be present in more than one copy and/or in combination with one or more other NLSs present in one or more copies. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the CRISPR enzyme comprises at most 6 NLSs. In some embodiments, an NLS is considered near the N- or C-terminus when the nearest amino acid of the NLS is within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more amino acids along the polypeptide chain from the N- or C-terminus. Typically, an NLS consists of one or more short sequences of positively charged lysines or arginines exposed on the protein surface, but other types of NLS are known. Non-limiting examples of NLSs include an NLS sequence derived from: the NLS of the SV40 virus large T-antigen, having the amino acid sequence PKKKRKV; the NLS from nucleoplasmin (e.g. the nucleoplasmin bipartite NLS with the sequence KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK); the c-myc NLS having the amino acid sequence PAAKRVKLD or RQRRNELKRSP; the hRNPAI M9 NLS having the sequence NQSSNFGPMKGGNFGGRSSGPYGGGGQYFAKPRNQGGY; the sequence RMRIZFKNKGKDTAELRRRRVEVSVELRKAKKDEQILKRRNV of the IBB domain from importin-alpha; the sequences VSRKRPRP and PPKKARED of the myoma T protein; the sequence POPKKKPL of human p53; the sequence SALIKKKKKMAP of mouse c-abl IV; the sequences DRLRR and PKQKKRK of the influenza virus NS1; the sequence RKLKKKIKKL of the Hepatitis virus delta antigen; the sequence REKKKFLKRR of the mouse Mx1 protein; the sequence KRKGDEVDGVDEVAKKKSKK of the human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and the sequence RKCLQAGMNLEARKTKK of the steroid hormone receptors (human) glucocorticoid.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">In general, the one or more NLSs are of sufficient strength to drive accumulation of the CRISPR enzyme in a detectable amount in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. In general, strength of nuclear localization activity may derive from the number of NLSs in the CRISPR enzyme, the particular NLS(s) used, or a combination of these factors. Detection of accumulation in the nucleus may be performed by any suitable technique. For example, a detectable marker may be fused to the CRISPR enzyme, such that location within a cell may be visualized, such as in combination with a means for detecting the location of the nucleus (e.g. a stain specific for the nucleus such as DAPI). Examples of detectable markers include fluorescent proteins (such as Green fluorescent proteins, or GFP; RFP; CFP), and epitope tags (HA tag, flag tag, SNAP tag). Cell nuclei may also be isolated from cells, the contents of which may then be analyzed by any suitable process for detecting protein, such as immunohistochemistry, Western blot, or enzyme activity assay. Accumulation in the nucleus may also be determined indirectly, such as by an assay for the effect of CRISPR complex formation (e.g. assay for DNA cleavage or mutation at the target sequence, or assay for altered gene expression activity affected by CRISPR complex formation and/or CRISPR enzyme activity), as compared to a control no exposed to the CRISPR enzyme or complex, or exposed to a CRISPR enzyme lacking the one or more NLSs.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">In general, a guide sequence is any polynucleotide sequence having sufficient complementarity with a target polynucleotide sequence to hybridize with the target sequence and direct sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to the target sequence. In some embodiments, the degree of complementarity between a guide sequence and its corresponding target sequence, when optimally aligned using a suitable alignment algorithm, is about or more than about 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or more. Optimal alignment may be determined with the use of any suitable algorithm for aligning sequences, non-limiting example of which include the Smith-Waterman algorithm, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, algorithms based on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (e.g. the Burrows Wheeler Aligner), ClustalW, Clustal X, BLAT, Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, ELAND (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.), SOAP (available at soap.genomics.org.cn), and Maq (available at maq.sourceforge.net). In some embodiments, a guide sequence is about or more than about 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, or more nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, a guide sequence is less than about 75, 50, 45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 12, or fewer nucleotides in length. The ability of a guide sequence to direct sequence-specific binding of a CRISPR complex to a target sequence may be assessed by any suitable assay. For example, the components of a CRISPR system sufficient to form a CRISPR complex, including the guide sequence to be tested, may be provided to a host cell having the corresponding target sequence, such as by transfection with vectors encoding the components of the CRISPR sequence, followed by an assessment of preferential cleavage within the target sequence, such as by Surveyor assay as described herein. Similarly, cleavage of a target polynucleotide sequence may be evaluated in a test tube by providing the target sequence, components of a CRISPR complex, including the guide sequence to be tested and a control guide sequence different from the test guide sequence, and comparing binding or rate of cleavage at the target sequence between the test and control guide sequence reactions. Other assays are possible, and will occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">A guide sequence may be selected to target any target sequence. In some embodiments, the target sequence is a sequence within a genome of a cell. Exemplary target sequences include those that are unique in the target genome. For example, for the <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9, a unique target sequence in a genome may include a Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNNXGG where NNNNNNNNNNNNXGG (N is A, G, T, or C; and X can be anything) has a single occurrence in the genome. A unique target sequence in a genome may include an <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNXGG where NNNNNNNNNNNXGG (N is A, G, T, or C; and X can be anything) has a single occurrence in the genome. For the <i>S. thermophilus </i>CRISPR1 Cas9, a unique target sequence in a genome may include a Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNNXXAGAAW where NNNNNNNNNNNNXXAGAAW (N is A, G, T, or C; X can be anything; and W is A or T) has a single occurrence in the genome. A unique target sequence in a genome may include an <i>S. thermophilus </i>CRISPR1 Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNXXAGAAW where NNNNNNNNNNNXXAGAAW (N is A, G, T, or C; X can be anything; and W is A or T) has a single occurrence in the genome. For the <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9, a unique target sequence in a genome may include a Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNNXGGXG where NNNNNNNNNNNNXGGXG (N is A, G, T, or C; and X can be anything) has a single occurrence in the genome. A unique target sequence in a genome may include an <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 target site of the form MMMMMMMMMNNNNNNNNNNNXGGXG where NNNNNNNNNNNXGGXG (N is A, G, T, or C; and X can be anything) has a single occurrence in the genome. In each of these sequences âMâ may be A. G, T, or C, and need not be considered in identifying a sequence as unique.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In some embodiments, a guide sequence is selected to reduce the degree of secondary structure within the guide sequence. Secondary structure may be determined by any suitable polynucleotide folding algorithm. Some programs are based on calculating the minimal Gibbs free energy. An example of one such algorithm is mFold, as described by Zuker and Stiegler (Nucleic Acids Res. 9 (1981), 133-148). Another example folding algorithm is the online webserver RNAfold, developed at Institute for Theoretical Chemistry at the University of Vienna, using the centroid structure prediction algorithm (see e.g. A.

      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">In general, a tracr mate sequence includes any sequence that has sufficient complementarity with a tracr sequence to promote one or more of: (1) excision of a guide sequence flanked by tracr mate sequences in a cell containing the corresponding tracr sequence; and (2) formation of a CRISPR complex at a target sequence, wherein the CRISPR complex comprises the tracr mate sequence hybridized to the tracr sequence. In general, degree of complementarity is with reference to the optimal alignment of the tracr mate sequence and tracr sequence, along the length of the shorter of the two sequences. Optimal alignment may be determined by any suitable alignment algorithm, and may further account for secondary structures, such as self-complementarity within either the tracr sequence or tracr mate sequence. In some embodiments, the degree of complementarity between the tracr sequence and tracr mate sequence along the length of the shorter of the two when optimally aligned is about or more than about 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%, 99%, or higher. Example illustrations of optimal alignment between a tracr sequence and a tracr mate sequence are provided in <figref>FIGS. 12B and 13B</figref>. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence is about or more than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, or more nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the tracr sequence and tracr mate sequence are contained within a single transcript, such that hybridization between the two produces a transcript having a secondary structure, such as a hairpin. Preferred loop forming sequences for use in hairpin structures are four nucleotides in length, and most preferably have the sequence GAAA. However, longer or shorter loop sequences may be used, as may alternative sequences. The sequences preferably include a nucleotide triplet (for example, AAA), and an additional nucleotide (for example C or G). Examples of loop forming sequences include CAAA and AAAG. In an embodiment of the invention, the transcript or transcribed polynucleotide sequence has at least two or more hairpins. In preferred embodiments, the transcript has two, three, four or five hairpins. In a further embodiment of the invention, the transcript has at most five hairpins. In some embodiments, the single transcript further includes a transcription termination sequence; preferably this is a polyT sequence, for example six T nucleotides.

A recombination template may be a component of another vector as described herein, contained in a separate vector, or provided as a separate polynucleotide.

In some aspects, the invention further provides cells produced by such methods, and organisms (such as animals, plants, or fungi) comprising or produced from such cells. In some embodiments, a CRISPR enzyme in combination with (and optionally complexed with) a guide sequence is delivered to a cell. Conventional viral and non-viral based gene transfer methods can be used to introduce nucleic acids in mammalian cells or target tissues. Such methods can be used to administer nucleic acids encoding components of a CRISPR system to cells in culture, or in a host organism. Non-viral vector delivery systems include DNA plasmids, RNA (e.g. a transcript of a vector described herein), naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle, such as a liposome.

      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">The preparation of lipid:nucleic acid complexes, including targeted liposomes such as immunolipid complexes, is well known to one of skill in the art (see, e.g., Crystal, Science 270:404-410 (1995); Blaese et al., Cancer Gene Ther. 2:291-297 (1995); Behr et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 5:382-389 (1994); Remy et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 5:647-654 (1994); Gao et al., Gene Therapy 2:710-722 (1995); Ahmad et al., Cancer Res. 52:4817-4820 (1992); U.S. Pat.

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">The use of RNA or DNA viral based systems for the delivery of nucleic acids takes advantage of highly evolved processes for targeting a virus to specific cells in the body and trafficking the viral payload to the nucleus. Viral vectors can be administered directly to patients (in vivo) or they can be used to treat cells in vitro, and the modified cells may optionally be administered to patients (ex vivo). Conventional viral based systems could include retroviral, lentivirus, adenoviral, adeno-associated and herpes simplex virus vectors for gene transfer. Integration in the host genome is possible with the retrovirus, lentivirus, and adeno-associated virus gene transfer methods, often resulting in long term expression of the inserted transgene. Additionally, high transduction efficiencies have been observed in many different cell types and target tissues.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">The tropism of a retrovirus can be altered by incorporating foreign envelope proteins, expanding the potential target population of target cells. Lentiviral vectors are retroviral vectors that are able to transduce or infect non-dividing cells and typically produce high viral titers. Selection of a retroviral gene transfer system would therefore depend on the target tissue. Retroviral vectors are comprised of cis-acting long terminal repeats with packaging capacity for up to 6-10 kb of foreign sequence. The minimum cis-acting LTRs are sufficient for replication and packaging of the vectors, which are then used to integrate the therapeutic gene into the target cell to provide permanent transgene expression. Widely used retroviral vectors include those based upon murine leukemia virus (MuLV), gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), Simian Immuno deficiency virus (SIV), human immuno deficiency virus (HIV), and combinations thereof (see, e.g., Buchscher et al., J. Virol. 66:2731-2739 (1992); Johann et al., J. Virol. 66:1635-1640 (1992); Sommnerfelt et al., Virol. 176:58-59 (1990); Wilson et al., J. Virol. 63:2374-2378 (1989); Miller et al., J. Virol. 65:2220-2224 (1991); PCT/US94/05700).</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">In applications where transient expression is preferred, adenoviral based systems may be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus (âAAVâ) vectors may also be used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures (see, e.g., West et al., Virology 160:38-47 (1987); U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,368; WO 93/24641; Kotin, Human Gene Therapy 5:793-801 (1994); Muzyczka, J. Clin. Invest. 94:1351 (1994). Construction of recombinant AAV vectors are described in a number of publications, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,414; Tratschin et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5:3251-3260 (1985); Tratschin, et al., Mol.

      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Packaging cells are typically used to form virus particles that are capable of infecting a host cell. Such cells include 293 cells, which package adenovirus, and Ï2 cells or PA317 cells, which package retrovirus. Viral vectors used in gene therapy are usually generated by producing a cell line that packages a nucleic acid vector into a viral particle. The vectors typically contain the minimal viral sequences required for packaging and subsequent integration into a host, other viral sequences being replaced by an expression cassette for the polynucleotide(s) to be expressed. The missing viral functions are typically supplied in trans by the packaging cell line. For example, AAV vectors used in gene therapy typically only possess ITR sequences from the AAV genome which are required for packaging and integration into the host genome. Viral DNA is packaged in a cell line, which contains a helper plasmid encoding the other AAV genes, namely rep and cap, but lacking ITR sequences. The cell line may also also infected with adenovirus as a helper. The helper virus promotes replication of the AAV vector and expression of AAV genes from the helper plasmid. The helper plasmid is not packaged in significant amounts due to a lack of ITR sequences. Contamination with adenovirus can be reduced by, e.g., heat treatment to which adenovirus is more sensitive than AAV. Additional methods for the delivery of nucleic acids to cells are known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, US20030087817, incorporated herein by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0126">Embodiments of the invention also relate to methods and compositions related to knocking out genes, amplifying genes and repairing particular mutations associated with DNA repeat instability and neurological disorders (Robert D. Wells, Tetsuo Ashizawa, Genetic Instabilities and Neurological Diseases, Second Edition, Academic Press, Oct. 13, 2011âMedical). Specific aspects of tandem repeat sequences have been found to be responsible for more than twenty human diseases (New insights into repeat instability: role of RNA*DNA hybrids. Mclvor El, Polak U. Napierala M. RNA Biol. 2010 September-October; 7(5):551-8). The CRISPR-Cas system may be harnessed to correct these defects of genomic instability.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0127">A further aspect of the invention relates to utilizing the CRISPR-Cas system for correcting defects in the EMP2A and EMP2B genes that have been identified to be associated with Lafora disease. Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive condition which is characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy which may start as epileptic seizures in adolescence. A few cases of the disease may be caused by mutations in genes yet to be identified. The disease causes seizures, muscle spasms, difficulty walking, dementia, and eventually death. There is currently no therapy that has proven effective against disease progression. Other genetic abnormalities associated with epilepsy may also be targeted by the CRISPR-Cas system and the underlying genetics is further described in Genetics of Epilepsy and Genetic Epilepsies, edited by Giuliano Avanzini, Jeffrey L. Noebels, Mariani Foundation Paediatric Neurology:20; 2009).</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0128">In yet another aspect of the invention, the CRISPR-Cas system may be Cl used to correct ocular defects that arise from several genetic mutations further described in Genetic Diseases of the Eye, Second Edition, edited by Elias I. Traboulsi, Oxford University Press, 2012.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0129">Several further aspects of the invention relate to correcting defects associated with a wide range of genetic diseases which are further described on the website of the National Institutes of Health under the topic subsection Genetic Disorders. The genetic brain diseases may include but are not limited to Adrenoleukodystrophy, Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, Aicardi Syndrome, Alpers' Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Barth Syndrome, Batten Disease, CADASIL, Cerebellar Degeneration, Fabry's Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease, Huntington's Disease and other Triplet Repeat Disorders, Leigh's Disease, Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome, Menkes Disease, Mitochondrial Myopathies and NINDS Colpocephaly.

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0149">Chronic administration of protein therapeutics may elicit unacceptable immune responses to the specific protein. The immunogenicity of protein drugs can be ascribed to a few immunodominant helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes. Reducing the MHC binding affinity of these HTL epitopes contained within these proteins can generate drugs with lower immunogenicity (Tangri S, et al. (âRationally engineered therapeutic proteins with reduced immunogenicityâ J Immunol. 2005 Mar. 15; 174(6):3187-96.) In the present invention, the immunogenicity of the CRISPR enzyme in particular may be reduced following the approach first set out in Tangri et al with respect to erythropoietin and subsequently developed. Accordingly, directed evolution or rational design may be used to reduce the immunogenicity of the CRISPR enzyme (for instance a Cas9) in the host species (human or other species).</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0150">In plants, pathogens are often host-specific. For example, <i>Fusarium oxysporum </i>f. sp. <i>lycopersici </i>causes tomato wilt but attacks only tomato, and <i>F. oxysporum f: dianthii Puccinia graminis </i>f. sp. <i>tritici </i>attacks only wheat. Plants have existing and induced defenses to resist most pathogens. Mutations and recombination events across plant generations lead to genetic variability that gives rise to susceptibility, especially as pathogens reproduce with more frequency than plants. In plants there can be non-host resistance, e.g., the host and pathogen are incompatible. There can also be Horizontal Resistance, e.g., partial resistance against all races of a pathogen, typically controlled by many genes and Vertical Resistance, e.g., complete resistance to some races of a pathogen but not to other races, typically controlled by a few genes. In a Gene-for-Gene level, plants and pathogens evolve together, and the genetic changes in one balance changes in other. Accordingly, using Natural Variability, breeders combine most useful genes for Yield, Quality, Uniformity, Hardiness, Resistance. The sources of resistance genes include native or foreign Varieties, Heirloom Varieties, Wild Plant Relatives, and Induced Mutations, e.g., treating plant material with mutagenic agents. Using the present invention, plant breeders are provided with a new tool to induce mutations. Accordingly, one skilled in the art can analyze the genome of sources of resistance genes, and in Varieties having desired characteristics or traits employ the present invention to induce the rise of resistance genes, with more precision than previous mutagenic agents and hence accelerate and improve plant breeding programs.</p>

      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0153">An example type II CRISPR system is the type I CRISPR locus from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>SF370, which contains a cluster of four genes Cas9, Cas1, Cas2, and Csn1, as well as two non-coding RNA elements, tracrRNA and a characteristic array of repetitive sequences (direct repeats) interspaced by short stretches of non-repetitive sequences (spacers, about 30 bp each). In this system, targeted DNA double-strand break (DSB) is generated in four sequential steps (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>). First, two non-coding RNAs, the pre-crRNA array and tracrRNA, are transcribed from the CRISPR locus. Second, tracrRNA hybridizes to the direct repeats of pre-crRNA, which is then processed into mature crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences. Third, the mature crRNA:tracrRNA complex directs Cas9 to the DNA target consisting of the protospacer and the corresponding PAM via heteroduplex formation between the spacer region of the crRNA and the protospacer DNA. Finally, Cas9 mediates cleavage of target DNA upstream of PAM to create a DSB within the protospacer (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>). This example describes an example process for adapting this RNA-programmable nuclease system to direct CRISPR complex activity in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0154">To improve expression of CRISPR components in mammalian cells, two genes from the SF370 locus 1 of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(<i>S. pyogenes</i>) were codon-optimized, Cas9 (SpCas9) and RNase III (SpRNase III). To facilitate nuclear localization, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) was included at the amino (N)- or carboxyl (C)-termini of both SpCas9 and SpRNase III (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>). To facilitate visualization of protein expression, a fluorescent protein marker was also included at the N- or C-termini of both proteins (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>). A version of SpCas9 with an NLS attached to both N- and C-termini (2ÃNLS-SpCas9) was also generated. Constructs containing NLS-fused SpCas9 and SpRNase III were transfected into 293FT human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, and the relative positioning of the NLS to SpCas9 and SpRNase III was found to affect their nuclear localization efficiency. Whereas the C-terminal NLS was sufficient to target SpRNase III to the nucleus, attachment of a single copy of these particular NLS's to either the N- or C-terminus of SpCas9 was unable to achieve adequate nuclear localization in this system. In this example, the C-terminal NLS was that of nucleoplasmin (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK), and the C-terminal NLS was that of the SV40 large T-antigen (PKKKRKV). Of the versions of SpCas9 tested, only 2ÃNLS-SpCas9 exhibited nuclear localization (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0155">The tracrRNA from the CRISPR locus of <i>S. pyogenes </i>SF370 has two transcriptional start sites, giving rise to two transcripts of 89-nucleotides (nt) and 171nt that are subsequently processed into identical 75nt mature tracrRNAs. The shorter 89nt tracrRNA was selected for expression in mammalian cells (expression constructs illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, with functionality as determined by results of Surveryor assay shown in <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>). Transcription start sites are marked as +1, and transcription terminator and the sequence probed by northern blot are also indicated. Expression of processed tracrRNA was also confirmed by Northern blot. <figref>FIG. 7C</figref> shows results of a Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from 293FT cells transfected with U6 expression constructs carrying long or short tracrRNA, as well as SpCas9 and DR-EMX1(1)-DR. Left and right panels are from 293FT cells transfected without or with SpRNase III, respectively. U6 indicate loading control blotted with a probe targeting human U6 snRNA. Transfection of the short tracrRNA expression construct led to abundant levels of the processed form of tracrRNA (Ë75 bp). Very low amounts of long tracrRNA are detected on the Northern blot.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0156">To promote precise transcriptional initiation, the RNA polymerase III-based U6 promoter was selected to drive the expression of tracrRNA (<figref>FIG. 2C</figref>). Similarly, a U6 promoter-based construct was developed to express a pre-crRNA array consisting of a single spacer flanked by two direct repeats (DRs, also encompassed by the term âtracr-mate sequencesâ; <figref>FIG. 2C</figref>). The initial spacer was designed to target a 33-base-pair (bp) target site (30-bp protospacer plus a 3-bp CRISPR motif (PAM) sequence satisfying the NGG recognition motif of Cas9) in the human EMX1 locus (<figref>FIG. 2C</figref>), a key gene in the development of the cerebral cortex.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0157">To test whether heterologous expression of the CRISPR system (SpCas9, SpRNase III, tracrRNA, and pre-crRNA) in mammalian cells can achieve targeted cleavage of mammalian chromosomes, HEK 293FT cells were transfected with combinations of CRISPR components. Since DSBs in mammalian nuclei are partially repaired by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which leads to the formation of indels, the Surveyor assay was used to detect potential cleavage activity at the target EMX1 locus (see e.g. Guschin et al., 2010, Methods Mol Biol 649: 247). Co-transfection of all four CRISPR components was able to induce up to 5.0% cleavage in the protospacer (see <figref>FIG. 2D</figref>). Co-transfection of all CRISPR components minus SpRNase III also induced up to 4.7% indel in the protospacer, suggesting that there may be endogenous mammalian RNases that are capable of assisting with crRNA maturation, such as for example the related Dicer and Drosha enzymes. Removing any of the remaining three components abolished the genome cleavage activity of the CRISPR system (<figref>FIG. 2D</figref>). Sanger sequencing of amplicons containing the target locus verified the cleavage activity: in 43 sequenced clones, 5 mutated alleles (11.6%) were found. Similar experiments using a variety of guide sequences produced indel percentages as high as 29% (see <figref>FIGS. 4-8</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>). These results define a three-component system for efficient CRISPR-mediated genome modification in mammalian cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0158">To optimize the cleavage efficiency, Applicants also tested whether different isoforms of tracrRNA affected the cleavage efficiency and found that, in this example system, only the short (89-bp) transcript form was able to mediate cleavage of the human EMX1 genomic locus. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> provides an additional Northern blot analysis of crRNA processing in mammalian cells. <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates a schematic showing the expression vector for a single spacer flanked by two direct repeats (DR-EMX1(1)-DR). The 30 bp spacer targeting the human EMX1 locus protospacer 1 and the direct repeat sequences are shown in the sequence beneath <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. The line indicates the region whose reverse-complement sequence was used to generate Northern blot probes for EMX1(1) crRNA detection. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> shows a Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from 293FT cells transfected with U6 expression constructs carrying DR-EMX1(1)-DR. Left and right panels are from 293FT cells transfected without or with SpRNase III respectively. DR-EMX1(1)-DR was processed into mature crRNAs only in the presence of SpCas9 and short tracrRNA and was not dependent on the presence of SpRNase III. The mature crRNA detected from transfected 293FT total RNA is Ë33 bp and is shorter than the 39-42 bp mature crRNA from <i>S. pyogenes</i>. These results demonstrate that a CRISPR system can be transplanted into eukaryotic cells and reprogrammed to facilitate cleavage of endogenous mammalian target polynucleotides.</p>

Mature crRNA processed from the direct repeat-spacer array directs Cas9 to genomic targets consisting of complimentary protospacers and a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM). Upon target-spacer base pairing, Cas9 mediates a double-strand break in the target DNA. <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates engineering of <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 (SpCas9) and RNase III (SpRNase III) with nuclear localization signals (NLSs) to enable import into the mammalian nucleus. <figref>FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates mammalian expression of SpCas9 and SpRNase III driven by the constitutive EF1a promoter and tracrRNA and pre-crRNA array (DR-Spacer-DR) driven by the RNA Pol3 promoter U6 to promote precise transcription initiation and termination. A protospacer from the human EMX1 locus with a satisfactory PAM sequence is used as the spacer in the pre-crRNA array. <figref>FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates surveyor nuclease assay for SpCas9-mediated minor insertions and deletions. SpCas9 was expressed with and without SpRNase III, tracrRNA, and a pre-crRNA array carrying the EMX1-target spacer. <figref>FIG. 2E</figref> illustrates a schematic representation of base pairing between target locus and EMX1-targeting crRNA, as well as an example chromatogram showing a micro deletion adjacent to the SpCas9 cleavage site. <figref>FIG. 2F</figref> illustrates mutated alleles identified from sequencing analysis of 43 clonal amplicons showing a variety of micro insertions and deletions.

      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0160">To further simplify the three-component system, a chimeric crRNA-tracrRNA hybrid design was adapted, where a mature crRNA (comprising a guide sequence) is fused to a partial tracrRNA via a stem-loop to mimic the natural crRNA:tracrRNA duplex (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>).</p>

Protospacers on the sense and anti-sense strands are indicated above and below the DNA sequences, respectively. A modification rate of 6.3% and 0.75% was achieved for the human PVALB and mouse Th loci respectively, demonstrating the broad applicability of the CRISPR system in modifying different loci across multiple organisms While cleavage was only detected with one out of three spacers for each locus using the chimeric constructs, all target sequences were cleaved with efficiency of indel production reaching 27% when using the co-expressed pre-crRNA arrangement (<figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>).</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> provides a further illustration that SpCas9 can be reprogrammed to target multiple genomic loci in mammalian cells. <figref>FIG. 5A</figref> provides a schematic of the human EMX1 locus showing the location of five protospacers, indicated by the underlined sequences. <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> provides a schematic of the pre-crRNA/trcrRNA complex showing hybridization between the direct repeat region of the pre-crRNA and tracrRNA (top), and a schematic of a chimeric RNA design comprising a 20 bp guide sequence, and tracr mate and tracr sequences consisting of partial direct repeat and tracrRNA sequences hybridized in a hairpin structure (bottom). Results of a Surveyor assay comparing the efficacy of Cas9-mediated cleavage at five protospacers in the human EMX1 locus is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5C</figref>. Each protospacer is targeted using either processed pre-crRNA/tracrRNA complex (crRNA) or chimeric RNA (chiRNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0163">Since the secondary structure of RNA can be crucial for intermolecular interactions, a structure prediction algorithm based on minimum free energy and Boltzmann-weighted structure ensemble was used to compare the putative secondary structure of all guide sequences used in our genome targeting experiment (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>) (see e.g. Gruber et al., 2008, Nucleic Acids Research, 36: W70). Analysis revealed that in most cases, the effective guide sequences in the chimeric crRNA context were substantially free of secondary structure motifs, whereas the ineffective guide sequences were more likely to form internal secondary structures that could prevent base pairing with the target protospacer DNA. It is thus possible that variability in the spacer secondary structure might impact the efficiency of CRISPR-mediated interference when using a chimeric crRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0164">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates example expression vectors. <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> provides a schematic of a bi-cistronic vector for driving the expression of a synthetic crRNA-tracrRNA chimera (chimeric RNA) as well as SpCas9. The chimeric guide RNA contains a 20-bp guide sequence corresponding to the protospacer in the genomic target site. <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> provides a schematic showing guide sequences targeting the human EMX1, PVALB, and mouse Th loci, as well as their predicted secondary structures. The modification efficiency at each target site is indicated below the RNA secondary structure drawing (EMX1, n=216 amplicon sequencing reads; PV4LB, n=224 reads; Th, n=265 reads). The folding algorithm produced an output with each base colored according to its probability of assuming the predicted secondary structure, as indicated by a rainbow scale that is reproduced in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> in gray scale. Further vector designs for SpCas9 are shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, including single expression vectors incorporating a U6 promoter linked to an insertion site for a guide oligo, and a Cbh promoter linked to SpCas9 coding sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0165">To test whether spacers containing secondary structures are able to function in prokaryotic cells where CRISPRs naturally operate, transformation interference of protospacer-bearing plasmids were tested in an <i>E. coli </i>strain heterologously expressing the <i>S. pyogenes </i>SF370 CRISPR locus 1 (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref>). The CRISPR locus was cloned into a low-copy <i>E. coli </i>expression vector and the crRNA array was replaced with a single spacer flanked by a pair of DRs (pCRISPR). <i>E. coli </i>strains harboring different pCRISPR plasmids were transformed with challenge plasmids containing the corresponding protospacer and PAM sequences (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref>). In the bacterial assay, all spacers facilitated efficient CRISPR interference (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref>). These results suggest that there may be additional factors affecting the efficiency of CRISPR activity in mammalian cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0166">To investigate the specificity of CRISPR-mediated cleavage, the effect of single-nucleotide mutations in the guide sequence on protospacer cleavage in the mammalian genome was analyzed using a series of EMX1-targeting chimeric crRNAs with single point mutations (<figref>FIG. 4A</figref>). <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates results of a Surveyor nuclease assay comparing the cleavage efficiency of Cas9 when paired with different mutant chimeric RNAs. Single-base mismatch up to 12-bp 5â² of the PAM substantially abrogated genomic cleavage by SpCas9, whereas spacers with mutations at farther upstream positions retained activity against the original protospacer target (<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>). In addition to the PAM, SpCas9 has single-base specificity within the last 12-bp of the spacer. Furthermore, CRISPR is able to mediate genomic cleavage as efficiently as a pair of TALE nucleases (TALEN) targeting the same EMX1 protospacer. <figref>FIG. 4C</figref> provides a schematic showing the design of TALENs targeting EMX1, and <figref>FIG. 4D</figref> shows a Surveyor gel comparing the efficiency of TALEN and Cas9 (n=3).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0167">Having established a set of components for achieving CRISPR-mediated gene editing in mammalian cells through the error-prone NHEJ mechanism, the ability of CRISPR to stimulate homologous recombination (HR), a high fidelity gene repair pathway for making precise edits in the genome, was tested. The wild type SpCas9 is able to mediate site-specific DSBs, which can be repaired through both NHEJ and HR. In addition, an aspartate-to-alanine substitution (D10A) in the RuvC I catalytic domain of SpCas9 was engineered to convert the nuclease into a nickase (SpCas9n; illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>) (see e.g. Sapranausaks et al., 2011, Cucleic Acis Research, 39: 9275; Gasiunas et al., 2012, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 109:E2579), such that nicked genomic DNA undergoes the high-fidelity homology-directed repair (HDR). Surveyor assay confirmed that SpCas9n does not generate indels at the EMX1 protospacer target. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>, co-expression of EMX1-targeting chimeric crRNA with SpCas9 produced indels in the target site, whereas co-expression with SpCas9n did not (n=3). Moreover, sequencing of 327 amplicons did not detect any indels induced by SpCas9n. The same locus was selected to test CRISPR-mediated HR by co-transfecting HEK 293FT cells with the chimeric RNA targeting EMX1, hSpCas9 or hSpCas9n, as well as a HR template to introduce a pair of restriction sites (HindIII and NheI) near the protospacer. <figref>FIG. 5C</figref> provides a schematic illustration of the HR strategy, with relative locations of recombination points and primer annealing sequences (arrows). SpCas9 and SpCas9n indeed catalyzed integration of the HR template into the EMX1 locus. PCR amplification of the target region followed by restriction digest with HindIII revealed cleavage products corresponding to expected fragment sizes (arrows in restriction fragment length polymorphism gel analysis shown in <figref>FIG. 5D</figref>), with SpCas9 and SpCas9n mediating similar levels of HR efficiencies. Applicants further verified HR using Sanger sequencing of genomic amplicons (<figref>FIG. 5E</figref>). These results demonstrate the utility of CRISPR for facilitating targeted gene insertion in the mammalian genome. Given the 14-bp (12-bp from the spacer and 2-bp from the PAM) target specificity of the wild type SpCas9, the availability of a nickase can significantly reduce the likelihood of off-target modifications, since single strand breaks are not substrates for the error-prone NHEJ pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0168">Expression constructs mimicking the natural architecture of CRISPR loci with arrayed spacers (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) were constructed to test the possibility of multiplexed sequence targeting. Using a single CRISPR array encoding a pair of EMX1- and PVALB-targeting spacers, efficient cleavage at both loci was detected (<figref>FIG. 4F</figref>, showing both a schematic design of the crRNA array and a Surveyor blot showing efficient mediation of cleavage). Targeted deletion of larger genomic regions through concurrent DSBs using spacers against two targets within EMX1 spaced by 119 bp was also tested, and a 1.6% deletion efficacy (3 out of 182 amplicons; <figref>FIG. 5G</figref>) was detected. This demonstrates that the CRISPR system can mediate multiplexed editing within a single genome.</p>

      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0169">The ability to use RNA to program sequence-specific DNA cleavage defines a new class of genome engineering tools for a variety of research and industrial applications. Several aspects of the CRISPR system can be further improved to increase the efficiency and versatility of CRISPR targeting. Optimal Cas9 activity may depend on the availability of free Mg<sup>2+</sup> at levels higher than that present in the mammalian nucleus (see e.g. Jinek et al., 2012. Science, 337:816), and the preference for an NGG motif immediately downstream of the protospacer restricts the ability to target on average every 12-bp in the human genome. Some of these constraints can be overcome by exploring the diversity of CRISPR loci across the microbial metagenome (see e.g. Makarova et al., 2011, Nat Rev Microbiol, 9:467). Other CRISPR loci may be transplanted into the mammalian cellular milieu by a process similar to that described in Example 1. The modification efficiency at each target site is indicated below the RNA secondary structures. The algorithm generating the structures colors each base according to its probability of assuming the predicted secondary structure. RNA guide spacers 1 and 2 induced 14% and 6.4%, respectively. Statistical analysis of cleavage activity across biological replica at these two protospacer sites is also provided in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>

      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Sample Target Sequence Selection Algorithm</heading>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0170">A software program is designed to identify candidate CRISPR target sequences on both strands of an input DNA sequence based on desired guide sequence length and a CRISPR motif sequence (PAM) for a specified CRISPR enzyme. For example, target sites for Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes</i>, with PAM sequences NGG, may be identified by searching for 5â²-N<sub>x</sub>-NGG-3â² both on the input sequence and on the reverse-complement of the input. Likewise, target sites for Cas9 of <i>S. thermophilus </i>CRISPR1, with PAM sequence NNAGAAW, may be identified by searching for 5â²-N<sub>x</sub>-NNAGAAW-3â² both on the input sequence and on the reverse-complement of the input. Likewise, target sites for Cas9 of <i>S. thermophilus </i>CRISPR3, with PAM sequence NGGNG, may be identified by searching for 5â²-N<sub>x</sub>-NGGNG-3â² both on the input sequence and on the reverse-complement of the input. The value âxâ in N<sub>x </sub>may be fixed by the program or specified by the user, such as 20.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0171">Since multiple occurrences in the genome of the DNA target site may lead to nonspecific genome editing, after identifying all potential sites, the program filters out sequences based on the number of times they appear in the relevant reference genome. For those CRISPR enzymes for which sequence specificity is determined by a âseedâ sequence, such as the 11-12 bp 5â² from the PAM sequence, including the PAM sequence itself, the filtering step may be based on the seed sequence. Thus, to avoid editing at additional genomic loci, results are filtered based on the number of occurrences of the seed:PAM sequence in the relevant genome. The user may be allowed to choose the length of the seed sequence. The user may also be allowed to specify the number of occurrences of the seed:PAM sequence in a genome for purposes of passing the filter. The default is to screen for unique sequences. Filtration level is altered by changing both the length of the seed sequence and the number of occurrences of the sequence in the genome. The program may in addition or alternatively provide the sequence of a guide sequence complementary to the reported target sequence(s) by providing the reverse complement of the identified target sequence(s).</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0176">To identify unique target sites for the <i>S. pyogenes </i>SF370 Cas9 (SpCas9) enzyme in the human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruit fly, and <i>C. elegans </i>genome, we developed a software package to scan both strands of a DNA sequence and identify all possible SpCas9 target sites. For this example, each SpCas9 target site was operationally defined as a 20 bp sequence followed by an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, and we identified all sequences satisfying this 5â²-N<sub>20</sub>-NGG-3â² definition on all chromosomes. To prevent non-specific genome editing, after identifying all potential sites, all target sites were filtered based on the number of times they appear in the relevant reference genome. To take advantage of sequence specificity of Cas9 activity conferred by a âseedâ sequence, which can be, for example, approximately 11-12 bp sequence 5â² from the PAM sequence, 5â²-NNNNNNNNNN-NGG-3â² sequences were selected to be unique in the relevant genome. All genomic sequences were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (Human genome hg19, Mouse genome mm9, Rat genome rn5, Zebrafish genome danRer7, <i>D. melanogaster </i>genome dm4 and <i>C. elegans </i>genome cc 10). The full search results are available to browse using UCSC Genome Browser information. An example visualization of some target sites in the human genome is provided in <figref>FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0177">Initially, three sites within the EMX1 locus in human HEK 293FT cells were targeted. Genome modification efficiency of each chiRNA was assessed using the SURVEYOR nuclease assay, which detects mutations resulting from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their subsequent repair by the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA damage repair pathway. Constructs designated chiRNA(+n) indicate that up to the +n nucleotide of wild-type tracrRNA is included in the chimeric RNA construct, with values of 48, 54, 67, and 85 used for n. Chimeric RNAs containing longer fragments of wild-type tracrRNA (chiRNA(+67) and chiRNA(+85)) mediated DNA cleavage at all three EMX1 target sites, with chiRNA(+85) in particular demonstrating significantly higher levels of DNA cleavage than the corresponding crRNA/tracrRNA hybrids that expressed guide and tracr sequences in separate transcripts (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>a</i>). Two sites in the PV4LB locus that yielded no detectable cleavage using the hybrid system (guide sequence and tracr sequence expressed as separate transcripts) were also targeted using chiRNAs. chiRNA(+67) and chiRNA(+85) were able to mediate significant cleavage at the two PVALB protospacers (<figref>FIGS. 10</figref><i>c </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0178">For all five targets in the EMX1 and PVALB loci, a consistent increase in genome modification efficiency with increasing tracr sequence length was observed. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the secondary structure formed by the 3â² end of the tracrRNA may play a role in enhancing the rate of CRISPR complex formation. An illustration of predicted secondary structures for each of the chimeric RNAs used in this example is provided in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>. The secondary structure was predicted using RNAfold (http://mrna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi) using minimum free energy and partition function algorithm. Pseudocolor for each based (reproduced in grayscale) indicates the probability of pairing. Because chiRNAs with longer tracr sequences were able to cleave targets that were not cleaved by native CRISPR crRNA/tracrRNA hybrids, it is possible that chimeric RNA may be loaded onto Cas9 more efficiently than its native hybrid counterpart. To facilitate the application of Cas9 for site-specific genome editing in eukaryotic cells and organisms, all predicted unique target sites for the <i>S. pyogenes </i>Cas9 were computationally identified in the human, mouse, rat, zebra fish, <i>C. elegans</i>, and <i>D. melanogaster </i>genomes. Chimeric RNAs can be designed for Cas9 enzymes from other microbes to expand the target space of CRISPR RNA-programmable nucleases.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 11 and 21</figref> illustrate exemplary bicistronic expression vectors for expression of chimeric RNA including up to the +85 nucleotide of wild-type tracr RNA sequence, and SpCas9 with nuclear localization sequences. SpCas9 is expressed from a CBh promoter and terminated with the bGH polyA signal (bGH pA). The expanded sequence illustrated immediately below the schematic corresponds to the region surrounding the guide sequence insertion site, and includes, from 5â² to 3â²,3â²-portion of the U6 promoter (first shaded region), BbsI cleavage sites (arrows), partial direct repeat (tracr mate sequence GTTTTAGAGCTA, underlined), loop sequence GAAA, and +85 tracr sequence (underlined sequence following loop sequence).

The experiment was conducted by co-transfecting 293FT cells with Cas9 and a U6-guide RNA DNA cassette to express one of the four RNA forms shown above. The target of the guide RNA is the same target site in the human Emx1 locus: âGTCACCTCCAATGACTAGGGâ</p>

      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0206">Applicants conducted a Metagenomic search for a Cas9 with small molecular weight. Most Cas9 homologs are fairly large. For example the SpCas9 is around 1368aa long, which is too large to be easily packaged into viral vectors for delivery. Some of the sequences may have been mis-annotated and therefore the exact frequency for each length may not necessarily be accurate. Nevertheless it provides a glimpse at distribution of Cas9 proteins and suggest that there are shorter Cas9 homologs.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0207">Through computational analysis, Applicants found that in the bacterial strain <i>Campylobacter</i>, there are two Cas9 proteins with less than 1000 amino acids. The sequence for one Cas9 from <i>Campylobacter jejuni </i>is presented below. At this length, CjCas9 can be easily packaged into AAV, lentiviruses, Adenoviruses, and other viral vectors for robust delivery into primary cells and in vivo in animal models.</p>
