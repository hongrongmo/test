    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Neurotransmitters such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine mediate a large number of processes in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as outside the CNS. Abnormal neurotransmitter levels are associated with a wide variety of diseases and conditions including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's Disease, autism, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia (such as cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), positive symptoms, disorganized symptoms, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia), anxiety, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, bipolar disorders, psychosis, depression, attention-deficit disorder (ADD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a variety of allergic diseases. Compounds that modulate these neurotransmitters may be useful therapeutics.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Histamine receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled seven transmembrane proteins. G protein-coupled receptors constitute one of the major signal transduction systems in eukaryotic cells. Coding sequences for these receptors, in those regions believed to contribute to the \agonist-antagonist binding site, are strongly conserved across mammalian species. Histamine receptors are found in most peripheral tissue and within the central nervous system. Compounds capable of modulating a histamine receptor may find use in therapy, e.g., histamine antagonists may find use as antihistamines.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dimebon is a known anti-histamine drug that has also been characterized as a neuroprotective agent useful to treat, inter alia, neurodegenerative diseases. Dimebon has been shown to inhibit the death of brain cells (neurons) in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, making it a novel potential treatment for these and other neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, dimebon has been shown to improve the mitochondrial function of cells in the setting of cellular stress with very high potency. For example, dimebon treatment improved mitochondrial function and increased the number of surviving cells after treatment with the cell toxin ionomycin in a dose dependent fashion. Dimebon has also been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis, processes important in the formation of new and/or enhanced neuronal cell connections, and evidence of dimebon's potential for use in additional diseases or conditions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,187,785 and 7,071,206 and PCT Patent Application Nos. PCT/US2004/041081, PCT/US2007/020483, PCT/US2006/039077, PCT/US2008/077090, PCT/US2007/020516, PCT/US2007/022645, PCT/US2007/002117, PCT/US2008/006667, PCT/US2007/024626, PCT/US2008/009357, PCT/US2007/024623 and PCT/US2008/008121. Hydrogenated pyrido[4,3-b]indoles and uses thereof have been disclosed in PCT Patent Application Nos. PCT/US2008/081390, PCT/US2009/032065 and PCT/US2009/038142. Hydrogenated pyrido[3,4-b]indoles and uses thereof have been described in PCT/US2009/038138. Azepino[4,5-b]indoles and uses thereof have been described in PCT/US2009/062872. All references disclosed herein and throughout, such as publications, patents, patent applications and published patent applications, are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Although dimebon holds great promise as a drug for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and/or diseases in which neurite outgrowth and/or neurogenesis may be implicated in therapy, there remains a need for new and alternative therapies for the treatment of such diseases or conditions. In addition, there remains a need for new and alternative antihistamine drugs, preferably ones in which side-effects such as drowsiness are reduced or eliminated. Compounds that exhibit enhanced and/or more desirable properties than dimebon (e.g., superior safety and efficacy) may find particular use in the treatment of at least those indications for which dimebon is believed to be advantageous. Further, compounds that exhibit a different therapeutic profile than dimebon as determined, e.g., by in vitro and/or in vivo assays, may find use in additional diseases and conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Hypertension is a serious condition that can damage vital organs, such as the heart and kidneys, and other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system. Individuals who have hypertension may have, or be at risk of developing, dangerous diseases such as coronary heart disease and kidney failure. Hypertension, which is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, causes more than 7 million deaths every year worldwide.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Hypertension is the most common chronic medical condition in developed countries as well as the most common indication for physician visits and prescription medication use. Hypertension affects more than 50 million individuals in the United States and over one billion individuals worldwide, and overall prevalence may continue to increase with the advancing age of the population.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Unfortunately, despite the importance of blood pressure control and the availability of multiple classes of antihypertensive agents, the treatment of hypertension remains suboptimal. Data from the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey demonstrate that only 34% of patients with hypertension have blood pressures at their therapeutic goal. Additionally, it was shown that the majority of patients with hypertension will require two or more antihypertensive agents to achieve their goal blood pressure. Even with optimal compliance with multiple antihypertensive agents of different classes, a significant fraction of patients will not be able to achieve their goal blood pressure. The overall prevalence of resistant hypertension, defined as elevated blood pressure in spite of the use of three or more antihypertensive agents, is unknown, but small studies suggest that it ranges from 5%-16% in primary care settings to greater than 50% in nephrology clinics. Given data suggesting that increasing age and obesity are important risk factors for the development of resistant hypertension, it is expected that the overall prevalence of this condition is likely to increase due to demographic changes in the population.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Systolic blood pressure tends to increase with age and systolic hypertension is an important health issue, prominent in the elderly (Duprez, <i>Am. J. Med. </i>121:179-184 (2008)). It has been suggested that this occurs as large vessels such as the aorta lose their elasticity with age and is less able to buffer the pulsative nature of cardiac output. There exists a need for a treatment for patients in such clinical setting, for example, patients with systolic hypertension accompanied with low diastolic pressure (Franklin et al. <i>J. Hypertension </i>29:1101-1108 (2011)).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders including obesity, hypertension, hypertrigleridemia, hypercholesterolemia and elevated blood sugar. Individuals with this spectrum of disorders are at increased risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Agents capable of treating more than one of these disorders are desirable.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in blood pressure associated with resultant organ damage (i.e., pulmonary edema, renal impairment, visual impairment, intracranial hemorrhage, or encephalopathy). The treatment of hypertensive emergencies involves aggressive and controlled blood pressure lowering in a highly monitored intensive care setting using intravenous blood pressure lowering agents. Therapeutic agents and method of treatment is needed to gradually lower blood pressure and minimize damage of end organs such as the brain, kidney, heart, and eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The frequency of chronic kidney disease also continues to increase worldwide as does the prevalence of end-stage renal disease. Although chronic kidney disease is often caused by hypertension, other factors such as a decrease in renal blood flow and increase in sodium retention or reabsorption can lead to renal diseases. Increased age and diabetes can also contribute to renal disease. Especially the elderly, which are a growing segment of the world population, are at increased risk for renal disease. The presence of chronic kidney disease is also associated with a large increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Consequently, the identification and reduction of chronic kidney disease has become a vital public health priority.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Thus, there remains a need for new and useful agents that are capable of (i) reducing an individual's blood pressure and/or (ii) promoting renal blood flow and/or (iii) inhibiting or decreasing sodium reabsorption.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Type 2 diabetes is a serious and prevalent disease. This form of diabetes may involve insulin resistance and impaired insulin release. Approximately 25.8 million people in the United States alone suffer from diabetes, whereby type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90-95% of all diagnosed diabetes cases. From 1980 to 2008 the number of Americans with diabetes has more than tripled. Diabetes is also increasingly prevalent elsewhere, such as in certain Asian countries whose populations have experienced a dramatic increase in the disease. For example, in India and China, where rapid lifestyle and economic changes have led to a more sedentary lifestyle and poorer diet among the overall population, diabetes is becoming a major health concern. In addition, more than a third of adults at least 20 years old have pre-diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Other diseases and indications, such as glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome may also be associated with impaired insulin release.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">There remains a need for new and improved therapies that enhance insulin secretion and/or promote insulin release into the blood stream in individuals who have a reduced or impaired ability to secrete insulin and/or release insulin into the blood stream.</p>

      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0076">Reference to âaboutâ a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to âabout Xâ includes description of âXâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0077">Unless clearly indicated otherwise, âan individualâ as used herein intends a mammal, including but not limited to a human. The invention may find use in both human medicine and in the veterinary context.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0078">As used herein, an âat riskâ individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a disease or condition. An individual âat riskâ may or may not have a detectable disease or condition, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. âAt riskâ denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a disease or condition and are known in the art. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disease or condition than an individual without these risk factor(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0079">As used herein, âtreatmentâ or âtreatingâ is an approach for obtaining a beneficial or desired result, including clinical results.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0080">As used herein, âdelayingâ development of a disease or condition means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize and/or postpone development of the disease or condition. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease or condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0081">As used herein, the term âeffective amountâ intends such amount of a compound of the invention which should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0082">As used herein, âunit dosage formâ refers to physically discrete units, suitable as unit dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient, or compound which may be in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0083">As used herein, by âpharmaceutically acceptableâ is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to an individual without causing significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0084">âPharmaceutically acceptable saltsâ are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth metal ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those listed in Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, <i>J. Pharm. Sci. </i>1977 January; 66(1):1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound of the invention in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0085">The term âexcipientâ as used herein includes an inert or inactive substance that may be used in the production of a drug or pharmaceutical, such as a tablet containing a compound detailed herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient. Various substances may be embraced by the term excipient, including without limitation any substance used as a binder, disintegrant, coating, compression/encapsulation aid, cream or lotion, lubricant, solutions for parenteral administration, materials for chewable tablets, sweetener or flavoring, suspending/gelling agent, or wet granulation agent. Binders include, e.g., carbomers, povidone, xanthan gum, etc.; coatings include, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, gellan gum, maltodextrin, enteric coatings, etc.; compression/encapsulation aids include, e.g., calcium carbonate, dextrose, fructose dc (dc=âdirectly compressibleâ), honey dc, lactose (anhydrate or monohydrate; optionally in combination with aspartame, cellulose, or microcrystalline cellulose), starch dc, sucrose, etc.; disintegrants include, e.g., croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, sodium starch glycolate, etc.; creams or lotions include, e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenans, etc.; lubricants include, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, etc.; materials for chewable tablets include, e.g., dextrose, fructose dc, lactose (monohydrate, optionally in combination with aspartame or cellulose), etc.; suspending/gelling agents include, e.g., carrageenan, sodium starch glycolate, xanthan gum, etc.; sweeteners include, e.g., aspartame, dextrose, fructose dc, sorbitol, sucrose dc, etc.; and wet granulation agents include, e.g., calcium carbonate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0086">An inverse agonist is a compound that binds to a receptor and inhibits the activity of the receptor in the absence of an agonist. An inverse agonist requires that the receptor have some constitutive basal activity in the absence of an agonist. While an agonist increases activity of the receptor over basal level an inverse agonist reduces receptor activity below basal level.</p>

      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0193">Risk factors may include gender, race, ethnicity, age, family history, weight and/or lifestyle. For example, certain races and ethnicities (e.g., Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asians (which as used herein includes individuals of the continent of Asia, such as Indians and Chinese) and individuals of such descent) are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Being overweight (e.g., having a body mass index&gt;25) is also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, with higher amount of fatty tissue also correlating with higher resistance of cells to insulin. Inactivity, which can lead to weight gain, is also a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (physical activity helps not only to control an individual's weight, but also utilizes glucose as energy and makes cells more sensitive to insulin). Family history is often a risk factor for many diseases, including type 2 diabetes, where the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes also increases with age, especially after age 45, which may also correlate with a tendency to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight with age. However, as obesity rates rise in children and young adults, type 2 diabetes is increasing common in these individuals and children and young adults who are overweight and/or sedentary are also at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Being pre-diabetic, in which an individual's blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes, if left untreated, often progresses to type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes include: a woman who has had gestational diabetes, gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds or has a history of polycystic ovary disease (PCOS); an individual who has metabolic syndrome; an individual who has hypertension; an individual who has a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) value under 35 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) and/or a triglyceride level over 250 mg/dL; and an individual with a history of vascular disease, such as stroke. Individuals who have more than one risk factor are particularly susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0197">In some embodiments, provided is a method of reducing blood glucose level in an individual in need thereof, comprises administering to an individual in need thereof an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, wherein the blood glucose level is reduced to a desirable level. The adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist may be administered alone or in combination with other agents such as an agent that reduces blood pressure in the individual. In some embodiments, the blood glucose level is reduced by about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, or about 70%, provided that the reduction in glucose level does not result in hypoglycemia. In some embodiments, the blood glucose level is reduced by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, or at least about 60%, provided that the reduction in glucose level does not result in hypoglycemia. In some embodiments, the blood glucose level is reduced by less than about 10%, between about 10% and about 30%, between about 30% and about 50%, between about 10% and about 50%, between about 50% and about 70%, between about 30% and about 70%, between about 20% and about 40%, between about 40% and about 60%, or between about 20% and about 60%, provided that the reduction in glucose level does not result in hypoglycemia.

      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0198">The blood glucose levels in an individual can be measured by methods known in the art, such as by a calorimetric method or by using a device (e.g., a glucose meter). A blood glucose level in the range of about 80 to 120 mg/dL pre-meal and about 100 to 140 mg/dL post-meal is considered desirable in healthy human beings. A blood glucose level at above the desirable level is considered hyperglycemic, such as that in diabetic patients. The blood glucose level in a mildly diabetic human is about 100 to 200 mg/dL. The blood glucose level in a moderately diabetic human is about 200 to 350 mg/dL. The blood glucose level in a severely diabetic human is above 400 mg/dL. A blood glucose level at below the desirable level is considered hypoglycemic, e.g., at below 60 to 80 mg/dL. The blood glucose levels may be measured at a single time point. However, a more accurate measurement requires an average over multiple time points or an area under the curve (AUC) over a period of time (e.g., 2 to 3 hours). The blood glucose level over a past period of about 2-3 months may be established by measuring the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level in the blood. HbA1c is a useful way to monitor a patient's overall response to diabetes treatment over time. The HbA1c in a healthy human being is about 5%. It is desirable for a diabetic patient to keep the HbA1c level below about 7%. Provided is a method of reducing blood glucose level in an individual having an HbA1c level of above about 7%, comprises administering to the individual an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, wherein the HbA1c level is reduced to below about 7% following administration of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0200">As is understood by those of skill in the art, metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions, which may include increased blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, abnormal cholesterol levels and elevated insulin levels due to insulin resistance whereby cells have a diminished ability to respond to insulin and the pancreas compensates by secreting more insulin leading to high insulin levels in blood. According to the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, metabolic syndrome is present if an individual has three or more of the following signs: blood pressure equal to or higher than 130/85 mm Hg; fasting blood sugar (glucose) equal to or higher than 100 mg/dL; large waist circumference, which for men is 40 inches or more and for women is 35 inches or more; low HDL cholesterol, which for men is under 40 mg/dL and for women is under 50 mg/dL; and triglycerides equal to or higher than 150 mg/dL.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0201">Treatment of metabolic syndrome requires a careful and well-balanced approach to account for both treatment of elevated insulin levels and high blood pressure. Thus, it is desirable in the context of treating metabolic syndrome that a compound that is an antagonist of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>is also an antagonist of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2B </sub>and/or Î±<sub>1B </sub>and/or Î±<sub>1D </sub>to reduce blood pressure. Alternatively, an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist that does not also antagonize the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2B </sub>and/or Î±<sub>1B </sub>may be administered in conjunction with a second agent that reduces, or is expected to reduce blood pressure in an individual.

In some embodiments, the compound is an antagonist and an inverse agonist of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0202">Risk factors associated with developing metabolic syndrome include: more than one parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes, individuals with high blood pressure and/or cardiovascular disease; individuals who are obese or overweight (e.g., individual's having a body mass index above 25); individuals who have more fat around their waist than around their hips (an apple shape); age greater than 40 years (although it is understood that children and young adults, particularly those who are overweight and/or sedentary, may also be at risk for developing metabolic syndrome); a woman who had gestational diabetes when pregnant or who has a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); individuals who are pre-diabetic and individuals of Latino, Black, Asian or Native American ethnicity.</p>

In one aspect of such a method, an individual who has failed a glucose tolerance test (e.g., an individual whose glucose levels do not return to normal levels following glucose challenge and/or whose insulin levels are not sufficiently elevated in response to administration of glucose, as measured by methods and as assessed by standards known in the art), is administered glucose following administration of an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and their insulin levels are then assessed. In one embodiment of such methods, the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist is administered to the individual about any one of 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes or more or between about 5 and about 15 or between about 5 and about 30 or between about 5 and about 60 or between about 15 and about 30 or between about 30 and about 60 minutes prior to administration of glucose. If such an individual, after administration of glucose and an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, exhibits an increase in insulin levels, the individual may be an individual who is responsive to a compound that promotes an increase in insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof). If such an individual exhibits an increase in insulin levels, but the individual's glucose levels do not decrease, then the individual may be an individual who is responsive to a compound that can increase insulin secretion and/or release (including but not limited to an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), used in conjunction with an insulin sensitizer. Sufficient levels of insulin increase and/or glucose decrease are known by those of skill in the art. Thus, a method of assessing whether an individual suffering from glucose intolerance (e.g., an individual who has failed (e.g., within the last 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, 2 weeks or 1 week) a glucose tolerance test administered in the absence of an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist) is more likely to be responsive or less likely to be responsive to a therapy that can increase insulin secretion and/or release (including but not limited to an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), is provided, the method comprising administering an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to the individual and testing the individual in a glucose tolerance test, wherein an increase in insulin levels after glucose challenge (the glucose tolerance test) indicates that the individual is more likely to be responsive to said therapy, and wherein a reduced or insignificant or no increase in insulin levels indicates that the individual is less likely to be responsive to said therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0205">Also provided herein are methods of selecting an individual suffering from glucose intolerance (e.g., an individual who has failed a glucose tolerance test) for a therapy comprising a compound which increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g. an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist) based on the levels of insulin and/or glucose of the individual following a glucose tolerance test in which the individual is administered an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist prior to glucose challenge, wherein an increase in insulin levels after glucose challenge and/or failure of the individual's glucose levels to return to normal selects the individual for said therapy. Thus, a method of selecting an individual for therapy comprising a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release is provided (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist), the method comprising the steps of (i) administering an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist to an individual who has failed (e.g., within the last 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, 2 weeks or 1 week) a glucose tolerance test administered in the absence of an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist; (2) administering a glucose tolerance test in which glucose is administered after the administration of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist; and (3) correlating the results of the glucose tolerance test administered in conjunction with the administration of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist to the individual (e.g., where glucose is administered about any one of 5, 15, 30, 60 or more minutes following administration of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist) with whether the individual is more or less likely to be responsive to an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, either alone, or in conjunction with an insulin sensitizer; and (4) selecting an individual who is more likely to be responsive to a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist for adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist therapy). An individual so selected may then be administered a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist for adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist therapy). In one aspect, the individual is selected for therapy if their insulin levels increase in response to the glucose tolerance test administered in conjunction with the administration of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist. If such an individual also exhibits a normal reduction in glucose levels, the individual may be selected for monotherapy with a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist). However, if such an individual does not exhibit a normal reduction in glucose levels, the individual may be selected for therapy with a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist) in conjunction with an insulin sensitizer. Individuals so selected may then be administered a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist), either alone or in conjunction with an insulin sensitizer. Methods of monitoring the treatment of an individual for glucose intolerance are also provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0206">Also provided herein are methods of treating an individual suffering from a disease or condition which is, or is expected to be, responsive to an increase in insulin secretion and/or release, the method comprising (i) determining insulin levels of an individual in a glucose tolerance test after administration of an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist and (ii) administering a compound that increases insulin secretion and/or release (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist) to an individual having an increase in insulin levels after the glucose tolerance test. In one aspect of such a method, the individual has failed (e.g., recently failed) a glucose tolerance test administered in the absence of an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist and the individual's insulin levels increase in response to a glucose tolerance test which employed administration of glucose and an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0207">In any of the methods employing a glucose tolerance test in conjunction with an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, in one variation, if the individual's insulin does not increase in response to a glucose challenge in conjunction with an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, the individual may have type 2 diabetes with a defect in insulin secretion. Therefore, also provided are methods of identifying individuals who may have type 2 diabetes with a defect in insulin secretion.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0208">Some genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associate with high blood glucose and can be used to screen for patients who respond to an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist with an increase in insulin secretion and a decrease in blood glucose. For example the DNA polymorphism Rs553668 located in the 3â² UTR region of adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>associates with overexpression of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A</sub>, reduced insulin secretion, and increased type 2 diabetes risk (Rosengren et al., <i>Science </i>327:217 (2010) and Talmud et al., <i>Diabetologia </i>54:1710 (2011)). Human pancreatic islets from Rs553668 allele carriers exhibited reduced granule docking and secreted less insulin in response to glucose. Individuals with elevated blood glucose would be screened for the polymorphism. Individuals heterozygous or homozygous for this polymorphism would be anticipated to respond to treatment with an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist. Other DNA polymorphisms may also be used to identify individuals with elevated blood sugar that would respond to an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist; for example Rs7911129, Rs1971596, Rs602618, and Rs2203616. Thus provided herein is a method of selecting an individual for therapy comprising a compound that (i) increases insulin secretion and/or release, and/or (ii) regulates blood glucose (e.g., an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist), the method comprising screening the individual for polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associate with high blood glucose, such as one or more of the DNA polymorphisms Rs553668, Rs7911129, Rs1971596, Rs602618 and Rs2203616.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0209">Also provided is a method of regulating (e.g., reducing and/or stabilizing) blood glucose levels in an individual, the method comprises the steps of (i) screening the individual for genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associate with high blood glucose; and (ii) administering to the individual carrying one or more genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associated with high blood glucose an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist. In one variation, provided is a method of increasing insulin seretion and/or release into the blood stream in an individual, the method comprises the steps of (i) screening the individual for genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associate with high blood glucose; and (ii) administering to the individual carrying one or more genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associated with high blood glucose an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist. Further provided are methods of treating type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance and/or metabolic syndrome, where the method comprises administering to an individual in need thereof an adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist, wherein the individual carries one or more genetic polymorphisms of the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene associated with high blood glucose, such as one or more of the DNA polymorphisms Rs553668, Rs7911129, Rs1971596, Rs602618 and Rs2203616. In some embodiments, the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist also binds to and is an antagonist of one or more of the adrenergic receptors Î±<sub>2B</sub>, Î±<sub>1B </sub>and Î±<sub>1D</sub>. In some embodiments, the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>antagonist also binds to and is an antagonist of the adrenergic receptors Î±<sub>2B</sub>. In some embodiments, the method of regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin seretion and/or release into the blood stream, or treating type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance and/or metabolic syndrome, further comprises administering to the individual a second agent that reduces, or is expected to reduce, blood pressure in an individual.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0210">Compounds described herein showing adrenergic receptors Î±<sub>2A </sub>and adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2B </sub>antagonist activity may find particular use in patients with fatty liver or/and obesity or/and hypertension with type-2 diabetes associated with glucose intolerance; and super-added with polymorphisms in the adrenergic receptor Î±<sub>2A </sub>gene.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">General Description of Biological Assays</heading>
      <p id="p-00459-en" num="0377">The binding properties of compounds disclosed herein to a panel of aminergic G protein-coupled receptors including adrenergic receptors, dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, histamine receptors and an imidazoline receptor may be determined. Binding properties may be assessed by methods known in the art, such as competitive binding assays. In one variation, compounds are assessed by the binding assays detailed herein. Compounds disclosed herein may also be tested in cell-based assays or in in vivo models for further characterization. In one aspect, compounds disclosed herein are of any formula detailed herein and further display one or more of the following characteristics: inhibition of binding of a ligand to an adrenergic receptor (e.g., Î±<sub>1D</sub>, Î±<sub>2A </sub>and Î±<sub>2B</sub>), inhibition of binding of a ligand to a serotonin receptor (e.g., 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>), inhibition of binding of a ligand to a dopamine receptor (e.g., D<sub>2L</sub>), and inhibition of binding of a ligand to a histamine receptor (e.g., H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>3</sub>); agonist/antagonist activity to a serotonin receptor (e.g., 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>); agonist/antagonist activity to a dopamine receptor (e.g., D<sub>2L</sub>, D<sub>2S</sub>); agonist/antagonist activity to a histamine receptor (e.g., H<sub>1</sub>); activity in a neurite outgrowth assay; efficacy in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction associated with cholinergic dysfunction/hypofunction; efficacy in a preclinical model of attention impulsivity and executive function, and efficacy in a preclinical model of schizophrenia.</p>
      <p id="p-00460-en" num="0378">In one variation, inhibition of binding of a ligand to a receptor is measured in the assays described herein. In another variation, inhibition of binding of a ligand is measured in an assay known in the art. In one variation, binding of a ligand to a receptor is inhibited by at least about 80% as determined in a suitable assay known in the art such as the assays described herein. In one variation, binding of a ligand to a receptor is inhibited by greater than about any one of 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, or between about 85% and about 95% or between about 90% and about 100% as determined in a suitable assay known in the art such as the assays described herein. In one variation, binding of a ligand to a receptor is inhibited by at least about 80%Â±20% as determined in an assay known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00461-en" num="0379">In one variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one receptor and as many as eleven as detailed herein (e.g., Î±<sub>1D</sub>, Î±<sub>2A</sub>, Î±<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, D<sub>2L</sub>, H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>). In one variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one receptor and as many as eleven as detailed herein (e.g., Î±<sub>1D</sub>, Î±<sub>2A</sub>, Î±<sub>2B</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>). In one variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one and as many as eleven receptors detailed herein and further displays agonist or antagonist activity to one or more receptors detailed herein (e.g., serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>6</sub>, dopamine receptor D<sub>2L</sub>, dopamine receptor D<sub>2S </sub>and histamine receptor H<sub>1</sub>) as measured in the assays described herein. In one variation, agonist response of serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>2A </sub>is inhibited by compounds of the invention by at least about any one of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 130%, 140%, 150% as determined in a suitable assay such as the assay described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00462-en" num="0380">In one variation, a compound of the invention displays the above described neurotransmitter receptor binding profile, e.g. inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one receptor and as many as eleven as detailed herein and further stimulates neurite outgrowth, e.g., as measured by the assays described herein. Certain compounds of the invention showed activity in neurite outgrowth assays using primary neurons in culture. Data is presented indicating that a compound of the invention has activity comparable in magnitude to that of naturally occurring prototypical neurotrophic proteins such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Notably, neurite outgrowth plays a critical part of new synaptogenesis, which is beneficial for the treatment of neuronal disorders. In one variation, neuronal disorders include ADHD. In one variation, neurite outgrowth is observed with a potency of about 1 Î¼M as measured in a suitable assay known in the art such as the assays described herein. In another variation, neurite outgrowth is observed with a potency of about 500 nM. In a further variation, neurite outgrowth is observed with a potency of about 50 nM. In another variation, neurite outgrowth is observed with a potency of about 5 nM.</p>
      <p id="p-00463-en" num="0381">In another variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one receptor and as many as eleven as detailed herein, further displays agonist or antagonist activity to one or more receptors detailed herein and further stimulates neurite outgrowth.</p>
      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0382">In a further variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one and as many as eleven receptors as detailed herein and/or display the above described neurotransmitter receptor binding profile and further shows efficacy in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction associated with cholinergic dysfunction/hypofunction, and in preclinical models of attention/impulsivity and executive function, e.g. shows pro-cognitive effects in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction. Compounds of the invention have been shown to be effective in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction associated with cholinergic hypofunction (see relevant Examples). As H<sub>1 </sub>antagonism may contribute to sedation, weight gain and reduced cognition, low affinity (less than about 80% inhibition of binding of Pyrilamine at 1 Î¼M in the assay described herein) for this receptor may be associated with pro-cognitive effects and a more desirable side effect profile. Furthermore, compounds of the invention with increased potency as a 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antagonist may have cognition-enhancing effects as serotonin acting through this receptor may impair memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0383">In another variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one and as many as eleven receptors as detailed herein, further shows efficacy in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction associated with cholinergic dysfunction/hypofunction, e.g. shows pro-cognitive effects in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction, in preclinical models of attention/impulsivity and executive function, and further displays agonist or antagonist activity to one or more receptors detailed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0384">In a further variation, a compound of the invention inhibits binding of a ligand to at least one and as many as eleven receptors as detailed herein, further shows efficacy in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction associated with cholinergic dysfunction/hypofunction, e.g. shows pro-cognitive effects in a preclinical model of memory dysfunction, and in preclinical models of attention/impulsivity and executive function, and further stimulates neurite outgrowth.</p>

      <p id="p-00496-en" num="0412">Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound, this may be accomplished from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for separating or resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers, e.g., a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallization and the desired enantiomer recovered. In another resolution process, a racemate may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described.</p>

The arena is placed in a dark room illuminated only by halogen lamps directed towards the ceiling in order to produce a uniformly dim light in the box of approximately 60 lux. The day before testing, animals are allowed to freely explore the experimental arena for 3 min in the presence of two objects (habituation). Animals to be tested are placed in the experimental room at least 30 min before testing.</p>
      <p id="p-00608-en" num="0506">Novel object recognition test is comprised of two trials separated by an interval of 120 min or 24h. When agents that disrupt memory such as the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine are used an inter-trial interval of 120 min is preferred. Alternatively a 24h inter-trial interval is used when studying effect of natural forgetting on novel object recognition task. During the first, or acquisition, trial (T<sub>1</sub>), rats are placed in the arena, where two identical objects have been previously placed. The time required for each animal to complete 15 sec of object exploration is determined, with a cut-off time of 4 min. Exploration is considered to be directing the nose at a distance less than 2 centimeters (âcmâ) from the object and/or touching the object. During the second, or testing, trial (T<sub>2</sub>), one of the objects presented in the first trial is replaced with an unknown or novel object, while the second, familiar object is left in place. Rats are placed back in the arena for 3 min., and exploration of both objects is determined. Locomotor activity of rats (number of times rats cross grid lines visible under the clear plexiglass floor) is scored for during T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. At the conclusion of the experiments, the rats are sacrificed by an overdose of pentobarbital given intraperitoneally.</p>
      <p id="p-00609-en" num="0507">The following parameters are measured as part of the novel object recognition task: (1) time required to achieve 15 sec of object exploration during T<sub>1</sub>; (2) locomotor activity during T<sub>1 </sub>(number of crossed lines); (3) time spent in active exploration of the familiar object during T<sub>2 </sub>(T<sub>Familiar</sub>); (4) time spent in active exploration of the novel object during T<sub>2 </sub>(T<sub>Novel</sub>); and (5) locomotor activity during T<sub>2 </sub>(number of crossed lines). The difference between time spent in active exploration of the novel object during T<sub>2 </sub>and time spent in active exploration of the familiar object during T<sub>2 </sub>(Î T<sub>Novel</sub>âT<sub>Familiar</sub>) is evaluated. The % of animals in each group with T<sub>Novel</sub>âT<sub>Familiar </sub>greater than or equal to 5 sec is also derived; described as % of good learners.</p>
      <p id="p-00610-en" num="0508">Animals not meeting a minimal level of object exploration are excluded from the study as having naturally low levels of spontaneous exploration. Thus, only rats exploring the objects for at least five sec (T<sub>Novel</sub>+T<sub>Familiar</sub>&gt;5 sec) are included in the study.</p>

      <p id="p-00639-en" num="0537">Attention and impulsivity are characteristic of several disease states. The continuous performance test (CPT), used in humans, is capable of detecting attention deficits in a number of disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia and mild cognitive impairment. The pre-clinical analogue of the CPT is the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT). In this operant-based test, rats are required to be attentive and withhold responding while they monitor 5 apertures for the appearance of a brief stimulus light in one of the apertures. The brief illumination of the stimulus light in the 5CSRTT is analogous to the appearance of the âcorrectâ letters in the CPT in humans. Upon observing the stimulus light, the rat must nose-poke in the corresponding aperture to receive a food reward. The 5CSRTT allows the measurement of similar behavioral responses as the CPT, including accuracy, speed of responding, impulsive and compulsive responding. In this study, drug tests are performed under altered test parameters which result in increased premature responding. This premature responding is hypothesized to indicate impulsivity, e.g., a failure to withhold an inappropriate response, and has been shown to be sensitive to atomoxetine.</p>

The experiments are conducted in accordance with the Australian code of Practice for the Care and use of Animals for Scientific Purposes and approval is sought from the Animal Experimental Committee of Alfred Hospital, Baker IDI, Melbourne, Australia. The conscious rabbits are implanted with an intravenous catheter in marginal ear vein or by centrally by intracisternal catheter interfaced to a pressure transducer connected to a suitable recorder. To unveil peripheral effects of test compound, two sets of acute studies are conducted in rabbits. In the first set of studies, test compound is dosed to rabbit intravenously for a dose-response study with cumulative doses starting 0 (Ringer's Lock solution as a vehicle), 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3.2 and 10 mg/kg where each dose is tested on a separate day. A single intravenous bolus dose at 3 mg/kg is given and a time-course study is conducted in the second set of studies. Systolic, diastolic, mean and diastolic blood pressures are recorded in both the studies. Data collections are made for 3 hours in the second set of studies. Heart rate (HR) is derived electronically using an algorithm to determine HR from pulse interval. In a separate set of studies, Clonidine (positive control) is tested where all experimental procedures including dose-regimen are identical to that of the studies with test compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00685-en" num="0581">The mean arterial pressure responses to test compound are dose-dependent in the dose-response study with cumulative doses Under similar conditions, Clonidine produces a maximum drop of arterial blood pressure of â6 mmHg before the blood pressure reversed back.</p>

(2009) âA practical guide to rodent islet isolation and assessment.â Biol. Proced. Online 11(1): 3-31]. In-vitro insulin secretion is measured in static incubations. Prior to experiments, islets are preincubated for 1 hour at 37Â° C. in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer composed of 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.8 mM glucose and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The medium is gassed with 100% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 15 minutes to obtain constant pH. Next, groups of 15 islets are incubated in 1 mL for 60 minutes at 37Â° C. in Krebs-Ringer buffered solution supplemented with glucose (2.8 mM as low glucose or 20 mM as high glucose), test compound, clonidine, yohimbine or norepinephrine as indicated. Immediately after incubation, an aliquot of the medium is removed for analysis of insulin content by ELISA (Mercodia).

All the experimental agents are dissolved in sterile saline or appropriate solvents and administered sub-cutaneously (SC), oral (PO) or intra-peritoneal (IP) as indicated. The vehicle group received saline alone via SC route. Test compound at doses of 0 (vehicle), 6 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg in SHR.OB rats; and 0 (vehicle), 5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg to Wistar rats are administered via SC route at â30 minutes. Hyperglycemia is induced in both SHR.OB and Wistar rats with clonidine at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg via PO route at 0 min. At all the study points, blood glucose levels are measured by one touch glucose meter (Lifescan, Milpitas, Calif.). The tip of the tail is snipped by sharp scissors and gently squeezed for a drop of blood. The glucose strip is inserted in the slot of the hand-held glucose meter and a drop of blood is added to the strip. Within 20 seconds, the device determined the blood glucose levels.

      <p id="p-00698-en" num="0593">When administered via SC route to SHR.OB or Wistar rats, test compound markedly reduced blood glucose levels by 30 minutes after the clonidine or norepinephrine challenge and the effect is evident throughout the entire study period. Identical effects on blood glucose levels are found in norepinephrine induced hyperglycemic ob/ob mice. These effects are dose-dependent and obvious. The glucose lowering effect of test compound is robust in Î±<sub>2A </sub>agonized SHR.OB rats, which is an animal model of metabolic syndrome, when compared to Wistar rats. In agreement with the reduction in blood glucose levels, the test compound proportionally increased insulin secretion in all these models. It also found that test compound lowers blood glucose levels even in the absence of norepinephrine where ob/ob mice are spontaneously (moderately) hyperglycemic; and it proportionally enhanced insulin secretions. Intriguingly, test compound promoted insulin secretions but not reduced blood glucose levels at higher dose in a OGTT test conducted in SHR.OB rats, suggesting that its role is obvious in insulin secretion but may not improve insulin sensitivity in this particular model.</p>

SHR rats are anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg IP). The left carotid artery cannulated with a polyethylene catheter (38 cm in length; PE60, Portex, Ltd.) connected with a polyurethane tubing (12 cm in length; PU-40, Cat. #BB520-40, Scientific Commodities, Inc.), which is tunneled under the skin and exited through the nape of the neck. The arterial cannula is connected to a pressure transducer through a swivel system, allowing free roaming during continuous recording of mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The animals are housed individually with food and water freely available during recovery. On the following day, the arterial cannula is connected via a Statham (P 23 x L) pressure transducer to a NEC/San-Ei amplifier and data acquisition and analysis system (Power Lab 8/SP) for direct mean arterial pressure and heart rate measurements. To determine the effect of test compound on systolic blood pressure, oral or i.v. bolus or i.v. escalating doses of compound administration in every 30 minutes is performed and systolic blood pressure is monitored at various time points, baseline data is collected during 0 to 120 minutes time points; test compound is dosed at 120 minutes; and compound effect is monitored from 120 minutes to 255 minutes.</p>

      <p id="p-00706-en" num="0601">For Western blotting, whole-cell extracts, cells are washed with ice-cold PBS and lysate with lysis buffer and collected by scraping. The protein concentration is determined using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit. Cell lysates containing 30 Î¼g proteins are electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes are rinsed with TBST, followed by incubation with Î±-ERK (mouse, 1/1000, SCBT) or ERK (rabbit, 1/1000, SCBT) for 2 or 1 hour, respectively, at room temperature. After being washed with TBST, the membranes are incubated with the anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, respectively, HRP antibody (1:5000; Rockland) for 1 hour. Immunoreactive bands are visualized by ECL Western blotting detection (PIERCE). As shown in the FIG. 25 (Westernblot), Test compound blocked pERK1/2 norepinephrine mediated effects in rat pancreatic islets.</p>
