      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hynes et al., <i>inorganic Chemistry, </i>5 (3) 488-489 (March 1966), disclose compositions of the formula R<sub>f</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>wherein R<sub>f </sub>is CF<sub>3 </sub>or C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>. They also disclose CClF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>, and NCl<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>. Further disclosed is a process for synthesizing those species by reacting at â78Â° C. the condensed vapors of, respectively, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>5</sub>CN, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>7</sub>CN, CClâF<sub>2</sub>CN, and CF<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub>, with ClâF, followed by warming to 0Â° C.

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0021">When a range of values is provided herein, it is intended to encompass the end-points of the range unless specifically stated otherwise. Numerical values used herein have the precision of the number of significant figures provided, following the standard protocol in chemistry for significant figures as outlined in ASTM E29-08 Section 6. For example, the number 40 encompasses a range from 35.0 to 44.9, whereas the number 40.0 encompasses a range from 39.50 to 40.49.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0022">The term âroom temperatureâ shall be understood to mean that no external heating or cooling has been applied to the specimen in question. In general, room temperature for the purposes of this invention lies in the range of 20-35Â° C., most typically 23-30Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0023">The terms âmelting point,â âmelting endotherm,â and âlatent heat of meltingâ are employed herein in a manner consistent with common usage in the art of polymer science. Terminology is referenced to the results obtained by employing the thermal analytical technique of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Unlike crystalline small molecules, crystalline organic polymers exhibit melting over a range of temperatures, and the melting transition is characterized in a number of ways. The output of DSC analysis of an organic polymer describes a continuous curve that rises continuously from the base line, reaches a peak, and then falls gradually and continuously back to the baseline. That curve is referred to as a melting endotherm. For the purposes of the present invention, the temperature at which the melting endotherm reaches its peak is referred to herein as the âmelting pointâ of the polymer. The integral of the melting endotherm corresponds to the latent heat of melting of the crystalline polymer. Thus each melting point is associated with a melting endotherm, and a latent heat of melting is associated with each melting point.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0024">The polymers suitable for the processes disclosed herein are amorphous polymers, exhibiting no substantial amount of crystallinity. More particularly, a suitable polymer is one which exhibits no melting point at a temperature of &gt;180Â° C. with an associated latent heat of melting greater than 1 J/g. Preferably, a suitable polymer is one which exhibits no melting point at a temperature of &gt;150Â° C. with an associated latent heat of melting greater than 1 J/g.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0025">The term âsolvent solubleâ is employed herein to describe some embodiments of the polymers described herein. By âsolvent solubleâ is meant that the indicated polymer is soluble in an organic solvent that is a liquid at room temperature. Particularly well-suited solvents are perfluorinated solvents. Suitable perfluorinated solvents include but are not limited to perfluoro-N-methylmorpholine, available commercially from the 3M Company as PF-5052, and FluorinertÂ® FC-40, also available from the 3M Company.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0026">Disclosed herein is a novel, non-crosslinked fluoropolymer, comprising a perfluoroether pendant group comprising a âCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>functional group, and the preparation thereof from a known polycyanofluorovinyl ether by treatment with ClâF; the crosslinking thereof by exposure to ultra-violet (UV) to form a novel azo crosslinked polymer; and, a novel, highly thermally stable, crosslinked polymer comprising perfluoroalkylene crosslinks, and a plurality of methods for the preparation thereof. Further disclosed is the use of these polymers for preparing highly stable molded articles. Also disclosed is the imagewise exposure of these polymers to UV, and the preparation thereby of imaged articles.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0027">Terms such as uncrosslinked and crosslinked shall be understood to refer to a preponderance of functional groups in a given polymer, but not necessarily, and not usually, to all. Thus, it shall be understood that when a polymer is described as uncrosslinked or ânot substantially crosslinkedâ it means that a preponderance of the crosslinkable groups remain uncrosslinked, and that the properties of the polymer so characterized are characteristic of uncrosslinked polymers, such as by solubility, thermo-formability, dimensional stability (or, more precisely, instability), melt flowability, and such other properties such as are known in the art to pertain to uncrosslinked polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0028">It shall further be understood that when a polymer is described as crosslinked or âsubstantially crosslinkedâ it means that a preponderance of the crosslinkable groups originally available in the uncrosslinked polymer have undergone crosslinking and that the properties of the polymer so characterized are characteristic of crosslinked polymers, exhibiting differences vis a vis the corresponding uncrosslinked polymer, of reduced solubility, reduced thermo-formability, increased dimensional stability, and decreased melt flowability, as well as exhibiting such other properties as are known in the art to pertain to crosslinked polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0029">In several embodiments, chemical reaction is effected in situ in a polymeric shaped article. The total reaction time will depend directly upon the thickness of the shaped article, and inversely upon the surface to volume ratio thereof. Desirably, sufficient time is allowed for reactants to diffuse into the polymeric shaped article, and for by-products to diffuse out. The thicker the shaped article, the longer time for diffusion, other things being equal. Similar considerations hold for heating profiles. Excessively rapid heating can lead to foaming and blistering because reaction by-products cannot escape. The thicker the polymeric shaped article, the more gradual heating needs to be; so, heating time varies directly with thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0030">As a result, the heating time required in a given process step has been observed to vary very considerably. When the article being heated to effect crosslinking is a film that might be 25-100 micrometers thick, crosslinking may be effected to completion in the time range of 10 seconds to 10 minutes. On the other hand, if the article being crosslinked is on the order of 1000-5000 micrometers in thickness, as long as 30 hours might be required to achieve uniform and complete crosslinking.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0031">It is common practice in the polymer art to refer to repeat units in polymer backbones according to the monomeric species from which the repeat unit has been formed. That practice will be employed herein. Thus, for example, the repeat unit in poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) is referred to as a tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) repeat unit, even though, in fact it is the diradical âCF<sub>2</sub>âCF<sub>2</sub>â that is incorporated into the backbone upon polymerization of the TFE.</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0125">An imageable article suitable for the imagewise exposure method of the present invention can act as a negative photoresist when imagewise exposed using UV light in the wavelength region from 200 to 425 nm, preferably 250 to 370 nm. As has been discussed supra and demonstrated in the specific embodiments infra, exposure of the dichloroamino-functionalized polymer cause it to undergo crosslinking to form the azo-crosslinked polymer. When a suitable imageable article is imagewise exposed to UV, the area of the imageable surface of a suitable imageable article that is exposed to the UV light will undergo crosslinking, while that area of the imageable surface that is masked from the UV light will remain uncrosslinked. After imagewise exposure, the imageable article can be subject to development by exposing the imaged surface to a fluorinated solvent such as perfluoro-N-methylmorpholine, available as PF-5052 performance fluid from the 3M company. The unexposed portion of a suitable imageable film will dissolve in the solvent while the exposed portion will remain intact, thereby creating a negative image of the masking pattern employed in the imagewise exposure. If needed, all or a portion of the image in its azo form as represented by Structure III can be converted to the fluoroalkenyl-crosslinked represented by Structure IV by heating to 200 to 350Â° C.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Sample Preparation</heading>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0147">Film samples were prepared using a laboratory hydraulic press. A specified weight of polymer was placed into a layered structure consisting of steel sheet/KaptonÂ® polyimide film/polymer sample/KaptonÂ® polyimide film/steel sheet. The so-prepared layered structure was then placed between the platens of a Pasadena Hydraulics, Inc press. Unless stated otherwise, polymer was piled on the KaptonÂ® and then pressed down giving a roughly circular piece generally 1 to 5â³ in diameter and tens of mils thick. When it was desired to press a second film from the same polymer sample that had been pressed into a previously prepared pressed film, the previously pressed film was first cut up into pieces and the pieces then pressed again, as described.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0148">When molded specimens in the range of 0.060 to 0.160 inches thick were fabricated, the layered structure consisted of steel sheet/KaptonÂ® polyimide film/a pile of polymer centered in a rectangular mold/KaptonÂ® polyimide film/steel sheet, the mold consisting of a stainless steel sheet with a rectangular hole cut in the center. Extra polymer (flashing) was trimmed from the edges of the molded parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0149">The pressing conditions are expressed herein the following manner: time (min)/temperature(Â° C.)/ram force(lbs). The âtimeâ refers to the dwell time of the polymer sample at the âtemperatureâ indicated, and at the exerted ram force indicated. Thus the expression 3 min/95Â° C./0 lbs means that the sample was held for 3 min. with the platens set at 95Â° C. and with the platens closed but exerting 0 lbs of force.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Analysis</heading>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Spectroscopy</heading>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0150">The chemistry that takes place in the processes disclosed herein occurs at the terminal functional group of the 8-CNVE monomer unit, as described infra. The 8-CNVE can be tracked in the IR by an ether peak at 1036 cm<sup>â1</sup>. The monomer unit derived from PMVE is characterized by an IR absorption peak at 889 cm<sup>â1</sup>. There is no evidence that any of the chemistry described herein involved monomer units derived from PMVE. That is, the monomer groups are believed to be inert. The ratio of the peak intensities at 1036 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and 899 cm<sup>â1 </sup>was then taken as a means for measuring the extent of reaction of the CN functional group.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0151">The IR spectrum was determined using a Thermo Nicolet 6700 FT-IR equipped with a SensiR Durascopeâ¢. The Durasopeâ¢ was a single bounce Diamond Attenuated Total Reflectance (DATR) accessory. A background spectrum of the DATR was acquired before each sample. The DATR was wiped clean after each sample. The sample was placed in contact with the diamond. The sample was then pressed against the diamond using the sample press. The spectrum was collected and compared to the background. A baseline and ATR correction were applied to the spectrum using Nicolet OmnicÂ® software. The spectrum was imported to G/AI 8.0 Spectroscopy software. In G, a Fourier deconvolution algorithm was applied using a gamma of 6. The peaks of interest were integrated within G. The peak height and areas were determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0152">After treatment with ClâF, any given specimen was purged using N<sub>2 </sub>to remove any residual ClâF or Cl<sub>2</sub>. Purging was accomplished by transferring the ClâF-treated specimen from the autoclave to a ziplock plastic bag or a glass bottle, the bag or bottle was sealed, and placed in a fume hood. With the specimen in the fume hood, a small opening was made in the bag or bottle, and a tube carrying nitrogen was placed therein. The nitrogen purge was continued for at least several hours.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Polymer Compositional Designations</heading>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0153">Throughout the Examples, polymers are referred to variously as PâCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>, PâCF<sub>2</sub>NâNCF<sub>2</sub>âP, and PâCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP, as well as mixtures thereof. In every instance, the given designation is intended to indicate the species that predominantly affects the measured properties, mechanical, thermal, thermomechanical, and spectroscopic. That is, for example, as shown infra, PâCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>converts to PâCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP via mixtures of PâCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>, PâCF<sub>2</sub>NâNCF<sub>2</sub>âP and PâCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP and a process may stop at a mixture stage. Thus a designation such as PâCF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>is not intended to suggest that the indicated species is present in neat form. In many of the examples, it is strongly believed that some other species than that indicated is present at undetermined concentration.</p>

      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0154">Inherent Viscosity (IV) was determined using a solution of 0.1 g of polymer in 100 g of FLUTECâ¢ PP11 perfluorocarbon fluid (F2 Chemicals Ltd., Preston, UK) at 30Â° C., except where otherwise noted.</p>

      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0155">A perfluoroelastomer containing copolymerized monomers of TFE, PMVE, and 8CNVE was prepared as follows. Three aqueous streams were each fed continuously to a 2 liter, mechanically stirred, water jacketed, stainless steel autoclave at a rate of 162 cc/hr. The first stream consisted of a solution of 12.8 g ammonium persulfate in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. The second stream consisted of 249.5 g of F(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>âCH<sub>2</sub>OâPO<sub>2</sub>(OH)(NH<sub>4</sub>) surfactant and 41.6 g of KrytoxÂ® 157FSL surfactant in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. The third stream consisted of a solution of 77.0 g disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. Using a diaphragm compressor, a mixture of TFE (145.5 g per hour (g/hr)) and PMVE (83.6 g/hr) was fed at a constant rate. Using a syringe pump, 8-CNVE was fed to the reactor at a rate of 4.20 milliliters per hour. The temperature was maintained at 85Â° C., and a pressure at 4.1 MPa (600 psig) was maintained throughout the reaction. The polymer emulsion was removed continuously by means of a letdown valve and the unreacted monomers were vented. Eight liters of deionized water was added per liter of emulsion and then 1% NaOH solution added until its pH was 6.9. After pH adjustment, the emulsion was coagulated with magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and washed with deionized water. The polymer was dried at 70Â° C. for 48 hours. The polymer had an inherent viscosity of 0.48 measured in a solution of 0.1 g polymer in 100 g FLUTECâ¢ PP11 perfluorocarbon fluid (F2 Chemicals Ltd., Preston, UK) at 30Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0156">T<sub>g </sub>was determined to be 9.5Â° C. by DSC. No melting endotherm was observed.</p>

      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">B. Film</heading>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0158">5 g of the P1-CN polymer prepared in Example 1A were placed between the platens of a hydraulic press as described, supra, and processed as follows: 3 min/95Â° C./0 lbs followed by 3 min/95Â° C./5,000 lbs, followed by release of pressure and cooling. The resulting film was roughly circular with a ca. 6.4 cm diameter. Thickness ranged from 0.003 to 0.0046 inches.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0159">An ATR spectrum taken of the P1-CN film found the area of the 1036 cm<sup>â1 </sup>band corresponding to copolymerized 8-CNVE to be 1.11 times the area of the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>band corresponding to copolymerized PMVE. The intensity ratio of the 1036 cm<sup>â1 </sup>band relative to the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>band was observed to decrease as the reaction of ClâF with the âCN group in copolymerized 8-CNVE progressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0160">A thin strip weighing 0.0878 g was cut from the thus prepared film. This strip was placed into a vial with 2 g of PF-5052 liquid. The vial was sealed and subject to rolling on a roll mill at 120 rpm for about 41 hours until no further dissolution was apparent by visual inspection. After rolling, the contents of the vial were visually examined. The film appeared to have partially dissolved, leaving a residue of numerous gel particles suspended in the solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0161">Three small 1.5â³ long dog-bone-shaped strips of the film were pulled at 23Â° C. at 0.5 inch/minute with the sample gauge length of 0.86 inches using an InstronÂ® Universal Testing Machine. Tensile strength was an average 640 psi at 300% elongation to break.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0162">Additional samples of the P1-CN polymer prepared in Example 1A were prepared for use in Part C, below. Each 5 g sample was hot pressed for 3 min/95Â° C./0 lbs followed by 3 min/95Â° C./5,000 lbs, followed by release of pressure and cooling. The films so prepared were roughly circular, Ë2.5â³ in diameter and varied from about 0.0030 to 0.0046â³ inches in thickness.</p>

      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0163">A 400 ml HastelloyÂ® autoclave was loaded with 5.6 g Cl<sub>2 </sub>(0.08 mole) and 6.1 g of 25 mole % F<sub>2 </sub>(0.05 mole F<sub>2</sub>) in N<sub>2</sub>. This mixture was heated to 250Â° C. over a period of Ë1.5 hours and then held at 250Â° C. for 1 hour. No exotherm was observed. The product was believed to be an approximately 1:3 Cl<sub>2</sub>:ClâF mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0164">Gambaretto et al., J. Fluorine Chem. 7, 569 (1976) showed near quantitative yield of ClâF when F<sub>2 </sub>plus a slight excess of Cl<sub>2 </sub>were passed through a 250Â° C. tube furnace with a 100 second contact time.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0165">One of the approximately 2.5â³ diameter film specimens of the P1-CN film prepared in Example 1-B was hand-pressed down on a TeflonÂ® film so that the specimen exhibited enough adhesion to hold the film specimen in place as it was being lowered into a horizontal position into a 400 ml HastelloyÂ® autoclave. The autoclave was sealed, evacuated, and then pressured to 40 psig with the Cl<sub>2</sub>/ClâF mixture prepared supra.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0166">The autoclave was heated for 7 hours at 70Â° C. After cooling the autoclave, the polymer film was recovered, transferred to a tight container, the container moved to a fume hood, the container opened, tubing inserted in the open mouth of the container, and a slow flow of purging nitrogen run through the container for 21 hours to remove any residual Cl<sub>2 </sub>or ClâF. The thus treated film is herein designated P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1a.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0167">An ATR spectrum was taken of the side of the P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1a film away from the TeflonÂ® sheet. The 1036 cm<sup>â1 </sup>band had decreased to 0.20Ãthe area of the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>peak. A new absorption band at 960 cm<sup>â1 </sup>was also observed, with an area 0.23Ãthe area of the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>peak. Since Hynes et. al., op.cit., reported a strong band at 968 cm<sup>â1 </sup>in the gas phase IR of CF<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>, the new band observed herein at 960 cm<sup>â1 </sup>can be assigned to the P1-CN polymer wherein the CN groups have been converted to CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>groups by the ClâF.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0168">A 0.0737 g strip of the thus prepared film of P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1a was rolled, as in Example 1 B, with 2 g of PF-5052 solvent until there was no longer any visual change By visual examination, it was observed that the result was a hazy solution having fewer gel particles than observed for the solution of P1-CN, described supra, but still too many to count.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0169">Two small dog-bone-shaped strips of the P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1a film were pulled on an Instron Machine, as described supra, exhibiting an average tensile strength of 370 psi at 330% elongation to break.</p>

      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0171">An ATR spectrum was taken of the P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1 b film. The intensity ratio of the 1036 cm<sup>â1 </sup>absorption to the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>absorption was 0.2243. The intensity ratio of the 960 cm<sup>â1 </sup>absorption to that of the 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>absorption was 0.1265.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0172">A 0.1247 g strip of the P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1b film was rolled with PF-5052, as in Example 1a. The resultant mixture was observed to consist of a mass of soft gel. The thus treated strip of P1-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-1b film was observed to have swollen to many times its original size, but still had a faint resemblance to the starting piece of film.

      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0211">A perfluoroelastomer containing copolymerized monomers of TFE, PMVE, and 8CNVE was prepared as follows. Three aqueous streams were each fed continuously to a 2 liter, mechanically stirred, water jacketed, stainless steel autoclave at a rate of 162 cubic centimeters per hour (cc/hr). The first stream consisted of a solution of 12.8 g ammonium persulfate in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. The second stream consisted of 249.5 g of F(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>âCH<sub>2</sub>OâPO<sub>2</sub>(OH)(NH<sub>4</sub>) surfactant and 41.6 g of KrytoxÂ® 157FSL surfactant in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. The third stream consisted of a solution of 77.0 g disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate in 5 kg of deionized, deaerated water. Using a diaphragm compressor, a mixture of TFE (145.5 g per hour (g/hr)) and PMVE (82.8 g/hr) was fed at a constant rate. Using a syringe pump, 8-CNVE was fed to the reactor at a rate of 5.25 milliliters per hour. The temperature was maintained at 85Â° C., and the pressure at 4.1 MPa (600 psig) throughout the reaction. The polymer emulsion was removed continuously by means of a letdown valve and the unreacted monomers were vented. The emulsion was collected and then diluted by adding 8 liters of deionized water per liter of emulsion. The diluted emulsion was treated with 1% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>solution until its pH was 3.0. After pH adjustment, the emulsion was coagulated with magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and washed with deionized water. The polymer was then dried at 70Â° C. for 48 hours. Mooney viscosity, ML-175 (1+10), was 39.6, determined according to ASTM D1646 with an L (large) type rotor at 175Â° C., using a preheating time of 1 minute and a rotor operation time of 10 minutes. The polymer had an inherent viscosity of 0.57. Polymer composition by NMR: 62.5 wt TFE, 34.0 wt % PMVE, 3.48 wt % 8-CNVCNE [74.5 mole % TFE, 24.4 mole % PMVE, 1.1 mole % 8-CNVE].</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0212">The polymer so prepared is herein designated P3-CN.</p>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0213">Nitrogen concentration in the P3-CN was determined with an AntekÂ® NS</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0214">Analyser using combustion analysis, and by NMR. The polymer was found to have 1381 ppm N by the former method, and 1246 ppm N by fluorine NMR using the âCF<sub>2</sub>CN resonance to track 8-CNVE content.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0215">A 30 g sample of the P3-CN polymer in the form of fine crumb was added to a 400 ml HastelloyÂ® autoclave. The autoclave was evacuated and pressured with ClâF (99% pure, Advance Research Chemicals, Catoosa, Okla.) to 24 psig at â10Â° C. The contents of the autoclave were agitated as the autoclave was heated to 70Â° C. over about 45 minutes and then held at 70Â° C. for 16 hours at an internal pressure of 40 to 39 psig. The polymer thereby prepared, herein designated P3-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-6, was recovered and purged with N<sub>2 </sub>to get rid of residual Cl<sub>2 </sub>and ClâF. A 2 g sample of the thus prepared P3-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub>-6 polymer was hot pressed 3 min/90Â° C./0 lb, 3 min/90Â° C./3000 lb making a roughly 2 in. circular film. A strip cut from the thus prepared film was heated for 1 hour at 300Â° C. under a flow of nitrogen.</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0216">A HastelloyÂ® tube (26 in. long, â in. I.D., 1 in. O.D) was swept with a slow nitrogen flow as its center 14â³ was heated using a clamshell Lindberg tube furnace set to 300Â° C. The first polymer film strip was placed on the flat end of an 18â³ long stainless steel spatula, that was positioned at roughly the center of the heated area. After 1 hour, the spatula was withdrawn from the heated HastelloyÂ® tube and the polymer film recovered from the spatula tip. The thus prepared film is herein designated P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>-P3-6. The nitrogen concentration of the P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>-P3-6 was found, by the method described supra, to be 251 ppm, an 82% decrease.</p>

A 0.094 g strip cut from the thus prepared film was rolled with 2 g of PF-5052, as described supra, giving partial viscous solution with numerous gel particles over a wide range of sizes, and no retention of the original film shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0219">Two additional strips of film were cut from the pressed P3-CF<sub>2</sub>NCl<sub>2 </sub>film prepared above. The first strip (Example 7) weighed 0.0918 g. The first strip was heated at 300Â° C. for 1 hour using the method of Example 6, under a nitrogen purge. It was found that after treatment the first strip weighed 0.0904 g (a 2% weight loss). Rolling the thus heated first strip with 2 g of PF-5052, as described supra, resulted in a weight gain to 0.2330 g (a 158% weight increase). The strip of film retained its integrity and merely swelled.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0220">The second polymer film strip (Example 8) weighed 0.1238 g.

      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0266">A. Five 13 gram samples of P3-CN crumb were pressed in a mold for 10 min/120Â° C./0 lb, 10 min/120*C/5000 lbs to make five sheets, each 2.5 inches square by 0.060 in. thick. Disks 15 mm in diameter by 0.060 in. thick were cut out using a die. A pellet mold was made in the cavity of a press by stacking in succession a steel plate, a KaptonÂ® film, a 0.5â³ thick steel plate having a 0.75 in. diameter circular hole with adjoining overfill cavities, a second Kapton film, and a third steel plate. The mold was preheated to 180Â° C. in a heated hydraulic press. Seven to eight grams of the circular P3-CN disks were loaded into the preheated mold cavity. The upper KaptonÂ® film and steel plate were set in place and the platens of the press closed only to contact pressure. The thus filled mold equilibrated for 5 minutes under contact pressure, and then 30,000 lbs of ram force was applied for 2 minutes. The mold was removed from the press, and the pellet thus formed was removed once the mold had cooled back to ambient. Molded pellets typically measured about 0.75 inch high by 0.5 inch wide and weighed about 6.75 g.</p>
      <p id="p-00315-en" num="0267">Seven such pellets were prepared. The pellets so prepared were slightly yellow in color, had occasional black spots, and occasional bubbles. The pellets so prepared are herein designated P3-CN-20a</p>
      <p id="p-00316-en" num="0268">B. Two P3-CN-20 pellets were loaded into a 400 ml autoclave, the autoclave was evacuated, and then filled with 2 g of ClâF (Advance Research Chemicals). The autoclave was then heated in the following series of steps: 7 hours at 75Â° C., 2 hours at 100Â° C., 2 hours at 125Â° C., 2 hours at 150Â° C., 2 hours at 175Â° C., 2 hours at 200Â° C., 2 hours at 250Â° C., and 2 hours at 300Â° C. with pressure in the autoclave observed to increase from at 12 psig at 22.1Â° C. to 37 psig at 300.6Â° C. The autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the pellets recovered and purged with nitrogen for 70 hours. The pellets so treated, herein designated P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-20b, appeared to be unchanged in shape except for some internal bubble formation. One of the pellets, a pellet with a few bubbles between two of the layers that had been pressed together to make the pellet, was cut longitudinally through its center traversing the 0.5â³distance from top to bottom. ATR was then used to measure the intensities of the 970 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and 889 cm<sup>â1 </sup>absorption bands approximately every mm from the top to the bottom of the cut with the results shown in Table 3. Significant âCF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2 </sub>crosslink formation as measured by ATR absorption at 970 cm<sup>â1 </sup>was observed only to a depth of 2-3 mm along the cross sectional cut.</p>

      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0273">Three aqueous streams were each fed continuously to a 1 liter mechanically stirred, water jacketed, stainless steel autoclave at a rate of 81 cc/hr. The first stream consisted of 1.34 g ammonium persulfate, 26.2 g of disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate, and 30 g ammonium perfluorooctanoate per liter of de-ionized water. The second stream consisted of 30 g of ammonium perfluorooctanoate per liter of de-ionized water. The third stream consisted of 1.34 g of ammonium persulfate and 30 g ammonium perfluorooctanoate per liter of de-ionized water. Using a diaphragm compressor, a mixture of TFE (58.5 g/hr) and PMVE (68.8 g/hr) was fed at constant rate. The liquid i-8CNVE was fed as a separate stream at a rate of 3.5 g/hr. The reaction temperature was maintained at 85Â° C., the pressure at 4.1 MPa (600 psi), and the pH at 4.2 throughout the reaction. The polymer emulsion was removed continuously by means of a letdown valve and the unreacted monomers were vented. The polymer was isolated from the emulsion by first diluting it with deionized water at the rate of 8 liter deionized water per liter of emulsion, followed by addition of 320 cc of a magnesium sulfate solution (100 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate per liter of deionized water) per liter of emulsion at a temperature of 60Â° C. The resulting slurry was filtered, and the polymer solids obtained from a liter of emulsion were re-dispersed in 8 liters of deionized water at 60Â° C. After filtering, the wet crumb was dried in a forced air oven for 48 hr at 70Â° C. Polymer yield was about 124 g per hour of reactor operation. The polymer composition, analyzed using FTIR, was 56.8 wt % (45.1 mole %) PMVE, 2.09 wt % (0.71 mole %) i-8CNVE, the remainder being tetrafluoroethylene. A parallel analysis by NMR found 51.4 wt % PMVE, 46.7 wt % TFE, and 1.938 wt % i-8CNVE [39.6 mole % PMVE, 59.7 mole % TFE, and 0.637 mole % i-8CNVE)].

The autoclave was held for 2 hrs at room temperature, then heated as follows: 2 hrs at 75Â° C., 2 hrs at 125Â° C., 2 hrs at 150Â° C., 2 hrs at 175Â° C., and 16 hrs at 200Â° C., followed by cooling to room temperature. The o-ring was recovered and then heated for 1 hour at 300Â° C. in an air oven to complete conversion to P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-25a, which was largely clear and colorless.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0280">The P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-25a o-ring was placed into a 400 ml HastelloyÂ® autoclave with 180 ml of water, and the autoclave was evacuated. The autoclave was then heated to 325Â° C. and held for 1 week at 325Â° C. followed by cooling to room temperature. The recovered o-ring was about 1.7 in. O.D., and was flattened like a ribbon. In appearance, it was noticeably brown and foamed. The o-ring weighed 2.1162 g (a 15% weight gain).</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0281">A second o-ring of P3-CN, herein designated P3-CN-25b, was prepared in an identical manner to that of P3-CN-25a, and exhibited identical initial dimensions. The P3-CN-25b o-ring weighed 1.8656 g. The P3-CN-25b o-ring was added to a 400 ml HastelloyÂ® autoclave, and the autoclave was evacuated. The pressure in the autoclave was increased from â11 to 1 psi by the addition of ClâF (Advance Research Chemicals). The autoclave was held for 2 hrs at r.t., then heated as follows: 2 hrs at 75Â° C., 2 hrs at 125Â° C., 2 hrs at 150Â° C., 2 hrs at 175Â° C., 4 hrs at 200Â° C., and 4 hours at 250Â° C. The recovered o-ring, herein designated P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-25b, was clear and colorless.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0282">P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-25b was treated in water in a manner identical to that of P3-CF<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>âP3-25a. The recovered o-ring came back unchanged in dimensions, black, and with its surface noticeably roughened. It weighed 1.9277 g (3% weight gain). The o-ring was still flexible and elastic.</p>
