    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Heat packs are incorporated into various travel and comfort items, such as pillows, blankets, and the like, in a designated pocket and/or pouch within the items to provide a user with soothing, targeted, and controlled heat in a consistent, convenient, and comfortable application. A disposable heat pack may comprise a soft, lightweight, air-permeable pouch. One side of the heat pack is air-permeable to optimally direct the targeted heat to a user. The contents of the heat pack may include a mixture of iron powder, sawdust, activated carbon, salt, water, cellulose, and vermiculite. The pocket into which the heat pack is inserted is comprised of a spandex material or the like that is lightweight, permeable, breathable, flexible, and stretchable, providing superior contact while allowing for an optimal amount of heat to permeate from the pocket to the user.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the incorporation of heat packs into various travel and comfort items, such as pillows, blankets, and the like. By placing a heat pack into a designated pocket or pouch within the item, a user is provided with soothing, targeted, and controlled heat in a consistent, convenient, and comfortable application.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Heat packs, also known as body warmers, heat pads, warmers, heating pads, heating packs, hand warmers, foot warmers, toe warmers, pack heat, oxygen-activated heat packs, and/or air-activated chemical warming devices, are known to aid users in keeping parts of the body warm in cold weather environments as well as in heat therapy applications. Depending upon the chemical composition of the heat pack, a sustained, controlled heat can be generated for a period of up to 18 hours at a maximum temperature of 131-170 degrees Fahrenheit. In some embodiments, a heat pack may be disposable. In some embodiments, a heat pack may be safe for air travel. This feature allows embodiments of the present invention to meet recent increased security measures for air travel, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In one embodiment, the disposable heat pack may comprise a soft, lightweight, air-permeable pouch. In one embodiment, one side of the heat pack is air-permeable to more efficiently provide and optimally direct the targeted heat to a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The contents of the heat pack may include, but are not limited to, a mixture of iron powder, sawdust, activated carbon, salt, and water. Other ingredients may include cellulose and vermiculite. A summary of exemplary ingredients and their role in the chemical reaction is provided below:</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Iron PowderâIron is an active ingredient in the heat pack. When the iron combines with oxygen and the other ingredients in the pack, it starts to rust at an accelerated rate. The rusting process is what gives off the heat that warms the heat pack.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">SawdustâSawdust is used to retain and release moisture in the heat pack, which in turns aids in the dispersion of the heat from the oxidation reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Activated CarbonâActivated carbon may be added to heat packs because it helps absorb the oxygen. It also prevents external odors because unpleasant smelling chemicals released during the oxidation process stick to it.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">WaterâWater adds to the reaction within the heat pack as it helps disperse the created heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">SaltâSalt may be used to accelerate the oxidation process, causing the iron to rust more quickly and generate more heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Optional IngredientsâVermiculite may be added and used as an insulator; it helps the heat pack retain its heat. Vermiculite also absorbs excess moisture. Cellulose may be added as a filler. It holds and releases moisture as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In one embodiment, a heat pack uses a specific formulation of iron powder, water, salt, activated carbon, and vermiculite filled to a predetermined maximum weight given their size to provide a quick ramp-up temperature in a comfort temperature zone (55-63 degrees Celsius), and to also provide maintenance of this temperature once reached through an elapsed time of eight hours after initial activation. This composition, based on proportion, size, weight, and heat pack materials, provides a steady heat once the temperature is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">When the heat pack is removed from airtight packaging and exposed to the air, an exothermic oxidation reaction activates, generating controlled and sustained heat from the pouch. Once the iron powder within the heat pack completely oxidizes and the heat pack cools, the pouch will no longer generate heat. For this reason, the heat pack is single use and disposable.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> illustrate incorporation of a heat zone in a U-shaped travel neck pillow <b>100</b>, according to embodiments provided herein.</p>

In one embodiment, the material of the heated travel memory foam pillow comprises the following composition: Outer Shell: 99% Polyester, 1% Spandex; and Filling: 100% Polyurethane Foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> illustrate incorporation of a heat zone in a travel pillow, according to embodiments provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In one embodiment, a heated travel pillow <b>200</b> is used to support a user's back, such as a lumbar region of the user's back. In another embodiment, the heated travel pillow <b>200</b> is used to support a user's neck.

Features of the pocket <b>220</b>, the opening or insert <b>225</b>, and the heat pack are described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In one embodiment, the material of the heated travel pillow comprises the following composition: Outer Shell: 94% Polyester, 6% Spandex; and Filling: 100% Polystyrene Foam Beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A-3D</figref> illustrate incorporation of heat zones in a travel-sized blanket, according to various embodiments provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In one embodiment, a heated travel-sized blanket <b>300</b> has one or more built-in heat zones to keep feet warm. In another embodiment, the heat zone portions may be used to warm a user's neck and/or chest. The heat zone may be comprised of one or more pockets <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b </i>at a bottom portion of a side <b>310</b> of the blanket <b>300</b> to correspond with a position of a user's feet, for example (see <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). This allows for the user to place the balls of their feet on each of the heat zones and then wrap blanket around them to stay warm.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In another embodiment, a large foot pouch <b>325</b> is provided with one or more heat zones within the pouch to keep feet warm (see <figref>FIGS. 3B</figref>, <b>3</b>C, and <b>3</b>D). In this embodiment, one side of the blanket may be folded over to create the pouch <b>325</b>, and separate inner pockets <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b </i>are configured to hold the heat packs. One or more fasteners <b>330</b>, <b>335</b> may be provided to secure the pouch <b>325</b>, allowing for the user to insert his or her feet into the pouch <b>325</b> near or on the pockets <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b</i>, and then close the pouch <b>325</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In one embodiment, the heated travel blanket is comprised of 98% Polyester, 2% Spandex.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">According to embodiments, the entire item (e.g., heated travel neck pillow <b>100</b>, heated travel pillow <b>200</b>, heated travel-sized blanket <b>300</b>) in which the heat pack is incorporated is not heated. For example, in the case of a heated U-shaped travel neck pillow (e.g., the heated travel neck pillow <b>100</b>), a designated âheat zoneâ comprises an area that comes into contact with the back of the user's neck. This âheat zoneâ may feature a sewn-in, or otherwise attached (e.g., glued on), pocket or pouch (e.g., pocket <b>120</b>), which may be fastened at one or more open ends <b>125</b> by Velcro, zipper, spandex, elastic, snaps, buttons, or the like. The user activates the heat pack <b>130</b> by exposing it to air, and then places it within the pocket <b>120</b> on the item. The activated heat pack <b>130</b> warms the âheat zoneâ to provide soothing heat for a sustained period of time in a targeted area during the user's trip, when relaxing at home, or whenever used by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In one embodiment, the pocket (e.g., the pocket <b>120</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>320</b><i>a</i>, <b>320</b><i>b</i>) is comprised of a lightweight material. In one embodiment, the pocket is a permeable/breathable material. In one embodiment, the pocket is a flexible material. In another embodiment, the pocket is a stretchable material. In one embodiment, the pocket is comprised of a spandex material or the like that is lightweight, permeable, breathable, flexible, and stretchable. These properties of the material (e.g., spandex) provide superior contact with the user, while allowing for an optimal amount of heat to permeate from the pocket to the user to optimize warmth. Moreover, an optimal air flow is achieved due to the permeability of the pocket.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The geometry of the pocket is such that the heat pack fits within while having sufficient breathing room and tautness to allow for maximum permeability. Thus, the material of the pocket and the geometry of the pocket provide a âheat zoneâ with a sustained, targeted, and controlled heat transfer to a specific area of the user's body.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In another embodiment, vertical and/or horizontal ribbing may be provided within the pocket to enhance air flow and in particular enhance two-way air flow. The ribbing may be provided in one or more portions of the pocket and on one or both internal sides of the pocket.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Use of a flexible and/or stretchable material allows for ease of insertion of a new heat pack, ease of removal of an exhausted heat pack, support to keep the activated heat pack in place to target the generated heat, and transfer the heat generated to an area on the user's body providing sustained, controlled warmth. The flexible/stretchable material may be expanded by, for example, a user's hand to allow for easy insertion of the heat pack, may return to its original shape or position to help hold the heat pack in place during use, and then expand again to facilitate removal of the exhausted heat pack.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As the heat packs are generally designed to be single use and disposable, the heat pack is easily removed from the item's âheat zoneâ pocket, so a new one can replace an exhausted pack at a later time, such as the return leg of the user's trip. With this in mind, for sales considerations, the item may be bundled with two or more heat packs for the customer to use. Refill packs may also be merchandised as a separate complementary item.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In one embodiment, the built-in heat zone comprises a pocket with a heat pack disposed therein. In one embodiment, the built-in heat zone comprises one or more pockets with one or more heat packs disposed within each of the one or more pockets. In another embodiment, the built-in heat zone comprises a plurality of pockets with one or more heat packs disposed within each pocket.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In one embodiment, the heat packs are sized and shaped to fit within a 3â³Ã5â³ heat zone (e.g., pocket) without bunching or folding; in this particular embodiment, the size of the heat pack is 2.75â³ HÃ4.50â³ W. In another embodiment, the heat pack is roughly 2.75â³ HÃ3.75â³ W, with the pocket accordingly sized to receive and contain the heat pack. In other embodiments, if other sized heat packs are utilized, the pocket is sized with a specific alignment and geometry to the heat pack to provide for sufficient breathing room and tautness for maximum permeability.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Although the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is not limited thereto. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous changes and modifications may be made to the preferred embodiments of the invention and that such changes and modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the appended claims be construed to cover all such equivalent variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the application of various embodiments is not limited to travel items and can also be applied to any number of items that provide comfort/relaxation in the home, during travel, and the like.</p>
