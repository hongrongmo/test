      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to systems for managing and allocating shelf space among rows of products. More particularly, the present invention is directed to integrated shelf allocation management systems accommodating varying product sizes easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In retail stores, such as grocery stores, products are displayed on shelves for customers to inspect and select. To attract customers to a particular product and/or to facilitate a convenient shopping experience, products are preferably organized in an orderly fashion on the store shelves. Moreover, because wasted shelf space wastes money, the products should efficiently use shelf space.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For orderly presentation to customers, products may be divided into rows with dividers between rows so that each product row remains confined to a designated area and does not shift or cross over into another row.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Additionally, vendors prefer to move the products to the front of the shelf so that the customer may easily view the products or reach them for purchase. If the products are hidden at the back of the shelf, the customer may not see or be able to reach them resulting in potential loss of sales.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Some traditional systems employ dividers that are separately attached to either the shelf itself or to locating strips that run lengthwise along the front of the shelf. Due to the separated nature of the dividers, these systems lack the structural stability of an integrated unit in which both side walls are joined by a base piece. As a result, the dividers may fail to provide a rigid enough barrier to confine products to one particular row or may fall down, thus limiting their utility. Further, the permanent or semi-permanent nature of the attachment of the dividers to the shelf makes it difficult to reposition the dividers in these systems to accommodate varying product shapes and sizes. To accomplish such tasks, each divider is manually removed from either the shelf itself or a locating strip, repositioned, and reattached at a new position on the shelf or locating strip. That step can be both time consuming and inconvenient.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">There has been a long-standing need in the commercial vendor community for an integrated shelving management system that is able to accommodate products of varying sizes. The present invention addresses this need.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention addresses the limitations currently existing within the art and provides a cost-effective integrated shelf allocation management system. Such a system preferably provides structural stability and is also quickly and easily adjustable to accommodate varying products shapes and sizes. The present invention may also incorporate a mechanism that provides for the efficient advancing of products toward the front of the shelf for customer inspection and selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The integrated shelf allocation management system allocates space along a retail store shelf among rows of product. Through the innovative design, the embodiments of the present invention are able to accommodate products have a wide range of widths. The side walls of the shelving units of the present invention are adjustable in two primary ways. First, the distance between the side walls is continuously adjustable from within a range established by slots located in the base portion of the side wall components, as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Second, the orientation of the side wall components may be adjusted to allow for a larger range of product widths to be accommodated. The side wall components of the shelving units of the present invention may be formed in an L shape with one side of the L being longer than the other. By rotating the side walls, a new range of product widths may be accommodated by the shelving unit.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other elements that may be well known. The detailed description will be provided herein below with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present invention addresses the limitations currently existing within the art and provides a cost-effective integrated shelf allocation management system. Such a system preferably provides structural stability, allowing it to be easily placed on, moved, or removed from the shelf due to its integrated form. The present invention allows a shelving unit with product loaded to be moved from one shelf to another, dramatically reducing the time required for stocking, restocking, and resets of product. The present invention is also quickly and easily adjustable to accommodate varying products shapes and sizes. The present invention may also incorporate a mechanism that provides for the efficient advancing of products toward the front of the shelf for customer inspection and selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As used herein, the âfrontâ of the integrated shelf allocation management system refers to the portion resting on that part of the shelf surface closest to the aisle where a customer may easily view and/or select a product. The ârearâ of the system refers to the portion resting of that part of the shelf surface farthest away from the aisle. As used herein, the term âintegratedâ means that the recited components remain engaged as a single unit regardless of the chosen position. As used herein, âlongitudinallyâ means the dimension that extends from the front of the shelf to the rear. As used herein, âorthogonallyâ means orthogonal to the longitudinal axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The integrated shelf allocation management system allocates space along a retail store shelf among rows of product. The integrated shelving unit also provides for the movement of product toward the front of the shelf as described below. Through the innovative design, the embodiments of the present invention are able to accommodate products have a range of widths. The side walls of the shelving units of the present invention are adjustable in two primary ways. First, the distance between the side walls is continuously adjustable from within a range established by slots located in the base portion of the side wall components, as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Second, the orientation of the side wall components may be adjusted to allow for a larger range of product widths to be accommodated. The side wall components of the shelving units of the present invention may be formed in an L shape with one side of the L being longer than the other. By rotating the side walls, a new range of product widths may be accommodated by the shelving unit, as described more fully hereinbelow.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a disassembled shelving unit of an embodiment <b>100</b> of the present invention. The shelving unit <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> includes a base which runs along a longitudinal axis, two side wall components <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, and a mechanism for securing the assembly together. The apparatus <b>100</b> may also include a central rail <b>128</b> that serves to stabilize the entire assembly and provide a surface on which the product may rest and be slid towards the front of the shelving unit <b>100</b> as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The side wall components <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> are roughly L-shaped such that a portion of the side component forms the wall of the shelving unit and a portion of the side wall component forms part of the base of the shelving unit. The vertical portion of each side wall component <b>104</b>A, <b>108</b>A is located on opposing sides of the shelving unit and extends vertically at approximately a <b>90</b>-degree angle from the base. Both side wall components <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> preferably have the same dimensions. In accord with the present invention, each L-shaped side wall component includes a long arm <b>104</b>A, <b>108</b>A and a short arm <b>104</b>B, <b>108</b>B. The arms may have a wide variety of dimensions as dictated by the specific implementation in which the shelving units of the present invention are employed. The side walls of the shelving unit may be defined by the long arm of the right side wall component <b>104</b>A and the long arm of the left wall component <b>108</b>A, if the long arm of each component is oriented vertically. If the orientation of the side wall components is changed as described below, the side walls of the shelving unit may instead by defined by the short arm of the right side wall component <b>104</b>B and the short arm of the left side wall component <b>108</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Each side wall component preferably includes slots oriented orthogonally in both the vertical and horizontal portions of the side component. In some embodiments, there are two pairs of slots <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, on each side wall component, such as the one shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. One pair of slots is towards the front of side wall component and includes a slot in the vertical portion of the side wall component and a slot in the horizontal portion of the side wall component <b>112</b>. The second pair of slots <b>116</b> is located at the same distance from the front of the front of the side wall components in the complementary side wall component for the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The sets of slots towards the front of the side wall components <b>112</b>, <b>120</b> are located at the same distance from the front of the side wall components, so that the slots in the base of the left side wall component <b>120</b> align with the slots in the base of the right side wall component <b>112</b>, for the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The sets of slots towards the rear of the side wall components <b>116</b>, <b>124</b> are similarly located at the same distance from the front of the side wall components. While the embodiment shown in the attached figures has two pairs of slots, other embodiments are contemplated in which there are more pairs of slots in the slide component, depending on the stability desired by the person implementing the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The central rail <b>128</b> of some embodiments of the present invention is also shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The central rail <b>128</b> may provide stability to the shelving unit, allowing it to be picked up and moved, even when product is housed on the shelving unit. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the central rail <b>128</b> may include front and rear vertically oriented barrier elements <b>132</b>, <b>136</b> that are effective to stop product housed in the shelving unit <b>100</b> from falling from the front or rear of the shelving unit, respectively. For partially this reason, the barrier elements <b>132</b>, <b>136</b> preferably extend above and below the longitudinal aspect of the central rail <b>128</b>. Additionally, a portion of the front barrier element <b>136</b> may be used to click into a guide strip attached to the shelf. This mechanism may thus be used to stabilize the location of the shelving unit <b>101</b> on the shelf, avoiding left-right and front-back shifting of the shelving unit. The portion of the front and rear barrier elements <b>132</b>, <b>136</b> that extends below the central rail may also provide support and stability for the shelving unit <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">For the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the central rail <b>128</b> includes two holes <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F, though other configurations are contemplated as discussed below. In this embodiment, the holes <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F are located at the same distance as their respective sets of slots in the side wall components. The holes are located roughly in the middle of the central rail <b>128</b> for this embodiment. The number of holes in the central rail may match the number of pairs of slots in the side wall components. The holes <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are adapted to receive a bolt <b>144</b>R, <b>144</b>F, as described below, which acts as a mechanism for securing the assembly together. As such, each hole <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F may be beveled to complimentarily accept the head of bolt <b>144</b>R, <b>144</b>F, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As noted above, holes <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F in the central rail shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are adapted to accept bolts <b>144</b>R, <b>144</b>F. The bolts preferably pass through the central rail <b>128</b>, through the pairs of slots in the horizontal portion of the side wall components <b>116</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>120</b> and extend to the bottom of the integrated shelving unit <b>100</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The tip of the bolt is preferably flat and is able to accept a nut-like component <b>148</b>R, <b>148</b>F, that acts as a receiving base for the bolt <b>144</b>R, <b>144</b>F. In the embodiments shown in the attached figures, the nut-like component <b>148</b>R, <b>148</b>F may be rectangularly shaped, though a wide variety of shapes may be used. Additionally, the nut-like component <b>148</b>R, <b>148</b>F may be implemented as a self-tapping screw that taps into a receiving base. The receiving base may be rectangular in shape, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, or any other shape as desired by the user of the present invention. Mechanisms besides a bolt/nut combination may be used, such as a tension fasteners and any other component that allows the mechanism to set and relieve tension. The central rail component <b>128</b> may be used with side wall components <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> having a variety of dimensions, so long as the holes <b>140</b>R, <b>140</b>F in the central rail <b>128</b> correspond to the slots in the side wall components.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The adjustable and integrated shelving unit may operate in the following way.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The width of the shelving unit is manually set to the appropriate distance as dictated by the product to be housed in the shelving unit. That may, for example, be accomplished by placing the product in the shelving unit <b>100</b> and adjusting the width by loosening the bolt/nut combinations (e.g., <b>144</b>R, <b>148</b>R &amp; <b>144</b>F, <b>148</b>F). During adjustment of the shelving unit's width the bolt-nut combination (e.g., <b>144</b>R, <b>148</b>R &amp; <b>144</b>F, <b>148</b>F) is loose enough to allow the side components <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> to slide orthogonally to accommodate the product. Once the appropriate width is set, the bolt-nut combination (e.g., <b>144</b>R, <b>148</b>R &amp; <b>144</b>F, <b>148</b>F) may be tightened to firmly set the width of the shelving unit. In the configuration shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> for a narrow product <b>204</b>, the long arms of the L-shaped side wall components <b>104</b>A, <b>108</b>A are vertical. This may be easily observed in the end view shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">For products having a larger width <b>304</b>, the shelving unit may be disassembled and the longer arms of the L-shaped side wall components rotated so that they are oriented horizontally to form a portion of the base of the shelving unit, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> also displays a puller-backstop assembly <b>700</b> that may be used in the context of the present invention, as described more fully below. In this configuration, the short arms of the L-shaped side wall components <b>104</b>B, <b>108</b>B are vertical. This may be easily observed in the end view shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The longer arms of the side wall components <b>104</b>A, <b>108</b>A thus allow the shelving unit to accommodate products having a larger width <b>304</b>. With the shorter arms of the L-shaped side wall components <b>104</b>B, <b>108</b>B oriented vertically, the bolt-nut assembly may be adjusted through the process described above. In this manner, the present invention provides a stable shelving unit that is easily adjustable across a wide range of product widths.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> displays another assembled embodiment of the shelving unit. Unlike the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, this embodiment includes pairs of staggered holes <b>604</b>RL, <b>604</b>RR and <b>608</b>FL, <b>608</b>FR in the central rail. The holes are staggered in that each hole is located at a different distance from the front of the shelving unit. Each of the holes is designed to accept a bolt, as described above. One pair of staggered holes <b>604</b>RL, <b>604</b>RR is located in the rear of the central rail, while a second pair of staggered holes <b>608</b>FL, <b>608</b>FR is located towards the front of the central rail. The holes on the left side <b>604</b>RL, <b>608</b>FL of the central rail engage only the slot of the left side wall component through a bolt, while the holes on the right side <b>604</b>RR, <b>608</b>FR of the central rail engage only the slot of the right side wall component through a bolt. This may be contrasted to the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> where the same bolt engages both the left and right side wall components. By having the bolts-nut combinations (through the holes in the central rail) selectively engage the side wall component on their respective sides of the shelving unit, these embodiments of the shelving units of the present invention may accommodate a wider diversity of product widths.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Product may be drawn towards the front of the shelving unit by using numerous mechanisms well known in the art. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> displays a backstop-puller assembly <b>700</b>. The backstop-puller assembly long horizontal arm <b>704</b> that extends for the majority of the length of the shelving unit between the left and right side wall components. At the rear of the shelving unit, the long horizontal arm <b>704</b> may turn <b>90</b> degrees to terminate in an L-shaped vertical arm <b>708</b>. The vertical arm <b>708</b> may be attached to a horizontal member <b>712</b> that engages the product and allows it to be drawn towards the front of the shelving unit (as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The front of the backstop-puller assembly may include a grip <b>716</b> for easy manipulation by the consumer. In other embodiments, the product may be drawn towards the front of the shelving unit by a bias mechanism (e.g., spring-driven or gravity-driven) whereby product is pushed towards the front of the shelving unit by the bias mechanism In other embodiments, a disengaging puller-backstop mechanism may be used, such as the one shown in U.S. Pat. No. 8,235,226, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In other embodiments, the product may be passively moved by raising the rear of the shelving unit, by hand, or by any other mechanism or strategy well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A further advantage of the shelving allocation units of the present invention includes the ability of store personnel to restock shelves with product from the front of the shelf. The shelving allocation units of the present invention may be removed from the shelf and new product may be placed at the rear of the shelving unit behind the existing product. Alternatively, the shelving unit may be stocked with new product from the front of the shelving unit and the entire shelving unit may then be rotated <b>180</b> degrees to place older product towards the front of the shelf.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Multiple individual assemblies of the present invention may be used in tandem to provide arrays of shelving space. For example, two shelving units of the present invention may be housed next to one another to accommodate varying sizes of product. Because the shelving units of the present invention may be adjusted to a wide variety of widths, shelving units having the same dimensions may be advantageously used to accommodate a diversity of product sizes without requiring a similar diversity in distinct shelving unitsâeach having unique dimensions.</p>
