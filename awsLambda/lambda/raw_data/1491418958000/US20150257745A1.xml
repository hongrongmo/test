      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to surgical retractor systems, such as brain retractors, and more specifically to devices that may be used to enhance the functionality of such retractors.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A variety of different devices have been used to retract delicate tissue during surgical procedures. One such device is illustrated in United States Patent Publication Number 2010/0010315 (âMangiardiâ), to which this application claims priority and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Mangiardi shows two general versions of a retractor for delicate tissue. One version is a closed-channel retractor in the form of a tube (see, e.g., Mangiardi FIG. 3), and the other is an open-channel retractor in the form of a curved channel (see, e.g., Mangiardi FIG. 23).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> of this application illustrates a soft tissue retractor system such as found in Mangiardi. The retractor system includes a hollow retractor <b>100</b>, and an introducer <b>102</b> that is selectively inserted into the retractor <b>100</b>. The retractor <b>100</b> and/or introducer <b>102</b> may include a handle <b>104</b> to facilitate manipulation and placement of the retractor system, and a lock to hold the introducer and retractor together. The illustrated handle <b>104</b> is molded integrally with the retractor <b>100</b>, but it may be a separate part. The handle <b>104</b> may be configured to connect to a clamp <b>106</b>, such as the standard surgical clamp <b>106</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In this example, the handle <b>104</b> has a ridge <b>108</b> that fits into a corresponding groove <b>110</b> on the clamp <b>106</b>, to prevent relative rotation between the two when engaged. Modifications to this design are described in Mangiardi.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A retractor system such as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is often used by inserting the introducer <b>102</b> into the retractor <b>100</b> and locking it in place, so the two can be moved and manipulated as a unit. The combined introducer/retractor system is inserted into the patient's body and moved to the surgery site, and then the introducer <b>102</b> is unlocked and removed to permit access to the site through the retractor <b>100</b>. When the unit is in place (either before or after the introducer <b>102</b> is removed), the handle <b>104</b> may be locked to a clamp <b>106</b> to hold the retractor <b>100</b> in place. An example of this procedure is shown in FIGS. 16-20 of Mangiardi. Surgeons using the Mangiardi retractor sometimes do not use a clamp to hold the retractor at the surgery site, and often manually manipulate the retractor to access different parts of the surgery site during the surgical procedure. The introducer/retractor system and the retractor may be manipulated by holding the proximal ends of the introducer or retractor or by holding the handle.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The device shown in Mangiardi may have a transparent introducer <b>102</b> and/or retractor <b>100</b>, and surgeons using such devices advantageously use the transparent introducer and retractor to manually guide the unit to the surgery site. While it has been found that visual guidance by looking through the introducer <b>102</b> is very beneficial, it also has been found that some form of additional guidance or navigation may be desired in some cases. For example, in some cases, surgeons have used a stylet (a narrow elongated rod) to guide the movement of the introducer/retractor system. In such cases, the stylet is advanced to the surgery site, and then the interlocked introducer/retractor system is slid over the stylet until it reaches the surgery site. This is facilitated by the inclusion of a hole at the tip of the introducer that fits around the stylet. If the hole through the tip of the introducer is absent, this method cannot be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It has been found that some surgeons using the above procedure may use a stylet that is integrated into a computer navigation system. For example, the stylet may include a so-called âstarburstâ or the like, on the stylet's proximal end (i.e., the end opposite the distal end that is inserted to the surgical site). This and other navigation systems are known in the art. For example, frameless navigation systems and other computerized guidance systems and methods are described in U.S. Publication No. 2001/0027271, and others, and are commercially available from companies such as Medtronic, Inc., Stryker, BrainLab, AG, Ge Healthcare. The foregoing reference is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As used herein, âcomputerized guidanceâ encompasses any method of guiding a device to or at a surgical site that relies on computer visualization and/or control, as opposed to direct visual inspection and/or manual movement. Mangiardi briefly notes the possibility of using stereotactic guidance or navigation in conjunction with a surgical retractor, but does not illustrate or describe this procedure or any apparatus for accomplishing this objective.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">While computerized surgical guidance systems are well-known, a number of limitations exist with respect to their use with introducer/retractor systems, and particularly with systems like those shown in Mangiardi. For example, while some surgeons use computerized guidance to direct a stylet to the surgery site, and then slide the introducer/retractor system over the stylet to the site, the movement of the introducer/retractor may be somewhat imprecise and the process can be unduly cumbersome. This method also is not available if the introducer/retractor system does not have a through-hole that fits over the stylet (due either to the absence of a hole or a hole that is too small). In addition, the stylet does not provide a view of the tissue through which it is advanced, so there is no visual means to perceive and avoid critical tissue (e.g., major blood vessels or nerves) when inserting a stylet before inserting a retractor/introducer system. Also, the small-diameter stylet may sever delicate tissue cells, such as grey or white brain matter, rather than moving the cells aside and passing between them as would be expected to happen when advancing the introducer/retractor system.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">While preexisting navigation system devices have been used with delicate tissue introducers and retractors, there still exists a need to provide alternative solutions. In addition, there is a need to provide alternatives to existing systems for manipulating, introducing and holding retractors.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In one exemplary embodiment, there is provided a delicate tissue retraction system having a hollow tubular retractor, a hollow tubular introducer, and a navigation module. The retractor has a proximal retractor end and a distal retractor end. The introducer has a proximal introducer end and a distal introducer end, and the introducer is configured to be removably installed within the retractor with the proximal introducer end being adjacent the proximal retractor end and the distal introducer end extending beyond the distal retractor end. The navigation module includes a shaft having a proximal shaft end and a distal shaft end, and a navigation unit mounted to the proximal shaft end. The navigation module being is removably installable within the retractor with the distal shaft end contained generally within the introducer and the navigation module outside the introducer. The navigation module indicates the location of one or more points on at least one of the retractor and the introducer to a navigation system.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The present disclosure provides exemplary embodiments of various apparatus that can be used with known or future tissue retractor systems. Such features include, for example, guidance systems for monitoring and/or controlling the movement of the retractor system and a clamp that can be used to manipulate the system. The features described herein may be used together or separately, and may be modified as appropriate or desired for the particular application. For illustration, the exemplary embodiments are described herein as they may be adapted for use with a soft tissue retractor such as the one shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. It will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art, however, that other modifications may be made to embodiments used with devices like the exemplary retractor in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and that other versions may be constructed for use with other devices that are not similar to this exemplary embodiment devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate a first embodiment of a navigation system that may be used with a combined introducer/retractor system. In this embodiment, the introducer/retractor system comprises a hollow retractor <b>200</b> into which a hollow introducer <b>202</b> is releasably installed. The introducer <b>202</b> and retractor <b>200</b> may comprise structures as described in Mangiardi, or have other shapes or configurations. In this example, the introducer <b>202</b> has a tapered proximal end <b>204</b>, an approximately straight or slightly tapered center portion <b>206</b>, and a tapered distal end <b>208</b> that extends beyond the retractor <b>200</b> and terminates at a tip <b>210</b>. The tip <b>210</b> of the introducer <b>202</b> has a tip opening <b>212</b> that passes through it. The retractor <b>200</b> has a tapered proximal end <b>214</b> and a straight or slightly tapered center portion <b>216</b>, and terminates at the end of the center portion <b>216</b> at an opening <b>218</b>. The outer wall of the retractor <b>200</b> may be chamfered or rounded around the perimeter of the opening <b>218</b> to help prevent local concentration of pressure when the introducer <b>202</b> is removed. The retractor <b>200</b> and introducer <b>202</b> may be a tube (i.e., a closed channel) having any suitable profile (i.e., shape as viewed along their longitudinal axis <b>220</b>) that is circular, semicircular, rectilinear, oval, elliptical, or flattened (i.e., provided with one long dimension and one short dimension) to help prevent unnecessary displacement of and pressure on tissue during insertion and use. The retractor <b>200</b> and/or introducer <b>202</b> also may have an open channel shape (i.e., non-tubular) having a semicircular profile or other profile. For example, the introducer <b>202</b> may be tubular with a closed half-circular profile (such as a âDâ shape), and the retractor <b>200</b> may be an open channel with an open half-circular profile (e.g., a âCâ shape) that nests over the introducer profile. The dimensions and shapes of the foregoing features be varied to address different surgical needs. Exemplary dimensions and shapes are provided in the Mangiardi reference. Such devices may be sold in kits that have introducers and retractors of various shapes and/or sizes to provide the surgeon with sufficient variety to address a number of situations.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The introducer <b>202</b> and/or retractor <b>200</b> may have transparent walls through which the surgeon can see underlying tissue. For example, the walls may be made of glass, polycarbonate or other transparent or semi-transparent materials. While transparent walls are preferred, it is not required in all embodiments, such as embodiments in which a navigation system supplants the surgeon's reliance on vision to position the introducer <b>202</b> and retractor <b>200</b>. The proximal surfaces of the retractor <b>200</b> and introducer (<b>222</b> and <b>224</b>, respectively) may be treated to render them non-reflective or glare-resistant, such as by painting them matte black or overmolding a matte layer of material. The walls of the introducer <b>202</b> and/or retractor <b>200</b> may also be used as a light guide to transmit light to the surgical site at the distal end of the retractor <b>200</b>, as known in the art and shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,417,746, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The retractor <b>200</b> may include a handle <b>226</b> that is shaped and sized to be retained in a clamp and/or to help a surgeon to manipulate the retractor <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, the handle <b>226</b> includes a raised bead <b>228</b> that fits into a corresponding groove on a clamp to provide a firmer connection between the handle and the clamp. Of course, other retention features may be provided in other embodiments (e.g., the bead may be formed on the clamp, and a corresponding groove formed on the handle <b>226</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">A navigation module <b>230</b> is selectively installed within the introducer <b>202</b>. In this example, the navigation module <b>230</b> may comprise a standard navigation stylus having a shaft <b>232</b> and a navigation unit <b>250</b> at the proximal end <b>236</b> of the shaft <b>232</b>. A computer navigation system tracks the movement of the navigation unit <b>250</b> to calculate of the location of the distal end <b>234</b> of the shaft <b>232</b>, as known in the art. When installed in the introducer/retractor system, the shaft <b>232</b> extends generally along the longitudinal axis <b>220</b> from the distal shaft end <b>234</b> to the proximal shaft end <b>236</b>. In this embodiment, the distal shaft end <b>234</b> preferably is located at or near the distal end <b>208</b> of the introducer <b>202</b>. Also in this embodiment, the proximal shaft end <b>236</b> is located outside and spaced from the proximal introducer surface <b>222</b>. It is envisioned that these locations may be modified without departing from the general spirit of this disclosure. For example, the proximal shaft end <b>236</b> may be located at or even somewhat within the proximal introducer end <b>204</b>, provided whatever navigation system is associated with the navigation module <b>230</b> is still able to operate effectively (e.g., by programming it to associate the displaced tip of the stylus shaft with the actual location of the distal end of the introducer). Infrared or other visual devices might require some part of the navigation module <b>230</b> to be located outside the proximal end <b>204</b> of the introducer <b>202</b>, but wired electronic systems or navigation units that do not rely on visual contact with a navigation system might be mounted well within the confines of the introducer <b>202</b>. While the distal shaft end <b>234</b> may, in some embodiments, protrude beyond the distal end <b>208</b> of the introducer, it is anticipated that locating the distal shaft end <b>234</b> at or short of the distal end of the introducer <b>208</b> may provide a particular benefit by reducing the likelihood that the distal shaft end <b>234</b> will interfere with tissue as the system is being advanced through the tissue. In this configuration (such as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), the navigation module <b>230</b> does not interfere with the benefit of gentle tissue separation that is provided by the introducer/retractor system.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The navigation module <b>230</b> may be secured to or located within the introducer <b>202</b> by any suitable means. In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the navigation module <b>230</b> is secured by one or more plugs that resiliently engage the introducer <b>202</b>. For example, in the shown embodiment, a tip plug <b>238</b> is provided at the distal shaft end <b>234</b> and a shaft plug <b>240</b> is provided along the shaft <b>232</b>. The plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> preferably hold the navigation module in a generally fixed position relative to the introducer, so that the navigation unit <b>230</b> and the introducer/retractor system move together as a unit during insertion to the surgery site. It will be appreciated that any movement between the navigation module <b>230</b> and the introducer <b>202</b> may cause some inaccuracy in computer navigation, but some minor relative movement may be within operating tolerances.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> preferably are made of a resilient, tactile material to secure the navigation module <b>230</b> to the introducer <b>202</b> by frictional engagement. The plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may be attached to the shaft <b>232</b> either permanently (such as by overmolding) or removably (such as by friction fitment). One material that is expected to be suitable for the plugs is silicone rubber, but other materials may be used. Using such resilient material, the navigation module <b>230</b> can be inserted into the introducer <b>202</b> and pressed in place with a force to slightly compress the plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>. The compressed plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> are expected to exert a restoring force against the inner walls of the introducer <b>202</b>, which will hold the navigation module <b>230</b> in place until it is removed by pulling it towards the proximal introducer end <b>204</b>. By connecting the navigation module <b>230</b> to the introducer <b>202</b> when the parts are dry, the engagement force can be maximized. However, it is expected that materials such as silicon rubber for the plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> and polycarbonate for the inner wall of the introducer <b>202</b> will maintain good engagement even in the presence of fluids present during typical surgical procedures, and possibly even if the materials are wet when connected. In order to minimize the likelihood that fluid will interfere with the connection, features may be provided to address issues that may be associated with the presence of fluids. For example, one or more grooves may be provided in the plugs to trap and retain moisture, and the plugs may have one or more integral wiping features <b>244</b> (e.g., flexible circumferential protrusions) to displace fluid that might be present during engagement.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The tip plug <b>238</b> and shaft plug <b>240</b> may be shaped to conform generally to the inner walls of the introducer <b>202</b>. For example, the plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may have an ovate profile if the introducer <b>202</b> is ovate, or a round profile is the introducer <b>202</b> is round. The plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may be tapered or otherwise shaped to correspond to the longitudinal shape of the inner wall of the introducer <b>202</b>. In the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the tip plug <b>238</b> includes a circumferential groove <b>246</b> that resiliency engages inside the introducer tip opening <b>212</b>. Such a tip plug <b>238</b> may be shaped and sized to seal the tip opening <b>212</b> closed against the ingress of fluid. The distal end of the tip plug <b>238</b> may protrude beyond the end of the tip opening <b>212</b>, and in that case may be shaped as a tapered or rounded cone <b>248</b> to form a smooth contour to displace tissue as the retractor/introducer unit is advanced to the surgical site. However, it is not necessary for the tip plug <b>238</b> to extend through the tip opening <b>212</b> in all embodiments. Indeed, the tip plug <b>238</b> may be spaced from the tip opening <b>212</b> and from the distal end of the introducer <b>202</b>. In still other embodiments, the tip plug <b>238</b> may be omitted, and the end of the shaft <b>232</b> may be sized to rest against the inside wall of the introducer <b>202</b> at or around the tip opening <b>212</b> (if one is present) or the distal end <b>208</b> of the introducer <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, one or both plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may be slidable along the shaft <b>232</b> to position the plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> to fit inside introducers <b>202</b> having different lengths. For example, in the shown embodiment, the shaft plug <b>240</b> is shaped as a simple ovate ring that can be slid in the longitudinal direction <b>220</b> along the shaft <b>232</b> to any desired position. Frictional engagement between the shaft plug <b>240</b> and the shaft <b>232</b> holds the shaft plug <b>240</b> in the desired position. If desired, other securements between the shaft plug <b>240</b> and the shaft <b>232</b> may be used, such as radial clamps or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">While the foregoing embodiment has been described using resilient plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, it will be appreciated that the plugs may be replaced by non-resilient members, such as solid plastic pieces that are attached to or integrally formed with shaft <b>232</b>. In such an embodiment, the plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may be used simply to center the navigation module <b>230</b> within the introducer/retractor system, with a retaining force being provided by the surgeon or other mechanisms. Alternatively, one or both plugs <b>238</b>, <b>240</b> may engage portions of the introducer or retractor to hold them together. For example, one plug <b>238</b> may comprise an exterior thread or bayonet fitting that engages a corresponding thread or bayonet fitting formed on the inner wall of the introducer <b>202</b>. These and other variations will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The navigation unit <b>250</b> may be attached to the shaft <b>232</b>, such as by being attached at the proximal shaft end <b>236</b>. The navigation unit <b>250</b> may comprise any suitable electronic, visual or stereotactic navigation device. Examples of such devices include arrangements of LEDs (light emitting diodes) or âstarburstsâ comprising multiple optical reflectors, which are used to convey the physical location and orientation of the navigation unit <b>250</b> to an optical detection system set up in the operation room. Such devices may use visible-light or non-visible radiation (e.g., infrared light) to detect and track the navigation unit <b>250</b>, as known in the art. Such devices are available from commercial sources, such as Medtronic, Inc., Stryker, BrainLab, AG, Ge Healthcare, and others, and need not be described in detail here. Alternatively, the navigation unit <b>250</b> may be integrally formed with the shaft <b>232</b>, as known in the art. Regardless of what kind of navigation unit <b>250</b> is used, it may be necessary to program the tracking system with the dimensions of the combined introducer, retractor and navigation unit so that the program can equate the location of the navigation unit <b>250</b> to the distal end (and perhaps other dimensions) of the introducer <b>202</b>. Using such programming, the tracking system can know precisely where the tip <b>210</b> of the introducer <b>202</b> is at all times.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, it is expected that an embodiment of a device as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> may be useful even if no navigation unit is provided. This embodiment is a simple tip closure member <b>400</b> having a shaft <b>402</b> or other structure to which a tip plug <b>404</b> is connected. The shaft <b>402</b> fits within an introducer, such as the introducer <b>202</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and the tip plug <b>404</b> engages and seals the introducer tip opening <b>212</b>. The shaft <b>402</b> preferably is long enough to be accessible for removal during surgery, but this is not required. The shaft <b>402</b> may include a second plug <b>406</b>, such as the tapered plug <b>406</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, to help hold the closure member <b>400</b> in place, but this is not strictly necessary. A second plug <b>406</b> may be desirable if it is expected that lateral movement of the shaft <b>402</b> within the introducer might accidentally dislodge the tip plug <b>404</b>, however such movement may actually be desirable to help the surgeon intentionally remove the tip plug <b>404</b> when desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">A device such as the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> may be useful for surgeons that prefer not to have a tip opening <b>212</b> formed in the introducer <b>202</b>. That preference may be due to the expected inflow of fluids into the tip opening <b>212</b> during insertion of the introducer/retractor system to the surgery site, or for other reasons. Regardless of the reason, the tip closure member <b>400</b> is expected to provide an economical way to close and seal an introducer tip opening <b>212</b> in introducers that have such an opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, another embodiment of a navigation module is illustrated and described. This embodiment is used with a retractor <b>500</b> and introducer <b>502</b> similar to the previously-described embodiment. In this embodiment, however, the introducer <b>502</b> does not include a tip opening, and instead has a closed tip <b>504</b>. The tip <b>504</b> may be formed, for example, as a rounded, tapered cone. Here, the navigation module <b>506</b> comprises a shaft <b>508</b> that is secured to the inner wall <b>510</b> of the introducer <b>502</b> by one or more plugs <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, and a navigation unit <b>516</b> such as described above. The plugs <b>512</b>, <b>514</b> may be constructed as described previously, or have different constructions. For example, the tip plug <b>512</b> may be shaped as a generally conical structure instead of being adapted to fit into and seal an introducer tip opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">It is also envisioned that a navigation module may be provided that fits introducer that have tip openings (such as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), or introducers that do not have a tip opening (such as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>). For example, the tip plug <b>238</b> on the navigation module <b>230</b> of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> may be shaped to engage the introducer regardless of whether the introducer has a tip opening or not.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Turning to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, another embodiment of a navigation module is illustrated and described. This embodiment mounts to an interconnected retractor <b>600</b> and introducer <b>602</b> by installing within the bore of the introducer <b>602</b>. In this embodiment, the navigation module <b>604</b> comprises a shaft <b>606</b> that engages the introducer, and a navigation unit <b>614</b> that is selectively connectable to the shaft <b>606</b>. For example, the navigation unit <b>614</b> may be selectively mounted in a receptacle <b>616</b> at the top of the shaft <b>606</b>. This makes the navigation module <b>604</b> a modular system in which different navigation units <b>614</b> may be selectively fitted to different shafts <b>606</b> to suit the particular circumstances. For example, a family of different shafts <b>606</b> may be provided, each fitting one or more introducers having different diameters, lengths, profiles or other dimensions. The receptacle <b>616</b> may be a locking cuff, a threaded opening, bayonet fittings, or any other suitable arrangement of engaging parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The shaft <b>606</b> may be secured to the introducer <b>602</b> by one or more resilient seals <b>608</b>. The seals <b>608</b> may comprise plugs as described before, or other structures. For example, the seals <b>608</b> may comprise O-rings or other resilient members that can frictionally engage the introducer <b>602</b>. O-rings may be mounted to the shaft by forming a circumferential groove <b>610</b> to retain each O-ring. The proximal end <b>612</b> of the shaft <b>606</b> may be flared outward to rest against the end of the introducer <b>602</b>, to thereby provide a visual indication when the shaft <b>606</b> is fully-seated and prevent over-insertion.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In this embodiment the introducer <b>602</b> has a tip opening <b>618</b>, but this is not required in all embodiments. If a tip opening is provided, it may be desirable to provide some means to seal the opening, such as a seal that extends down from the shaft <b>606</b>. Alternatively, it may be desirable to permit fluid to enter the opening, and to provide some means to facilitate suction removal of that fluid. For example, a bore may be provided through the shaft <b>606</b> to permit access by a suction tube. Some means for providing suction may also be provided in the previously-described embodiments. For example, the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> may include a notch formed on the upper plug <b>240</b> through which a suction tube or other devices can be passed to detect the presence of and remove fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The foregoing embodiments are illustrated with the navigation module being centered along the longitudinal axis of the introducer. This arrangement may be desirable to simplify the spatial relationship between the navigation unit and the end of the introducer, and give the surgeon a better sense about where the tip of the introducer is located during the surgical procedure. However, this arrangement is not necessary in all embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate an embodiment of an offset mount for a navigation module. This embodiment is also shown in relation to a nested retractor <b>700</b> and introducer <b>702</b> that are held together with a lock <b>712</b>. The introducer <b>702</b> includes an internal passage <b>704</b> that is sized to receive a shaft <b>705</b> of a navigation module <b>708</b>. As with the other embodiments, the navigation module <b>708</b> includes a navigation unit <b>710</b>, this time shown as wired unit. The internal passage <b>704</b> may be formed integrally with the introducer using a conventional molding process, but it may alternatively be made separately and attached to the introducer. The internal passage <b>704</b> may be closed at the distal end, as shown, or it may be open to facilitate the evacuation of fluid or materials therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the shaft <b>706</b> of the navigation module <b>708</b> may be somewhat loosely retained in the passage <b>704</b> by forming them with close tolerances, but not so close that there is substantial friction upon insertion or removal. In this case, the navigation module <b>708</b> may be held in place manually by the user, by gravity, or simply by contact between the parts. When the most accurate computer navigation is desired, it may be recommended to the user to apply a slight retaining force to hold the navigation module <b>708</b> snugly in place in the passage <b>704</b>. Alternatively, the navigation module may be frictionally retained or locked in place by any suitable arrangement of devices. For example, plugs, threads, bayonet fittings, or seals may be provided to hold the navigation module <b>708</b> in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">One beneficial feature of this embodiment is that the navigation module <b>708</b> is offset from the centerline of the introducer <b>702</b>, and therefore interferes to a lesser degree (if at all) with the surgeon's view into the introducer. This feature makes embodiments such as this one suitable for simultaneous computer (e.g., stereotactic) and manual navigation, thus providing the benefits of both forms of navigation.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Embodiments such as this also may permit access by one or more surgical instruments without having to remove the navigation module. This may be particularly advantageous where a surgeon desires to suction fluid, or to cauterize, cut or remove tissue, during the insertion process or at any other time before the introducer is removed from the retractor. Of course, as with other embodiments described herein, the navigation module may be removed at any time to permit operations through the introducer (or to further enhance the user's view), and then replaced if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">It will be appreciated that the passage <b>704</b> that holds the navigation module <b>708</b> may be moved to other locations and formed in any suitable way. For example, the passage <b>704</b> may be moved to the side of the introducer <b>702</b> that is opposite the handle <b>720</b> on the retractor <b>700</b>, or at other locations around the introducer <b>702</b>. The passage <b>704</b> also may be formed in the wall of the retractor <b>700</b> instead of the introducer <b>702</b>. These and other variations will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The foregoing exemplary embodiments have generally illustrated a navigation module that is retained in the introducer either loosely or by friction fitment between parts. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an example of an embodiment in which a navigation module <b>900</b> is connected to an introducer <b>902</b> (which is received in a retractor <b>904</b>) by a mechanical lock <b>906</b>. The lock <b>906</b> comprises an arm <b>908</b> having two resilient tabs <b>910</b>. The tabs <b>910</b> each have a protrusion <b>912</b> that fits into a corresponding detent <b>914</b> on the inner wall of the introducer <b>902</b>. The arm <b>906</b> rests on top of a shelf <b>916</b> provided on the shaft <b>918</b> of the navigation module <b>900</b>. The shelf <b>916</b>, arm <b>906</b> and shaft <b>918</b> are positioned to hold the tip of the shaft <b>918</b> (not shown) in proper registration with the tip of the introducer <b>902</b> (not shown). When the lock <b>906</b> is engaged over the shelf <b>906</b>, the shaft <b>918</b> is fully inserted into the introducer <b>902</b>, and a navigation unit <b>920</b> at the proximal end of the shaft <b>918</b> is properly positioned to navigate. The lock <b>906</b> may be released by squeezing the tabs <b>910</b> together to disengage the protrusions <b>912</b> from the detents <b>914</b>. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that any other suitable mechanical lock may be used to hold a navigation module in place in an introducer and/or retractor.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">It will be appreciated that other mechanisms or parts may be used to hold a navigation module to an introducer/retractor system. For example, the mechanical lock shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> may be replaced by a different kind of latch system. As another example, the system of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> may be modified by removing the o-rings <b>608</b>, and adding an expanding grip that a surgeon can selectively extend radially from the navigation module shaft <b>606</b> to grip the inner walls of the introducer <b>602</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Another exemplary embodiment is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, an introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b> (which may be held together as a unit by a lock <b>1002</b>), is connected to a manipulation arm <b>1004</b>. The arm <b>1004</b> includes a clamp <b>1006</b> that is tightened onto the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b> by turning a knob <b>1008</b> that closes the clamp <b>1006</b>. Any suitable clamping system may be used for this application. Also, while the shown embodiment shows the clamp <b>1006</b> engaged to a handle <b>1010</b> that extends from the retractor portion of the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b>, the clamp <b>1006</b> can engage any other suitable part of the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b>. A navigation unit <b>1012</b> is connected to the manipulation arm <b>1004</b>, where it can be used to computer navigate the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b>. The navigation unit <b>1012</b> preferably is mounted at a location where it does not interfere with visualization into the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b>, thereby providing the benefits as described above with respect to the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. It also is preferred for the navigation unit <b>1012</b> to be mounted where it can properly work with the rest of the navigation system, such a by being mounted on the top of the arm <b>1004</b>, or being elevated on a short post. The navigation unit <b>1012</b> may be removable or movable to facilitate manipulation of the arm <b>1004</b> and viewing through the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A further embodiment of a manipulator arm is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 11-14</figref>. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows a manipulator arm <b>1100</b> that is connected to an elongated elliptical retractor <b>1102</b>. The retractor <b>1102</b> may be constructed as shown in Mangiardi or have other shapes or features. The arm <b>1100</b> comprises a first clamp member <b>1104</b> and a second clamp member <b>1106</b>. The first clamp member <b>1104</b> has an upper clamp <b>1108</b> that fits over a handle <b>1110</b> that extends from the retractor <b>1102</b>. The second clamp member <b>1106</b> has a lower clamp <b>1112</b> that fits below the retractor handle <b>1110</b>. The handle <b>1110</b> is held between the upper clamp <b>1108</b> and lower clamp <b>1112</b>, and may be retained by a compressive force generated by the clamps <b>1108</b>, <b>1112</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The handle <b>1110</b> and clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> may include features to help engage them and hold them together. For example, the upper clamp <b>1108</b> may include a recess such as groove <b>1114</b> that is shaped to receive a corresponding protrusion such as ridge <b>1116</b> on the handle <b>1110</b>. The groove <b>1114</b> and ridge <b>1116</b> may be straight, but may include a bent portion <b>1118</b> (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>) that ensures that the handle <b>1110</b> is positioned at a precise location along the groove <b>1114</b>. The lower surface of the upper clamp <b>1108</b> also may have an indentation <b>1119</b> (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>) with sidewalls <b>1121</b> that hold the handle <b>1110</b> against rotation. The bent portion <b>1118</b> of the groove <b>1114</b> and the indentation <b>1119</b> and sidewalls <b>1121</b> are examples of registration features that hold the retractor <b>1102</b> at a fixed location and orientation with respect to the arm <b>1100</b>. It will be appreciated that in other embodiments the shown registration features may be moved to other locations, transposed, replaced with recesses and grooves having different shapes, or even omitted. For example the groove <b>1114</b> may be formed on the handle <b>1110</b>, and the ridge formed on the lower clamp <b>1108</b>. In alternative embodiments, the foregoing registration features may be replaced by any arrangement of parts that are shaped to align the retractor <b>1102</b> at a particular location and/or orientation with respect to the arm <b>1100</b>, however, it is not strictly necessary for there to be registration features in all embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> may be slidable with respect to one another to selectively grip and release the retractor handle <b>1110</b>. For example, in the shown embodiment, the first clamp member <b>1104</b> includes a flat, straight slide portion <b>1120</b> (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>), and the second clamp member <b>1106</b> is slidably mounted on the first clamp member <b>1104</b> by providing the second clamp member <b>1106</b> with a pair of rails <b>1122</b> (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>) that wrap around the slide portion <b>1120</b>. Each rail <b>1122</b> includes one or more inwardly-extending tabs <b>1124</b> that are positioned below the slide portion <b>1120</b> to capture the slide portion <b>1120</b> in place between the rails <b>1122</b>. If desired, the slide portion <b>1120</b> may include one or more cutouts <b>1126</b> that are large enough to permit the tabs <b>1124</b> to pass through. When it is desired to disengage the first clamp member <b>1104</b> from the second clamp member <b>1106</b> (such as for cleaning), the second clamp member <b>1106</b> may be slid backwards towards the proximal end of the first clamp member <b>1104</b> until the tabs <b>1124</b> align with the cutouts <b>1126</b>. At this point, the second clamp member can be lifted vertically off of the first clamp member <b>1106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> may be interleaved. For example, the first clamp member <b>1104</b> may have an open channel <b>1128</b> that receives a narrow portion <b>1130</b> of the second clamp member <b>1106</b>. The two parts can be removed by rotating them relative to one another, but in normal use they cannot disengage. This construction is expected to make the arm <b>1100</b> relatively compact in the lateral direction, promote part strength, and promote the even application of force across the width of the upper clamp <b>1108</b> and lower clamp <b>1112</b>. The open channel <b>1128</b> and narrow portion <b>1130</b> may be shaped to permit movement between an engaged position (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>) and an open position (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>), and may permit further travel to a release position at which point the tabs <b>1124</b> align with the cutouts <b>1126</b> to allow the clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> to be disassembled.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the arm <b>1100</b> showing the clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> in the open position, and illustrating the general relationship between the parts. As noted above, the arm <b>1100</b> may apply a gripping force to hold the retractor <b>1102</b>. This may be accomplished, for example, by making the vertical clearance between the bottom of the upper clamp <b>1108</b> and the top of the lower clamp <b>1112</b> less than the vertical height of the handle <b>1110</b>. Thus, the act of sliding the lower clamp <b>1112</b> forward forces the upper clamp <b>1108</b> and lower clamp <b>1112</b> apart and generates a restoring force that compresses against and grips the handle <b>1110</b>. To facilitate engagement of the clamps, one or both of the clamps <b>1108</b><b>1112</b> may include a tapered surface <b>1132</b> that slides along the handle <b>1110</b> like a wedge to slowly increase the restoring force applied to the handle.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Also, as shown by one example in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, the arm <b>1100</b> may include a position lock <b>1134</b> that selectively holds the first and second clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> at particular locations with respect to one another. In this example, the position lock <b>134</b> comprises a button <b>1136</b> (also shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>) that extends through a corresponding countersunk hole <b>1138</b> (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>) through the second clamp member <b>1106</b>. The countersunk hole <b>1138</b> has a larger bore adjacent the top surface of the second clamp member <b>1106</b>, and smaller bore adjacent the lower surface, and is sized so that the button can slide within the larger bore, but can not pass through the smaller bore. The button <b>1136</b> has a threaded bore, and a locking pin <b>1140</b> extends up through the smaller portion of the countersunk hole <b>1138</b> and into the threaded bore. The locking pin <b>1140</b> has a head located below the lower surfaced of the second clamp member <b>1106</b>. When the locking pin <b>1140</b> is threaded into the bore, the pin <b>1140</b> and button <b>1136</b> are captured on the second clamp member <b>1106</b>. A spring <b>1142</b> is provided in the countersunk hole <b>1138</b> to bias the button <b>1136</b> and pin <b>1140</b> upwards.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">When the first and second clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> are connected to one another, the head of the locking pin <b>1140</b> may be positioned within one of multiple recesses in a channel <b>1144</b> formed in the first clamp member <b>1104</b>. The channel <b>1144</b> may include a first recess <b>1146</b> located where the head of the locking pin <b>1144</b> rests when the arm <b>1100</b> is in the clamped position (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>), and a second recess <b>1148</b> where the head of the locking pin <b>1144</b> rests when the arm <b>1100</b> is in the open position (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>). The channel <b>1144</b> also may include a third recess <b>1150</b> where the head of the locking pin <b>1140</b> can rest when the first and second clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> are slid into a release position to disengage them from one another (e.g., when the tabs <b>1124</b> are aligned with the cutouts <b>1126</b>). The channel <b>1144</b> itself is narrower than the recesses, but wide enough that the locking pin <b>1140</b> can slide along it when it is depressed by pushing down on the button <b>1136</b>. While this arrangement may be preferred in some embodiments, it is not strictly required in all. Other slide locks or locking mechanisms may be used in other embodiments, if a lock is desired. Where no lock is desired, the first and second clamp members <b>1104</b>, <b>1106</b> may simply be retained by the surgeon's hand or friction.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Referring still to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, a navigation unit <b>1152</b> may be mounted on the manipulation arm <b>1100</b>, much like the arm shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. In this embodiment, it may be useful to locate the navigation unit <b>1152</b> remotely from the retractor <b>1102</b>, to permit a surgeon to grip the arm <b>1100</b> between the navigation unit <b>1152</b> and the retractor <b>1102</b>. This location may provide enhanced feel and control during insertion and manipulation, and may inhibit the surgeon's view even less than the embodiments shown previously herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">
        <figref>FIG. 15</figref> shows a variation on the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 11-14</figref>. In this embodiment, the lower clamp <b>1112</b> is provided with side walls <b>1500</b> that fit around either side of the upper clamp <b>1108</b>. The sidewalls <b>1500</b> prevent or inhibit relative movement in the lateral direction between the lower clamp <b>1112</b> and the upper clamp <b>1108</b>, which enhances the stability and strength of the system. In alternative embodiments, the sidewalls could be placed on the upper clamp <b>1108</b> to surround the sides of the lower clamp <b>1112</b>, or replaced by a guide pin or rail located elsewhere (e.g., a guide rail along the centerline of the parts). Other variations will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">
        <figref>FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show isometric and partially cutaway side views, respectively, of another embodiment of a manipulation arm <b>1600</b>. The embodiment is shown in use with an interleaved introducer <b>1602</b> and retractor <b>1604</b>, which may be temporarily connected to one another to form a combined introducer/retractor system. The exemplary introducer <b>1602</b> is shown with a navigation module <b>1604</b> mounted to it, but this is not required. As with prior embodiments, the manipulation arm <b>1600</b> may be provided with a navigation unit that is connected to the arm <b>1600</b> itself, and need not be used with navigation system at all (i.e., it may be used solely for visual or manual navigation. The manipulation arm <b>1600</b> also may be adapted for use with retractors having different shapes and sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The manipulation arm <b>1600</b> includes a handle <b>1606</b> and a retractor mount <b>1608</b> that may be connected by universal joint, such as a spherical ball joint <b>1610</b>. The ball joint <b>1610</b> permits the retractor mount <b>1608</b> to pivot relative to the handle <b>1606</b> around one or more axes (three axes or movement capability are provided in the shown embodiment). Any suitable universal or ball joint construction may be used. For example, the ball joint <b>1610</b> may comprise a generally spherical ball <b>1612</b> that fits in a housing <b>1614</b> having a corresponding spherical interior space. The housing <b>1614</b> has an opening through which a handle connector <b>1616</b> extends to rigidly join the handle <b>1606</b> to the ball <b>1612</b>. The shape and size of the opening and the handle connector <b>1616</b> may generally dictate the range of movement of the ball <b>1612</b> within the housing <b>1614</b>. The housing <b>1614</b> itself may be formed by two halves that are held together to capture the ball <b>1612</b> in place, or it may have sufficient flexibility to allow the ball <b>1612</b> to be snapped into the spherical interior space. A lining, such as a low-friction polytetrafluoroethylene (e.g. Teflonâ¢) material, may be provided in the spherical interior space, to hold the ball <b>1612</b> firmly. If desired, a clamp (not shown) may be provided to control the friction between the ball <b>1612</b> and the housing <b>1614</b> or to lock the two together. A clamp may include, for example, a simple threaded screw that threads into the housing <b>1614</b> at a location where the screw can be tightened to press the ball <b>1612</b> into place within the housing <b>1614</b>, or a clamp similar to the rotation lock discussed below.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The manipulation arm <b>1600</b> also may include a rotating ring mount <b>1618</b>. The ring mount <b>1618</b> includes an inner ring <b>1620</b> and an outer ring <b>1622</b> that are nested together, with the inner ring <b>1620</b> captured in place within a track <b>1624</b> on the inner surface of the outer ring <b>1622</b>. The track <b>1624</b> holds the inner ring <b>1620</b> in the same plane as the outer ring <b>1622</b>, but permits the inner ring <b>1620</b> to rotate within the plane as the outer ring <b>1622</b>. A low-friction liner material may be used to facilitate smooth movement between the inner and outer rings <b>1620</b>, <b>1622</b>. The inner ring <b>1620</b> includes a through-hole <b>1626</b> that is shaped to receive the retractor <b>1604</b> portion of the introducer/retractor system. The through-hole <b>1626</b> may be shaped to conform to the outer wall of the retractor <b>1604</b>, and may be formed of a high-friction material to help grip and hold the retractor <b>1604</b>. If desired, a rotation lock <b>1628</b> may be provided to increase friction between the inner and outer rings <b>1620</b>, <b>1622</b>, or stop relative rotation entirely. For example, the rotation lock <b>1628</b> may comprise a threaded screw that can be tightened to open or close a channel <b>1630</b> formed in the outer ring <b>1622</b>, thereby increasing or decreasing the tolerance between the outer ring <b>1622</b> and the inner ring <b>1620</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">From the foregoing, it will be seen that the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> provides two unique benefits. First, the universal joint permits the handle to be oriented at various angles relative to the retractor mount, and therefore at various angles to the introducer/retractor system. This allows use where clearance may be an issue, allows the surgeon to hold the device more comfortably, and permits connection to a mounting clamp at different angles. Where a navigation unit is provided on the handle, this flexibility also may permit the handle to be repositioned to receive a navigation signal (although movement mid-surgery may require recalibration of the navigation unit to continue tracking the relevant parts of the introducer/retractor system). The rotating ring mount also enhances the flexibility of the device, by letting the surgeon rotate the introducer/retractor system with one hand, while it is simultaneously being held by the handle. This arrangement is particularly helpful where the surgeon is holding the handle (as opposed to it being mounted by a fixed a clamp), and where the introducer/retractor system is oval instead of round. For oval retractors, rotation may give enhanced 360Â° viewing and possibly other benefits.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As noted above, any number of navigation systems may be used with embodiments of the invention. Such devices typically operate by associating a navigation unit with a point in space (the ânavigation pointâ). In more sophisticated systems, the navigation unit may be associated with a multitude of points or geometric shapes. For example, a stylet-type navigation module may associate a navigation unit (such as a series of reflective balls) at one end of the stylet with a single navigation point at the other end of the stylet, and it may further associated the navigation unit with the full shape of the stylet. When the computer detects the location and orientation of the navigation unit, it can calculate the location of the navigation point, or even the entire stylet. In the foregoing embodiments, it may be necessary to program the computer navigation system to associate the navigation unit with a navigation point or points on the introducer and/or retractor, or with some other point as desired. For example, in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the navigation module <b>708</b> may be pre-programmed to associate the location of the navigation unit <b>710</b> with the location of the tip <b>714</b> of the shaft <b>706</b>. In this case, it may be necessary or desirable to reprogram this particular navigation module <b>708</b> to associate the location of the navigation unit <b>710</b> with the location of the tip <b>716</b> of the introducer or with other points. If that is the case, then it may be further necessary to prevent the navigation module <b>708</b> from rotating relative to the introducer <b>702</b>, as such rotation might move the location of the virtual navigation point, for example, rotating the navigation module 180 degrees might relocate the associated navigation point to a location <b>718</b> that is offset 180 degrees about the axis of the shaft <b>706</b> from the tip <b>716</b> of the introducer <b>702</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Such concerns may not be present in devices such as the one shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 through 6</figref> and <b>9</b>, because the tip of the introducer in each of those embodiments is located along the axis of the navigation module. In those cases, however, it may still be necessary or desirable to reprogram the navigation module to account for any difference in distance from the tip of the introducer to the tip of the navigation module. To even further reduce the need to reprogram a pre-existing navigation module such as a navigation stylet, the introducer may be shaped to receive the tip of the navigation stylet at the distal end or tip opening of the introducer, so that no reprogramming is required. For example, the tip opening may have a conical shape to receive a conical navigation stylet tip.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The foregoing considerations generally relate to navigation modules that have a pre-programmed virtual association point. Some navigation units, such as the unit shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, may not be pre-programmed. Such units may be affixed to the introducer/retractor and programmed on a case-by-case basis with any necessary offset to locate the desired navigation point or points with the orientation and location of the navigation unit. Such programming may be accomplished, for example, by attaching the introducer/retractor system <b>1000</b> and navigation unit <b>1012</b> to the manipulation arm <b>1004</b>, locating the tip of the introducer at a known location, and registering the position of the navigation unit <b>1012</b> while the introducer is so positioned, to thereby associate the location of the navigation unit <b>1012</b> with that known location. Thereafter, wherever the assembly is moved, the navigation system will register the location of the navigation unit <b>1012</b> with the position of the tip of the introducer (assuming the parts are not moved relative to one another). Also, while the foregoing examples may use the tip of the introducer as a navigation point, this is not necessary in all cases.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">It is also noted that various foregoing embodiments are shown being used in relation with an introducer portion of a combined nested introducer/retractor system. However, the inventors further envision that a navigation module such as described above could be adapted to fit into a retractor that does not have an introducer. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> provides one such example. This arrangement may be useful to continue to navigate a retractor after it has been inserted into the patient and the introducer has been removed. Such an embodiment also may be useful to monitor the location of navigation points on the retractor to track any movement that might occur during the course of an operation. A navigation system may be programmed to raise an alarm if the retractor moves by an excessive amount or towards a predetermined prohibited location.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">It is also envisioned that a navigation system may be programmed to associate with two different points, such as the distal tip of the introducer and the distal end of the retractor. During introduction, the navigation system can correlate the position of the navigation unit with the tip of the introducer. Once the introducer is removed, the navigation system can then be switched to correlate the position of the navigation unit with the distal end of the retractor. Other associations may also be used, as will be appreciated to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">It is also envisioned that the navigation module in the foregoing embodiments or other embodiments may, itself, be used as a handle to physically manipulate the introducer/retractor system. For example, the navigation module shaft <b>606</b> in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> may include a manipulation arm that connects directly to the shaft. In such a case, the navigation module should be fastened to the introducer or retractor with sufficient retention force to ensure reliable movement together as a unit under the forces being applied to the navigation module. If the retaining force generated by the o-rings in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, for example, is not sufficient, a supplemental lock may be provided to hold the navigation module to the introducer or retractor. For example, the top of the shaft <b>606</b> may be connected to the top of the introducer <b>602</b> by threads or other mechanisms to enhance the connection between the parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In all of the foregoing embodiments, the navigation module, manipulation arm, tip closure member or other features may be made of materials that can either be disposed of after surgery, or reconditioned for later use. For example stainless steel or other materials that can be sterilized (such as by treatment in an autoclave) may be used to form the shaft of a navigation stylet, or to form the manipulation arms shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. While some parts may be reusable, others may be replaceable. For example, the shaft in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> may be provided as a reusable material, and the o-ring seals can be easily removed and replaced if they become worn out or cannot be sterilized. Alternatively, the shaft in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> may be disposable, but a cost savings may be realized by making the navigation unit removable from the shaft and reusable.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The embodiments described herein may be used in any suitable way to provide the surgeon with computer-assisted navigation or positional feedback. These embodiments can provide a particular advantage by connecting a navigation system to a delicate tissue (e.g., brain) retractor that gently separates and retracts tissue during installation of the retractor while at the same time converting the retractor into a pointer for a frameless or computer-based navigation system. For example, a navigation system such as described previously herein may be affixed to a combined introducer/retractor system before surgery commences, programmed to track one or more navigation points, and then inserted into the patient using stereotactic or other computer-based navigation. During such use, the navigation module may be periodically removed to provide visual access through the introducer and then replaced if desired. Visual access may be possible even with the navigation module in place, although even in those cases it still may be desirable to remove the navigation module to provide greater visual access or access for surgical instruments. When the introducer and retractor are positioned at the surgery site, the navigation may be removed in some embodiments for the remainder of the surgery, or it may be replaced (either with or without the introducer) periodically to adjustment the location of the retractor using computer guidance. The navigation module may alternatively remain connected to the retractor at all times. The details of these and other methods will be readily apparent to persons of ordinary skill in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">An example of a surgical procedure using the foregoing embodiments may include a combination of some or all of a number of steps, which may be reordered or repeated as circumstances warrant or by preference of the surgical team or surgeon. A typical surgical process may begin by analyzing (e.g., by CAT scan or MRI) a patient's physiology to locate, as precisely as possible, a lesion within the brain tissue or other part of the body. Once the lesion's location is identified, the surgeon plans the surgical path to the lesion. The surgical path may be conventional, or may take into consideration the unique properties of a retractor system such as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> to access surgical sites that might not otherwise be operable. Once pre-surgical planning is complete, the patient is prepared for surgery, an introducer/retractor assembly is equipped with a navigation system, and the navigation system is programmed to associate with one or more points on an introducer/retractor assembly. In a typical brain surgery, the skull is resected to reveal a portion of the dura, which is cut by a minimal incision size to accommodate the introducer and retractor. The arachnoid, pia mater, grey matter and white matter also may be cut to provide access for the introducer/retractor system, but some of all of these steps may not be necessary in all cases. The introducer/retractor system is then inserted into the brain through the cut in the dura, and advanced forward, using the navigation system to monitor and help make corrections to the path of the introducer/retractor system. As the introducer/retractor system is advanced, the navigation module may be removed periodically to permit visual inspection of the brain tissue through the transparent walls (if provided) of the introducer and/or retractor, to permit suctioning of fluid, to relieve pressure, or to permit further incisions through a small opening (if provided) at the tip of the introducer. The navigation module may then be reinserted into the introducer/retractor, and the assembly advanced further into the brain. (Of course, tissue other than the brain may be the subject of the surgical procedure.) The surgeon may also reposition or further advance the assembly with the navigation module removed. Once the introducer/retractor system is positioned at the approximate location of the lesion, the navigation module may be removed to permit final positioning of the system (if necessary), and the introducer may be removed to provide access to the lesion. Surgical procedures may then be performed through the introducer, as indicated for the particular lesion and patient conditions.</p>
