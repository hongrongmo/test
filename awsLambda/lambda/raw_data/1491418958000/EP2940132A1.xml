    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Obesity causes excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and increases risk of various health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and depression (see Non-Patent Literature 1). These problems lead tremendous economic and social loss in modern society. Molecular mechanisms of adipocyte metabolism are extensively studied (see Non-Patent Literatures 2 and 3).</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Synoviolin is a protein discovered as a membrane protein overexpressed in rheumatoid patient-derived synovial cells (see Patent Document 1). Studies using genetically modified animals have revealed that synoviolin is an essential molecule for the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Synoviolin has been suggested to have a RING finger motif based on analyses using a protein structure prediction system. This motif is found in large numbers in an enzyme known as E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays an important role in protein ubiquitination. Synoviolin has been demonstrated to have self-ubiquitination activity, which is a characteristic of E3 ubiquitin ligase (see</p>

    <heading id="h-00007-en">
      <b>Technical Problem</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A development of a screening method for a substance or a candidate compound thereof having an obesity preventive or therapeutic action is sought.</p>
    <heading id="h-00008-en">
      <b>Solution to Problem</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Inventors of the present invention obtained an example-based knowledge that destruction of synoviolin gene causes reduction of body weight of a target and inhibition of differentiation induction of adipocytes, by using synoviolin gene conditional knockout mice. The inventors of the present invention found that compounds having regulating actions of a differentiation induction of adipocytes, an amount of adipose tissues, and body weight can be screened by screening compounds that inhibit synoviolin activity. The present invention has been completed by these findings.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The first aspect of the present invention relates to a screening method for a substance having an anti-obesity action. The method includes a step for contacting a test substance and a synoviolin-gene-expressing cell, and a step for verifying an effect of the test substance on a synoviolin gene expression or on a synoviolin protein activity. Examples of the effect on the synoviolin gene expression include an effect on a synoviolin mRNA level or an effect on a self-ubiquitination of synoviolin protein. The screening method for a substance having an anti-obesity action is a method for searching a candidate substance having the anti-obesity action.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the first aspect, the anti-obesity action is an action of reducing an amount of adipose tissues, or an action of inhibiting a differentiation induction of adipocytes. Namely, according to this embodiment, a compound having the action of reducing the amount of adipose tissues or the action of inhibiting the differentiation induction of adipocytes can be screened.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The second aspect of the present invention relates to an anti-obesity drug. The anti-obesity drug contains an siRNA of synoviolin, a decoy nucleic acid of synoviolin, or an antisense nucleic acid of synoviolin, as an active ingredient thereof. The anti-obesity drug has, for example, an action of reducing an amount of adipose tissues, or an action of inhibiting a differentiation induction of adipocytes.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">An embodiment of the second aspect of the present invention contains an siRNA of synoviolin as an active ingredient. An example of synoviolin siRNA is a RNA having one base sequence selected from the following SEQ ID Nos. 2 to 6, complemental base sequences thereof, or a base sequence obtained by replacing, inserting, deleting, or adding one base or two bases with respect to one of these base sequences. The RNA having base sequences represented by the SEQ ID Nos. 2 to 4 are known as synoviolin siRNA as disclosed in <nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="s"><text>Izumi T, et al., Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60(1); 63-72.</text></nplcit>, <nplcit id="ncit-00005" npl-type="s"><text>EMBO, Yamasaki S, et al., EMBO J. 2007; 26(1): 113-22</text></nplcit>. by using experiments.

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The first aspect of the present invention relates to a screening method for a substance having an anti-obesity action. The method includes a step for contacting a test substance and a synoviolin-gene-expressing cell; and a step for verifying the effect of the test substance on the synoviolin gene expression, or the effect thereof on synoviolin protein activity. The screening method for a substance having an anti-obesity action is a method for searching a candidate for the substance having an anti-obesity action.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">One of anti-obesity activities is a weight-regulating action. The weight-regulating action refers to an action that causes a change in body weight by a significant difference before and after treatment. Weight-regulating action acts through, for example, regulation of the amount of adipose tissue or regulation of the induction of adipocyte differentiation.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The accession number of human synoviolin gene in the public gene database Genbank is AB024690 (SEQ ID NO: 1).</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding human synoviolin is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Moreover, proteins other than the protein encoded by this nucleotide sequence, that are highly homologous to the sequence (normally, 70% or more; preferably 80% or more; more preferably 90% or more; and most preferably 95% or more) and have functions of the synoviolin protein, are included in the synoviolin of the present invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The term "synoviolin gene" as used herein includes, for example, endogenous genes of other organisms that correspond to a DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (such as that of homologs of the human synoviolin gene).</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Moreover, the endogenous DNA of other organisms that corresponds to DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is generally highly homologous to the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1. The term "highly homologous" means a homology of 50% or more, preferably 70% or more, more preferably 80% or more, and yet more preferably 90% or more (for example, 95% or more, and further, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% or more). This homology can be determined using the mBLAST algorithm (<nplcit id="ncit-00007" npl-type="s"><text>Altschul et al., 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2264-8</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00008" npl-type="s"><text>Karlin and Altschul, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-7</text></nplcit>). Moreover, if the DNA is isolated from an organism, it is considered to hybridize with the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 1 under stringent conditions. Here, examples of the "stringent conditions" include "2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 50Â°C", "2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 42Â°C", and "1ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 37Â°C". Examples of more stringent conditions include "2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 65Â°C", "0.5ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 42Â°C", and "0.2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS, 65Â°C". Those skilled in the art are capable of appropriately obtaining endogenous genes of other organisms that correspond to the synoviolin gene, based on the nucleotide sequence of the synoviolin gene. In the present specification, proteins (genes) corresponding to synoviolin proteins (genes) in organisms other than humans, or proteins (genes) functionally equivalent to the synoviolin described above, may be simply referred to as "synoviolin protein (gene)".</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The "synoviolin protein" of the present invention can be prepared as a natural protein or as a recombinant protein using gene recombination techniques. Natural proteins can be prepared, for example, by a method using affinity chromatography, which employs antibodies against synoviolin protein, from cell (tissue) extracts considered to express the synoviolin protein. In addition, recombinant proteins can be prepared by culturing cells transfected by a DNA encoding the synoviolin protein. The "synoviolin protein" of the present invention is suitably used in, for example, the screening methods described below.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In the present invention, the term "expression" includes "transcription" from genes, "translation" into polypeptides, and the "inhibition of degradation" of proteins. The "expression of synoviolin protein" means the occurrence of the transcription and translation of a gene encoding the synoviolin protein, or the production of the synoviolin protein by such transcription and translation.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The various functions mentioned above can be appropriately evaluated (measured), using general techniques, by those skilled in the art. Specifically, the methods described in the Examples below, or such methods suitably modified, can be performed.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029"> Accordingly, the term "inhibiting the expression and/or function of synoviolin protein" refers to lowering or eliminating the quantity, function, or activity of a synoviolin gene or protein as compared with the quantity, function, or activity of the wild-type synoviolin gene or protein. The term "inhibition" includes the inhibition of either or both of function and expression.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Specifically, ubiquitination means a process for the formation of a polyubiquitin chain via repeated cascade of reactions with enzymes such as ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3), by which ubiquitin molecules are conjugated in a branched form to a substrate protein. The polyubiquitin chain is formed via an Îµ-amino group at Lys48 in ubiquitin molecules, and then becomes a degradation signal for the 26S proteasome, leading to the degradation of target proteins.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">To confirm influences on synoviolin gene expression or synoviolin protein activity by test substances, such a method as disclosed in <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="WO2006137514A"><text>WO 2006-137514</text></patcit> can be used.</p>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">Influences of test substances on synoviolin gene expression</heading>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A test compound is contacted with cells expressing the synoviolin gene. The "cells" to be used include those derived from a human, mouse, rat, or the like. Microbial cells such as E. coli and yeast, transformed to express synoviolin, can also be used. The "cells expressing the synoviolin gene" may be either cells expressing an endogenous synoviolin gene, or cells expressing a foreign synoviolin gene introduced into the cells. Typically, the cells expressing a foreign synoviolin gene can be produced by introducing an expression vector having the synoviolin gene inserted therein into a host cell. The expression vector can be produced with common genetic engineering techniques.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The test compound to be used in the present method is not specifically limited, but includes, for example, single compounds such as natural compounds, organic compounds, inorganic compounds, proteins, and peptides, as well as compound libraries, expression products from gene libraries, cell extracts, cell culture supernatants, microbial fermentation products, marine organism extracts, plant extracts, and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The "contact" of the test compound with the cell expressing the synoviolin gene is normally performed by adding the test compound to a culture fluid containing cells expressing the synoviolin gene, although it is not limited to this method. If the test compound is a protein or the like, the "contact" can be performed by introducing a DNA vector expressing the protein into the cell.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the present method, the synoviolin gene expression level is then measured. Herein, the term "gene expression" includes both gene transcription and translation. The gene expression level can be measured with methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">For example, the gene transcription level can be measured by extracting mRNA from cells expressing the synoviolin gene according to a usual method, and performing Northern hybridization, RT-PCR, a DNA assay method, and the like, using the mRNA as a template. Moreover, the gene translation level can be measured by collecting a protein fraction from cells expressing the synoviolin gene, and by then detecting synoviolin protein expression using electrophoretic methods such as SDS-PAGE. Furthermore, the gene translation level can also be measured by performing Western blotting using an antibody against the synoviolin protein to detect protein expression. The antibody used for detecting the synoviolin protein is not specifically limited as long as the antibody can detect the protein, and, for example, both monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies can be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the present method, compounds that lower synoviolin expression level as compared to the situation where the test compound is not contacted (control) are selected. The compounds lowering the expression level of synoviolin serve as drugs for anti-obesity.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Furthermore, compounds lowering (suppressing) synoviolin protein activity as compared to the situation where the test compound is not contacted (control) are selected. The compounds lowering (suppressing) the synoviolin protein activity serve as drugs for treating cancer. Influences on synoviolin protein activity include influence on self-ubiquitination of synoviolin protein.</p>
    <heading id="h-00013-en">Influence on self-ubiquitination of synoviolin protein</heading>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="JP2008074753A"><text>2008-74753</text></patcit> (Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit-00005" dnum="JP5008932B"><text>5008932</text></patcit>) discloses that plumbagin (2-methyl-5-hydroxy-1, 4-naphthoquinone) and quercetin (2-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,5,7-trihydroxy-4H-1-benzopyrano-4-on) inhibit self-ubiquitination of synoviolin protein. The self-ubiquitination of synoviolin means ubiquitination of protein caused by synoviolin-synoviolin interactions as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00006" dnum="JP2008074753A"><text>2008-74753</text></patcit>. The self-ubiquitination of protein occurs when synoviolin binds to protein.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040"> Influence of synoviolin protein on self-ubiquitination may be confirmed by using a method disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00007" dnum="JP2008074753A"><text>2008-74753</text></patcit> (Japanese Patent No. <patcit id="pcit-00008" dnum="JP5008932B"><text>5008932</text></patcit>). For example, test substances may be added to in vitro self-ubiquitination reaction solution of MBP-Syno ÎTM-His to react at 37Â°C for 30 minutes. After the reaction, Western blot using anti-HA antibody may be performed to detect ubiquitinated protein. MBP-Syno ÎTM-His means synoviolin in which transmembrane domain has been deleted and which has maltose-binding protein fused to N terminus side thereof and His tag fused to C terminus side thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In a preferred embodiment of the first aspect, the anti-obesity action is an action of reducing an amount of adipose tissues, or an action of inhibiting a differentiation induction of adipocytes. Namely, according to this embodiment, a compound having the action of reducing the amount of adipose tissues or the action of inhibiting the differentiation induction of adipocytes can be screened.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The second aspect of the present invention relates to an anti-obesity drug. The anti-obesity drug contains an siRNA of synoviolin, a decoy nucleic acid of synoviolin, or an antisense nucleic acid of synoviolin, as an active ingredient thereof. The anti-obesity drug has, for example, an action of reducing an amount of adipose tissues, or an action of inhibiting a differentiation induction of adipocytes.</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The second aspect of the present invention contains an siRNA of synoviolin as an active ingredient. Nucleic acids having an inhibitory action by means of the RNAi effect are generally referred to as siRNA or shRNA. RNAi is a phenomenon in which, when a short double-stranded RNA (herein abbreviated as "dsRNA") that is composed of a sense RNA comprising a sequence homologous to mRNA of the target gene, and an antisense RNA comprising the complementary sequence thereto, is introduced into a cell, the dsRNA specifically and selectively binds to target gene mRNA and induces its disruption, and efficiently inhibits (suppresses) target gene expression by cleaving the target gene. For example, when a dsRNA is introduced into a cell, the expression of a gene having a sequence homologous to the RNA is suppressed (knocked down). As RNAi is capable of suppressing target gene expression as described above, the technique is attracting attention as a simple gene knockout method replacing conventional gene disruption methods based on homologous recombination, which are complicated and inefficient, and as a method applicable to gene therapy. RNA used for RNAi is not necessarily completely identical to the synoviolin gene or to a partial region of the gene, although it is preferably completely homologous.</p>

    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The antisense nucleic acids used in the present invention may inhibit synoviolin gene expression and/or function by any of the above mechanisms. In one embodiment, an antisense sequence designed to be complementary to the untranslated region near the 5'-terminal of mRNA of the synoviolin gene is considered to be effective in inhibiting the translation of the gene. Moreover, sequences complementary to the coding region or to the untranslated region on the 3' side can also be used. Thus, nucleic acids comprising not only antisense sequences of translated regions of the synoviolin gene, but also those of untranslated regions, are included in the antisense nucleic acids used in the present invention. The antisense nucleic acid to be used is linked to the downstream region of an appropriate promoter, and preferably, a sequence containing a transcription termination signal is connected to the 3' side. A desired animal (cell) can be transformed with the nucleic acid thus prepared using known methods. The sequence of the antisense nucleic acid is preferably complementary to the endogenous-synoviolin gene of the animal (cell) to be transformed or a portion thereof, but the sequence may not be completely complementary as long as the sequence can effectively inhibit gene expression. The transcribed RNA preferably has a complementarity of 90% or more, and most preferably 95% or more, to the transcript of the target gene. In order to effectively inhibit the expression of the target gene (synoviolin) by using an antisense nucleic acid, the antisense nucleic acid is preferably at least 15 bases long but less than 25 bases long. However, antisense nucleic acids of the present invention are not necessarily limited to this length, and may be 100 bases long or longer, or 500 bases long or longer.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Moreover, ribozymes or DNAs encoding ribozymes can also be used to inhibit synoviolin gene expression. "Ribozyme" refers to an RNA molecule that has a catalytic activity. Ribozymes have various activities. Studies focusing on ribozymes as RNA cleaving enzymes have made it possible to design ribozymes that site-specifically cleave RNA. Some ribozymes such as group I intron ribozymes or the Ml RNA contained in RNase P consist of 400 nucleotides or more, whereas others, called the hammerhead or hairpin ribozymes, have activity domains of about 40 nucleotides (<nplcit id="ncit-00014" npl-type="s"><text>M. Koizumi and E. Ohtsuka, Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Kohso [Protein, Nucleic Acid, and Enzyme], 35: 2191, 1990</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">For example, the self-cleavage domain of hammerhead ribozymes cleaves the 3' side of C15 in the G13U14C15 sequence. The base pair formation between U14 and A9 is considered important for the above cleavage activity, and it has been shown that the cleavage may also occur when C15 is replaced with A15 or U15 (<nplcit id="ncit-00015" npl-type="s"><text>M. Koizumi et al., FEBS Lett. 228: 228, 1988</text></nplcit>). When ribozymes are designed to have substrate-binding sites that are complementary to RNA sequences near target sites, they can be restriction enzyme-like RNA-cleaving ribozymes that recognize the sequence of UC, UU, or UA in target RNA (<nplcit id="ncit-00016" npl-type="s"><text>Koizumi, M. et al., FEBS Lett. 239: 285, 1988</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00017" npl-type="s"><text>M.

Acids Res. 17: 7059, 1989</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Hairpin type ribozymes are also useful for the purpose of the present invention. Such a ribozyme can be found, for example, in the minus strand of the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (<nplcit id="ncit-00019" npl-type="s"><text>Buzayan, J. M., Nature, 323: 349, 1986</text></nplcit>). It has been shown that target-specific RNA-cleaving ribozymes can also be produced from hairpin type ribozymes (<nplcit id="ncit-00020" npl-type="s"><text>Kikuchi, Y. and Sasaki, N., Nucleic Acids Res. 19: 6751, 1991</text></nplcit>; <nplcit id="ncit-00021" npl-type="s"><text>Yo Kikuchi, Kagaku To Seibutsu [Chemistry and Biology] 30: 112, 1992</text></nplcit>). Thus, the expression of the synoviolin gene of the present invention can be inhibited by specifically cleaving the transcript of the gene.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The expression of endogenous genes can also be suppressed by RNA interference (hereinafter abbreviated as "RNAi") using a double-stranded RNA having the same or similar sequence to the target gene sequence.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The therapeutic agent of the present invention can be administrated orally or parenterally. Transpulmonary administration agent type (e.g. using nebulizer etc.), transnasal administration agent type, transdermal administration agent type (e.g. ointment, creams), injection type, and the like are included in parenteral administration type therapeutic agent of the present invention. The injection type therapeutic agent can be administered to the whole body or locally by intravenous injection such as dripping, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, hypodermic injection, or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Administration method is appropriately selected depending on age and symptom of a patient. Effective administration amount is 0.1 Âµg to 100 mg, preferably 1 Âµg to 10 Âµg per 1 kg body weight for one administration. However, administration amount of the above therapeutic agent is not restricted to these administration amounts. In a case that nucleic acid such as siRNA is mixed, exemplary amount of the nucleic acid is 0.01 to 10 Âµg/ml, preferably 0.1 to 1 Âµg/ml.</p>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The therapeutic agent of the present invention can be formulated in the usual manner and may contain pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or additives. Such carriers or additives include water, pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents, collagen, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxyvinyl polymer, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, sodium polyacrylate, sodium alginate, water-soluble dextran, carboxymethyl starch sodium, pectin, methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, xanthan gum, gum arabic, casein, agar, polyethylene glycol, diglycerol, glycerol, propylene glycol, vaseline, paraffin, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, human serum albumin, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, surfactant acceptable as pharmaceutical additive, and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The above additive may be selected alone or appropriately in combination from the above additives depending on the pharmaceutical form of the therapeutic agent of the present invention. For example, in a case of being used as an injectable preparation, refined ER stress inducer may be dissolved into a solvent (e.g. saline, buffer solution, glucose solution, or the like), and Tween80, Tween20, gelatin, human serum albumin, or the like may be added to the solution. Alternatively, the therapeutic agent of the present invention may be lyophilized to have a pharmaceutical form of dissolving before use. For example, sugar alcohol or saccharide such as mannitol or glucose can be used as excipient for lyophilization.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The present invention found out that inhibiting expression or activity of synoviolin by generation of synoviolin gene knockout mice is effective for treatment of obesity. Synoviolin gene knockout mice refer to mice in which the normal expression of synoviolin has been inhibited as a result of artificially modifying the sequence of the synoviolin gene region, and as a result thereof, preventing synoviolin from functioning normally in the body.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062"> In addition, a portion or all of synoviolin gene can be modified or deleted. Here, "all" of synoviolin gene refers to a region extending from the 5' end of exon 1 to the 3' end of the final exon of synoviolin genomic DNA. In addition, a "portion" of synoviolin gene refers to a portion of this region of a length required for inhibition of normal expression of synoviolin gene. Moreover, "modified" refers to changing the base sequence of a target region of genomic DNA to another base sequence by substituting, deleting, inserting and/or translocating one or a plurality of nucleotides.</p>
    <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">A knockout animal in which a portion or all of synoviolin gene has been modified or deleted can be produced according to a known method. For example, a knockout animal can be produced using a gene targeting method as described in the following examples. In this method, by substituting a region at least containing the start codon of exon 1 of synoviolin gene with another base sequence by homologous recombination, normal expression of synoviolin can be inhibited. In addition, knockout animals used in the screening method of the present invention include not only knockout animals produced according to this method, but also progeny thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The animals targeted for use as knockout animals of the present invention are non-human animals, and there are no particular limitations thereon. Examples include mammals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats, rabbits, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice or rats. Rabbits, dogs, eats, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice or rats are preferable for use as experimental animals. In particular, rodents are more preferable, while mice and rats are particularly preferable when considering that a large number of inbred strains have been produced as well as in consideration of techniques such as culturing of fertilized eggs or in vitro fertilization.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">A portion of synoviolin gene of a target animal is isolated in order to construct a targeting vector. For example, in the case of producing a knockout mouse, a mouse genomic DNA library is screened for synoviolin gene. A targeting vector for homologous recombination is then constructed using the resulting genomic DNA clone. The genomic DNA clone is not required to be the full length of the gene. All required is cloning of a region required to suppress expression of synoviolin by disrupting synoviolin gene. In addition, the targeting vector can also be produced by a known method, and for example, can be produced by using a commercially available plasmid as a backbone and suitably linking respective fragments consisting of the aforementioned genomic DNA clone, a positive selection marker, a negative selection marker and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The targeting vector produced according to the aforementioned method is then introduced into cells having the ability to form an individual (totipotency), such as fertilized eggs, early embryos or embryonic stem cells (ES cells), by electroporation and the like, followed by selecting those cells in which the target homologous recombination has occurred. Screening is carried out by selecting cells using chemical agents according to a positive-negative selection method. Following selection, those cells in which the target homologous recombination has occurred are confirmed by southern blotting or PCR and the like. Finally, cells for which the desired homologous recombination has been confirmed are introduced into an 8-cell stage embryo or blastocyst harvested from the fallopian tube or uterus during pregnancy.</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The aforementioned 8-cell stage embryo or blastocyst is transplanted into an allomother in accordance with ordinary methods. By crossing the germ-line chimeric animals (preferably males) born from the allomother with wild-type animals (preferable females) homologous for the wild-type syvnlgene, a first generation (F1) can be obtained in the form of heterozygotes in which one of the synv1genes on a homologous chromosome has been disrupted by homologous recombination. Moreover, by crossing these heterozygotes, a second generation (F2) can be obtained in the form of homozygotes in which both syvn1 genes on homologous chromosomes have been disrupted, namely the synv1 knockout animals of the present invention. Homozygotes are identified by severing a portion of the body (such as the tail), extracting DNA and determining genotype by southern blotting or PCR and the like.</p>

    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The aforementioned targeting vector was introduced into ES cells.

Moreover, these chimeric mice were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6 mice to acquire mice in which the neomycin sequence had been removed.
