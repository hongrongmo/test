      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to therapeutically effective preparations of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), methods for manufacturing such preparations, methods of screening and selecting such preparations, and therapeutic uses thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">One of the major problems in stem cell therapy is the lack of understanding of the therapeutic properties of stem cells, and how these therapeutic properties are influenced by manufacturing methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Stem cells are populations of cells found in embryos, fetuses, and adult tissues that are capable of self-renewal in undifferentiated forms and regain the capability of toti-, pluri- or multi-potential differentiation in conditioned environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Use of the term âstemâ cell has generally been reserved for those cells possessing the ability to self-replicate and give rise to daughter cells which undergo a unidirectional, terminal differentiation process. Three adult tissues in which stem cells have been extensively studied include the epidermis, gastrointestinal epithelium, and the hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow. Of these, hematopoietic stem cells are perhaps the best characterized, and are noted for their ability to give rise to multiple cellular phenotypes through lineage progression of daughter progenitor cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The bone marrow stroma was originally thought to function mainly as a structural framework for the hematopoietic component of the marrow. Subsequently, it has become well established that the stroma consists of a heterogeneous population of cells, a subset of which exerts both positive and negative regulatory effects on the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the marrow through a combination of physical and chemical signals. The stroma also contains other non-hematopoietic cells termed mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), which are capable of both self-renewal and differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts and chondroblasts. The number of HSCs in bone marrow is about 10-100 times greater than that of MSCs. MSCs also give rise to a variety of mature cell types via a step-wise maturation process similar to hematopoiesis, termed mesengenesis. Functions that have been attributed to MSCs include, for example, the daily control of inflammation, immune response, hematopoiesis and organ integrity.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Despite the features ascribed to MSC populations by their in vitro differentiation capabilities, the mechanisms governing their proliferation and multi-lineage differentiation capacity have been poorly understood. At the clonal level, there is little evidence for MSC self-renewal, therefore these cells might be termed multipotent progenitor cells. One of the greatest obstacles in the study of MSC biology is the heterogeneity of studied cell populations (Baksh et al. (2004) J Cell Mol Med 8, 301-16). For example, Pittenger et al. ((1999) Science 284, 143-7) found that the majority of human bone marrow derived MSCs are not pluripotent, while Kusnestov et al., ((1997) J Bone Miner Res 12, 1335-47) showed that only 58.8% of human MSCs had in vivo osteogenic potential. Others have shown that within the adipose derived populations of MSCs, cells with multi-lineage differentiation capability co-exist with single lineage committed cells (Zuk et al. (2002) Mol Biol Cell 13, 4279-95). Others have reported pluripotent progenitor cells (Jiang et al. (2002) Nature 418, 41-9).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Ex vivo preparations of bone marrow aspirates can show a great diversity of cell types. Even when such preparations are enriched for MSCs (e.g. by adherence), there is a remarkable diversity and heterogeneity. Methods exist in the art to enrich and expand such MSC's in culture, nonetheless, heterogeneity is observed at biochemical, genetic, and phenotypic levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Even so-called âpure MSCâ preparations demonstrate heterogeneity with variation of therapeutic effect, potency, differentiation capacity, mitotic activity, and so forth. For example, MSCs are known to undergo phenotypic rearrangements during ex vivo manipulations, losing expression of some markers while acquiring new ones (Augello et al. âThe Regulation of Differentiation in Mesenchymal Stem Cellsâ HUMAN GENE THERAPY 21:1226-1238 (October 2010)). Depending on culture conditions, various MSC subsets are preferentially expanded in culture, differing, for example, in expression of surface markers and other proteins, differentiation capacity, proliferation, and morphology (Baksh et al. âAdult mesenchymal stem cells: characterization, differentiation, and application in cell and gene therapy,â J. Cell. Mol. Med. Vol 8, No 3, 2004 pp. 301-316; Bobis et al. âMesenchymal stem cells: characteristics and clinical applications,â FOLIA HISTOCHEMICA ET CYTOBIOLOGICA. Vol. 44, No. 4, 2006; pp. 215-230). Donor variability and donor tissue site also contribute to differences between preparation of cells (Zhukareva et al. âSecretion profile of human bone marrow stromal cells: donor variability and response to inflammatory stimuli,â Cytokine, 2010, Volume: 50, Issue: 3, Pages: 317-321; US 2009/0010896).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Thus, it is clear that various observations attributed to âMSCsâ by various laboratories are very likely describing different subsets of MSC populations, even when populations share certain functional properties typical of MSCs in general such as proliferative or differentiation capacity. For example, Xiao et al. describe a culture of bone marrow derived MSCs that has undergone 20 population doublings, exhibiting an antigen profile of less than 90% CD105+ cells and less than 85% CD166+ cells (Xiao et al. âClonal Characterization of Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells and Their Application for Bone Regenerationâ Int J Oral Sci, 2(3): 127-135, 2010).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Changes of MSC cultures with passage (i.e. ex vivo expansion) are also well recognized. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,359, Caplan describes that in his MSC preparations, early passaged cells (1st-2nd passages) gave more bone formation than late passaged cells (4th-6th passages).</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">This heterogeneity can be explained, in part, by the hypothesis that MSCs, with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple lineages, are only a small sub-population of the pool of MSCs and the remainder of the mixed population consists of cells at various stages of differentiation and commitment. Adding to the complexity of heterogeneity within a single MSC population is the variety of tissues from which MSC have been harvested and the variety of techniques that have been utilized in their isolation and propagation (Gronthos et al. (2001) J Cell Physiol 189, 54-63; Peister et al. (2004) Blood 103, 1662-8). Given these variabilities, populations and sub-populations of so-called MSCs have not yet been systematically compared.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">WO 2007/123363 (Choung et al.) describes an MSC preparation that appears to be enriched for CD105+ cells and CD45â cells. However, Choung et al. does not teach an MSC preparation that is pure for CD166+ cells, CD105+ cells, and CD45â cells and does not teach a clinical scale MSC preparation containing a billion MSCs. Further, Choung et al. does not provide teachings of other technical features such as TNFRI expression, immunosuppression by inhibition of IL-2RÎ± expression, resilience to cryopreservation, a capacity for adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation after passage expansion.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">US 2009/0010896 (Centeno et al.) describes a preparation of primary MSCs that are enriched for CD166+ cells, CD105+ cells, and CD45â cells. However, such a primary culture does not provide clinical scale MSC numbers in the billions. Further, like Choung et al., Centeno et al. lacks teaching of other technical features useful for therapeutic treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Choung et al. and Centeno et al. illustrate a problem facing the skilled artisan. The art is replete with reports of poorly characterized preparations based on a mixed variety of cellular phenotypes derived from a mixed variety of manufacturing techniques. While there is a tendency among some to combine teachings from such reports, such combinations can lead to false conclusions when the reports represent different MSC populations. To advance the understanding of MSC biology and therapy, it will be important to fully characterize the phenotype of MSCs in a preparation and to recognize heterogeneity where it exists.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">What is needed in the art is the ability to manufacture uniform preparations of MSCs in numbers sufficient for one or more therapeutically-effective dose, having a reproducible therapeutic action, and having a phenotype that is stable during ex vivo expansion and following cryogenic preservation. Also needed are such preparations that are isogenic, minimizing certain adverse effects associated with allogeneic transplantation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Preparations of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have now been discovered with enhanced therapeutic potential and with a structural and functional phenotype that is stable in culture. Surprisingly, MSCs in these preparations can be expanded to provide a therapeutic dose; even clinical scale preparations can now be made.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">MSCs of the present preparations can be expanded ex vivo and cryopreserved and thawed, yet maintaining a stable and uniform phenotype.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The MSCs of the present invention are non-primary MSCs, having an antigen profile comprising less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells (or less than about 0.75% CD45+), at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">MSCs of the present preparation have a phenotype characterized by one or more of the following properties: TNFR1 expression, inhibition of IL2RÎ± (e.g. in a PBMC assay), greater than 70% viability after freeze-thaw, ability to maintain phenotype following ex vivo expansion, capacity for differentiation, and isogenic (i.e., derived from a single donor).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In one embodiment, the MSC preparation has a combination of unexpected technical features, namely: a) it comprises at least about 1 billion (1Ã10<sup>9</sup>) cells; b) it has an antigen profile comprising less than about 0.75% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells; c) it comprises TNFRI in an amount of at least about 13 pg (e.g. about 13 pg to about 44 pg) of TNFRI per million cells; d) the MSCs have a capacity for adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation; e) the MSCs are resilient to cryopreservation, i.e. after a freeze-thaw cycle, at least about 70% of the MCSs are viable, as assessed by dye exclusion; f) when mixed with PBMCs at a ratio of about 5 PBMCs per MSC, the MSCs are capable of inhibiting IL2RÎ± expression by CD3/CD28-activated PBMCs cells by at least about 30%, relative to a control; g) it generally contains less than about 55 Î¼g/mL BSA and less than about 42 Î¼g/mL trypsin; h) it is substantially free of pathogens (e.g. endotoxin, bacteria, fungi, and viruses); and i) the MSCs have a normal karyotype. Surprisingly such an MSC preparation can comprise a cell number of at least about any of: 10 billion, 100 billion, 500 billion, or 1 trillion cells, even when expanded from a single bone marrow donation.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Preparations of the above embodiment can be obtained by screening preparations made by various culture techniques known in the art or made by screening preparations made by methods including one or more of the steps of ex vivo expansion taught herein. Surprisingly, however, the inventors have discovered a novel method that involves a series of steps that result in consistent MSC preparations of the present invention, as detailed herein, for example in Example 1 through Example 41. Accordingly, the invention also provides a collection of preparations with low variability between preparations.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The invention also provides a method of preparing, screening, or selecting preparations.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The invention also provides a method of treatment comprising administering MSCs from a preparation to a subject in need thereof.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As used here, the following definitions and abbreviations apply.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">âBMAâ means bone marrow aspirate.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">âClinical scaleâ as it refers to a present MSC preparation, means a preparation that contains more than one therapeutic dose. Optionally, a clinical scale preparation is derived from a single donor. For example, a clinical scale preparation of the present invention can comprise 8,000Â±10% or Â±20% doses of 125 million MSCs (or 100 million viable MSCs after a freeze-thaw cycle). Optionally, a clinical scale preparation of the present invention can comprise 10,000Â±10% or Â±20% doses of 125 million MSCs (or 100 million viable MSCs after a freeze-thaw cycle).</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">âFreeze-thaw cycleâ or âcryoprotective freeze-thaw cycleâ means cryogenic freezing followed by thawing and in vitro culturing under conditions to preserve viability, especially as taught here according to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">âTherapeutic doseâ is an amount of MSCs that, when administered to a subject in need thereof in a single administration (or optionally in fractional amounts within a given period), can result in a clinically relevant response. A clinically relevant response is any direct or indirect indicator of a positive therapeutic response (irrespective of the eventual outcome). Methods of determining therapeutic response are well known in the art. By way of example, a therapeutic dose is about 100 million MSCs or about 125 million MSCs. Other useful therapeutic doses include about 2 million MSCs per kg, about 8 million MSCs per kg, and about 2-8 million MSCs per kg, for example, as detailed in Example 42 through Example 45.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">âExemplaryâ (or âe.g.,â or âby exampleâ) means a non-limiting example.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">âIsogenicâ means that cells of a given population are autologous to each other, i.e., derived from the same donor. The term isogenic is intended to include, for example, natural variation in genetic makeup of cells derived from the same donor.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">ânÂ±x %â means a range extending from [nâ(x %*n)] to [n+(x %*n)]. Such a phrase is not intended to set forth error or precision in measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">âP<sub>n</sub>â, where ânâ is an integer, refers to the number of cells that a culture has been passage. P1 is the first passage after cells are plated from the bone marrow aspirate (primary culture).</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The present invention provides a preparation comprising a uniform population of MSC cells in sufficient numbers to have a clinically significant effect and being greatly enriched for a subset of MSCs with a remarkable therapeutic potential. Surprisingly, it has been discovered that such a preparation can be further expanded ex vivo to produce multiple therapeutic doses, even from a single donor.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Overview of MSC Preparations.</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">An MSC preparation according to the present invention is an MSC preparation that is 95% homogeneous with respect to being CD105 positive and CD166 positive and being CD45 negative. This homogeneity persists through ex vivo expansion; i.e. though multiple population doublings. An example of a useful embodiment is a preparation where the MSCs comprise less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells, and contains at least one therapeutic dose. This homogeneity persists after cryogenic storage and thawing, where the cell also generally have a viability of about 70% or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">MSC preparations of the instant invention express substantial levels of TNFR1, for example greater than 13 pg of TNFRI per million MSCs. This phenotype is stable throughout ex vivo expansion and cryogenic storage. Indeed, the expression of levels of TNFRI in the range of about 13 to about 179 pg (e.g. about 13 pg to about 44 pg) per million MSCs is associated with a desirous therapeutic potential which also persists through ex vivo expansion and cryopreservation.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Another feature of cells according to the present invention in high potency, as defined by the ability of the cells to inhibit IL-2RÎ± expression on T-cells. Typically, preparations according to the present invention can inhibit IL-2RÎ± expression by at least about 30%, alternatively at least about 35%, alternatively at least about 40%, alternatively at least about 45%, alternatively at least about 50%, alternatively at least about 55%, alternatively at least about 60.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Optionally, the preparations of MSCs of the present invention contain at least one therapeutic dose (e.g., at least about 100 million cells or about 125 million cells).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Unexpectedly, one embodiment of the present invention provides a clinical scale preparation providing multiple therapeutic doses (e.g., expanded from a single donor).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Optionally, the preparations of the present invention, including, for example, a clinical scale preparation, can be produced that have one or more additional unexpected profiles that especially suit the preparation for clinical use. For example, the preparations of the present invention may have a profile based on potency (e.g., TNFRI activity), resilience to cryopreservation (e.g., viability after a freeze thaw cycle), differentiation capacity (i.e., the ability to differentiate into cell types), retention of differentiation capacity, unexpected therapeutic utility as taught herein, or any combination of the aforementioned properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Optionally, the preparations of the present invention comprise at least 100 million cells, have an antigen profile of less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells and the cells can be expanded ex vivo from passage 2 until passage 5 while maintaining population uniformity based upon the antigen profile (i.e. less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">An MSC preparation can be in any form. In one embodiment, a preparation is provided in a single volume or aliquot (e.g., in a single container comprising the entire preparation). In another embodiment, a preparation is provided as a non-continuous preparation (e.g., the preparation is provided as a plurality of spatially separate compositions). Optionally, a non-continuous preparation is provided in a plurality of vessels, wherein each of the plurality of vessels contains a portion of the preparation. Optionally, the vessels are bags, or other useful storage containers. Optionally, the vessels are other therapeutic dosage form. Optionally, the vessels are culture vessels. Optionally, a continuous or non-continuous preparation is present in a facility, such as an MSC manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Optionally, the MSCs in the preparation are isogenic (e.g., derived from the same donor).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Optionally, the majority of MSCs in the preparation have about the same ex vivo age.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Optionally, the majority of MSCs in the preparation are of about the same generation number (i.e., they are within about 1 or about 2 or about 3 or about 4 cell doublings of each other). Optionally, the average number of cell doublings in the present preparations is about 20 to about 25 doublings. Optionally, the average number of cell doublings in the present preparations is about 9 to about 13 (e.g., about 11 or about 11.2) doublings arising from the primary culture, plus about 1, about 2, about 3, or about 4 doublings per passage (for example, about 2.5 doublings per passage) as seen in the MSC preparations set forth in Example 30 and Example 32. Exemplary average cell doublings in present preparations are any of about 13.5, about 16, about 18.5, about 21, about 23.5, about 26, about 28.5, about 31, about 33.5, and about 36 when produced by about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, and about 10 passages, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Optionally, the majority of MSCs in the preparation have about the same passage number (e.g., they are within about 1 or about 2 or about 3 or about 4 passages numbers of each other). Exemplary passage numbers in present preparations are any of about 2 to about 5, about 2 to about 6, about 2 to about 7, about 2 to about 8, about 3 to about 5, about 3 to about 6, about 3 to about 7, about 3 to about 8, about 4 to about 7, about 4 to about 8, about 4 to about 9, or less than any of about 10, about 11, or about 12.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Preparation Profiles</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Surprisingly, it has been discovered that MSCs can be cultured and expanded ex vivo to produce a preparation containing at least one therapeutic dose (or optionally, multiple therapeutic doses constituting a clinical scale preparation) with an antigen profile of less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32). Additionally, the MSC preparations having such an antigen profile can be produced that also have one or more other unexpected profiles that especially suit the preparation for clinical use For example, the preparation may exhibit unexpected potency (e.g., TNFRI concentration or activity as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), resilience to cryopreservation (e.g., viability after a freeze thaw cycle as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), differentiation capacity or retention and differentiation (e.g., the ability to differentiate into cell types as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32).</p>

In one embodiment, the invention provides a preparation, therapeutic dose, or a clinical scale preparation having a quantity of MSCs and an antigen profile set forth in Example 30 or Example 32. The antigen profile is a useful indicator of phenotypic purity. Methods for determining an antigen profile are provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or a clinical scale preparation having a TNFRI profile of greater than about 13 pg per million MSCs, or optionally about 13 pg to about 179 pg per million MSCs (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32) such as about 13 pg to about 44 pg/million MSCs. Among other qualities, a TNFRI profile is a useful indicator of potency of the preparation (e.g., capacity for immunosuppression). The potency and activity in the TNFRI profiles of the present invention are based on the relative amount of TNFRI (pg per million MSCs) in the preparation (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32). The activity of the preparation can be expressed as the percent IL-2RÎ± expression inhibition on mitogen-stimulated white blood cells (e.g., as set forth in Example 32). Methods for determining relative TNFRI amount or aggregate cellular preparation activity are provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or a clinical scale preparation having a favorable cryopreservation profile, i.e., favorable post-thaw viability. A cryopreservation profile of the present invention indicates the resilience of the cells to cryopreservation as the percentage of viable cells in the composition after a freeze thaw cycle. A cryopreservation profile indicates the percentage of cells that are viable after a freeze-thaw cycle compared to an unfrozen composition. Exemplary post-thaw viabilities of present preparations are at least about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 82%, or about 85% viable cells (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32).

Chromosomal abnormalities that can be screened optionally include numerical and structural abnormalities, such as translocations, breaks, rings, markers and double-minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or clinical scale preparation comprising MSCs with a spindle-shaped morphology or appearance (as opposed to star, flat, or round shape). Optionally, at least about any of: about 80%, about 90%, or about 95% or greater of the MSCs exhibit a spindle-shaped morphology.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or clinical scale preparation free of pathogen contaminants (e.g. fungi, viruses, mycobacteria, and other pathogenic bacteria), for example, as detailed in Example 38.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or clinical scale preparation free of abnormalities in telomerase activity. Methods of determining such are well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In one embodiment, the invention provides a therapeutic dose or clinical scale preparation wherein the cells are non-senescent. Methods of determining senescence are well known in the art, for example as described by Wagner et al. (Wagner et al., âReplicative Senescence of Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Continuous and Organized Processâ, PLoS ONE. 2008; 3(5): e2213; Wagner et al. âHow to track cellular aging of mesenchymal stromal cells?,â Aging (Albany N.Y.). 2010 April; 2(4): 224-230). Optionally, non-senescent MSCs do not have elevated levels of senescent markers such as micro-RNA markers or protein markers (e.g. expression is similar to P1 MSC cultures, or within about 10%, or about 25%, or about 50%). For example, hsa-mir-371, hsa-mir-369-5P, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-499 and hsa-mir-217; GPNMB; RAMP; PERP; LY96; STAT1; and PRNP have all been shown to be up-regulated in senescent MSCs (Wagner et al.). Optionally, non-senescent cells exhibit typical morphology of non-senescent cells. For example, it has been shown that senescent MSCs enlarge and generate more vacuoles and cellular debris compared to non-senescent cells (Wagner et al.). Optionally, the cells remain non-senescent for at least 1, 2, or 3 additional population doublings.</p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Surprisingly, a population of MSCs, e.g., derived from only a single donor, can expanded to a clinical scale preparation having an antigen profile taught herein (e.g., as detailed forth in Example 30 or Example 32).</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">A clinical scale preparation of the present invention provides several superior advantages. The availability of multiple, nearly identical therapeutic doses (i.e., within the variance taught here) allows more predictable clinical responses. Subjects that respond to a therapeutic dose can be subsequently treated with reduced risk of toxicity. As information is obtained for various conditions, dosing (frequency and amounts) can be adjusted to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the therapeutically effective amount of cells is highly dependent on the nature of the preparation itself, for example, the phenotypic purity, potency, resilience to cryopreservation, and/or differentiation capacity of cells in the preparation. Unless indicated otherwise, a therapeutically effective dose of MSC preparations of the present invention is about 100 million cells or about 125 million cells. While the skilled artisan can readily determine the number of the present MSCs required for a therapeutic dose, in general (depending upon the therapeutic need), such a number can be any of about 50 million, about 100 million, about 250 million, or about 500 million, or about 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells for example. Other useful therapeutic doses include about 2 million MSCs per kg, about 8 million MSCs per kg, and about 2 to about 8 million MSCs per kg, for example, as detailed in Example 42 through Example 45.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Surprisingly, an MSC population derived from only a single donor can be expanded to produce a clinical scale MSC preparation containing about at least any of: about 2; about 8; about 11; about 36; about 50; about 150; about 220; about 690; about 960; about 1,000; about 2,000; about 3,000; about 4,200; about 5,000; about 6,000; about 7,000; or about 8,000 therapeutic doses, wherein the preparation has the antigen profile described above (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 and Example 32).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">By way of example, one embodiment of the present invention provides an MSC preparation of about 1Ã10<sup>12 </sup>or about 1Ã10<sup>12</sup>Â±about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, or about 40% MSCs, with the antigen profile described above. Such an MSC preparation is capable of providing, for example, about 8,000Â±about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, or about 40% doses to a patient before or after a freeze-thaw cycle (e.g., a patient with an immune modulatory disease such as GVHD) or, optionally about 10,000Â±about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, or about 40% doses to a patient before or after a freeze-thaw cycle. Such a clinical scale preparation is quite remarkable, for example, because a single patient can be frequently and repeatedly treated with doses of MSCs expanded from a single donation (e.g., bone marrow donation of 100 ml to 120 ml). For example, with the teachings provided herein, a single donation of bone marrow (e.g., 100-120 ml) can be used to produce a preparation of MSCs which can be used to treat a patient for many months or many years (i.e., lifelong treatment).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">With the teachings provided herein, the skilled artisan can now make clinical scale MSC preparations having a desired number of MSCs with the antigen profiles taught herein. In general, the final number of MSCs in a preparation is dependent the starting number of primary MSCs (or volume of bone marrow aspirate) and the expansion level. However, large aspirate and culture volumes introduce a number of technical challenges. Successful culture of cells to provide clinical scale preparations of the instant invention can require a heavy burden on cell handling and sterile technique. Even the most well-established culture methods can impart culture heterogeneity in a multitude of ways. A present clinical scale preparation can optionally be obtained by serial passage expansion where each passage includes a step of splitting the previous culture into a plurality of cultures at a given ratio. Each passaging step increases the number of concurrent cultures in the preparation. By way of example, the method detailed in Example 1 through Example 25 produces over 7,000 cell factories for a single isogenic preparation. It is quite remarkable that, by following the teachings provided herein, one can successfully produce clinical scale preparations having the instant preparation profiles, e.g. antigen profile, TNFRI profile, cryopreservation profile, differentiation profile, and/or sterility (with respect to pathogens).</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Manufacture</heading>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0082">Surprisingly, a bone marrow aspirate containing only a small fraction of the MSCs of the present invention can be processed to produce a preparation containing a relatively uniform and reliable population of MSCs, expanded to a sufficient quantity for a therapeutic dosage or for a clinical scale preparation. Such preparations have an antigen profile taught herein (e.g., a preparation set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), optionally having one or more profiles selected from the group consisting of potency, resilience to cryopreservation, differentiation capacity and retention of differentiation capacity, as taught herein (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0083">Generally, a donor is selected as taught here, a biological sample is obtained, the sample is screened (e.g., by methods taught here), acceptable samples are cultured to obtain adherent cells, the adherent cells are expanded under conditions that greatly enrich for the MSCs with desired phenotype (e.g., having an antigen profile taught herein). The culture is expanded to contain a number of cells for a therapeutic dose or for a clinical scale preparation. The preparation can be cryopreserved at one or more passages during expansion.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0084">An MSC preparation of the present invention can be prepared by obtaining a population comprising MSCs, expanding the number by passaging the population one or more times, and selecting cells with a CD105+/CD166+/CD45â phenotype to provide a therapeutic dose or a clinical scale MSC preparation having an antigen profile taught herein (e.g., a preparation set forth in Example 30 or Example 32). In one embodiment, the selection process comprises a step of culturing a population in the presence of a substrate and selecting cells that adhere to the substrate. Optionally, the selecting step does not comprise immunoselecting (e.g. antibody-based purification). Optionally, the selecting step consists essentially of culturing a population in the presence of a substrate and selecting cells that adhere to the substrate, and optionally serially repeating said culturing and selecting steps one or more times.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">As set forth below, the MSC preparations of the present invention can be produced by a series of steps, including (1) obtaining living cells from a biological sample of bone marrow (e.g. a bone marrow aspirate); (2) combining the cells with growth medium on a surface suitable for adherent cells; (3) cultivating the cells in vitro to increase the cell numbers; (4) expanding the cells numbers further through âpassagingâ (or subculturing); (5) optional selecting preparations that have been âqualifiedâ by structural and function features of the therapeutic MSC preparations of the present invention; (6) optionally, cryopreserving the cells; and (6) optionally thawing the cells for subsequent therapeutic administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">Bone marrow aspirates can typically be more than about 50 ml such as about 100 ml to about 120 ml bone marrow. These cells are âseededâ in appropriate tissue culture medium containing factors that stimulate MSC growth relative to differentiation. Initial seeding concentrations can be about 40 to about one million cells per cm<sup>2 </sup>of culture dish, or about 146 or about 146 plus and minus 50 or plus and minus 100 or in the range of about 50 to about 500 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>of culture dish. Primary cells are selected for adherence to an appropriate substrate surface and cultivated for one or more weeks (e.g., for about 21Â±3 days), removing the non-adherent matter from the substrate surface by replacing the medium with a fresh medium and allowing the adherent MSCs to culture-expand.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">Optionally, these primary cells can be further passaged to non-primary cells (e.g. removed from the culture surface and expanded into additional area) by seeding at a density of about 1,000 to about one million nucleated cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>of culture dish (e.g. about 5,900 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>plus and minus about 1,200), and then culturing for additional days, e.g. about 14Â±about 2 days. In suitable embodiments, the primary cells are grown to confluence, and in some instances are passaged to a second culture of non-primary cells by seeding the primary cells from a confluent primary cell culture in the second culture surface in an amount below confluence and growing the non-primary culture to confluence. This method can be repeated for additional passages.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0088">This ex vivo culture expansion can optionally comprise additional passaging (e.g., about 3, about 4, or about 5 cycles). The method can comprise, for example, passaging a number of times to provide a five passage (P5) culture.</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0116">While growing in culture, cells consume nutrients in the culture medium. Optionally, nutrients are replenished by adding culture medium. Optionally, replenishing comprises one or more feed changes (e.g., about every 3-4 days). Optionally, a feed change comprises removing spent medium (medium with reduced nutrient levels) and then adding fresh culture medium. Optionally, non-adherent cells are removed with the spent medium (e.g., by aspiration) during the one or more feed changes, for example, as set forth in Example 7. Optionally, the cells are grown in culture for about 14Â±2 days (e.g., between passages). Optionally, cells are grown in culture for about 9 to about 12 days for the final expansion stage, for example, to produce a P5 culture. Optionally, MSCs are seeded at about 5,900 cellsÂ±about 5%, Â±about 10%, or Â±about 20% per cm<sup>2 </sup>or in a range of about 1,000 to about 10,000 and/or about 37.5Ã10<sup>6</sup>Â±about 5%, Â±about 10%, or Â±about 20% cells per about 1.5 L of culture media for expansion steps (e.g., prior to a second or later expansion after an initial passage of an MSC culture expanded from a population of INBMCs).</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0117">MSCs in culture will generally continue growing until confluence at which time contact inhibition causes cessation of cell division or growth. A passage can then be performed at or before confluence, as described below, to reseed the culture at a reduced concentration in order to continue expansion of the cells (âpassage expansionâ), as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0118">Passaging</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0119">The methods of manufacture of the present invention comprise at least one passaging, splitting or âsubculturingâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0120">In one embodiment, one passage comprises removing non-adherent cells, leaving adherent MSCs. Such MSCs can then be dissociated from the substrate or flask (e.g., by using a protease such as trypsin or collagenase), media can be added, optional washing (e.g., by centrifugation) may be performed, and then the MSCs can be replated or reseeded to one or more culture vessels contain a greater surface area in total, for example, as set forth in Example 9 through Example 11. Other methods of removing non-adherent cells include steps of non-enzymatic treatment (e.g., with EDTA).</p>

      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0126">Cell Handling</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0127">The process of MSC isolation and ex-vivo expansion can be performed using any equipment and cell handing methods known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0128">Various manufacturing embodiments of the present invention employ steps that require manipulation of cells, for example, steps of seeding, feeding, dissociating an adherent culture, or washing. Any step of manipulating cells has the potential to insult the cells. Although MSCs can generally withstand a certain amount of insult during preparation, cells are preferably manipulated by handling procedures and/or equipment that adequately performs the given step(s) while minimizing insult to the cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0129">Steps of washing and freezing are potentially insulting to cells. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that protocols requiring extensive washing or rapid freezing of cells do not provide the quality or consistency required to manufacture a pharmaceutical composition suitable for administration to a human. Furthermore, the effects of extensive washing or rapid freezing protocols on the viability of cells and the efficacy a pharmaceutical composition comprising such cells is unknown.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0130">In one embodiment, the mesenchymal stem cells are washed in an apparatus that includes a cell source bag, a wash solution bag, a recirculation wash bag, a spinning membrane filter having inlet and outlet ports, a filtrate bag, a mixing zone, an end product bag for the washed cells, and appropriate tubing, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,251,295 to Johnson, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The apparatus can be a closed or semi-closed system, thereby reducing the potential for contamination. Unwashed MSCs from the cell source bag can be mixed with the wash solution in the centrifugal filtration device. The resulting suspension of mesenchymal stem cells in wash solution then is fed to the spinning membrane filter through an inlet port. A filtrate comprising wash solution is withdrawn from the spinning membrane filter through a first outlet port, and a concentrated suspension of MSCs is withdrawn from the spinning membrane filter through a second outlet port, and fed into the recirculation wash bag. The MSCs then are withdrawn from the recirculation wash bag, mixed with additional wash solution, and sent again to the spinning membrane filter.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0131">In one embodiment, washing comprises pooling several culture vessels in a single container and washing, for example, as set forth in Example 12 and Example 28.</p>

In some embodiments, the DMSO is added to purified MSCs.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0133">In one embodiment, cells are cryogenically frozen and/or stored at less than about â70Â° C., for example: about â¦â80Â° C., about â¦â80Â° C. to about â¦â135Â° C., or about â¦â135Â° C. In one embodiment, cells are cryogenically frozen by reducing the preparation temperature by about one degree per minute. Optionally, cells are cryogenically frozen by reducing the preparation temperature by about one degree per minute until the preparation reaches about â¦â80Â° C., and then the temperature of preparation is reduced to about â¦â135Â° C. Optionally, the rate of temperature change before reaching about â80Â° C. is less than the rate of temperature change from about â¦â80Â° C. to about â¦â135Â° C. Optionally, the temperature of preparation is reduced to about â¦â80Â° C. in a first refrigerating apparatus that provides a controlled rate of temperature change (e.g., a Cryomed) while temperature of preparation is reduced from about â¦â80Â° C. to about â¦â135Â° C. in second refrigerating apparatus that does not provide a controlled rate of temperature change, for example, a freezer set at about â¦â135Â° C. (e.g., a LN2 freezer), for example, as discussed in Example 29.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0134">In one embodiment, manufacturing of MSCs preparation is performed in a closed or semi-closed system, for example, for filling, sampling, and transfer of solutions.

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Screening</heading>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0135">In one embodiment of the present invention, an MSC preparation is screened for therapeutic use, wherein the preparation is selected for administration to a patient if the preparation has an antigen profile taught herein (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32). Optionally, the preparation is selected for administration only if it has an acceptable potency (e.g., a TNFRI profile set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), an acceptable post-thaw viability (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), has an acceptable differentiation profile (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32), has a pathogen content under an acceptable limit, and/or has an animal-derived residual content under an acceptable limit.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0136">A number of methods are known in the art for determining an antigen profile. In one embodiment, an antigen profile is determined by flow cytometry or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Thus, as known in the art, FACS involves exposing cells to a reporter, such as a labeled antibody, which binds to and labels antigens expressed by the cell. Methods of production of antibodies and labeling thereof to form reporters are known in the art. The cells are then passed through a FACS machine, which sorts the cells from each other based on the labeling.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0137">The potency in the TNFRI profiles of the present invention is the relative amount of TNFRI in the preparation (pg per million MSCs) and optionally, the activity of the preparation (% IL-2RÎ± Inhibition). The amount of cellular TNFRI in a culture of mesenchymal stem cells can be determined by methods known to those skilled in the art. Such methods include, but are not limited to, quantitative assays such as quantitative ELISA assays, for example, as described in WO 2007/087139 to Danilkovitch et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference. It is to be understood, however, that the scope of the present invention is not to be limited to any particular method for determining the amount. The TNFRI activity of the preparation is expressed as the percent IL-2RÎ± expression inhibition on mitogen-stimulated white blood cells and is determined by the method described by Le Blanc et al. (âMesenchymal Stem Cells Inhibit the Expression of CD25 (Interleukin-2 Receptor) and CD38 on Phytohaemagglutinin-Activated Lymphocytesâ, Scandinavian Journal of Immunology, 2004, Vol 60 No 3, Pages 307-315).</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0138">Methods of determining adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation are described by Pittenger et al. (âMultilineage potential of adult human mesenchymal stem cellsâ. Science 1999; 284:143-7). Adipogenic differentiation can be measured by detecting the formation of lipid-rich vacuoles within cells after treatment with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, insulin, and indomethacin. Chondrogenic differentiation can be measured by detecting type II collagen and expression of chondrocytic markers after culturing the cells without serum and with transforming growth factor-b3. Osteogenic differentiation is measured by detecting alkaline phosophatase expression after treatment with dexamethasone, Î²-glycerol phosphate, and ascorbate and in the presence of about 10% v/v FBS.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0139">In one embodiment of the present invention, an MSC preparation is screened for therapeutic use, wherein the preparation is selected for administration to a patient if the preparation is free of pathogens.

      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0141">In one embodiment of the present invention, an MSC preparation is screened for therapeutic use, wherein the preparation is selected for administration to a patient if the preparation has acceptable freeze-thaw viability (e.g., as set forth in Example 30 or Example 32). Cell viability and cell count is assessed by flow cytometry of fluorescently stained cells, based on differential staining of viable and non-viable cells due to their respective permeabilities to DNA-binding dyes in a proprietary reagent (Viacountâ¢ Guava Technologies). The stained sample is analyzed on a Guava PCA flow cytometer and the Guava CytoSoft software package. The Guava PCA uses a 532 nm diode laser to excite the dyes, whose fluorescence is detected by photomultipliers (âPMâ) (PM1 detects the viability dye emission at 580 nm; PM2 detects nuclear dye emission at 675 nm), while a photodiode measures forward light scatter (FSC). The fluorescence signal is resolved, allowing quantitation of the viable and non-viable cell populations from cellular debris in the test article. The Guava's operational range of diluted cell suspension is about 10 to about 500 particles/mL.</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0178">Collection of the BMA takes place at an outpatient surgical center (e.g., 7 days after blood sample collection was performed.) The donor is placed in the prone position and the bone marrow aspiration needle is inserted into the posterior iliac crest. The BMA collection procedure uses two syringes each containing 5 mL of 1,000 USP units/mL heparin sodium, which acts as an anticoagulant. As a result, the BMA material contains a small concentration (10,000 U/BMA) of heparin sodium. Up to 60 ml bone marrow is aspirated from the insertion site (from each side of the iliac crest), for example from 100 ml to 120 ml bone marrow in total.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">Example 4</heading>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">BMA Packaging</heading>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0179">The BMA material is packaged in a 300 mL Baxter LifeCellâ¢ tissue culture bag, which is an FDA-cleared, sterile, gas-permeable bag that is intended for the cultivation of cells grown in suspension. The container has a tubing harness allowing for functionally closed system filling, sampling, and transferring of solutions during the manufacturing process.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Isolation of Nucleated Bone Marrow Cells from BMA</heading>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0180">The first step (day 1) in the isolation and expansion of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) involves the isolation of nucleated bone marrow cells from the BMA. A CytoMateÂ® Cell Washer (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, Ill.) connected with a fluid transfer set is used to transfer a Plasma-LyteÂ®A (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) and Hespan formulation to the BMA by using a Terumo sterile tube welder to fuse the BMA bag tubing lines together with the fluid transfer set. In some embodiments of the present application, other cell washing or purification machines or techniques are used instead of a Cytomate Cell Washer; when the Cytomate is referred to herein, the present inventors appreciate that any suitable replacement device for cell washing or purification machines or techniques may be employed instead. Hespan is utilized to agglutinate, sediment, and separate the majority of the red blood cells (RBCs) from the bone marrow nucleated cells. Using the âFluid Transferâ program on the CytoMateÂ® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.), the Plasma-LyteÂ®A (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) and Hespan formulation (6% Hetastarch) is then transferred into the BMA bag and the RBCs are allowed to settle for approximately 60 to 90 minutes until a distinct separation appears between the nucleated bone marrow cells and the RBCs. The nucleated bone marrow cells (top layer) are isolated from the BMA bag using a Fenwal plasma extractor to press the upper nucleated bone marrow cell layer into a transfer pack. The isolated nucleated bone marrow cells (INBMCs) are then transferred to the CytoMateÂ® and processed by concentrating and washing the cells with culture medium (DMEM w/ 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine+10% FBS). INBMCs are counted using a Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter).</p>

      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="1">Isolation of MSCs</heading>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0181">Following the cell count, the INBMCs are diluted to the target seeding concentration (e.g., 925Ã10<sup>6 </sup>INBMCs per 55 ml) and transferred to a 1.5 L culture medium bag using the âTransfer Volumeâ program on the CytoMateÂ® to obtain the âMedia Cell Suspensionâ. The âMedia Cell Suspensionâ is used to seed the INBMCs into a CO<sub>2 </sub>primed Nunc ten-stack cell factory (CF) at about 5,900 cellsÂ±about 20% per cm<sup>2 </sup>of growing surface. The CF is then placed in an incubator set at about 37Â±1Â° C. and about 5Â±2% CO<sub>2</sub>, and ambient relative humidity. This is the primary culture (P0). After the initial seeding of the INBMCs, MSCs attach to the tissue culture plastic and grow to form a primary adherent population.</p>

      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0182">Non-adherent cells are aspirated away during a feed change. The feed is an addition of 1.5 L of fresh culture medium to replace the existing culture medium (âspent mediumâ) that has been depleted of nutrients from cells growing in culture. A feed is performed every 3-4 days. During each feed, the CF is examined for integrity and appearance.</p>

After the CF has been completely drained, the âspent mediumâ bag is removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0185">A âStop Solutionâ bag and a âTrypsin-EDTA (0.05% Trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA)â bag are attached (e.g., sterile welded) to the CF tubing set. Trypsin-EDTA approximately 400 mL) is added to the CF via gravity flow. Once the âTrypsin-EDTAâ bag has been emptied, the CF is placed into a 37Â±1Â° C. and 5Â±2% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for trypsinization.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0186">Each CF is trypsinized for up to 30 minutes (e.g., up to about 15 to about 30 min or any range in-between). During the trypsinization period, the CFs are observed approximately every 8 minutes using an inverted microscope to determine the percentage of cells that have detached. When the percentage of detached cells is estimated to be &gt;about 90%, the trypsinization is stopped by adding 100 mL of media âstop solutionâ (e.g., DMEM containing 10% FBS) into the CF via gravity flow. The duration of the trypsinization is recorded.</p>

      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0194">Based on the cell yield calculated from the harvest, the pooled âWashed hMSCsâ, are concentrated or diluted to obtain an in-process intermediate formulation containing about 6.0 million cells/mL, for example, in a wash solution such as about 1% HSA in Plasma-LyteÂ® A. The in-process intermediate is a clinical scale MSC preparation that provides a standardized formulation for sample analysis or cryopreservation before further expansion, if desired, or before administration to a patient as therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0195">Samples for sterility, endotoxin, adventitious viruses (DNA PCR and RNA PCR detection), and phenotype lot release testing are obtained from the formulation.</p>

      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0198">A number of Cryocyteâ¢ (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) bags (between about 100 to about 300, e.g. about 200) are filled, each with a 15 mL volume of the in-process intermediate. Each bag now contains about 45 million MSCs in about 5% HSA, about 10% DMSO in Plasma-LyteÂ®A (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.). The in-process intermediate is then placed into a secondary packaging container (e.g. a Custom Biogenic Systems aluminum canister/cassette) that is designed to enclose and protect the Cryocyteâ¢ bag. Once in the cassette, the in-process intermediate is cryopreserved in a Cryomed controlled-rate freezer. Following completion of the freezing program, the frozen bags are then transferred from the CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) and placed into a LN<sub>2 </sub>cryofreezer.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0199">Before freezing, a sample is obtained for sterility, endotoxin, appearance, and cell viability (post-thaw) testing. The in-process intermediate is screened for acceptance by each of the tests listed in Table 4.</p>

Each of the bags is thawed and processed, alone or simultaneously with the others, and processed by the steps that follow. The bag is diluted with DMEM containing about 10% FBS. A sample is taken from the bag for a cell count and cell viability assessment, and then hMSCs are transferred from the bag into 1.5 L of culture medium.</p>

      <heading id="h-00061-en" level="1">Formulating an MSC Preparation for Therapy or Storage</heading>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0208">Based on the cell yield calculated from the harvest, the pooled âWashed hMSCsâ are either concentrated or diluted to obtain a formulation containing about 16.6 million cells/mL. If the pooled âWashed hMSCsâ are concentrated, the cells are spun down and the excess volume is removed. If the pooled âWashed hMSCsâ are diluted, the required volume of Wash/Stop Solution (about 1% HSA in Plasma-LyteÂ®A) is added to get the desired concentration. A sample for phenotype and residuals (BSA and trypsin) testing are obtained from the formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0209">The formulation is then diluted with an equal volume (1:1) of cryoprotectant solution containing about 20% DMSO and about 9% HSA in Plasma-LyteÂ®A. The formulation now contains a concentration of about 8.3 million cells/mL (in approximately 10% DMSO and approximately 5% HSA in Plasma-Lyte A).</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0210">A sample for potency testing is obtained from the diluted formulation.</p>

      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0211">The MSC preparation is then filled into a number of Cryocyteâ¢ bags to a volume of about 15 mL/bag (e.g., about 8,000 bags in total, or optionally about 10,000 bags in total). Each bag of the MSC preparation has a final formulation of about 125Ã10<sup>6 </sup>hMSCs (at least about 100Ã10<sup>6 </sup>viable hMSCs after a freeze-thaw cycle) in Plasma-LyteÂ®A containing a concentration of about 5% HSA and about 10% DMSO per bag. Bags of the MSC preparation are then placed into a secondary container (a Custom Biogenic Systems aluminum canister/cassette) that is designed to enclose and protect the Cryocyteâ¢ bag. Once in the cassette, the MSC preparation is cryopreserved in a controlled rate freezer (CryomedÂ®, Thermal Scientific, Rockford, Ill.). Following completion of the freezing program, the frozen bags are then transferred from the CryomedÂ® (Thermal Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) and placed into LN<sub>2 </sub>cryofreezers. A sample bag is obtained for sterility, endotoxin, appearance and cell viability (post-thaw) lot release testing.</p>

      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0213">The number of cells harvested per donor is correlated with the number of passages during culture expansion. Although cells from any passage can be formulated for therapy, it has been surprisingly discovered that limiting the number of passages, for example, to less than any of about 14, about 10, about 8, or about 6 passages, provides preparations with a superior safety profile. By the end of the process set forth in Example 1 through Example 23, there are approximately 22 to approximately 25 (e.g., 25) population doublings. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that limiting the number of passages minimizes the risk of spontaneous genetic transformations.</p>

      <heading id="h-00069-en" level="1">Evaluation of Washing Protocol</heading>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0214">Based on low post-thaw cell viabilities observed in a development study, changes were made in the CytoMateÂ® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) cell washing process to improve cell viability and cell recovery post-thaw. The old standard procedure to be improved upon here used a CytoMateÂ® (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.) programmed to wash all three collection bags serially. The time required to complete the entire wash cycle was three times longer than the time required to wash the contents of one individual collection bag. Surprisingly, it was discovered here that standard shear forces experienced by the cells during washing reduced cell viability and resilience to cryopreservation.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0215">In the new procedure, the contents of the cell factories harvested at each passage are transferred into collection bags for cell washing. An automated cell washer (CytoMate (Baxter, Deerfield, Ill.)) is used during processing to provide consistent, automated cell washing. The change in the washing process was to wash one collection bag at a time, and after completion of its wash cycle, transfer the contents of the washed cells to a âWashed hMSCâ collection (or holding) bag. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this modification to the process reduced the cell wash exposure time per collection bag by one third, thus protecting the cells from unnecessary handling and exposure to the shear forces of cell washing.</p>

      <heading id="h-00071-en" level="1">Evaluation of Freezing Protocol</heading>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0216">Based on low post-thaw cell viabilities observed in a development study, changes in the CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) freezing process were made to ensure good cell viability and cell recovery post-thaw. Surprisingly, standard procedures previously used for freezing MSC preparations resulted in unacceptable cell viability. Changes in the CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) freezing process included a modification to the freeze program so that it would closely mimic what is experienced by cells which are simply placed in an â80Â° C. freezer inside an insulated container. These modifications raised cell viability post-thaw by approximately 20%.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0217">In manufacturing, a CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) freezer is used at the time of harvest to provide controlled-rate freezing of the cells to â¦â80Â° C. prior to the transfer to a LN<sub>2 </sub>freezer (â¦â135Â° C.). In development and research, small scale samples were initially frozen directly in a â80Â° C. inside an insulated container, and then transferred to a LN<sub>2 </sub>freezer (â¦135Â° C.). It was noted that these samples had consistently high viability. A study was conducted to map the temperature profile under these conditions. This temperature profile was then programmed into the CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) freezer and tested. The effect was a more gradual temperature transition to the final freezing temperature. This change was found to improve cell viability and was incorporated into the current CryomedÂ® (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, Ill.) freezing process used in manufacturing.</p>

      <heading id="h-00073-en" level="1">Production of Clinical Scale MSC Preparations Through Passage 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0218">Multiple clinical scale preparations were produced, each by the method set forth in Example 1 through Example 15 to produce a collection of preparations. Each MSC preparation contained about 4.5Ã10<sup>9 </sup>to about 6.3Ã10<sup>9 </sup>cells (about 30 to about 50 doses), for example about 5.5Ã10<sup>9 </sup>cells derived from a single donor with an average of 5 population doublings compared to the P0 culture. After thawing, a sample from each preparation was tested for antigen profile, TNFRI profile, cell viability, and capacity for differentiation.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0219">As shown in Table 6, each preparation in the collection had an antigen profile of less than about 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least about 95% CD105+ cells, and at least about 95% CD166+ cells. Also as shown in Table 6, each preparation in the collection had a TNFRI profile of at least about 13 pg TNFRI per million cells. Each preparation had a cell viability of at least about 70% (data not shown). Cells from each preparation were tested and determined to have a capacity for chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and adipogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0220">The antigen profile of MSCs was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The assay used a single-antibody approach and generated data reflecting expression of the three markers individually (CD45â, CD105+, and CD166+). CD45 (LCA) is a marker for cells of hematopoietic origin, while CD105 (endoglin) and CD166 (ALCAM) are markers for MSCs. The MSC samples were labeled with commercial fluorescent antibodies to the cell surface markers, then washed, fixed and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. An isotype antibody negative control was also run at the same time. The MSC phenotype profile was determined using CELLQuest software (Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Jose Calif.). The cells were first identified on the basis of light scatter properties (forward scatter for size and side scatter for internal granularity), while marker expression was assessed through fluorescence from the bound antibodies. In the forward scatter versus side scatter dot blot for the unstained control, the main dot cluster was positioned at the center of the side scatter axis by adjusting the side scatter voltage control. The acquisition gate, defined by the R1 region, was subsequently adjusted to ensure that the main dot cluster is completely enclosed within the R1 region. The data acquisition process involved the accumulation of 10,000 events. When the analysis of the unstained control was complete, the isotype antibody negative control was analyzed using the acquisition parameters that were defined for the unstained control. The CD166, CD105, and CD45 test samples were analyzed using the same approach. The fluorescence threshold for positive marker expression was defined using the isotype antibody negative control, which was adjusted so that at least about 99.50% of the negative control cells were identified as ânegativeâ. This threshold was used to measure the percentage of positive cells for each of the three cell surface markers independently.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0221">Cell viability was assessed by a flow cytometry of fluorescently stained cells, based on differential staining of viable and non-viable cells on their respective permeabilities to DNA-binding dyes in a proprietary reagent (Viacountâ¢, Guava Technologies, Millipore, Billerica, Calif.). The stained sample was analyzed on a Guava PCA flow cytometer and the Guava CytoSoft software package (Millipore, Billerica, Calif.). The Guava PCA uses a 532 nm diode laser to excite the dyes, whose fluorescence is detected by photomultipliers (PM: PM1 detects the viability dye emission at 580 nm; PM2 detects nuclear dye emission at 675 nm), while a photodiode measures forward light scatter (FSC). The fluorescence signal was resolved, allowing quantitation of the viable and non-viable cell populations from cellular debris in the test article.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0222">To test for osteogenic differentiation, about 3Ã10<sup>4 </sup>hMSCs were seeded onto 35 mm dishes in medium (DMEM, 10% FBS). After 24 hours, the medium was replaced with osteogenic assay medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 50 mM ascorbate 2-phosphate, 10 mM Î²-glycerol phosphate, 0.1 mM dexamethasone), which was replaced every three to four days during the 17-day period of the assay. At the end of culture period MSC osteogenic differentiation was assessed using von Kossa staining and by measurement of calcium accumulation in cells. Selected specimens were subsequently stained for mineral by the von Kossa method. Cell layers were fixed with 10% formalin for 1 hour, incubated with 2% (w/v) silver nitrate solution for 10 minutes in the dark, washed thoroughly with deionized water and then exposed to bright light for 15 minutes. For the calcium assay, cell layers were rinsed twice with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and scraped off the dish in 0.5N Hydrochloric acid. Calcium was then extracted from the cell layers by shaking for 4 hours at 4Â° C. followed by centrifugation at 1,000Ãg for 5 minutes. The calcium content of the resulting supernatant was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions for Sigma kit #587-A. Absorbance of samples was measured at 575 nm using a Beckman spectrophotometer. Total calcium in samples was calculated using standards assayed in parallel and expressed as pg per dish.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0223">To test for chondrogenic differentiation, chondrogenic differentiation was induced by gently pelleting about 2.5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>hMSCs in defined chondrogenic medium (high-glucose DMEM, ITS<sup>+</sup> supplement (Becton-Dickinson), 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 10 ng/mL TGF-Î²3, 50 Î¼g/mL ascorbate 2-phosphate, 2 mM pyruvate+antibiotics) in a 15 mL conical tube. The pellet culture was then incubated at 37Â° C. for 1 to 4 weeks with medium replacement every 2 to 3 days. At harvest, the pellets were gently fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then sections cut and analyzed. Type II collagen was detected by immunohistochemical methods. Sections were also stained for proteoglycans using Toluidine Blue and Safronin O.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0224">To test for adipogenic differentiation, adipogenic differentiation was induced by adding adipogenic induction medium (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM methyl-isobutylxanthine, 0.2 mM indomethecin, 10 Î¼g/mL insulin and antibiotics) to hMSCs previously grown for several days after reaching confluency. After induction, the media was changed to adipogenic maintenance media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 10 Î¼g/mL insulin and antibiotics) and the culture grown for a further 1 week. Lipid vacuoles in cells differentiated into adipocytes were detected by Oil Red O.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0225">For the TNFRI assay, MSC samples were processed to lyse the cells and release TNFRI into solution. An ELISA method was used to quantify TNFRI using a commercially available kit. This kit allowed for the measurement of both cell-associated TNFRI, and soluble TNFRI that has been shed from cell surface. The assay employed a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Samples were added to a microplate that had been precoated with a monoclonal antibody specific for human TNFRI. TNFRI present in standards and samples was captured by the immobilized anti-TNFRI antibody. After repeated washing to remove unbound extraneous material, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody specific for TNFRI was added. Following incubation, a wash was done to remove unbound antibody-enzyme reagent, and then a substrate solution was added and color develops in proportion to the amount of TNFRI bound to the microplate. The color development was stopped at a specified time point and the intensity of the color is measured using a microplate spectrophotometer. Quantitation was achieved by comparing the signal of unknowns to TNF RI standards assayed at the same time. Although quantification using this assay provides units of pg TNFRI/ml, the amount of TNFRI relative to the number of MSCs (âpotencyâ) can be obtained by calculating the concentration of MSCs before lysis.</p>

      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0226">A collection of clinical scale preparations were produced and analyzed, as in Example 30. The results are depicted in Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9. As depicted, each preparation in the collection had an antigen profile of less than 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least 95% CD105+ cells, and at least 95% CD166+ cells. Also as depicted, each preparation in the collection had a TNFRI profile of at least 13 pg TNFRI per million cells. Each preparation was tested and determined to have a cell viability of at least 70% (data not shown).</p>

      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0227">Multiple clinical scale preparations were produced, each by the method set forth in Example 1 through Example 26, to produce a collection of preparations. Each preparation contained about 1Ã10<sup>12 </sup>MSCs (up to about 8,000 doses after a freeze-thaw cycle) derived from a single donor with an average of about 12.5 population doublings compared to the P0 culture, or 25 total doublings. After thawing, a sample from each preparation was tested for antigen profile, TNFRI profile, cell viability, and capacity for differentiation. With the exception of TNFRI profile, each test was performed in the same manner described in Example 30. For the TNFRI profile, a TNFRI assay was performed in the same manner described in Example 30, and an assay of IL-2Ra expression inhibition was also determined as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0228">Inhibition of IL-2Ra expression on T-cells was determined by co-culturing MSCs with CD3/CD28-activated hPBMCs for 3 days, the time corresponding to the maximal level of IL-2RÎ± expression by the T-cell population in hPBMCs. The ratio of hMSCs to hPBMCs is 1:5, which was the optimal ratio identified for hMSC-mediated inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation tests. After incubation, cells were collected and lysed. The level of IL-2RÎ± in cell lysates was measured by ELISA. Results were expressed as % inhibition of IL-2RÎ± expression on CD3/CD28-stimulated hPBMCs by hMSCs relative to the control CD3/CD28 hPBMC cultured without hMSCs.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0229">As shown in Table 10, each preparation in the collection had an antigen profile of less than 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least 95% CD105+ cells, and at least 95% CD166+ cells. Also as shown in Table 10, each preparation in the collection had a TNFRI profile of 13 to 179 pg TNFRI per million cells and inhibited IL-2Ra expression by at least 20% (at least 30%). Also as shown in Table 10, at least 70% (at least 80%) of the cells in each preparation were viable. Cells from each preparation had a capacity for chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, and adipogenesis (data not shown).</p>

      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0230">A collection of clinical scale preparations were produced and analyzed, as in Example 32.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0231">Table 11 depicts the results of the preparation screen for the properties listed in Table 12 and the population density in the CFs. As depicted in Table 11, all preparations successfully analyzed passed the exemplary release criteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0232">As depicted in Table 12, each preparation in the collection had an antigen profile of less than 1.25% CD45+ cells, at least 95% CD105+ cells, and at least 95% CD166+ cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0233">Also as depicted in Table 12, each preparation in the collection had a TNFRI profile of at least 13 pg TNFRI per million cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0234">Also as depicted Table 12, each preparation in the collection had a TNFRI profile of at least 13 pg TNFRI per million cells and inhibited IL-2Ra expression by at least about 20% (at least about 30%). Each preparation had a cell viability of at least about 70% (at least about 80%).</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0235">In order to determine if preparations could consistently be produced, the variance and standard deviation in the antigen profile, TNFRI profile, and cryopreservation profile were calculated as measures of deviation within the collection set forth in Table 12. The results are shown at the end of Table 12. As seen in Table 12, there is minimal deviation in the profiles (note that the cutoff value (preceded by a â&lt;â symbol) was used for deviation calculation in certain instances where actual values were not determined).</p>

      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0237">An analysis of cellular proliferation was used to assess process consistency, although cells from different donors will have different proliferation potential. The evaluation of the total cells harvested for each MSC preparation also allows for the identification of any out of trend values. One measure of process consistency is the number of cells per CF, since it reflects the uniformity of the process performance. However, due the inherent biological variability of the preparation of a cellular product, the process will always be subject to a certain level of variability.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0238">The number of cells recovered per CF was evaluated at two passages during the manufacture of MSC preparations. The number of cells per CF after the third passage (see Example 17) and the fifth passage (see Example 23) for several MSC preparations is presented with descriptive statistics in Table 14. At P3, the average number of cells per CF was about 190 million, and the standard deviation was 67. At P5, the average number of cells per CF was about 166 million, and the standard deviation was 35.</p>

      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0239">Product formulation and bag fill time ranges for an exemplary ex vivo cultured mesenchymal stem cells manufacturing process was performed to evaluate the effects of the cryoprotectant solution on cells to determine an exemplary time range for formulation and fill prior to cryopreservation. Four time points were evaluated: 60, 90 (control), 150 and 240 minutes. At one day and thirty days post-cryopreservation, hMSCs were thawed and evaluated for viability (Table 15), phenotype (Table 16) and expression of TNFRI (potency) (Table 17) against this exemplary acceptance criteria. Results of the study showed that cell quality is not affected, for example, when product formulation and fill occurs within 150 or 240 minutes prior to cryopreservation.</p>

      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0240">The karyotype of an hMSC sample is determined through examination of colcemid-arrested metaphase spreads. The hMSCs are cultured briefly, arrested with colcemid and processed. The cells are enlarged using a hypotonic HEPES buffered EGTA solution, fixed, and then the cells are enlarged using a hypotonic HEPES buffered EGTA solution, fixed, and then placed on microscope slides. The slides are aged overnight, treated with trypsin, and stained with Giemsa to produce G-banding. Typical G-banding should yield about 350-450 positive G bands. Standard evaluation includes enumeration of numerical and structural abnormalities (â²chromosomal abnormalitiesâ²), such as translocations, breaks, rings, markers and double-minutes, with at least 20 cells evaluated. Inversion, deletion, or translocation breakpoints are identified as per the ISCN 1995 International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature, when possible. At least two karyotypes per sample are prepared. Results of karyotyping show that exemplary preparations of the present invention have no chromosomal abnormalities (Table 4, Table 6, and Table 9).</p>

      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0243">Sterility.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0244">The sterility of the test article is determined by the Direct Inoculation Method (Direct Method) in accordance with &lt;USP 71&gt; Sterility Test. The test conforms to the standard 14-day incubation period under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Fluid Thioglycollate Medium is used for the culture of anaerobic bacteria and Soybean-Casein Digest (SCD) Medium is used for both fungi and aerobic bacteria. A test Negative result is no growth of microorganisms after 14 days incubation. Validation of the test method includes the following strains of test microorganisms: FTM (anaerobic)â[<i>B. subtillis </i>(ATCC 6633<i>, k. rhizophilia </i>(ATCC 9341), and <i>C. sporogenes </i>(ATCC 11437)] and SCD (aeorobic and fungi)â[<i>B. subtillis </i>(ATCC 6633); <i>C. albicans </i>(ATCC 10231), and <i>A. niger </i>(ATCC 16404)].</p>

      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0247">i. The indirect method allows visualization of <i>mycoplasma </i>in a co-cultured indicator cell line (Vero cells). The test article hMSCs are co-cultured with Vero cells on coverslips. Positive controls for the test are Vero cells inoculated with the <i>Mycoplasma </i>species <i>M. hyorhinis </i>and <i>M. orale</i>. The negative control is Vero cells inoculated with sterile broth. Mycoplasmas are identified by epiflorescent detection of a DNA-binding fluorochrome stain (Hoechst stain). In negative controls, only the Vero cell nucleus is stained, whereas in positive controls, both nuclear and extra-nuclear fluorescence is detected. <i>Mycoplasma </i>exhibit a staining pattern that differs from the host Vero cells, and consists of extra-nuclear staining of small round bodies of approximately 0.3 Î¼m in diameter.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0248">ii. The direct method allows detection of <i>mycoplasma </i>growth under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (broth culture flasks and agar plates, respectively). The agar and broth media supply nutrients and a source of carbon and energy necessary for <i>mycoplasma </i>growth. Positive controls consist of cultures inoculated with nonfermentative and fermentative <i>mycoplasma </i>species (<i>M. orale </i>and <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, respectively), while sterile broth serves as a negative control. Indicators of <i>mycoplasma </i>growth include change in color or turbidity of broth cultures, and growth of colonies with âfried eggâ morphology on agar plates.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0249">Negative results for <i>mycoplasma </i>contamination of the hMSC test sample are defined as results for both indirect and direct methods that resemble the respective negative controls. This test is governed by an OTI-approved protocol executed by an external testing laboratory (AppTec protocol 30055).</p>

This test is a quantitative, chromogenic kinetic assay for the detection of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. The concentration of endotoxin in the test article is calculated from a standard curve using a series of endotoxin standards. The assay is validated to ensure the test article does not inhibit or enhance detection of endotoxin. A positive product control (PPC) is included to ensure the sample dilution is valid.</p>

The test article is prepared as a clarified lysate supernatant and inoculated into the following:</p>
      <p id="p-00277-en" num="0260">Adult mice (intraperitoneal and intracerebral administration). Adult mice are susceptible to various viral agents (including coxsackieviruses, flaviviruses). Daily health observations of the adult mice are performed and they are sacrificed 21 days after inoculation, or possibly sooner if group mortality exceeds 20%.</p>
      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0261">Newborn suckling mice (intraperitoneal and intracerebral administration). Suckling mice are susceptible to various agents, including togaviruses, bunyaviruses, flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and herpes viruses. The newborn suckling mice are observed for 14 days post administration for ill effects, or possibly sooner if group mortality exceeds 20%. At that time the mice are sacrificed, their tissues pooled, and homogenized for subpassage into another set of newborn suckling mice through the same routes of administration. This group is monitored for 14 days. Animals found dead within 24 hours of injection have their tissues homogenized and sub-passaged into a fresh group of animals.</p>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0262">Embryonated hen eggs (allantois and yolk sac administration) is used to test for viruses. Inoculation via the allantois favors propagation of orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses. Inoculation via the yolk sac favors replication of herpes viruses, rickettsiae, <i>mycoplasma</i>, and bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0263">Embryonated hen's eggs inoculated via the allantoic cavity (first passage) are incubated for three days and the embryos are observed for viability. Allantoic fluids from this first passage are harvested (including fluids from dead eggs) for a hemagglutination assay (to quantify viral particles) or for sub-passage into a fresh set of eggs. The second passage eggs follow the same time course, at the end of which the allantoic fluids are harvested for a hemagglutination assay and an examination of the embryos.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0264">Eggs inoculated via the yolk sac (first passage) are incubated for nine days and are observed for viability. After the 9-day incubation, all embryos are harvested and examined. All first passage yolk sacs are harvested, washed, and pooled; second passage eggs are inoculated with a preparation of this material. Second passage eggs, along with the negative control, are incubated for 9 days and are candled each working day for viability. After the 9 day incubation all embryos are harvested and examined.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0265">The hemagglutination assay uses chicken, guinea pig, and human type-O erythrocytes. Replicate plates are observed after incubation for hemagglutination.</p>

      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0268">The in vitro viral test is designed to detect various viruses, including picornaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and reoviruses. Test article is incubated with three indicator cell lines (MRC-5, a human embryonic cell line; VERO, a simian kidney cell line; Hs68, a human foreskin cell line). The inoculated cultures are examined for at least 28 days and compared to positive controls for the development of cell morphology characteristic of viral contamination. Picornaviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and reoviruses can be detected by changes in morphology directly. However, orthomyxo- and paramyxo-viruses may replicate in these cell lines with little or no cytopathic manifestation. The presence of these viruses is detected by the ability to adsorb erythrocytes to the surface of infected cells (hemadsorption assay) which is performed at the conclusion of the observation period.</p>

To reduce potential contamination, the TerumoÂ® Sterile Tubing Welder and the SebraÂ® MINIâ¢ Hand Held Tube Sealer were utilized to permit closed processing. Steps that used the welder and sealer included: transfer of BMA and fluids, sampling, seeding of CFs, feeds, passages, harvest, formulation, fill and cryopreservation. All welds and seals were visually inspected for integrity. If the integrity of a seal or weld has been breached (exposed to air), then the affected portion of the material will be discarded.</p>

All welding of tubing was performed using the TerumoÂ® Sterile Tubing Welder. This welder has been designed for use in the storage and handling of blood products. The system automatically connects in a sterile manner two sections of tubing. The welds were visually inspected to ensure integrity by rotating the tubing 360Â° to determine if the outer diameters of the two tubes were aligned at the connection (weld). If the welds were determined to be breached (exposed to air), then the affected portion of material was discarded. If properly aligned, each weld was opened by pinching or rolling the tubing until the fluid pathway opens. Process steps that are surprisingly enhanced by welding include, for example, transfer of BMA and fluids, sampling, seeding of CFs, feeds, passages, harvest, formulation and fill.</p>

      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0293">Processing steps that require tubing to be sealed or severed utilized the SebraÂ® MINIâ¢ Hand Held Tube Sealer. The tube sealer is an instrument for making seals on tubing made of Radio Frequency (RF)-reactive thermoplastic materials used in blood banks, blood processing facilities and transfusion centers. The sealer is an instrument that generates a controlled amount of RF energy at the sealing head while mechanically compressing the tubing across its diameter during the dielectric sealing and forming process. When the energy is removed and the tubing is allowed to cool under compression, a permanent seal is produced. During processing, the seals were inspected visually for integrity. If a seal was determined to be breached (exposed to air), that portion of material was discarded. Process steps that are surprisingly enhanced by seals include transfer of BMA and fluids, sampling, seeding of CFs, feeds, passages, harvest, formulation, fill and cryopreservation.</p>

One of the preparations failed the TNFRI assay also failed the IL-2Ra assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0312">These results demonstrate that MSC preparations can show heterogeneity, even when standardized procedures are followed. Thus, the skilled artisan should now recognize that MSC preparations in the art that appear equivalent based one or even several criteria may, in fact, have important phenotypic or genotypic differences between them and may not demonstrate the potency that characterizes the MSC preparations of the present invention. Moreover, the MSC preparations of the present invention can be distinguished from many of the preparations in the prior art upon complete characterization as taught here.</p>

      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0313">At another manufacturing facility (i.e. different facility than in Example 46), the methodologies set forth in Example 1-Example 41 were generally followed. Greater than 95% of the lots met the criteria of Example 46. However, one preparation failed post-thaw viability test and the TNFR1 assay for potency. Another preparation failed the residual trypsin analysis, having a value of 38.1 Î¼g/mL. These results demonstrate the importance of adding a screening step to the manufacturing methods, even when highly reproducible techniques have been achieved.</p>
