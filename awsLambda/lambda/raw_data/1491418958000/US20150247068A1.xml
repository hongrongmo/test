    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to a polyolefin adhesive composition that comprises one or more nucleating agents for improving the set time of the finished adhesive.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Historically, packaging grade hot melt adhesive (âHMAâ) formulations include a base polymer, and one or more waxes and tackifiers. In addition to basic adhesive bond strength performance, the set-time of the HMA is a key parameter for packaging grade HMAs. This is because lower set times enable faster packaging line speeds.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Set-time is the minimum time interval, after bonding of two substrates, during which the cohesive strength of the bond becomes stronger than the joint stress (often called the pop open force). Set-time thus represents the time necessary to cool down the HMA and obtain a good bond. Open-time is the maximum time interval, after application of the liquid HMA, during which a second substrate can be brought into contact with the molten adhesive and a good bond will be formed. Generally, once the adhesive has cooled to a certain temperature, it is no longer possible to make a bond. Usually HMA formulators attempt to design HMA formulations that have long open time and short setting times, a balance which is difficult to achieve.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Conventional HMA formulations contain up to 30% wax to obtain good set times. Waxes however do not take part in actual adhesive performance; by removing the wax, overall adhesive performance can be enhanced. It would therefore be desirable to provide a hot melt adhesive formulation requiring less wax, preferably little to no wax and higher base polymer loading.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The foregoing and/or other challenges are addressed by the methods and products disclosed herein.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Adhesive formulations are disclosed herein that enable enhanced adhesive properties and deliver excellent set-times while maintaining long open times. In any embodiment, the formulations enable the usage of higher polymer loads in the finished adhesive, thereby delivering enhanced adhesive strength. In doing so, the formulations may reduce adhesive density and provide a pathway for reducing the mass and volume of adhesive that must be applied on packaging lines. By lowering adhesive volumes, set time may be further improved due to the fact that the reduced thermal mass requires less time to cool.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The formulations disclosed herein may deliver improved set times while maintaining long open times by the incorporation of nucleating agents in the adhesive formulation. In any embodiment, the formulation may include a polyolefin composition comprising a homopolymer of propylene or a copolymer of propylene and ethylene or a C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>alpha-olefin. In any embodiment, the polyolefin composition may comprise a copolymer of propylene and ethylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be effective for decreasing the set time for the adhesive composition, preferably by at least 10%, in comparison to an otherwise identical adhesive composition in which the nucleating agent is absent. In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be effective to increase the onset crystallization temperature of the polyolefin composition relative to the adhesive composition in which the nucleating agent is absent. In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be effective to increase the onset crystallization temperature of the polyolefin composition by at least 10Â° C. relative to the adhesive composition in which the nucleating agent is absent.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be a metal salt. In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be an organic compound having a crystallization temperature greater than the crystallization temperature of the polyolefin composition.

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Polymers employed in any of the polyolefin compositions of the invention are preferably derived from one or more monomers selected from the group consisting of propylene, ethylene, C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>20 </sub>linear or branched olefins, and diolefins (particularly, C<sub>4 </sub>to C<sub>10 </sub>olefins). The term âmonomerâ or âcomonomerâ as used herein can refer to the monomer used to form the polymer, i.e., the unreacted chemical compound in the form prior to polymerization, and can also refer to the monomer after it has been incorporated into the polymer, also referred to herein as a â[monomer]-derived unitâ, which by virtue of the polymerization reaction typically has fewer hydrogen atoms than it does prior to the polymerization reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Preferably, the polymer is predominantly propylene. Preferred comonomers include ethylene, butene, hexene, and octene, with ethylene being the most preferred comonomer. For propylene-based polymers, the crystallinity and heat of fusion of the polymer are affected by the comonomer content and the sequence distribution of the comonomer within the polymer. Generally, increased levels of comonomer will reduce the crystallinity provided by the crystallization of stereoregular propylene-derived sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The comonomer content and sequence distribution of the polymers can be measured using <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Comonomer content of discrete molecular weight ranges can be measured using methods well known to those skilled in the art, including Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) in conjunction with samples by GPC, as described in Wheeler and Willis, Applied Spectroscopy, 1993, Vol. 47, pp. 1128-1130. For a propylene ethylene copolymer containing greater than 75 wt % propylene, the comonomer content (ethylene content) of such a polymer can be measured as follows: A thin homogeneous film is pressed at a temperature of about 150Â° C. or greater, and mounted on a Perkin Elmer PE 1760 infrared spectrophotometer. A full spectrum of the sample from 600 cm-1 to 4000 cm-1 is recorded and the monomer weight percent of ethylene can be calculated according to the following equation: Ethylene wt %=82.585â111.987X+30.045X2, where X is the ratio of the peak height at 1155 cm-1 and peak height at either 722 cm-1 or 732 cm-1, whichever is higher. For propylene ethylene copolymers having 75 wt % or less propylene content, the comonomer (ethylene) content can be measured using the procedure described in Wheeler and Willis. Various test methods including GPC measurements methods and methods for determining ethylene content by NMR and the DSC measurements are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,525,157, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>

Fiber tear is a visual measurement as to the amount of paper substrate fibers that are attached to a bond after the substrates are torn apart. 100% fiber tear means the adhesive is stronger than the substrate and 100% of the adhesive is covered in substrate fibers. 0% fiber tear means the adhesive does not bond at all and simply pops off the substrate. Fiber tear was determined by bonding together substrates with the adhesive after the molten adhesive (180Â° C.) has been dropped onto one of the substrates with an eye dropper. The second substrate was placed on top of the adhesive, and a 500 g weight was placed on top of the second substrate for even application.

The second substrate was placed on top of the adhesive, and a 500 g weight was placed on top of the second substrate for even application. After a predetermined interval of time the second substrate is removed and checked for fiber tear. If no fiber tear was found, a longer interval of time was tried. This continued until fiber tear is found. This length of time was reported as the set time.</p>

The second substrate was placed on top of the adhesive, and a 500 g weight was placed on top of the second substrate for even application. The bonded specimen was examined to determine the longest time period, between application of the adhesive to one surface and mating with a second surface, which allows at least 50% fiber tear.</p>

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0101">As can be seen in TABLE 1, the compositions that included the nucleating agent (compositions E and F), exhibited set time performances equal to that of the desired performance benchmarks. Notably, such performance was achieved without using a Fischer-Tropsch wax and using higher polymer loadings. Open time and fiber tear performance were also exceptional for compositions E and F.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0102">Peeling force as a function of application time for each of the adhesive blends is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the adhesive compositions comprising a nucleating agent build up strength quickly at about 0.7 seconds after application. It is believed that this phenomenon is effected by the crystallization of the organic component of the metal salt as the adhesive composition cools, which in turn promotes the crystallization and solidification of the base polymer of the adhesive composition starting at sites adjacent to the nucleating agent as the adhesive composition cools. Accordingly, the presence of the nucleating agent may increase the onset crystallization temperature of the polyolefin composition, e.g., by at least 2Â° C., 3Â° C., 5Â° C., or 7Â° C. relative to the adhesive composition in which the nucleating agent is absent. As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the presence of the nucleating agent in Composition F increased the onset crystallization temperature of the composition (relative to Composition D) to 97.62Â° C. from 90.26Â° C. In any embodiment, the nucleating agent may be provided in an amount effective to increase the onset crystallization temperature of the polyolefin composition, e.g., by at least 2Â° C., 3Â° C., 5Â° C., or 7Â° C. relative to the adhesive composition in which the nucleating agent is absent.</p>
