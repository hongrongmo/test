      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite and a metallopolymer nanocomposite prepared by surface modification of the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite with silica.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Recently, metallopolymer nanocomposites prepared from synthetic polymers with metal centers have received attention as next generation hybrid materials. Such metallopolymer nanocomposites contain typical elements (main group elements), transition elements (transition metal elements) or rare earth elements as central elements and may have various structures depending on the central metals and linkages, for example, depending on whether the central metals are introduced into the backbones or side chains of the polymers or are linear or branched. Polymers have easy-to-control mechanical properties and good formability compared to inorganic materials. Accordingly, metallopolymer nanocomposites can be imparted with various functions by strict design of the chemical structure of the polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is the most widely used polymeric material except for polyethylene and polypropylene. PVC is highly compatible in terms of mechanical properties and processability and can be useful in a range of applications, such as insulators and flame retardants. Particularly, PVC is widely used in construction applications because it is easy to process and cheap. The production of PVC in Korea is estimated to be 400 thousand tons in 2016. However, PVC has some drawbacks owing to its low thermal stability and strength. The presence of labile chlorines and internal allyl chlorides reduces the thermal stability of PVC.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In view of this situation, the present inventors have undertaken extensive studies to overcome the above drawbacks, and as a result, found that when a nucleophilic thiol having mercapto functional groups is introduced in PVC, a PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite can be prepared with improved economic efficiency and compatibility and can be used in various applications due to its high thermal stability. The present invention has been achieved based on this finding.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a superhydrophobic coating composition including the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide a metallopolymer nanocomposite that is prepared by surface modification of the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite to achieve improved mechanical strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is another object of the present invention to provide anti-fouling coating compositions including the metallopolymer nanocomposites.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">It is still another object of the present invention to provide anti-fouling coatings formed by applying the anti-fouling coating compositions to substrates.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite including a core-forming metal ion, a nucleophilic thiol having three mercapto functional groups, and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a superhydrophobic coating composition including the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a metallopolymer nanocomposite surface modified with silica that is prepared by grafting the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite with a silane compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an anti-fouling coating composition including the modified metallopolymer nanocomposite.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an anti-fouling coating formed by applying the anti-fouling coating composition to a substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The metallopolymer nanocomposites of the present invention use PVC and include a nucleophilic thiol having mercapto functional groups introduced in the PVC, achieving high thermal stability. In addition, the metallopolymer nanocomposites exhibit superhydrophobic properties due to their structures and are highly thermally stable. Therefore, the metallopolymer nanocomposites can be used to prepare superhydrophobic coating compositions useful in a range of applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Furthermore, the metallopolymer nanocomposite surface modified with silica using a silane compound is highly thermally stable and has improved mechanical strength. The metallopolymer nanocomposite surface modified with silica exhibits excellent anti-fouling properties as well as very high mechanical strength when compared to conventional PVC films.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">0.1081 g (0.4 mmol) of FeCl<sub>3</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O was dissolved in 5.0 mL of double distilled water and 0.2558 g of TOAB as a phase transfer catalyst was dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water. The two separate solutions were combined in a flask and stirred at 1100 rpm under N<sub>2 </sub>purge for 15 min until phase separation occurred. The yellow organic layer was separated from the aqueous phase, transferred to another flask, and cooled to 0Â° C. under N<sub>2 </sub>purge.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0048">0.4787 g (1.2 mmol) of TMSH was added to the solution and stirred at 100 rpm for 24 h. An immediate color change was observed from yellow to green upon the addition of TMSH to the organic phase, indicating the conversion of Fe (III) to Fe (II). After stirring for 24 h, the solution was later changed to greenish-yellow. This solution is called an iron (II) mercaptopropionate (FeSH) precursor, simply âFeSH precursorâ.</p>

The solution of Fe (III) in distilled water (c) showed broad peaks at 212-250 nm and 310-370 nm. The solution of Fe (III) in toluene (d) was phase separated from the toluene-water mixture solution. For the solution (d), broad UV absorption peaks shifted to 212-278 nm and two new broad peaks appeared at 290-340 nm and 345-410 nm. For the TMSH monomer (e), a strong peak appeared at 235 nm. For the FeSH precursor (f) prepared by the reaction of the TMSH monomer and the Fe (III) solution in toluene, a broad band was shown in the range of 215-275 nm. Weak broad bands shifted to the ranges of 290-340 nm and 345-410 nm were observed because Fe (III) was reduced to Fe (II) by the mercapto functional groups. For PVCFeS after reaction for 30 min (g), the two broad bands of the FeSH precursor disappeared completely in the peaks of the PVCFeS metallopolymer and a new peak at 336 nm started to appear with increasing reaction time. This is due to the complete reaction of PVC with the mercapto functional groups present in the TMSH monomer. For PVCFeS after reaction for 6, 12, and 24 h (h-j), the sharp peak shifted to 220, 257, 263, and 270 nm and the weak peaks appeared at 204 and 208 nm with increasing reaction time. As the reaction proceeded, a slight increase in the intensity of the sharp peak at 220 nm and a slight shift of the peak to 224 nm were observed. Other strong peaks appeared at 253, 257, 263, 270, and 336 nm, which slightly increased with increasing reaction time.

This is attributed to the decomposition of the metallopolymer at the higher temperatures.

        <figref>FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> show the anti-fouling properties of the PVCFeS-SHSi metallopolymer coated on glass substrates and cured at 150Â° C. for 24 h. Specifically, <figref>FIG. 15</figref> shows the anti-fouling properties of the metallopolymer measured from a writing and erasing test using an oil based pen and ethanol, respectively. The test was repeated 10 times. <figref>FIG. 16</figref> shows the anti-fouling properties of the metallopolymer measured from a writing and erasing test using a water based pen and water, respectively. The test was repeated 10 times. <figref>FIG. 17</figref> shows the anti-fouling properties of the PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymer coated on a glass substrate and cured at 150Â° C. for 24 h, which were measured by repeating a writing (with an oil based pen) and erasing (with ethanol) test 10 times.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0115">Oil based pens marks on the uncoated glass substrate clearly remained and were not erased (see âUncoatedâ in <figref>FIGS. 15 and 17</figref>). When compared with <figref>FIGS. 9</figref> (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), no marks were left on the surface of the PVCFeS-SHSi metallopolymer despite 10 times of writing with both oil and water based pens and erasing with ethanol and the transparent state of the metallopolymer was maintained, demonstrating excellent anti-fouling properties of the metallopolymer. No marks were left on the surface of the PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymer despite the repeated writing and erasing with an oil based pen and ethanol, respectively, demonstrating excellent anti-fouling properties of the metallopolymer. Referring to <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, the superhydrophobic coating was not readily marked with a water based pen. The results of <figref>FIGS. 15 to 17</figref> indicate excellent anti-fouling properties and superior mechanical strength of the metallopolymers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Experimental Example 1</heading>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="1">Scratch Resistance Test</heading>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">The scratch resistance of the metallopolymers was tested using a Yoshimitsu pencil hardness tester D-221 according to the ASTM method (ASTM D 3363-74). Specifically, each of the PVC polymer and PVCFeS, PVCFeS-SHSi, and PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymers was spin coated on a glass substrate, cured at 80Â° C. and 150Â° C., and measured for pencil hardness.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">The PVC polymer showed good adhesive properties to a glass substrate and less hardness. When the PVC polymer was tested with a HB pencil, scratches remained, indicating very low hardness of the PVC polymer. The PVCFeS metallopolymer sample cured at 80Â° C. failed to reach F pencil hardness and showed very low mechanical strength. The PVCFeS metallopolymer sample cured at a higher temperature of 150Â° C. also failed to reach F pencil hardness but was found to have further improved scratch resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">These results show that the PVCFeS metallopolymer has very low mechanical strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">The surface modification with the silica monomer was found to enhance the mechanical strength (scratch resistance). When the PVCFeS-SHSi metallopolymer surface modified with the MPTMS monomer was spin coated on a glass substrate and cured at 80Â° C., it showed improved scratch resistance (<b>3</b> H). When the curing temperature was increased to 150Â° C., the scratch resistance was dramatically enhanced (above 8 H). This is believed to be due to the enhanced adhesive properties of the metallopolymer to the glass substrate at 150Â° C. The PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymer surface modified with the MTMS monomer showed a pencil hardness of 1 H when cured at 80Â° C., which increased to 4 H when cured at 150Â° C. Also in this case, the scratch resistance of the metallopolymer surface was improved by increasing the curing temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">The metallopolymer nanocomposite (PVCFeS metallopolymer) cured at 80Â° C. was highly transparent (85.7%), hydrophobic (142.65Â°Â±3.0Â°), and oleophobic (120.87Â°Â±2.2Â°). In contrast, the metallopolymer nanocomposite cured at 150Â° C. was less transparent (6.5%) and showed improved hydrophobic (143.27Â°Â±2.0Â°) and oleophobic properties (138.50Â°Â±3.0Â°). These results lead to the conclusion that the metallopolymer nanocomposite is highly thermally stable and has superhydrophobicity when coated.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">However, the metallopolymer nanocomposite failed to reach F pencil hardness, indicating low strength. In contrast, the metallopolymer nanocomposites surface modified with silica (the PVCFeS-SHSi and PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymers) showed transmittances of 87.0% and 67.5%, mechanical strengths of â§8H and â§4H, and contact angles for water of 112.20Â°Â±1.0Â° and 116.20Â°Â±2.0Â°, respectively. That is, the metallopolymer nanocomposites surface modified with silica can be used to form highly thermally stable, transparent, mechanically strong, and hydrophobic coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">Furthermore, from the writing and erasing test results using water and oil based pens, it could be confirmed that the PVCFeS-SHSi and PVCFeS-MeSi metallopolymers have excellent anti-fouling properties and high mechanical strength. Therefore, the use of the metallopolymer nanocomposites surface modified with silica enables the formation of coatings with excellent anti-fouling properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">As is apparent from the foregoing, the PVC-based metallopolymer nanocomposite of the present invention is expected to find application in various fields due to its high economic efficiency and compatibility. Particularly, the surface modified metallopolymer nanocomposite of the present invention has the advantages of high thermal stability and improved mechanical strength. Due to these advantages, the surface modified metallopolymer nanocomposite of the present invention is expected to find applications where superhydrophobicity and anti-fouling properties are required.</p>
