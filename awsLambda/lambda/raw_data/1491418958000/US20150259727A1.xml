      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention generally provides compositions and methods to detect and differentiate methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA) USA100, USA300, and USA600 strains. More particularly, the present invention provides assays based on identified SNPs, primers and probes, designed accordingly, to detect the presence of specific MRSA strains.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA) has become one of the most dangerous infectious agents in the U.S. and elsewhere, with a higher mortality rate than HIV-AIDS. MRSA is a strain of <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(<i>S. aureus</i>) bacteria, a common type of bacteria that may live on the skin and in the nasal passages of healthy people. MRSA does not respond to some of the antibiotics generally used to treat <i>staphylococcus </i>and other bacterial infections.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infections occur in people who are or have recently been in a hospital or other health-care facility. Many people may be at risk of MRSA infection due to receiving healthcare services in an environment where the MRSA bacteria are colonized on surfaces, healthcare workers, inpatients or outpatients. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections occur in otherwise healthy people who have not recently been in the hospital. In fact, MRSA has become a primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections among persons without extensive exposure to healthcare settings, and the outbreaks have occurred in athletic team facilities, correctional facilities, and military basic training camps.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is a molecular method for typing MRSA. It is used to identify index strain(s) of an outbreak or understand the clonal relationship among strains. The nonlimiting PFGE reference strains include USA100, USA200, USA300, USA400, USA500, USA600, USA700, USA800, USA1100 (see Network on Antimicrobial resistance in <i>S. aureus </i>(NARSA), available at UTL: narsa.net/). However, many isolates of MRSA are indistinguishable when compared using the standard PFGE typing method. This may present a problem when investigating local outbreaks of MRSA transmission in a healthcare setting.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Strains that are identified as belonging to the USA100, USA300, and USA600 strain types have specific clinical relevance. USA100 type strains are more likely to be HA-MRSA strains, typically have increased multi-drug resistance, and are not thought to be as virulent as USA300 type strains. USA300 type strains are more likely to be CA-MRSA, are less multi-drug resistant than USA100 strains, and typically have increased virulence. USA600 has been found to be associated with a higher than average mortality rate for MRSA, especially when associated with blood-stream infections.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Microbiological identification systems are based on different analytical techniques, such as phenotypic, genotypic, and strain typing. Each system has limitations due to method and/or database limitations and shortcomings in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, technical complexity, speed, and cost. Considering these limitations and the level of identification required as to genus, species, and strain, there is an ongoing need for strain typing technology to link cases together and identify sources of infection using more rapid and informative tests with a high level of accuracy. With such an invention, it would be possible to rapidly identify individuals who are colonized with MRSA, and thus interventions for MRSA colonization through decolonization, isolation procedures, or restrictions in occupational activities among clinicians and patients would be more effective.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">This disclosure provides genetic signatures specific to major strain types of MRSA (methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>). A real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) format, providing a straightforward, highly sensitive, specific assay system for rapidly typing strains is provided based on the signatures disclosed herein. The present invention discloses assays, methods and kits designed to identify and differentiate among USA100, USA300 and USA600 MRSA strains, which are considered clinically important.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">(I) Detection of MRSA Strains</heading>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">(a) Molecules Identifying and Differentiating MRSA Strains</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The resistance of <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>to <i>b</i>-lactam antibiotics is associated with the expression of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a). This protein is encoded by the mecA gene, which is situated on a mobile genetic element, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). Five different SCCmec types have been identified in methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus </i>(MRSA) strains. SCCmec types I, II and III are mainly found in hospital-acquired MSRA (HA-MRSA), whereas SCCmec types IV and V are mainly associated with community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). SCCmec contains the mec complex (mecA and its regulators) and the ccr gene complex, which encodes site-specific recombinases, responsible for the mobility of SCCmec.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">
        <i>S. aureus </i>can produce a number of virulence factors. Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is predominantly associated with severe skin infections and necrotizing pneumonia. Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a 29.1 kDa super-antigen that is encoded by the tst gene. The release of TSST-1 into the bloodstream may give rise to a variety of severe clinical conditions, like toxic shock syndrome (TSS). PVL, together with SCCmec type IV, is suggested to be a marker for CA-MRSA, although there are exceptions. Among the PFGE types (USA100, USA200, USA300, USA400, USA500, USA600, USA700, and USA800), for example, the PFGE typing of USA100 is PVL (â)/TSST (â)/SCCmec II (staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type II), PFGE typing of USA300 is PVL (+)/TSST (â)/SCCmec IV or PVL (â)/TSST(â)/SCCmec IV, and PFGE typing of USA600 is PVL(â)/TSST(â)/SCCmec II.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">(i) Species or Strain Specific Nucleic Acid Sequences</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Species or strain specific sequences are sequences unique to the species or strain, that is, not shared by other previously characterized species or strains. Oligonucleotides, such as a probe or primer, containing a sequence complementary to a sequence specific to a <i>S. aureus </i>strain will typically not hybridize to the corresponding portion of the genome of other species or strains under similar stringent conditions. The concept of oligonucleotides includes any DNA or RNA molecule of two or more nucleotides, whether from a natural source, chemically synthesized, or produced through DNA replication, reverse transcription, or a combination thereof. A nucleotide is an individual deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide base. Examples of nucleotides include but are not limited to: adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil, which may be abbreviated as A, T, G, C, or U in representations of oligonucleotide sequence. The length of the oligonucleotide depends on how the oligonucleotide will be used. One skilled in the art would understand the approximate length of oligonucleotide necessary in any given method. Depending on the method, an oligonucleotide may be 1 to 1000 bases in length. In other aspects, it may be 5 to 500 bases in length, 5 to 100 bases in length, 5 to 50 bases in length, or 10 to 30 bases in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">When a particular species or strain specific sequence is identified, strain specific probes or primer sets may be designed based on any part of that sequence. The probes or primers may be the entirety of that sequence. The probes or primers may also comprise part of or the entirety of that sequence along with other sequences or one or more additional nucleotides. The primers or probes designed according to particular species or strain sequence may also be represented in degenerate form, or comprising chemically modified nucleic acids, or any other components that facilitate the identification of the identifying sequence of a strain or species. The concept of a sequence identified to be specific to a species or strain further encompasses nucleic acid sequences that are less than 100% identical to the specific sequence, but are still capable of specifically detecting the species or strain. Note that in a nucleic acid sequence, T or U may be used interchangeably depending on whether the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. A sequence having less than 60% 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or 100% identity to the identifying sequence may still be encompassed by the invention if it is capable of binding to its complimentary sequence and/or facilitating nucleic acid amplification of a desired target sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The term âprimerâ refers to an oligonucleotide, whether occurring naturally as in a purified restriction digest or produced synthetically, which is capable of acting as a point of initiation of nucleic acid synthesis when placed under conditions in which synthesis of a primer extension product complementary to a template nucleic acid strand is induced, i.e., in the presence of nucleotides and an inducing agent such as DNA polymerase and at a suitable temperature and pH. The primer is preferably single-stranded for maximum efficiency in amplification. Alternatively, the primer is first treated to ensure that it is single-stranded before being used to prepare extension products. Preferably, the primer is an oligodeoxyribonucleotide. The primer must be sufficiently long to prime the synthesis of extension products in the presence of the inducing agent. The exact lengths of the primers will depend on many factors, including temperature, source of primer and the use of the method.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The strain specific sequences identified in various MRSA strains, including USA 100, 300, and 600, are disclosed in Table A, as SEQ ID NOs. 1, 3, 5 and 7. Specifically, each of these strain specific sequences comprises a strain specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), also called allelic identification herein, signifying the identity of a known or unknown MRSA strain. Loci in the FPR3757 reference genome with nucleotide variations containing allelic identifications include: 1531501=A or C; 1069320=A or G; 1053462=T or A; and 2595222=G or A, each of which represents the corresponding strain name listed in the first column in Table A. The concept of âalleleâ or âallelicâ is detailed below.</p>

      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">(ii) Alleles of Species or Strain Specific Nucleic Acids</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">Identifying alleles specific to a MRSA strain is another aspect of this invention. An allele includes any form of a particular nucleic acid that may be recognized as a form of existence of a particular nucleic acid on account of its location, sequence, modification, or any other characteristics that may identify it as being a particular existing form of that particular nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">Alleles include but need not be limited to forms of a nucleic acid that include point mutations, deletions, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), inversions, translocations, heterochromatic insertions, and differentially methylated sequences relative to a reference gene, whether alone or in combination. When a particular nucleic acid is a gene, the allele of this particular gene may or may not produce a functional protein; the functional protein thereof may or may not comprise a silent mutation, frame-shift mutation. The different alleles of a particular gene may each produce a protein with altered function, localization, stability, dimerization, or protein-protein interaction; may have overexpression, underexpression or no expression; may have altered temporal or spacial expression specificity. The presence or absence of an allele may be detected through the use of any process known in the art, including using primers and probes designed accordingly for PCR, sequencing, hybridization analyses. An allele may also be called a mutation or a mutant. An allele may be compared to another allele that may be termed a wild type form of an allele. In some cases, the wild type allele is more common than the mutant.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">As disclosed herein, 1531501=A allele identifies the host as a PFGE USA300 MRSA strain, whereas 1531501=C allele identifies the host as a non-USA300 MRSA strain; 1069320=A allele identifies the host as a PFGE USA300 MRSA strain, whereas 1069320=G identifies the host as a non-USA300 MRSA strain; 1053462=T allele identifies the host as a PFGE USA600 MRSA strain, whereas 1053462=A identifies the host as a non-USA600 MRSA strain; and 2595222=G allele identifies the host as a PFGE USA100 MRSA strain, whereas 2595222=A identifies the host as a non-USA10 MRSA strain (see Table A).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">(iii) Biomarkers as Indications of the Presence of Specific Species or Strain</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">Molecules, including but not limited to small RNAs, peptides and proteins, derived from transcription or translation processes of various MRSA strains specific to nucleic acid sequence alleles may serve as biomarkers indicating the presence of a particular species or strain. Some molecules that are produced by the immune system to defend against a particular MRSA strain, for example, may also serve as biomarkers. The presence of a particular species or strain may be indicated by the presence or absence of the biomarker, or a differential level of the biomarker. In one embodiment, the presence or absence of the biomarker may be determined by PCR, hybridization, sequencing, or any other methods known in the art. In one embodiment, methods of detecting an allele generally involve assessing the expression of material created from a genomic DNA template such as an RNA or protein molecule. Such expression may be assessed by any of a number of methods used currently in the art and yet to be developed.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">Once strain specific genes, alleles thereof, or other nucleic acid based biomarkers thereof, are identified, primers and probes may be designed to screen samples to specifically and selectively detect the presence or absence of these genes, alleles or biomarkers, and therefore, a particular strain of <i>Staphylococcus </i>may be determined through various methods including PCR-based (polymerase chain reaction-based) methods such as real-time PCR, quantitative PCR, quantitative real time PCR; allele specific ligation; comparative genomic hybridization; sequencing; and other methods known in the art. One aspect of the invention provides primers based on strain specific sequences in Table A for real-time PCR assays comprising one or more specific primer sets and probes depending on the application to differentiate between various MRSA strains.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">As to probes, they may be used for single probe analysis or multiplex probe/primer combined Real Time-PCR/PCR analysis. Oligonucleotide probes complimentary to a selected sequence within the target sequence may be designed. In one exemplary example, oligonucleotide probes facilitating Real Time-PCR/PCR product detection are complimentary to a selected sequence within the target sequence downstream from either the upstream or downstream primer. Therefore, these probes hybridize to an internal sequence of the amplified fragment of a targeted sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">One aspect of the present invention provides assays comprising primers and/or probes based on strain specific alleles that can be used to detect and/or differentiate different strains of MRSA, specifically USA100, USA300 and USA600 strains. An exemplary group of primers and probes based on strain specific alleles for detecting USA100 and non-USA100; USA300 and non-USA300; USA600 and non-USA600 is disclosed in Table B.</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0057">Samples often come with a mixture of bacterium species. The present invention discloses assays utilizing primer sets and/or probes, methods and kits designed to differentiate among various MRSA strains, including the USA100, USA300 and USA600 strains, in a sample using a single assay comprising a single set of primers and/or corresponding probes, or a multiplex assay comprising a combination of variable sets of primers and/or corresponding probes depending on the application.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0058">A sample subjected to the assays, methods or kits disclosed herein may or may not be suspected of containing a nucleic acid from a bacterium of interest. Nucleic acids may include but need not be limited to RNA, cDNA, tRNA, mitochondrial DNA, plasmid DNA, siRNA, genomic DNA, or any other naturally occurring or artificial nucleic acid molecule originating from a bacterium. Samples may be suspected of containing a bacterium if they are derived from a subject displaying symptoms of a bacterial infection, or from an environmental sample from an area in which a bacterium is thought to be endemic, or from a subject recently present in a hospital or other environment found to contain MRSA. A subject may or may not display signs or symptoms of MRSA infection, which include red, swollen and painful areas on the skin, drainage of pus or other fluids from the site, fever, skin abscesses, warmth around the infected area, chest pain, chills, cough, fatigue, malaise, headache, muscle ache, rash, and shortness of breath.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0059">A sample may be derived from anywhere that a bacterium or any part of a bacterium may be found, including but not limited to soil, air, water, solid surfaces (whether natural or artificial,) culture media, foodstuffs, devices, including devices used in medical procedures and/or bodily embellishment procedures (such as tattoo needles or body piercing needles). Additionally, a sample may be derived from a subject, or from agricultural, environmental, or any and all other sources.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">(II) Methods for Detecting MRSA Strains</heading>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0062">Methods that can be used to identify strain specific nucleic acids, alleles of strain specific nucleic acids, and biomarkers derived from transcriptional and translational products of the strain specific nucleic acids and the alleles thereof, include PCR, Real Time-PCR, hybridization, sequencing and any combination of the above methods. In one embodiment, the presence of the PCR or Real Time-PCR products in an assay may indicate the presence of one or more MRSA strain(s). In one embodiment, the PCR or Real Time-PCR products may be further identified or differentiated by hybridization undergoing simultaneously or subsequently with the PCR reactions. In another embodiment, the PCR or Real Time-PCR products may be sequenced to ascertain the existence of a particular allele indicative of the identity of the one or more MRSA strains in a sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0063">A nucleic acid may be added to a sample by any of a number of methods, including manual methods, mechanical methods, or any combination thereof. The presence of the allele may be signified by any of a number of methods, including amplification of a specific nucleic acid sequence, sequencing of a native or amplified nucleic acid, or the detection of a label either bound to or released from the nucleic acid. Addition of the nucleic acid to the sample also encompasses addition of the nucleic acid to a sample in which the target allele to which the nucleic acid has specificity is absent.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0064">(a) PCR</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0065">Nucleic acids may be selectively and specifically amplified from a template nucleic acid contained in a sample. In some nucleic amplification methods, the copies are generated exponentially. Examples of nucleic acid amplification methods known in the art include: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), ligase chain reaction (LCR), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), amplification with QÎ² replicase, whole genome amplification with enzymes such as Ï29, whole genome PCR, in vitro transcription with Klenow or any other RNA polymerase, or any other method by which copies of a desired sequence are generated.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0066">With PCR, it is possible to amplify a single copy of a specific target sequence in genomic DNA to a level detectable by several different methodologies (for example, hybridization with a labeled probe; incorporation of biotinylated primers followed by avidin-enzyme conjugate detection; incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates, such as dCTP or dATP, into the amplified segment). In addition to genomic DNA, any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequence can be amplified with an appropriate set of primer molecules. In particular, the amplified segments created by the PCR process itself are, themselves, efficient templates for subsequent PCR amplifications.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0067">PCR generally involves the mixing of a nucleic acid sample, two or more primers that are designed to recognize the template DNA, a DNA polymerase, which may be a thermostable DNA polymerase such as Taq or Pfu, and deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphates (dNTP's). Reverse transcription PCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR are other specific examples of PCR. In general, the reaction mixture is subjected to temperature cycles comprising a denaturation stage (typically 80-100Â° C.) an annealing stage with a temperature that is selected based on the melting temperature (Tm) of the primers and the degeneracy of the primers, and an extension stage (for example 40-75â² C). In real-time PCR analysis, additional reagents, methods, optical detection systems, and devices known in the art are used that allow a measurement of the magnitude of fluorescence in proportion to concentration of amplified DNA. In such analyses, incorporation of fluorescent dye into the amplified strands may be detected or measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0068">Alternatively, labeled probes that bind to a specific sequence during the annealing phase of the PCR may be used with primers. Labeled probes release their fluorescent tags during the extension phase so that the fluorescence level may be detected or measured. Generally, probes are complimentary to a sequence within the target sequence downstream from either the upstream or downstream primer. Probes may include one or more label. A label may be any substance capable of aiding a machine, detector, sensor, device, or enhanced or unenhanced human eye from differentiating a labeled composition from an unlabeled composition. Examples of labels include but are not limited to: a radioactive isotope or chelate thereof, dye (fluorescent or nonfluorescent,) stain, enzyme, or nonradioactive metal. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: fluorescein, biotin, digoxigenin, alkaline phosphatese, biotin, streptavidin, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, or any other compound capable of emitting radiation, rhodamine, 4-(4â²-dimethylamino-phenylazo)benzoic acid (âDabcylâ); 4-(4â²-dimethylamino-phenylazo)sulfonic acid (sulfonyl chloride) (âDabsylâ); 5-((2-aminoethyl)-amino)-naphtalene-1-sulfonic acid (âEDANSâ); Psoralene derivatives, haptens, cyanines, acridines, fluorescent rhodol derivatives, cholesterol derivatives; ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (âEDTAâ) and derivatives thereof or any other compound that may be differentially detected. The label may also include one or more fluorescent dyes optimized for use in genotyping. Examples of dyes facilitating the reading of the target amplification include, but are not limited to: CAL-Fluor Red 610, CAL-Fluor Orange 560, dR110, 5-FAM, 6FAM, dR6G, JOE, HEX, VIC, TET, dTAMRA, TAMRA, NED, dROX, PET, BHQ+, Go1d540, and LIZ.PCR facilitating the reading of the target amplification.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0069">Either primers or primers along with probes, as described above, will allow a quantification of the amount of specific template DNA present in the initial sample. In addition, RNA may be detected by PCR analysis by first creating a DNA template from RNA through a reverse transcriptase enzyme. In some aspects of the invention, the allele may be detected by quantitative PCR analysis facilitating genotyping analysis of the samples.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0070">As an exemplary example, the use of dual-labeled oligonucleotide probes in PCR reactions is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,784 to DiCesare. In the PCR step of the multiplex Real Time-PCR/PCR reaction of the present invention, the dual-labeled fluorescent oligonucleotide probe binds to the target nucleic acid between the flanking oligonucleotide primers during the annealing step of the PCR reaction. The 5â² end of the oligonucleotide probe contains the energy transfer donor fluorophore (reporter fluor) and the 3â² end contains the energy transfer acceptor fluorophore (quenching fluor). In the intact oligonucleotide probe, the 3â² quenching fluor quenches the fluorescence of the 5â² reporter fluor. However, when the oligonucleotide probe is bound to the target nucleic acid, the 5â² to 3â² exonuclease activity of the DNA polymerase, e.g., Taq DNA polymerase, will effectively digest the bound labeled oligonucleotide probe during the amplification step. Digestion of the oligonucleotide probe separates the 5â² reporter fluor from the blocking effect of the 3â² quenching fluor. The appearance of fluorescence by the reporter fluor is detected and monitored during the reaction, and the amount of detected fluorescence is proportional to the amount of fluorescent product released. Examples of apparatus suitable for detection include, e.g. Applied Biosystemsâ¢ 7900HT real-time PCR platform and Roche's 480 LightCycler, the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector using 96-well reaction plates or GENEAMP PC System 9600 or 9700 in 9600 emulation mode followed by analysis in the ABA Prism Sequence Detector or TAQMAN LS-50B PCR Detection System. The labeled probe facilitated multiplex Real Time-PCR/PCR can also be performed in other real-time PCR systems with multiplexing capabilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0071">âAmplificationâ is a special case of nucleic acid replication involving template specificity. It is to be contrasted with non-specific template replication (in other words, replication that is template-dependent but not dependent on a specific template). Template specificity is here distinguished from fidelity of replication (in other words, synthesis of the proper polynucleotide sequence) and nucleotide (ribo- or deoxyribo-) specificity. Template specificity is frequently described in terms of âtargetâ specificity. Target sequences are âtargetsâ in the sense that they are sought to be sorted out from other nucleic acid. Amplification techniques have been designed primarily for this sorting out.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0072">The term âtemplateâ refers to nucleic acid originating from a sample that is analyzed for the presence of a molecule of interest. In contrast, âbackground templateâ or âcontrolâ is used in reference to nucleic acid other than sample template that may or may not be present in a sample. Background template is most often inadvertent. It may be the result of carryover, or it may be due to the presence of nucleic acid contaminants sought to be purified away from the sample. For example, nucleic acids from organisms other than those to be detected may be present as background in a test sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0073">Template specificity is achieved in most amplification techniques by the choice of enzyme. Amplification enzymes are enzymes that, under the conditions in which they are used, will process only specific sequences of nucleic acid in a heterogeneous mixture of nucleic acid. Other nucleic acid will not be replicated by this amplification enzyme. Similarly, in the case of T7 RNA polymerase, this amplification enzyme has a stringent specificity for its own promoters (Chamberlin et al. (1970) Nature, 228:227). In the case of T4 DNA ligase, the enzyme will not ligate the two oligonucleotides or polynucleotides, where there is a mismatch between the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide substrate and the template at the ligation junction (Wu and Wallace (1989) Genomics, 4:560). Finally, Taq and Pfu polymerases, by virtue of their ability to function at high temperature, are found to display high specificity for the sequences bounded and thus defined by the primers; the high temperature results in thermodynamic conditions that favor primer hybridization with the target sequences and not hybridization with non-target sequences (H. A. Erlich (ed.) (1989) PCR Technology, Stockton Press).</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0074">The term âamplifiable nucleic acidâ refers to nucleic acids that may be amplified by any amplification method. It is contemplated that âamplifiable nucleic acidâ will usually comprise âsample template.â</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0075">The terms âPCR product,â âPCR fragment,â and âamplification productâ refer to the resultant mixture of compounds after two or more cycles of the PCR steps of denaturation, annealing and extension are complete. These terms encompass the case where there has been amplification of one or more segments of one or more target sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0076">One aspect of the invention provides a multiplex PCR assay to identify and differentiate MRSA strains. Multiplex PCR is a technique for amplification of multiple targets in a single PCR experiment. In a multiplexing assay, more than one target sequence can be amplified by using multiple primer pairs in a reaction mixture. As an extension to the practical use of PCR, this technique has the potential to produce considerable savings in time and effort within the laboratory without compromising on the utility of the experiment. Design of specific primer sets is essential for a successful multiplex reaction, and the factors to be considered include primer length, melting temperature, specificity, and primer dimerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0077">In some forms of multiplex PCR assays, relative quantification is often used to determine the changes in steady-state mRNA levels of a gene across multiple samples, and describe the level of mRNA in reference to the levels of an internal control RNA. The control RNA may be co-amplified in the same tube in a multiplex assay or may be amplified in a separate tube. Generally, the control RNA may be a house keeping gene, or gene with constitutive expression, or a standard with known concentration. In relative quantification, however, it does not require standards with known concentrations and the reference can be any transcript, as long as its sequence is known. Relative quantification is based on the expression levels of a target gene versus one or more reference gene(s), and in many experiments, it is adequate for investigating physiological changes in gene expression levels. To calculate the expression of a target gene in relation to an adequate reference gene, various mathematical models are established. Calculations are based on the comparison of the distinct cycle determined by various methods, e.g., crossing points (CP) and cycle threshold values (Ct) at a constant level of fluorescence; or CP acquisition according to established mathematic algorithm.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0078">The algorithm for Ct values in Real Time-PCR calculates the cycle at which each PCR amplification reaches a significant threshold. The calculated Ct value is proportional to the number of target copies present in the sample, and the Ct value is a precise quantitative measurement of the copies of the target found in any sample. In other words, Ct values represent the presence of respective target that the primer sets are designed to recognize. If the target is missing in a sample, there should be no amplification in the Real Time-PCR reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0079">Alternatively, the Cp value may be utilized. Cp value represents the cycle at which the increase of fluorescence is highest and where the logarithmic phase of a PCR begins. The LightCyclerÂ® 480 Software (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) calculates the second derivatives of entire amplification curves and determines where this value is at its maximum. By using the second-derivative algorithm, data obtained are more reliable and reproducible, even if fluorescence is relatively low.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0080">(b) Hybridization</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0081">In addition to PCR, genotyping analysis may also be performed using a probe that is capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid sequence of interest. The term âhybridizationâ refers to the pairing of complementary nucleic acids. Hybridization and the strength of hybridization (in other words, the strength of the association between the nucleic acids) is impacted by such factors as the degree of complementary between the nucleic acids, stringency of the conditions involved, the Tm of the formed hybrid, and the G:C ratio within the nucleic acids. A single molecule that contains pairing of complementary nucleic acids within its structure is said to be âself-hybridized.â</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0082">The terms âcomplementaryâ and âcomplementarityâ refer to polynucleotides (in other words, a sequence of nucleotides) related by the base-pairing rules. For example, for the sequence âA-G-T,â is complementary to the sequence âT-C-A.â Complementarity may be âpartial,â in which only some of the nucleic acids' bases are matched according to the base pairing rules. Or, there may be âcompleteâ or âtotalâ complementarity between the nucleic acids. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. This is of particular importance in amplification reactions, as well as detection methods that depend upon binding between nucleic acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0083">The term âhomologyâ when used in relation to nucleic acids refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (in other words, identity). âSequence identityâ refers to a measure of relatedness between two or more nucleic acids, and is given as a percentage with reference to the total comparison length. The identity calculation takes into account those nucleotide residues that are identical and in the same relative positions in their respective larger sequences. Calculations of identity may be performed by algorithms contained within computer programs such as âGAPâ (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.) and âALIGNâ (DNAStar, Madison, Wis.). A partially complementary sequence is one that at least partially inhibits (or competes with) a completely complementary sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is referred to using the functional term âsubstantially homologous.â The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or Northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or probe will compete for and inhibit the binding (in other words, the hybridization) of a sequence that is completely homologous to a target under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (in other words, selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (for example, less than about 30% identity); in the absence of non-specific binding the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0084">When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term âsubstantially homologousâ refers to any probe which can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low stringency as described infra.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0085">Low stringency conditions when used in reference to nucleic acid hybridization comprise conditions equivalent to binding or hybridization at 42Â° C. in a solution consisting of 5ÃSSPE (43.8 g/1 NaCl, 6.9 g/1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O and 1.85 g/1 EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), 0.1% SDS, 5ÃDenhardt's reagent [50ÃDenhardt's contains per 500 ml: 5 g Ficoll (Type 400, Pharmacia), 5 g BSA (Fraction V; Sigma)] and 100 Î¼g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA followed by washing in a solution comprising 5ÃSSPE, 0.1% SDS at 42Â° C. when a probe of about 500 nucleotides in length is employed.</p>

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0087">It is well known that numerous equivalent conditions may be employed to comprise low stringency conditions; factors such as the length and nature (DNA, RNA, base composition) of the probe and nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition, present in solution or immobilized, etc.) and the concentration of the salts and other components (for example, the presence or absence of formamide, dextran sulfate, polyethylene glycol) are considered and the hybridization solution may be varied to generate conditions of low stringency hybridization different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. In addition, the art knows conditions that promote hybridization under conditions of high stringency (for example, increasing the temperature of the hybridization and/or wash steps, the use of formamide in the hybridization solution, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0088">When used in reference to a double-stranded nucleic acid sequence such as a cDNA or genomic clone, the term âsubstantially homologousâ refers to any probe that can hybridize to either or both strands of the double-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low to high stringency as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0089">When used in reference to a single-stranded nucleic acid sequence, the term âsubstantially homologousâ refers to any probe that can hybridize (in other words, it is the complement of) the single-stranded nucleic acid sequence under conditions of low to high stringency as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0090">The term âTmâ refers to the âmelting temperatureâ of a nucleic acid. The melting temperature is the temperature at which a population of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules becomes half dissociated into single strands. The equation for calculating the Tm of nucleic acids is well known in the art. As indicated by standard references, a simple estimate of the Tm value may be calculated by the equation: Tm=81.5+0.41(% G+C), when a nucleic acid is in aqueous solution at 1 M NaCl (See for example, Anderson and Young, Quantitative Filter Hybridization (1985) in Nucleic Acid Hybridization). Other references include more sophisticated computations that take structural as well as sequence characteristics into account for the calculation of Tm.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0091">As used herein the term âstringencyâ refers to the conditions of temperature, ionic strength, and the presence of other compounds such as organic solvents, under which nucleic acid hybridizations are conducted. With âhigh stringencyâ conditions, nucleic acid base pairing will occur only between nucleic acid fragments that have a high frequency of complementary base sequences. Thus, conditions of âlowâ stringency are often required with nucleic acids that are derived from organisms that are genetically diverse, as the frequency of complementary sequences is usually less.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0092">Probes for hybridization may comprise nucleic acids, oligonucleotides (DNA or RNA), proteins, protein complexes, conjugates, natural ligands, small molecules, nanoparticles, or any combination of molecules that includes one or more of the above, or any other molecular entity capable of specific binding to any allele, whether such molecular entity exists now or is yet to be disclosed. In one aspect of the invention, the probe comprises an oligonucleotide. The description of oligonucleotide, as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0093">Under some circumstances, methods of detecting a gene or an allele may involve assessing their expression level through their transcriptional or translational products such as a RNA or protein molecule. The expression of a gene or an allele may be assessed by any of a number of methods used currently in the art and yet to be developed. Examples include any nucleic acid detection method, including the following nonlimiting examples, microarray analysis, RNA in situ hybridization, RNAse protection assay, Northern blot. Other examples include any process of detecting expression that uses an antibody including the following nonlimiting examples, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, Western blot, Northwestern blot, and immunoaffinity chromatography. Antibodies may be monoclonal, polyclonal, or any antibody fragment, for example, Fab, F(ab)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, scFv, phage display antibody, peptibody, multispecific ligand, or any other reagent with specific binding to a target. Other methods of assessing protein expression include the following nonlimiting examples: HPLC, mass spectrometry, protein microarray analysis, PAGE analysis, isoelectric focusing, 2-D gel electrophoresis, and enzymatic assays.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0094">In some aspects of the invention, the presence of an allele may be established by binding to probes in a media or on a microarray such as a DNA chip. Examples of DNA chips include chips in which a number of single stranded oligonucleotide probes are affixed to a solid substrate such as silicon glass. Oligonucleotides with a sequence complementary to an allele are capable of specifically binding to that allele to the exclusion of alleles that differ from the specific allele by one or more nucleotides. Labeled sample DNA is hybridized to the oligonucleotides and detection of the label is correlated with binding of the sample, and consequently, the presence of the allele in the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0095">In allele-specific hybridization, oligonucleotide sequences representing all possible variations at a polymorphic site are included on a chip. The chip and sample are subjected to conditions under which the labeled sample DNA will bind only to an oligonucleotide with an exact sequence match. In allele-specific primer extension, sample DNA hybridized to the chip may be used as a synthesis template with the affixed oligonucleotide as a primer. Under this method, only the added dNTP's are labeled. Incorporation of the labeled dNTP then serves as the signal indicating the presence of the allele. The fluorescent label may be detected by any of a number of instruments configured to read at least four different fluorescent labels on a DNA chip. In another alternative, the identity of the final dNTP added to the oligonucleotide may be assessed by mass spectrometry. In this alternative, the dNTP's may, but need not be labeled with a label of known molecular weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0096">A nucleic acid probe may be affixed to a substrate. Alternatively, a sample may be affixed to the substrate. A probe or sample may be covalently bound to the substrate or it may be bound by some non covalent interaction including electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, Van Der Waals, magnetic, or any other interaction by which a probe such as an oligonucleotide probe may be attached to a substrate while maintaining its ability to recognize the allele to which it has specificity. A substrate may be any solid or semi-solid material onto which a probe may be affixed, either singly or in the presence of one or more additional probes or samples as is exemplified in a microarray. Examples of substrate materials include but are not limited to polyvinyl, polysterene, polypropylene, polyester or any other plastic, glass, silicon dioxide or other silanes, hydrogels, gold, platinum, microbeads, micelles and other lipid formations, nitrocellulose, or nylon membranes. The substrate may take any form, including a spherical bead or flat surface. For example, the probe may be bound to a substrate in the case of an array or an in situ PCR reaction. The sample may be bound to a substrate in the case of a Southern Blot.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0097">A nucleic acid probe may include a label. A label may be any substance capable of aiding a machine, detector, sensor, device, or enhanced or unenhanced human eye from differentiating a labeled composition from an unlabeled composition. Examples of labels include, but are not limited to: a radioactive isotope or chelate thereof, dye (fluorescent or nonfluorescent,) stain, enzyme, or nonradioactive metal. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: fluorescein, biotin, digoxigenin, alkaline phosphatese, biotin, streptavidin, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, or any other compound capable of emitting radiation, rhodamine, 4-(4â²-dimethylamino-phenylazo)benzoic acid (âDabcylâ); 4-(4â²-dimethylamino-phenylazo)sulfonic acid (sulfonyl chloride) (âDabsylâ); 5-((2-aminoethyl)-amino)-naphtalene-1-sulfonic acid (âEDANSâ); Psoralene derivatives, haptens, cyanines, acridines, fluorescent rhodol derivatives, cholesterol derivatives; ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (âEDTAâ) and derivatives thereof, or any other compound that may be differentially detected. The label may also include one or more fluorescent dyes optimized for use in genotyping. Examples of such dyes include, but are not limited to: dR110, 5-FAM, 6FAM, dR6G, JOE, HEX, VIC, TET, dTAMRA, TAMRA, NED, dROX, PET, BHQ+, Go1d540, and LIZ.

      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0099">Methods of detecting the presence of a gene or an allele further include, but are not limited to, any form of DNA sequencing including Sanger, next generation sequencing, pyrosequencing, SOLID sequencing, massively parallel sequencing, pooled, and barcoded DNA sequencing or any other sequencing method now known or yet to be disclosed; or any other method that allows the detection of a particular nucleic acid sequence within a sample or enables the differentiation of one nucleic acid from another nucleic acid that differs from the first nucleic acid by one or more nucleotides, or any combination of these.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0100">In Sanger Sequencing, a single-stranded DNA template, a primer, a DNA polymerase, nucleotides and a label such as a radioactive label conjugated with the nucleotide base or a fluorescent label conjugated to the primer, and one chain terminator base comprising a dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, or ddTTP) are added to each of four reactions (one reaction for each of the chain terminator bases). The sequence may be determined by electrophoresis of the resulting strands. In dye terminator sequencing, each of the chain termination bases is labeled with a fluorescent label of a different wavelength which allows the sequencing to be performed in a single reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0101">In pyrosequencing, the addition of a base to a single stranded template to be sequenced by a polymerase results in the release of a phyrophosphate upon nucleotide incorporation. An ATP sulfurylase enzyme converts pyrophosphate into ATP which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin which results in the generation of visible light that is then detected by a camera.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0102">In SOLID sequencing, the molecule to be sequenced is fragmented and used to prepare a population of clonal magnetic beads (in which each bead is conjugated to a plurality of copies of a single fragment) with an adaptor sequence, and alternatively, a barcode sequence. The beads are bound to a glass surface. Sequencing is then performed through 2-base encoding.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0103">In massively parallel sequencing, randomly fragmented targeted DNA is attached to a surface. The fragments are extended and bridge amplified to create a flow cell with clusters, each with a plurality of copies of a single fragment sequence. The templates are sequenced by synthesizing the fragments in parallel. Bases are indicated by the release of a fluorescent dye correlating to the addition of the particular base to the fragment.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0114">This example describes the procedure, equipment, and reagents required to perform a multiplex real-time PCR on the LightcyclerÂ® 480 (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) instrument to identify and differentiate MRSA USA100, USA300, and USA600 strains.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0115">Items Required:</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0116">PerfeCTaÂ® MultiPlex qPCR SuperMix (Quanta Cat#95063, Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, Md.); Assay primers and probes; Molecular biology grade water; Microcentrifuge tubes; Optical reaction plates compatible with real-time instrument; Optical adhesive film and applicator; Micropipettes and tips; Template DNA and appropriate controls (gDNA from MRSA and CNS); Centrifuge with rotors for tubes and plates; LightcyclerÂ® 480.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0117">Reaction Preparation:</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0118">i. Color Compensation:</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0119">If running the assay for the first time on the instrument, a color compensation file must be generated. Reactions with at least 5 replicates of positive control DNA for each assay in singleton, and 5 total replicates of no template controls must be run. A color compensation file for this multiplex assay need only be generated once. See LC480 User's Manual for details. Prepare color compensation reactions as below.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0120">ii. Assay Procedure:</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0121">(1) calculate volume of mastermix needed (Reaction volumeÃnumber samplesÃ1.1); (2) mix reagents to that volume for a final reaction concentration of: 1Ã PerfeCTaÂ® MultiPlex qPCR SuperMix; 300 nM forward primer; 300 nM reverse primer; 125 nM probe; add water to bring volume so final concentrations are reached upon addition of template; (3) transfer array mastermix into optical reaction plate; (4) add control template: add MRSA DNA template to each of the single assay reaction well; add water to no template control reaction wells. For subsequent runs on the same instrument, no single assays need to be run. The color compensation file generated previously can be applied to all subsequent multiplex assays using these fluorophores.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0122">iii. Multiplex Setup:</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0123">(1) calculate volume of mastermix needed (reaction volumeÃnumber samplesÃ1.1); (2) mix reagents to that volume for a final concentration of: 1Ã PerfeCTaÂ® MultiPlex qPCR SuperMix; 300 nM each primer; 125 nM each probe; then add water to bring volume so final concentrations are reached upon addition of template; (3) transfer array mastermix into optical reaction plate; (4) add 0.5 to 10 ng DNA extracted from culture, and add more if DNA is extracted from specimens (optimization of template amount may be necessary); seal optical plate with optical adhesive film and spin down the liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0124">Thermal Cycling:</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0125">first, load plate onto instrument; then in LC480 software, create a new experiment with the following program: (1) in Detection Format menu select Multi Color Hydrolysis Probe; (2) select Customize and select colors accordingly; (3) enter proper reaction volume; (4) start run and name file. An exemplary program is illustrated here in Table 6:</p>
