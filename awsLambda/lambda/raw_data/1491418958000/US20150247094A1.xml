      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Separation methods for separating a feed material comprising solid mineral material, water and bitumen, wherein the feed material is derived from a process for recovering bitumen from oil sands.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Oil sands is essentially comprised of a matrix of bitumen, solid mineral material and water.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The bitumen component of oil sands includes hydrocarbons which are typically quite viscous at normal in situ temperatures and which act as a binder for the other components of the oil sands. For example, bitumen has been defined by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as a hydrocarbon with a viscosity greater than 10<sup>4 </sup>mPa s (at deposit temperature) and a density greater than 1000 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>at 15.6 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The solid mineral material component of oil sands typically consists of sand, rock, silt and clay. Solid mineral material may be present in oil sands as coarse mineral material or fine mineral material. The accepted division between coarse mineral material and fine mineral material is typically a particle size of about 44 microns. Solid mineral material having a particle size greater than about 44 microns is typically considered to be coarse mineral material, while solid mineral material having a particle size less than about 44 microns is typically considered to be fine mineral material. Sand and rock are generally present in oil sands as coarse mineral material, while silt and clay are generally present in oil sands as fine mineral material.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A typical deposit of oil sands may contain (by weight) about 10 percent bitumen, up to about 6 percent water, with the remainder being comprised of solid mineral material, which may include a relatively small amount of impurities such as humic matter and heavy minerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Water based technologies are typically used to extract bitumen from oil sands ore originating from the Athabasca area in northeastern Alberta, Canada. A variety of water based technologies exist, including the Clark âhot waterâ process and a variety of other processes which may use hot water, warm water or cold water in association with a variety of different separation apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a typical water based oil sands extraction process, the oil sands ore is first mixed with water to form an aqueous slurry. The slurry is then processed to release bitumen from within the oil sands matrix and prepare the bitumen for separation from the slurry, thereby providing a conditioned slurry. The conditioned slurry is then processed in one or more separation apparatus which promote the formation of a primary bitumen froth while rejecting coarse mineral material and much of the fine mineral material and water. The separation apparatus may also produce a middlings stream from which a secondary bitumen froth may be scavenged. This secondary bitumen froth may be added to the primary bitumen froth or may be kept separate from the primary bitumen froth.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A typical bitumen froth (comprising a primary bitumen froth and/or a secondary bitumen froth) may contain (by weight) about 60 percent bitumen, about 30 percent water and about 10 percent solid mineral material, wherein a large proportion of the solid mineral material is fine mineral material. The bitumen which is present in a typical bitumen froth is typically comprised of both non-asphaltenic material and asphaltenes.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">This bitumen froth is typically subjected to a froth treatment process in order to reduce its solid mineral material and water concentration by separating the bitumen froth into a bitumen product and froth treatment tailings.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a typical froth treatment process, the bitumen froth is diluted with a froth treatment diluent to provide a density gradient between the hydrocarbon phase and the water phase and to lower the viscosity of the hydrocarbon phase. The diluted bitumen froth is then subjected to separation by solvent extraction in one or more solvent extraction apparatus in order to produce the bitumen product and the froth treatment tailings. Exemplary solvent extraction apparatus include gravity settling vessels, inclined plate separators and centrifuges.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Some commercial froth treatment processes use naphthenic type diluents (defined as froth treatment diluents which consist essentially of or contain a significant amount of one or more aromatic compounds). Examples of naphthenic type diluents include toluene (a light aromatic compound) and naphtha, which may be comprised of both aromatic and non-aromatic compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Other commercial froth treatment processes use paraffinic type diluents (defined as froth treatment diluents which consist essentially of or contain significant amounts of one or more relatively short-chained aliphatic compounds). Examples of paraffinic type diluents are C4 to C8 aliphatic compounds and natural gas condensate, which typically contains short-chained aliphatic compounds and may also contain small amounts of aromatic compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Froth treatment processes which use naphthenic type diluents (i.e., naphthenic froth treatment processes) typically result in a relatively high bitumen recovery (perhaps about 98 percent), but also typically result in a bitumen product which has a relatively high solid mineral material and water concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Froth treatment processes which use paraffinic type diluents (i.e., paraffinic froth treatment processes) typically result in a relatively lower bitumen recovery (in comparison with naphthenic froth treatment processes), and in a bitumen product which has a relatively lower solid mineral material and water concentration (in comparison with naphthenic froth treatment processes). Both the relatively lower bitumen recovery and the relatively lower solid mineral material and water concentration may be attributable to the phenomenon of asphaltene precipitation, which occurs in paraffinic froth treatment processes when the concentration of the paraffinic type diluent exceeds a critical level. This asphaltene precipitation results in bitumen being lost to the froth treatment tailings, but also provides a cleaning effect in which the precipitating asphaltenes trap solid mineral material and water as they precipitate, thereby separating the solid mineral material and the water from the bitumen froth.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Froth treatment tailings therefore typically contain solid mineral material, water, froth treatment diluent, and small amounts of residual bitumen (perhaps about 2-12 percent of the bitumen which was contained in the original bitumen froth, depending upon whether the froth treatment process uses a naphthenic type diluent or a paraffinic type diluent).</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Much of the residual froth treatment diluent remaining in froth treatment tailings is typically recovered from the froth treatment tailings in a tailings solvent recovery unit (TSRU). The froth treatment tailings (including the tailings bitumen) are then typically disposed of in a tailings pond.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">A significant amount of bitumen from the original oil sands ore is therefore typically lost to the froth treatment tailings as residual bitumen. There are both environmental incentives and economic incentives for recovering all or a portion of this residual bitumen.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In addition, the solid mineral material which is included in the froth treatment tailings comprises an amount of heavy minerals. Heavy minerals are typically considered to be solid mineral material which has a specific gravity greater than that of quartz (i.e., a specific gravity greater than about 2.65). The heavy minerals in the solid mineral material which is contained in typical froth treatment tailings may include titanium bearing minerals such as rutile (TiO<sub>2</sub>), anatase (TiO<sub>2</sub>), ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>) and leucoxene (typically an alteration product of ilmenite) and zirconium bearing minerals such as zircon (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>). Titanium and zirconium bearing minerals are typically used as feedstocks for manufacturing engineered materials due to their inherent properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Although oil sands ore may contain a relatively low concentration of heavy minerals, it is known that these heavy minerals tend to concentrate in the bitumen froth which is extracted from the oil sands ore, and therefore become concentrated in the froth treatment tailings which result from froth treatment processes, primarily as coarse mineral material. As a result, froth treatment tailings may typically contain a sufficient concentration of heavy minerals to provide an economic incentive to recover these heavy minerals from the froth treatment tailings.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Froth treatment tailings may be further processed to recover bitumen and/or heavy minerals therefrom. Froth treatment tailings may be further processed as âwhole tailingsâ, or froth treatment tailings may be separated and fractions of the separated froth treatment tailings may be further processed. Examples in the art of methods for further processing froth treatment tailings to recover bitumen and/or heavy minerals therefrom may be found in Canadian Patent No. 2,426,113 (Reeves et al), Canadian Patent Application No. 2,548,006 (Erasmus et al), and Canadian Patent Application No. 2,662,346 (Moran et al).</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">There remains a need in the art for methods for separating feed materials comprising solid mineral material, water and bitumen, wherein the feed materials are derived from a process for recovering bitumen from oil sands, and wherein representative feed materials may include (but are not limited to) a bitumen froth, whole froth treatment tailings, and/or fractions of whole froth treatment tailings.</p>

      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0117">The present invention is directed at methods for separating a feed material comprising solid mineral material, water and bitumen, wherein the feed material is derived from a process for recovering bitumen from oil sands. The feed material may consist of, may consist essentially of, or may be comprised of a bitumen froth, whole froth treatment tailings, a fraction of whole froth treatment tailings, and/or any other suitable material derived from oil sands.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0118">The methods of the invention are solvent extraction methods which are performed in one or more solvent extraction stages.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0119">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are hereafter described with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in which a coarse mineral material fraction and a fine mineral material fraction of froth treatment tailings are both processed using the methods of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0120">In the exemplary embodiments depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the froth treatment tailings result from a process for recovering bitumen from oil sands. In the exemplary embodiments, the process for recovering bitumen from oil sands is comprised of producing a bitumen froth from the oil sands and is further comprised of separating the froth treatment tailings from the bitumen froth in a froth treatment process.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0121">A typical bitumen froth may be comprised of about 60 percent bitumen, about 30 percent water and about 10 percent solid mineral material by weight. Bitumen froth may therefore be characterized generally as containing, in decreasing order of amount by weight: (1) bitumen; (2) water; and (3) solid mineral material.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0122">Typical froth treatment tailings may be comprised of between about 3 percent and about 12 percent bitumen and froth treatment diluent (if the froth treatment tailings contain a froth treatment diluent), between about 15 percent and about 20 percent solid mineral material, with the balance being comprised primarily of water. Froth treatment tailings may therefore be characterized generally as containing, in decreasing order of amount by weight: (1) water; (2) solid mineral material; and (3) bitumen.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0123">In the exemplary embodiments depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the froth treatment tailings may or may not contain a froth treatment diluent. For example, the froth treatment tailings may result from a froth treatment process in which no froth treatment diluent is used, or the froth treatment tailings may have been subjected to a tailings solvent recovery unit (TSRU) process or a similar process in which substantially all of the froth treatment diluent has been recovered from the froth treatment tailings.</p>

It may also be desirable to subject the extract (<b>174</b>) to a diluent recovery process (not shown) in order to recover at least a portion of the diluent from the extract (<b>174</b>) in order to facilitate recycling of the diluent before processing, storing and/or transporting the extract (<b>174</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0249">In some embodiments, all or a portion of the extract (<b>174</b>) may be provided to the solvent extraction (<b>68</b>) relating to the fine mineral material fraction (<b>24</b>) to provide or to supplement the hydrocarbon diluent (<b>108</b>) which is added in the solvent extraction (<b>68</b>). Providing all or a portion of the extract (<b>174</b>) to the solvent extraction (<b>68</b>) may reduce the amount of fresh hydrocarbon diluent (<b>108</b>) which must be added in the solvent extraction (<b>68</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0250">Following the solvent extraction (<b>170</b>), the raffinate (<b>172</b>) may be further processed to recover the heavy minerals which are contained therein. It may also be desirable to subject the raffinate (<b>172</b>) to a diluent recovery process (not shown) in order to reduce the diluent concentration of the raffinate (<b>172</b>) before attempting to recover the heavy minerals therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0251">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a material balance for a pilot plant scale experiment is provided for a method for processing a fine mineral material fraction (<b>24</b>) of froth treatment tailings (<b>20</b>) in accordance with the methods of the invention. Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a material balance for a pilot plant scale experiment is provided for a method for processing a coarse mineral material fraction (<b>22</b>) of froth treatment tailings (<b>20</b>) in accordance with methods of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0252">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the first stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 3.10 kilograms per minute, the second stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 2.90 kilograms per minute, the first overflow product withdrawal rate is 0.34 kilograms per minute, and the introduction rate of the hydrocarbon diluent (<b>108</b>) is 0.32 kilograms per minute. It is noted that the differential between the first stage underflow product withdrawal rate and the second stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 0.20 kilograms per minute. The differential is therefore less than both the first overflow product withdrawal rate and the introduction rate of the hydrocarbon diluent (<b>108</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0253">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the first stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 0.44 kilograms per minute, the second stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 0.35 kilograms per minute, the third stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 0.35 kilograms per minute, the first overflow product withdrawal rate is 0.045 kilograms per minute, and the introduction rate of the hydrocarbon diluent (<b>244</b>) is 0.06 kilograms per minute. It is noted that the differential between the first stage underflow product withdrawal rate and the third stage underflow product withdrawal rate is 0.09 kilograms per minute. The differential is therefore greater than both the first overflow product withdrawal rate and the introduction rate of the hydrocarbon diluent (<b>244</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0254">As described herein, the present invention is directed at solvent extraction separation methods. In some embodiments, the present invention is more particularly directed at withdrawing an intra-stage recycle component from one or more solvent extraction stages. In some embodiments, the present invention is more particularly directed at providing that an underflow product withdrawal rate in at least one of the solvent extraction stages other than the final solvent extraction stage is greater than the underflow product withdrawal rate in the final solvent extraction stage so that there is a differential between the underflow product withdrawal rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0255">Both of these aspects of the invention are directed toward improving multiphase separation processes which can be complicated by interphase developments such as emulsions, rag layers, sludges, etc. and at improving the separation of the bitumen phase in the solvent extraction stages.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0256">Both of these aspects of the invention may potentially provide improved process efficiencies in that relatively less hydrocarbon diluent may potentially be necessary in the processes and/or the size of the processes may potentially be reduced, by ultimately reducing the amount of hydrocarbon diluent which is required to achieve a desired standard of performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0257">In the intra-stage recycle aspect of the invention, providing an intra-stage recycle component creates an opportunity to remove interphase developments such as rag material from the solvent extraction apparatus and transferring such material to a mixer where it may be treated with mechanical energy and potentially be shifted to a new equilibrium that may be less prone to developing such interphase developments. Providing an intra-stage recycle component may also provide a further benefit of reducing the solid mineral material concentration in the solvent extraction apparatus, thereby reducing the viscosity of the bitumen phase in the solvent extraction apparatus and potentially improving the separation in the solvent extraction apparatus and potentially improving the quality of the extract produced by the solvent extraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0258">In the underflow component withdrawal rate differential aspect of the invention, the relatively higher underflow component withdrawal rate in an upstream solvent extraction stage causes a reduction in the residence time, primarily of the underflow component in the solvent extraction apparatus, which may potentially âdrawâ some interphase developments such as rag material to the underflow component, thereby potentially reducing an accumulation of rag material in the solvent extraction apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0259">In the practice of the invention, the phenomenon of rag material accumulation may in some embodiments be controlled by monitoring the fluid density in the solvent extraction apparatus and increasing the underflow component withdrawal rate from the solvent extraction apparatus if the fluid density of the material in the solvent extraction apparatus increases above a desired value. In some embodiments, the fluid density may be monitored by monitoring the fluid density of the intra-stage recycle component.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0260">In the underflow component withdrawal rate differential aspect of the invention, transferring âadditionalâ underflow material to the downstream solvent extraction stage also provides an opportunity for more mechanical energy to be imparted to the potentially problematic underflow material and in a countercurrent process, allows such underflow material to be subjected to an increased hydrocarbon diluent concentration in the downstream solvent extraction stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0261">This increased hydrocarbon diluent concentration may assist in reducing the amount of rag material (by shifting to a new phase equilibrium), may provide improved settling in the downstream solvent extraction apparatus because of the increased dilution of the material in the downstream solvent extraction apparatus. This may in turn result in an improved quality of the overflow component which is produced in the downstream solvent extraction apparatus. If this improved quality overflow component is recycled back to the previous solvent extraction stage, the improved quality of the overflow component may assist in minimizing interphase development such as rag material in the previous solvent extraction stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0262">In the underflow component withdrawal rate differential aspect of the invention, maintaining the underflow component withdrawal rate in the final solvent extraction stage at a lower rate relative to the underflow component withdrawal rate in one or more of the upstream solvent extraction stages provides for a relatively greater overflow component withdrawal rate in the final solvent extraction stage. In a countercurrent process, where the overflow component from the final solvent extraction stage is recycled back to the previous solvent extraction stage, the relatively greater overflow component withdrawal rate in the final solvent extraction stage provides an increased opportunity to dilute the material in the previous solvent extraction stage and provides potentially improved separation in the previous solvent extraction stage, which may result in an improved quality of the overflow component in the previous solvent extraction stage by increasing the bitumen phase residence time in the previous solvent extraction stage.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0263">In this document, the word âcomprisingâ is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article âaâ does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the elements is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be one and only one of the elements.</p>
