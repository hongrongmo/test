      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application makes no priority claim.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate generally to parts racks used with assembly lines, and more specifically to collapsible racks that are stackable whether in a collapsed or upright position.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many forms of racks, stands, shelves and other such support structures, hereinafter referred to simply as âracks,â have been used for holding articles. Portable racks are used in manufacturing environments to deliver parts to an assembly line for inclusion in or preparation for inclusion in a manufacturing product. Racks are also used to provide uniform storage for articles, parts or components, and further in situations in which transportation and delivery of such items is needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Racks are numerous in design, and attempts to improve upon them have been made in the past to suit a variety of needs. One general improvement has been to provide for collapsible racks that may be collapsed, folded or dismantled when not in use, primarily to reduce to the space needed to transport empty racks back to their point of origin. Another general improvement has been to provide for stackable racks that are configured to be stacked vertically on top of other similar racks to utilize space in storage and transportation circumstances.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In both cases, rack designs have been used that provide various advantages and disadvantages to the user. For example, some designs have utilized foldable opposing end frames that, while providing strength and stability, interfere with the rack surface when in a collapsed position. This becomes a disadvantage in manufacturing situations wherein it is preferable for the rack surface of the topmost rack in a vertical stack to be freely accessible to assembly line workers or machines picking parts and components from the rack for utilization on the assembly line. Therefore, it is preferable for racks to be collapsible so that structural components do not interfere with the rack surfaces or the parts stored thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Other racks designs provide collapsibility via dismantling. However, this is not desirable for situations in which quick and safe removal of the rack from an active area is needed, as is the case for assembly lines. Disaggregate rack components may pose a safety hazard if not secured properly in and around assembly line areas, and on board transportation vehicles. Furthermore, separable components generally result in much longer breakdown times for racks. For these reasons, racks with removable components are not favored.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Various hinge or bearing mechanisms have been used to enable folding of leg or frame structures relative to the rack surface or base. It has also been recognized that it is desirous for safety and convenience reasons to avoid bearing designs in which components protrude from the jointed areas which may in turn catch on clothing, machinery, or the articles or parts themselves. To avoid such issues, some designs have utilized a leg or post configuration wherein the leg or support posts slide into or around another structural component of the rack. These designs have often suffered from shaky stability due to loose-fitting parts. Various elaborate mating cuts and welded components have been introduced to increase strength and stability of such configurations, but at the cost of increased production difficulty, expense and complication, and often introduce disadvantages such as protruding components that are undesirable for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It is therefore an unmet need in the prior art for a collapsible rack that is stackable upon other similar racks when in both the upright and collapsed positions, that has foldable legs that do not interfere with or inhibit access to the rack surface when in the collapsed position, has movable components that remain within the footprint of the rack regardless of position, that has a hinging mechanism that contains no protruding parts and requires no welding or intricate mating surface finishing, that has no separable, removable parts, and that may be quickly collapsed and unfolded in a safe manner.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">One object of the invention is to provide a collapsible and portable rack that is stackable upon other similar racks whether any one rack is in an upright (e.g., unfolded or active) or a collapsed (e.g., folded or inactive) position.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a rack with a shelf having a top surface and a perimeter, and further at least three leg assemblies distributed symmetrically about the perimeter, wherein each leg assembly is provided with a leg footer affixed to the perimeter and having a proximal end, a distal end and a bearing bracket at the proximal end, a leg member having a proximal end and a distal end wherein the proximal end of the leg member is shaped to be received into the bearing bracket, and a slider pivot bearing joining the leg member to the bearing bracket at a pivot axis and having a journal in contact with a linear bearing surface and a circular bearing surface, wherein the slider pivot bearing constrains, via the journal, the pivot axis to linear motion along the linear bearing surface and axial rotation along the circular bearing surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack with a retaining tab protruding from the leg member and a notch in the bearing bracket shaped to receive the retaining tab, thereby locking the slider pivot bearing against axial rotation when the leg member is in an upright position.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Further objects of the invention are provided in racks having an upright position wherein the leg member extends vertically from the leg footer wherein the retaining tab is retained within the notch, and a collapsed position wherein the leg member is slid upward so that the retaining tab is released from the notch and the leg member is pivoted into a horizontal position, thereby extending horizontally from an opening in the leg footer body.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a leg footer with a stacking socket at the distal end of the leg footer sized to receive from a second rack for stacking thereon a distal end of a leg member or a proximal end of a leg footer.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Another object of the invention is provided in a rack with at least two leg assembly pairs spaced apart about the perimeter, wherein each leg assembly pair comprises a first leg assembly and a second leg assembly joined by a primary connecting frame element that forms a portion of the perimeter. Racks may also be provided with a secondary connecting frame element joining perimetrically adjacent leg assembly pairs in the at least two leg assembly pairs, wherein the secondary connecting frame element forms a portion of the perimeter.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack wherein the journal is carried by a shaft pin coaxial with the pivot axis, the linear bearing surface being an interior surface of a slot through the leg member and the circular bearing surface being an interior surface of a hole through the bearing bracket of the leg footer. Alternatively, the linear bearing surface may be an interior surface of a slot through the bearing bracket of the leg footer and the circular bearing surface may be an interior surface of a hole through the leg member.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack with spaced apart fork guides affixed to the rack in parallel beneath the shelf.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack with a plurality of tie-downs affixed to the rack, a plurality of mounting brackets affixed to the shelf, and a plurality of mounting holes through the shelf.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack with a shelf having a top surface, a perimeter and a geometric center, and further a plurality of leg assemblies distributed about the perimeter in rotational symmetry with respect to the geometric center. Each leg assembly has a leg member having an outer surface, a maximum leg member width, a proximal end and a distal end, and further includes a bearing surface being closed and extending through the proximal end of the leg member, and a retaining tab protruding from the outer surface longitudinally between the bearing surface and the distal end of the leg member body. Each leg assembly further has a leg footer having a proximal end and a distal end, is affixed to the perimeter, and further includes a tubular shell body having an interior shape sized to receive the proximal end of the leg member, a notch sized to receive the retaining tab formed in and open to the proximal end of the leg footer, a bearing surface being closed and extending through the proximal end of the leg footer, an opening in the leg footer extending longitudinally from the proximal end of the leg footer having a transverse width greater than the maximum leg member width, and a stacking socket extending from the distal end of the leg footer sized to receive from a second rack for stacking thereon a distal end of a leg member or a proximal end of a leg footer. Each leg assembly further includes a slider pivot bearing connecting the proximal end of the leg member to the proximal end of the leg footer and has a shaft pin secured within the bearing surface of the leg footer and the bearing surface of the leg member wherein the proximal end of the leg member is contained within the tubular shell of the leg footer, the leg member being thereby movable between the upright position and the collapsed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Another object of the invention is provided wherein the bearing surface of the leg footer is a circular bearing surface being an interior surface of a hole and the bearing surface of the leg member is a linear bearing surface being an interior surface of a slot, whereby the shaft pin constrains the leg member to linear motion with respect to the shaft pin, and the leg footer and leg member are constrained to axial rotation about the shaft pin with respect to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Another object of the invention is provided wherein the bearing surface of the leg member is a circular bearing surface being an interior surface of a hole and the bearing surface of the leg footer is a linear bearing surface being an interior surface of a slot, whereby the shaft pin is constrained to linear motion with respect to the leg footer, and the leg footer and leg member are constrained to axial rotation about the shaft pin with respect to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">It is another object of the invention to provide a rack with a shelf having a top surface and a first and second pair of parallel sides together forming a perimeter, and further pair of primary support structures each having a pair of leg assemblies. Each leg assembly has a leg member having a proximal end and a distal end, and further includes a leg member body having a pair of opposing sides each having an outer surface and together defining a maximum leg member width there between, a pair of slots in the pair of opposing sides and extending longitudinally from the proximal end of the leg member, and a retaining tab protruding from the outer surface of each opposing side and located longitudinally between the slot and the distal end of the leg member. Each leg assembly is further provided with a leg footer having a proximal end and a distal end, and further includes a leg footer body having a U-channel shell with two parallel sides defining an interior diameter greater than the maximum leg member width, a perpendicular side joining the two parallel sides and an open side, further a notch sized to receive the retaining tab formed in and open to the proximal end of the leg footer on each parallel side of the leg footer body, a hole formed in the proximal end of the leg footer on each parallel side of the leg footer body, and a stacking socket at the distal end of the leg footer sized to receive from a second rack for stacking thereon a distal end of a leg member or a proximal end of a leg footer body.

The rack <b>10</b> has a shelf <b>12</b> with a top surface <b>14</b> on which various articles or parts and components thereof (not shown) may be placed for storage, transport or the like. Preferably, the shelf <b>12</b> includes a single continuous top surface <b>14</b>, but may also be provided as a series of slats, as a lattice structure, or other such discontinuous surface configurations. The shelf <b>12</b> depicted in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is substantially rectangular in shape, but can be any shape desired that is practicable for stability of the rack <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">At least three leg assemblies <b>16</b> are included and distributed about the perimeter <b>18</b> of the shelf <b>12</b>. The leg assemblies <b>16</b> are preferably distributed symmetrically about the perimeter <b>18</b> to ensure stability and to assist in achieving proper orientation of the racks with respect to other racks during stacking. As explained in further detail below, the exemplary embodiment of the rack <b>10</b> shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>6</b> is rotationally symmetric at 180 degrees, in part aligning open ends (see the discussion of <figref>FIG. 7</figref> provided below) of stacked racks.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The leg assemblies <b>16</b> each include a leg footer <b>20</b>, a leg member <b>22</b> and a slider pivot bearing (see <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>), which joins the leg footer and leg member together with two degrees of freedom. Each leg assembly <b>16</b> is fixed to the shelf perimeter <b>18</b> at its leg footer <b>20</b>. When in the upright position (as shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>6</b>), the proximal end of the leg member <b>22</b> fits within the proximal end of the corresponding leg footer <b>20</b>. Therefore, at least a portion of the leg footer <b>20</b> must be sufficiently open at its proximal end so that the proximal end of the leg member <b>22</b> may be inserted and connected therein. Portions of the leg footer <b>20</b> and up to the entire leg member <b>22</b> may thus be constructed of solid material, although it is preferred that both the leg member <b>22</b> and the leg footer <b>20</b> are both formed of tubular (i.e., hollow) material to reduce the overall weight of the rack <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">It is preferred that the leg member <b>22</b> be formed as an elongate square- or rectangular-shaped body, but those skilled in the art will recognize that other shapes are readily employed. Regardless of the leg member shape, the leg member will have a maximum leg member width that must be accommodated by the leg footer as further defined below.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The proximal end of the leg footer <b>20</b> also includes a horizontal opening so that the leg member <b>22</b> may be rotated into the collapsed position without interference from the leg footer <b>20</b> structure, thereby extending horizontally away from the leg footer <b>20</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The horizontal opening may be embodied as a bearing bracket situated at the proximal end of the leg footer, which serves as the slider pivot bearing connection point for the leg footer and permits movement of the leg member between the upright and collapsed position. For the purposes of this disclosure, a âbearing bracketâ is defined as at least two opposing sides of a leg footer at its proximal end spaced apart so as to receive the proximal end of the leg member therebetween. It is preferred that a bearing bracket have at least one additional side connecting the opposing sides in order to prevent leg member rotation outwardly from the rack. Bearing brackets may be welded or fastened onto the proximal end of the leg footer, orâfor leg footers that are constructed from tubular structures, three-sided U-channel shells or the likeâthe bearing bracket may simply be embodied as an integral portion of the leg footer body.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The leg footer <b>20</b> may optionally and preferably be provided as a three-sided U-channel shell having two parallel sides defining an interior diameter greater than the maximum leg member width, a perpendicular side joining the two parallel sides, and an open side, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>. The bearing bracket in this exemplary embodiment encompasses the proximal ends of the two parallel sides <b>24</b> and the perpendicular side <b>26</b>, and is sized to receive the proximal end of the leg member <b>22</b> therein. If the rack is intended for carrying heavy articles such as transmissions, engine blocks or the like, it is preferable that the rack components are constructed of aluminum or steel alloy, but other materials such as lightweight but durable plastic, metals, alloys or combinations thereof may be used, as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In preferred embodiments square steel tubing is used to form the leg footers and members, however the use of a particular material is not intended nor considered to be limiting herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The slider pivot bearing consists of the features that join the proximal ends of each leg footer <b>20</b> and leg member <b>22</b> in a leg assembly <b>16</b> thereby allowing rotational motion of the leg member <b>22</b> with respect to the leg footer <b>20</b>, and linear motion of either the leg footer <b>20</b> or the leg member <b>22</b> with respect to the other. That is, the slider pivot bearing permits axial rotation of the leg member <b>22</b> about a pivot axis, and further permits linear motion of either the leg footer <b>20</b> or the leg member <b>22</b> with respect to the pivot axis, depending on the configuration. The location of a pivot axis for one of the leg assemblies in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is illustrated by the broken line <b>28</b> extending through the proximal ends of the leg footer and leg member. A slider pivot bearing includes a journal, or other such friction bearing surface that is in contact with a linear bearing surface and a circular bearing surface in order to constrain movement of the leg assembly components to the two degrees of freedom described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Preferably, a shaft pin <b>30</b> coaxial with the pivot axis <b>24</b> carries the journal surface that contacts the linear and circular bearing surfaces and joins the proximal ends of the leg footers <b>20</b> and leg members <b>22</b>. The shaft pin <b>30</b> is shown generally as a capped axle secured through the leg footers <b>20</b> and the leg members <b>22</b>, and may comprise a locking pin, grooved clevis pin and retaining clamp configuration, axle and tension or cotter pin configuration, self-locking pin/axle, welded pin or the like. A preferred embodiment utilizes a welded pin for the shaft pin. Alternatively, as opposed to the preferred method of connecting the leg footer and member together with a separate pin secured through the components of the leg assembly, an axle may be fixed with respect to either the leg footer or the leg member in either a single or split axle configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Further details and optional exemplary embodiments of the slider pivot bearing are depicted in connection with <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> is an exploded view of a first exemplary embodiment of the slider pivot bearing for leg assembly <b>16</b><i>a </i>in which the shaft pin is a grooved clevis pin <b>32</b> and retaining clip <b>34</b>, the linear bearing surface <b>36</b> is the interior surface of a slot <b>38</b> through the leg member <b>22</b>, and the circular bearing surface <b>40</b> is the interior surface of a hole <b>42</b> through the leg footer <b>20</b>. The linear bearing surface <b>36</b> extends longitudinally along the sides of the leg member <b>22</b> and constrains the leg member <b>22</b> to linear motion with respect to the pin <b>32</b>, as well as axial rotation about the pin <b>32</b>. The circular bearing surface <b>40</b> of this embodiment is coaxial with the pivot axis, thereby fixing the pin <b>32</b> and constraining its movement with respect to the leg footer <b>20</b> to axial rotation only. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that in some embodiments the pin <b>32</b> may be fixed in all degrees of freedom with respect to the leg footer <b>20</b>, if desired. The slider pivot bearing is assembled by inserting the proximal end of the leg member <b>22</b> into the interior of the leg footer <b>20</b> and securing the pin <b>32</b> through the hole <b>42</b> and slot <b>38</b> with the retaining clip <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In some embodiments of the invented rack, the leg members include at least one retaining tab <b>44</b> protruding from the side, and corresponding notches <b>46</b> in the proximal ends of the leg footer or its bearing bracket portion <b>20</b> shaped to receive the retaining tabs <b>44</b> to lock the slider pivot bearing against axial rotation when the leg member <b>22</b> is in the upright position. For added stability when in the upright position, it is preferred that two opposing retaining tabs <b>44</b> be employed on each leg member <b>22</b>, for example one on each of the two opposing sides of a bearing bracket. Such opposing retaining tabs <b>44</b> are clearly depicted in the view shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, for instance. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a leg member retaining tab and the correspondingly-shaped leg footer notch can be any general shape so long as lowering the leg member while in a vertical position engages the retaining tab with the notch such that axial rotation of the leg member is prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Some embodiments also include a stacking socket <b>48</b> at the distal end of the leg footer <b>20</b>. The stacking socket <b>48</b> is a cavity sized for receiving the distal end of a leg member <b>22</b> when the rack <b>10</b> is stacked upon another similarly configured rack that is in the upright position, and the proximal end of a leg footer <b>20</b> when stacked upon another rack that is in the collapsed position. The stacking socket <b>48</b> is preferably provided as a flared end cap defining a cavity <b>49</b> and affixed at the distal end of the leg footer <b>20</b>. The stacking socket <b>48</b> should provide a sufficient barrier to lateral movement (e.g., the stacking socket walls) of the rack <b>10</b> when stacked upon other similar racks to prevent tipping or sliding from stacked positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">
        <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> is an exploded view of a second exemplary embodiment of a slider pivot bearing configuration for leg assembly <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other configurations may be employed to achieve the constraint of motion to the two degrees of freedom as disclosed herein, and the use of alternative axle and bearing surface configurations that are equivalent to those disclosed explicitly are considered encompassed by this disclosure. The leg assembly <b>16</b><i>b </i>in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> similar to the leg assembly in <b>16</b><i>a </i>in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> except that the former utilizes a clevis pin <b>50</b> and cotter pin <b>52</b> configuration to provide a journal for the linear and circular bearing surfaces. In this embodiment, the linear bearing surface <b>54</b> is the interior surface of a slot <b>56</b> through the leg footer <b>20</b>, and the circular bearing surface <b>58</b> is the interior surface of a hole <b>60</b> through the leg member <b>22</b>. This configuration linearly fixes the leg member <b>22</b> with respect to the pin <b>50</b>, allowing the pin <b>50</b> linear motion along the vertically oriented slot <b>56</b> in the leg footer <b>20</b>. As with the embodiment shown in connection with <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the leg member <b>20</b> may be lifted vertically from its upright position, whereby the pin <b>50</b> slides upwardly from the bottom to the top of the slot <b>56</b> until the retaining tabs <b>44</b> are no longer retained within the notches <b>46</b>, and the leg member <b>22</b> is rotated to the collapsed position, extending horizontally away from the leg footer <b>20</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of two exemplary racks of a second embodiment <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> stacked and in the collapsed and position and a third exemplary rack <b>74</b> between the upright and collapsed position. The top rack <b>74</b> leg assemblies <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> and <b>80</b> are configured similarly to that depicted in connection with <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, and with the exception of leg assembly <b>82</b> are all in the collapsed position wherein the leg members <b>22</b> extend horizontally away from their corresponding leg footer <b>20</b>. The arrows associated with the upright leg assembly <b>82</b> illustrate the process of collapsing the leg member <b>22</b>, wherein it is lifted upwardly to clear the retaining tabs <b>44</b> from their notches <b>46</b> and then rotated down to rest on the shelf perimeter <b>18</b>. The vertical broken lines between the top rack <b>74</b> and the middle rack <b>72</b> illustrate the stacking of the racks wherein the distal end <b>84</b> of the leg footers of the middle rack are received into the stacking sockets <b>48</b> of the top rack <b>74</b>, which rests thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The racks <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> also illustrate that some embodiments may be further provided with leg assembly pairs spaced apart about the shelf perimeter. The top rack <b>74</b>, for example, is provided with two leg assembly pairs: a first pair formed by the front two leg assemblies <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, and a second pair formed by the back two leg assemblies <b>80</b> and <b>82</b>. The leg assemblies in each leg assembly pair are joined together by a primary connecting frame element (e.g., <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>) that forms a portion of the shelf perimeter <b>18</b>. In a leg assembly pair, the leg assemblies are positioned so that each leg member <b>22</b> in the leg assembly pair rotates toward the opposing leg assembly and rests upon the primary connecting frame element when in the collapsed position. For the second leg assembly pair shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, for instance, the back two leg assemblies <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are connected by a primary connecting frame element <b>88</b> and the leg member <b>22</b> of the left leg assembly <b>82</b> collapses to rest along the primary frame element <b>88</b> toward the right leg assembly <b>80</b>, and vise versa.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The use of primary connecting frame elements such as <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>, wherein those elements form a portion of the shelf perimeter <b>18</b>, is the preferred method of securing the leg assemblies to the shelf <b>12</b>. The use of connecting frame elements in general is preferred to provide increased load carrying capacity and even distribution of the load among the leg assemblies. Further secondary connecting frame elements, such as <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> for instance, may be secured between perimetrically consecutive leg assembly pairs and form additional portions of the shelf perimeter <b>18</b>. In embodiments for which connecting frame elements are employed (e.g., <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>), it is preferred to affix those elements to the shelf <b>12</b> along each side to form the shelf perimeter <b>18</b>. Preferred embodiments employ a lip <b>94</b> around top surface <b>14</b> of the shelf <b>12</b> welded to the primary (<b>86</b> and <b>88</b>) or secondary (<b>90</b> and <b>92</b>) connecting frame elements, or bothâhowever those skilled in the art will appreciate that the manner of affixation may vary depending upon application and expected load characteristics. Furthermore, reinforcing frame elements, such as element <b>96</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, may be optionally included in some exemplary embodiments to assist in load distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Traversing the perimeter <b>18</b> of the shelf <b>12</b>, the use of inwardly-facing leg assembly pairs allows for one or more open sides (âopen endsâ in the case of four-sided embodiments), where an âopen sideâ is a portion of the perimeter that is free of leg members when the leg assemblies are in a collapsed position. The top rack <b>74</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> exhibits open ends corresponding to secondary connecting frame elements <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>. The existence of open ends in an embodiment allows for the attachment of optional features that may be used to secure parts to the racks for shipping and storage purposes, for example, including but not limited to tie-downs <b>98</b> for straps and the like. Such optional features may be permanently or temporarily affixed to the open ends without interfering with the leg members <b>22</b> when in the collapsed position. Alternatively, excluding any features on the open sides will permit free access to the parts on the shelf <b>12</b> without regard to leg assembly positioning.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Some embodiments are provided with one or more optional spaced apart fork guides. For example, the top rack <b>74</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> includes one set of spaced apart fork guides <b>100</b>, affixed to the rack <b>74</b> in parallel beneath the shelf <b>12</b> and providing targets and support for the rack <b>74</b> to sit upon the forks of a traditional forklift apparatus used for moving the rack <b>74</b>. The exemplary embodiment of the rack <b>10</b> shown in FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>-<b>6</b> is alternatively provided with two pairs of spaced apart fork guides with one pair providing guides in the front-to-back position <b>102</b>, and one pair providing guides in the side-to-side position <b>104</b>. It should be noted that, the term âpair of spaced apart fork guidesâ does not require continuous guides, but may be provided as guides that are discontinuous across the bottom of the shelf <b>12</b> to lower the overall rack <b>10</b> weight (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, for instance). <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a bottom view of an exemplary embodiment depicting the use of two pairs of spaced apart fork guides.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">It is preferred, as shown in the exemplary embodiments herein, to employ a four-sided rectangular shelf <b>12</b> with two primary connecting frame elements and two secondary connecting frame elements forming the shelf perimeter <b>18</b> so that, when several racks are stacked in the upright position, the leg assemblies of the top most rack may be collapsed, leaving two open ends as freely accessible to assembly line operations. Upon exhausting the parts held on the top most rack, the collapsed rack can be quickly removed and placed upon a second stack of collapsed racks out of the way of the assembly line operations. Such configurations are also useful in shipping and storage situations to permit unloaded racks to be stacked, stored or transported safely and with little floor space required.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">It is further preferred to provide optional mounting brackets <b>106</b>, interior tie-downs (similar to the tie-downs <b>98</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>), mounting holes <b>108</b> or a combination thereof on the top surface of the rack <b>74</b>, as in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, in order to secure form fitting inserts (not shown) to the top surface <b>14</b> for temporary affixation of heavy parts or parts with non-uniform or curved bottom surfaces (e.g., transmission casings) to the shelf <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Any embodiment of the present invention may include any of the optional or preferred features of the other embodiments of the present invention. The exemplary embodiments herein disclosed are not intended to be exhaustive or to unnecessarily limit the scope of the invention. The exemplary embodiments were chosen and described in order to explain some of the principles of the present invention so that others skilled in the art may practice the invention. Having shown and described exemplary embodiments of the present invention, those skilled in the art will realize that many variations and modifications may be made to the described invention. Many of those variations and modifications will provide the same result and fall within the spirit of the claimed invention. It is the intention, therefore, to limit the invention only as indicated by the scope of the claims.</p>
