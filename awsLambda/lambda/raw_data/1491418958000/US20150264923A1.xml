      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">Copending patent application PCT/EP2012/056766, filed on 13 Apr. 2012 and published on 15 Nov. 2012 as WO 2012/152527 A2 (Syngenta Participations AG), discloses an liquid emulsifiable concentrate composition comprising a mixture of: pinoxaden, a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>alkyl ester or a 2-(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkoxy)C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>alkyl-ester of fluroxypyr, and a built-in phosphate and/or phosphonate adjuvant; wherein the built-in phosphate and/or phosphonate adjuvant comprises a tris-[C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>alkyl or 2-(C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>alkoxy)C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>alkyl-]ester of phosphoric acid (preferably tris-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate) and/or a bis-(C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>alkyl) ester of a C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>12</sub>alkyl-phosphonic acid. In WO 2012/152527 A2, most preferably, the ester of fluroxypyr is the 1-methylheptyl ester of fluroxypyr, also named fluroxypyr-meptyl. WO 2012/152527 A2 also discloses methods for controlling and/or inhibiting the growth of <i>dicotyledonous and/or broadleaf weeds, such as weeds from the genus Kochia, Polygonum, Fallopia, Salsola, Descurainia, Helianthus, Lactuca, Sinapsis </i>and/or <i>Amaranthus</i>, e.g. using the emulsifiable concentrate composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0010">WO 2008/049618 A2 (Syngenta Participations AG) discloses a liquid herbicidal composition containing pinoxaden and an adjuvant, where the adjuvant is a built-in adjuvant consisting of a tris-ester of phosphoric acid with aliphatic or aromatic alcohols and/or a bis-ester of alkyl phosphonic acids with aliphatic or aromatic alcohols. WO 2008/049618 discloses the following preferred built-in adjuvants: the tris-ester of phosphoric acid is preferably tris-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate, tris-n-octyl phosphate or tris-butoxyethyl phosphate; and the bis-ester of alkyl phosphonic acids is preferably bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-(2-ethylhexyl)-phosphonate, bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-(n-octyl)-phosphonate, dibutyl-butyl phosphonate or bis(2-ethylhexyl)-tripropylene-phosphonate. WO 2008/049618 (e.g. pages 7-9 thereof) discloses that Example 1 Compositions A and B thereinâwhich are emulsifiable concentrate (EC) compositions containing 5% or 6.9% w/v pinoxaden (as the herbicide), 1.25% or 1.725% w/v cloquintocet-mexyl (as a safener), 5% w/v castor oil ethoxylate (30 EO) and 2% w/v calcium alkylbenzene sulfonate (as two emulsifiers), 34% or 32% w/v tris-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate (as the built-in adjuvant), 18% w/v tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (as a first solvent), and the remainder as a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons (as a second solvent)âshowed an enhanced chemical stability of pinoxaden, in comparison to other pinoxaden EC formulations containing different built-in adjuvants. The good herbicidal efficacy of the pinoxaden on the grassy weeds from the genera <i>Alopecurus, Apera, Avena, Lolium</i>, and <i>Phalaris </i>was also maintained (see WO 2008/049618, Example 3, pages 10-11). WO 2008/049618 discloses on page 6 that the weeds to be controlled may be both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, such as, for example, <i>Stellaria, Apera, Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Echinochloa, Bromus, Alopecurus, Phalaris, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Convolvulus, Chrysanthemum, Papaver, Cirsium, Polygonum, Matricaria, Galium, Viola and Veronica</i>. WO 2008/049618 discloses on page 5 that a further co-herbicide in addition to pinoxaden can optionally be incorporated into the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0011">In the pinoxaden compositions disclosed in WO 2008/049618 Example 1 Compositions A and B (pages 7-9 therein), the mixture of aromatic solvents used is typically a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons (see WO 2008/049618 page 4 paragraph 3), for example Solvessoâ¢ such as Solvessoâ¢ 200 ND.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">Heavy aromatic solvents such as Solvessoâ¢, usually containing inter alia C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>alkyl-naphthalenes, have the potential to cause human lung damage following oral ingestion, if part of the solvents pass down the human trachea (i.e. there is a potential aspiration hazard). Therefore, a liquid agrochemical (e.g. EC) composition containing heavy aromatic solvents has the potential that some of the solvent therein might reach and possibly damage the human lungs after accidental oral ingestion of the liquid (e.g. EC) composition by a user such as a farmer. Therefore, it can be preferable to use a thickener in the liquid agrochemical (e.g. EC) compositionâpreferably, the thickener is dissolved in the heavy aromatic solvents. The thickener increases the viscosity of the liquid agrochemical (e.g. EC) composition, reducing the potential for entry to the human lungs and any potential damage caused therein, after accidental oral ingestion.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">It is also possible, though it is not confirmed, that the use of a dissolved thickener in the heavy aromatic solvents, such as Solvessoâ¢, might somewhat reduce human skin penetration of the solvents and/or of a liquid agrochemical composition containing such solvents, e.g. after accidental spillage by a user onto the skin, for example in the event that a significant amount of unsubstituted naphthalene (which is a good skin penetration agent) is present in the heavy aromatic solvents (which is not preferred).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">For the pinoxaden compositions disclosed in WO 2008/049618 Example 1 Compositions A and B (pages 7-9 therein) containing tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol as the first solvent, when a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons such as Solvessoâ¢ 200 ND is chosen as the second (aromatic) solvent, a suitable thickener (e.g. for use in Europe) has been found to be polystyrene, typically present at about 0.5% w/v of the pinoxaden EC and/or present as STYRON 666D CLEARâ¢ (see e.g. Reference Formulation Example 14 hereinafter). This works well because polystyrene, in the relevant concentrations, is soluble in typical mixtures of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol+heavy aromatic hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">In certain countries such as European Union countries, it is now thought to be preferred to replace the tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (âTHFAâ) solvent used in known pinoxaden EC compositions (e.g. as disclosed in WO 2007/073933 or WO 2008/049618) with a different solvent, or to reduce the amount of THFA, for environmental, regulatory and/or other related reasons.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0016">However, it has been found that when the alcoholic solvent in the pinoxaden EC composition is changed from tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol to hexylene glycol (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), the polystyrene thickener is not sufficiently soluble at relevant concentrations in typical mixtures of hexylene glycol+heavy aromatic hydrocarbons. The polystyrene dissolves in the mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons, but when the hexylene glycol is added the polystyrene generally precipitates out of solution, usually to form a sticky insoluble mass which may block pipes and filters. This makes polystyrene less useful and not very suitable as a thickener in EC compositions containing a mixture of hexylene glycol+heavy aromatic hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">A large number of alternative substances were tested as potential thickeners, but almost all of them were found not to be suitable as thickeners for a solvent system comprising hexylene glycol and heavy aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures, usually because, like polystyrene, they were insufficiently soluble in this particular solvent system, with the solubility in the hexylene glycol component of the solvent system being thought to be the main problem.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0018">Finally, after much testing, it has been found that a thickener comprising a polymer of isobutyl methacrylate is soluble in, and so is a suitable thickener for, a solvent system comprising: (i) hexylene glycol and (ii) heavy aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures (specifically, Solvessoâ¢). This discovery has enabled a suitable pinoxaden EC composition containing this solvent system and this thickener to be made which is herbicidally efficacious against grassy weeds sensitive to pinoxaden, and which suitable for commercialization in countries where the presence of the thickener in heavy-aromatic-hydrocarbon-containing agrochemical compositions is desirable or mandated.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0019">The combination of (a) the solvent system comprising hexylene glycol (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) and heavy aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures and (b) the poly(isobutyl methacrylate) thickener is also thought to be generally useful in liquid agrochemical compositions (in particular emulsifiable concentrates), independent of which agrochemically active ingredient(s) is or are present in the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0020">Further, the poly(isobutyl methacrylate) thickener is also thought to be, or is likely to be, preferable to (i.e. more soluble than) polystyrene in solvent systems containing heavy aromatic hydrocarbon mixtures combined with other alcoholic organic solvents suitable for liquid compositions such as emulsifiable concentrates (e.g. pinoxaden-containing ECs), such as: benzyl alcohol, diacetone alcohol (2-methyl-4-oxo-pentane-2-ol, also named 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone), n-hexanol, n-octanol, 2-ethyl-hexanol, cyclohexanol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, or ethylene glycol, or possibly other alcohols such as isobutanol, n-pentanol or n-heptanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0021">It is also possible that a variety of alkyl (e.g. C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl such as C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>5 </sub>alkyl) methacrylate polymers might also be suitable thickeners for liquid agrochemical compositions, e.g. containing the above-mentioned solvent systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0022">Therefore, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid agrochemical (preferably herbicidal) composition, preferably in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), comprising a mixture of:</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0023">(a) one or more agrochemically active ingredients (preferably comprising one or more herbicides);</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0024">(b) a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl methacrylate polymer (preferably an isobutyl methacrylate polymer); and</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0025">(c) a solvent system comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>(c1) an alcohol solvent comprising hexylene glycol (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), benzyl alcohol, diacetone alcohol (2-methyl-4-oxo-pentane-2-ol, or 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone), isobutanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-heptanol, n-octanol, 2-ethyl-hexanol, cyclohexanol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol, or a mixture of two or more of these alcohols; and</li><li>(c2) a heavy aromatic hydrocarbon solvent.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0028">Preferably, in the first aspect of the invention, the liquid agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition, in particular in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), contains substantially no water (in particular less than 1% w/w of water, more particularly less than 0.5% w/w, e.g. equal to or less than 0.2% w/w, by weight of the liquid agrochemical (preferably herbicidal) composition).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0029">Turning now to a further (second) aspect of the invention: Known agrochemical emulsifiable concentrate (EC) compositions often have at least 1 non-ionic surfactant/emulsifier and at least 1 ionic (e.g. anionic) surfactant/emulsifier. This is to maximize the chance of obtaining stable emulsion droplets after the EC is mixed with water, because the two different surfactant classes have different ways of stabilizing droplets. For example, the pinoxaden-containing EC compositions disclosed as Example 1 Compositions A and B and Example 2 Compositions G, H and I on pages 7-10 of WO 2008/049618 A2 contain 5% w/v castor oil ethoxylate (30EO), a non-ionic emulsifier, and 2% w/v of alkylbenzenesulfonate calcium salt, an anionic emulsifier. Similarly, Example 1 (EC1-3) and Examples 2, 3, 5 and 6 on pages 5-8 of WO 2007/073933 A2 disclose pinoxaden ECs with 1 or 2 nonionic emulsifiers and 1 anionic emulsifier.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0030">However, in a further (second) aspect of the invention, a surfactant system comprising three specific non-ionic surfactants has now been discovered, which is believed to be a particularly suitable surfactant system for agrochemical liquid (e.g. emulsifiable concentrate, EC) compositons, and, in particular, which is a particularly suitable surfactant system for pinoxaden-containing EC compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0031">Therefore, according to the second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid agrochemical (preferably herbicidal) composition, preferably in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), comprising a mixture of:</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0032">(a) one or more agrochemically active ingredients (preferably comprising one or more herbicides); and</p>

      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0037">Preferably, in the second aspect of the invention, the liquid agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition, in particular in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), contains substantially no water (in particular less than 1% w/w of water, more particularly less than 0.5% w/w, e.g. equal to or less than 0.2% w/w, by weight of the liquid agrochemical e.g. herbicidal composition).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0038">In a preferable embodiment of the invention, the features of the first and second aspects of the invention are combined in a or the liquid agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0039">A further (third) aspect of the invention has also been discovered in the context of removing tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (âTHFAâ)) from pinoxaden and florasulam containing emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) such as Compositions G and I from page 10 of WO 2008/049618 A2. THFA is an excellent solvent for pinoxaden, florasulam and clodinafop-propargyl, and when removed from the EC it was found that two solvents are generally required to replace it in order to keep all active ingredients (e.g. pinoxaden, florasulam, and optionally clodinafop-propargyl) dissolved in the EC. In this third aspect of the invention, a new solvent system comprising an alkylene carbonate such as 1,2-propylene carbonate (combined with a defined alcohol solvent, most preferably benzyl alcohol) has been discovered, which is believed to be a particularly suitable solvent system for agrochemical (herbicidal) liquid (e.g. EC) compositions comprising pinoxaden, florasulam or an agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, or clodinafop-propargyl, or (more preferably) a combination of pinoxaden, and florasulam or an agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, and optionally clodinafop-propargyl. It has been found that 1,2-propylene carbonate is an excellent solvent for florasulam but only a moderately good solvent for pinoxaden. Benzyl alcohol is a excellent solvent for pinoxaden (up to about 55% w/w pinoxaden dissolves in benzyl alcohol at 20Â° C.) but benzyl alcohol is only a moderately good solvent for florasulam. Therefore, a combination of 1,2-propylene carbonate and benzyl alcohol (in practice also combined with a heavy aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as Solvessoâ¢) was used to solubilize both the pinoxaden and the florasulam fully and reliably in the EC. It is also thought likely that other agrochemically-acceptable alcohol solvents which are good solvents for pinoxaden should also work in this invention, in particular: hexylene glycol (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) (in which up to ca. 21.1% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), diacetone alcohol (2-methyl-4-oxo-pentane-2-ol, or 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, in which up to ca. 27.5% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), isobutanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol (in which up to ca. 25-30% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), n-heptanol, n-octanol (in which up to ca. 15.3% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), 2-ethyl-hexanol (in which up to ca. 18.7% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), cyclohexanol (in which up to ca. 19.8% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), dipropylene glycol (in which up to ca. 11.4% w/w pinoxaden dissolves at 20Â° C.), diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, or dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, or a mixture of two or more alcohols selected from the previously-mentioned alcohols and benzyl alcohol.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0040">In this third aspect of the invention, it was time-consuming and difficult to discover that the present alkylene carbonate and alcohol containing solvent system was a suitable solvent system (not requiring tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (âTHFAâ)) for pinoxaden and florasulam or an agrochemically acceptable salt thereof, especially considering special and/or difficult considerations regarding solubilizing florasulam. Other agrochemically active ingredients e.g. herbicides might benefit as well from this new solvent system, in particular metosulam, diclosulam, or cloransulam-methyl, all of which are in the same triazolopyrimidine sulfonamide class of ALS inhibitor herbicides as florasulam, and which are thought likely to have somewhat similar or acceptably good solubilities in 1,2-propylene carbonate.</p>

For such viscosity measurements, measurements of viscosity are taken at different rotational speeds of the composition at a specified tested temperature (preferably 40Â° C.), which typically show the dependency of the viscosity on the rotational speed (or shear rate), e.g. in the viscosimeter or rheometer, at the tested temperature. The kinematic viscosity is determined (e.g. by the viscosimeter or rheometer) by dividing the absolute viscosity by the density of the fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0102">A typical method for measuring kinematic viscosity, e.g. of a or the liquid (or first) agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition, is as follows. This method is and/or has been used by the patent applicant in the laboratory. Preferably, a Rheoplus Physicaâ¢ MCR 301 rheometer or viscosimeter (e.g. available from Anton Paar), or a functionally-equivalent rheometer or viscosimeter, is used. Approximately 80 mL (or, alternatively, approximately 19 mL) of the liquid (or first) agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition is transferred to a or the cylinder of the viscosimeter (or rheometer). The spindle of the viscosimeter (or rheometer) is then submerged and the sample of the composition is heated up to 40Â° C. and kept at this temperature for 30 minutes. Then, the spindle starts rotation with gradually increasing speed (rotational speed or shear rate), starting from 0 s<sup>â1 </sup>and gradually increasing to 300 s<sup>â1 </sup>(preferably within 120 seconds); when the maximum rotation is reached the spindle slows down from 300 s<sup>â1 </sup>to 0 s<sup>â1 </sup>while measuring and documenting various measurement points of viscosity at different rotational speeds. After cooling down to 20Â° C. one can remove the sample of the composition. In such viscosity measurements, the measurement points show the dependency of the viscosity on the rotational speed (or shear rate) of the composition, at the tested temperature. The viscosimeter (or rheometer) determines the kinematic viscosity by dividing the absolute viscosity by the density of the fluid.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0104">A suitable method for measuring density is OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals No. 109 (1995) [âOECD 109â], according to which: The density is determined by means of an oscillating density meter. The measuring equipment is calibrated using deionized water and air. The test sample is injected by a syringe into the density meter where the sample is equilibrated to the appropriate temperature. Then the reading of the density meter is recorded.</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0215">The term âcropsâ is to be understood as also including crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides (for example ALS, GS, EPSPS, PPO and HPPD inhibitors) as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has been rendered tolerant e.g. to imidazolinones, such as imazamox, by conventional methods of breeding is ClearfieldÂ® summer rape (Canola). Examples of crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by genetic engineering methods include e.g. glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties commercially available under the trade names RoundupReadyÂ® and LibertyLinkÂ®. Crops are also to be understood as being those which have been rendered resistant to harmful insects by genetic engineering methods, for example Bt maize (resistant to European corn borer), Bt cotton (resistant to cotton boll weevil) and also Bt potatoes (resistant to Colorado beetle). Examples of Bt maize are the Bt-176 maize hybrids of NKÂ® (Syngenta Seeds). The Bt toxin is a protein that is formed naturally by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>soil bacteria. Examples of toxins and transgenic plants able to synthesise such toxins are described in EP-A-451 878, EP-A-374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, WO 03/052073 and EP-A-427 529. Examples of transgenic plants that contain one or more genes which code for an insecticidal resistance and express one or more toxins are KnockOutÂ® (maize), Yield GardÂ® (maize), NuCOTIN33BC (cotton), BollgardÂ® (cotton), NewLeafÂ® (potatoes), NatureGardÂ® and ProtexctaÂ®. Plant crops and their seed material can be resistant to herbicides and at the same time also to insect feeding (âstackedâ transgenic events). Seed can, for example, have the ability to express an insecticidally active Cry3 protein and at the same time be glyphosate-tolerant. The term âcropsâ is to be understood as also including crops obtained as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering which contain so-called output traits (e.g. improved flavour, storage stability, nutritional content).</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0216">Areas under cultivation, and/or the locus of weeds, and/or fields, are to be understood as including land where crop plants are already growing as well as land intended for the cultivation of those crop plants.</p>

      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0221">Because Degalanâ¢ P 26 is best dissolved in pure Solvessoâ¢ (a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons), preferably a premix of Degalanâ¢ P 26 is made dissolved in pure Solvessoâ¢. This premix then can easily be mixed with the rest of the substances during the production of the emulsifiable concentrate formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0222">In order to produce the Degalanâ¢ P 26 premix for a 4000 litre batch of emulsifiable concentrate the procedure is as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0223">Charge in a separate vessel 400 kg of SOLVESSOâ¢ and start agitation. Then add 100 kg DEGALANâ¢ P 26. Heat up to 60Â° C. Agitate for 1 hour at 60Â° C. until a homogeneous solution is obtained. Afterwards, cool the premix to less than 25Â° C. under agitation for easier handling.</p>

      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0224">It is recommended, though not essential, to prepare a pinoxaden-containing premix in a separate vessel. The pinoxaden should be dissolved in a mix of 65 weight % hexylene glycol and 35 weight % Solvessoâ¢ (a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons).</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0225">In order to produce a pinoxaden premix for a 4000 litre batch, starting from pinoxaden having a purity (content) of 97% w/w, follow the instructions below:</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0226">Charge in a separate vessel 534.5 kg of hexylene glycol and 286.2 kg of SOLVESSOâ¢ and start agitation. Add 212.4 kg of pinoxaden and stir until a homogeneous solution is obtained.</p>

      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0269">A typical method for measuring the kinematic viscosity, e.g. of a or the liquid (or first) agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition, is as follows. This method is and/or has been used by the patent applicant in the laboratory. A Rheoplus Physicaâ¢ MCR 301 rheometer (or viscosimeter) is used, which is available from Anton Paar. Approximately 80 mL (or, alternatively, approximately 19 mL) of the liquid (or first) agrochemical (e.g. herbicidal) composition is transferred to a or the cylinder of the viscosimeter (or rheometer). The spindle of the viscosimeter (or rheometer) is then submerged and the sample of the composition is heated up to 40Â° C. and kept at this temperature for 30 minutes. Then, the spindle starts rotation with gradually increasing speed (rotational speed or shear rate), starting from 0 s<sup>â1 </sup>and gradually increasing to 300 s<sup>â1 </sup>(preferably within 120 seconds); when the maximum rotation is reached the spindle slows down from 300 s<sup>â1 </sup>to 0 s<sup>â1 </sup>while measuring and documenting various measurement points of viscosity at different rotational speeds. After cooling down to 20Â° C. one can remove the sample of the composition. In such viscosity measurements, the measurement points show the dependency of the viscosity on the rotational speed (or shear rate) of the composition, at the tested temperature (here, 40Â° C.). The viscosimeter (or rheometer) determines the kinematic viscosity by dividing the absolute viscosity by the density of the fluid.</p>

      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0277">Degalanâ¢ P 26 is best dissolved in pure Solvessoâ¢ (a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons), therefore a premix of Degalanâ¢ P 26 is preferably made, to avoid problems such as solidification of particles and incomplete dissolution. This premix then can easily be mixed with the rest of the substances during the production of the formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0278">In order to produce the Degalanâ¢ P 26 premix for a 4000 litre batch, charge in a separate vessel 400 kg of SOLVESSOâ¢ and start agitation. Then add 100 kg DEGALANâ¢ P 26. Heat up to 60Â° C. Agitate for 1 hour at 60Â° C. until a homogeneous solution is obtained. Afterwards, cool the premix to &lt;25Â° C. under agitation for easier handling.</p>

      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0279">It is recommended to make a premix of pinoxaden in hexylene glycol and Solvessoâ¢ (a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons). The pinoxaden should be dissolved in a mix of 65 weight % hexylene glycol and 35 weight % Solvessoâ¢ (a mixture of heavy aromatic hydrocarbons).</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0280">In order to produce pinoxaden premix for a 4000 litre batch, follow the instructions below: Charge in a separate vessel 265.7 kg of hexylene glycol and 143.1 kg of SOLVESSOâ¢ and start agitation. Add 106.2 kg of pinoxaden and stir until a homogeneous solution is obtained.</p>

      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="1">General Procedures and Practices for Formulation Example 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0317">Check the equipment for moisture or residues of water. All equipment and piping has to be completely dry. Flush the whole equipment with nitrogen to protect the formulation from air moisture.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0318">Heat the Serviroxâ¢ OEG 59 E up to 30Â° C. to reduce viscosity and facilitate homogenization and discharge. Homogenize drums by rolling if the whole drum cannot be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0319">Heat the ATLASâ¢ G-5004LD up to 50Â° C. until it is molten.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0320">Heat the cloquintocet-mexyl up to 80Â° C. until it has melted and use it in (add it to) the formulation within a few hours after it has become liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0321">After having added emulsifiers and cloquintocet-mexyl check the temperature of the formulation batch. Avoid temperatures above 25Â° C. for the formulation, during the whole process. Do not heat the formulation to accelerate dissolution of pinoxaden. Filtering is required. Filter the formulation below 25Â° C.; apply cooling if necessary.</p>

These two formulations were tested in the field on a wide range of grass weed species throughout different European zones. The resulting data supports that the new Formulation Example 1 (according to the first and second aspects of the present invention) is substantially equivalent to Reference Formulation Example 14 in term of post-emergence herbicidal activity against the tested grass weeds.</p>

      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0359">Trials were conducted in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Spain. As a general rule, the trial layout was according to the randomized complete block design with three replicates per treatment. All normal crop husbandry measures were applied to the trials area, according to crop requirements and in accordance with good agricultural practice. Trials included a range of soil types and locations to determine crop tolerance and efficacy on a number of commercially grown varieties, under a range of conditions. All the trials were placed within regions where cereal crops are commonly grown and data are presented on grass weeds which are also indigenous to the area covered. Crop growth stages and infestation levels were recorded at the time of application using the appropriate BBCH codes. Weed growth at application is described on the basis of development stage. Crop growth stages are described using the standard BBCH scale. In all trials, efficacy was assessed according to EPPO guidelines (% visual biomass reduction compared to untreated check).</p>
