      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a peptide that has the high ability to bind to EpCAM, a derivative of the peptide such as a fusion protein comprising the peptide, an antibody recognizing the peptide, a method using the peptide for detecting or quantifying EpCAM, and a composition comprising the peptide for diagnosing cancer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM; CD326) is a type I membrane protein that has been reported as a cancer-specific cell surface antigen expressed in colorectal cancer (Non Patent Literature 1). EpCAM is expressed mainly on the basal membranes of epithelial cells in normal tissues. However, because its expression is observed in most of cancer cells of epithelial origin, EpCAM has been known as a so-called cancer antigen and has been shown to be useful as a diagnostic marker (Non Patent Literature 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As the sensitive techniques to detect cancer cells have been established in recent years, it has been found that tumor cells exist and circulate in blood: circulating tumor cells. The presence of the circulating tumor cells is closely associated with metastasis of cancer and is therefore very important for prognostic prediction. Since EpCAM is detected in most of cancer cells of epithelial origin, as mentioned above, prognostic prediction by a method which involves collecting cells having the EpCAM antigen on their surface with an antibody and detecting this antibody has already been practiced (Patent Literature 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It has also been shown that EpCAM dissociate from the surface of tumor cells to increase significantly its concentration in the serum of malignant tumor patients, suggesting that EpCAM can be used not only as a surface marker of tumor cells but as a tumor marker in serum.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Furthermore, in addition to its diagnostic benefit, the therapeutic benefit of EpCAM has been shown in recent years. Cancer vaccines have already been developed by use of EpCAM, and vaccine therapies have also been reported, in which EpCAM proteins prepared with an insect cell expression system such as a baculovirus system, or anti-idiotype antibodies binding to the antigen recognition site of an anti-EpCAM antibody are used. In addition, anti-EpCAM antibodies for cancer treatment have also been developed, and clinical trials are underway using anti-EpCAM antibodies such as Adecatumumab (MT201) and ING-1. The treatment using these antibodies is intended to reduce the size of tumor by cellular immunity (cytotoxic activity) induced by binding of the antibody to EpCAM on the surface of tumor cells through the patient's own immune system. For the purpose of enhancing the cytotoxic activity of the anti-EpCAM antibodies, Proxiniums Vivendiums (VB4-845) which is an anti-EpCAM antibody fused with a <i>pseudomonas </i>exotoxin, EMD 273 066 (huKS-IL2) which is an anti-EpCAM antibody fused with IL-2, EU-approved Catumaximab which also has anti-CD3 activity, and the like have been further developed (Non Patent Literatures 3 and 4).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As mentioned above, EpCAM is very important for the diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and treatment of cancer, and the efficacy of molecules specifically binding to EpCAM, such as antibodies, in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer have been established. In addition to the antibodies mentioned above, Î±-actinin, claudin 7, CD44v4-v7 (a splicing valiant of CD44), D6.1A protein (a kind of tetraspanin), and the like are known as the molecules that bind to EpCAM specifically (Non Patent Literature 5).</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0018">Unfortunately, previously known antibodies or molecules having the ability to bind to endogenous EpCAM require high cost because their isolation or preparation is laborious work. In the case of antibodies prepared using a cell culture system, the possibility of contamination by toxic substances during protein preparation cannot be ruled out and extreme safety measures should be taken when these antibodies are used in treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0019">Accordingly, as a post-antibody drug or a post-antibody diagnostic agent, there has been a demand for a compound having the ability to bind to EpCAM, which can be prepared inexpensively without the use of a cell culture system.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0020">To overcome the problems mentioned above, the present inventors have already disclosed a peptide having the ability to bind to EpCAM, which can be prepared easily using a chemical synthesis method or a genetic engineering technique (Patent Literature 2). This peptide was identified by contacting a population of phages displaying diverse peptide sequences on phage particles with an immobilized EpCAM protein, and recovering the phage particles bound to the EpCAM protein, followed by selection of the phage clones that specifically bind to EpCAM. The analysis of the DNA sequence of this phage clone revealed that the peptide specifically binding to EpCAM had the amino acid sequence of KSLQCINNLCWP. This peptide was designated as Ep301.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0021">However, the ability of the peptide Ep301 to bind to EpCAM was weak. Although the peptide exhibits the ability to bind thereto on the phage, the ability to bind to EpCAM is weakened by separation from the phage. The peptide therefore presents a problem associated with accuracy for use in diagnosis or the like and is also difficult to use in treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0022">Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a peptide that has the strong ability to bind to EpCAM and thereby effectively recognizes EpCAM-expressing cells, and to provide various methods for detecting EpCAM using the peptide.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0023">To solve the problem, the present inventors have improved a method for screening a phage library and thereby successfully cloned a clone Ep133 that has the strong ability to bind to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0024">The present inventors have also used Ep301 as a lead compound to prepare a diverse population of derivatives thereof, and have cloned Ep114 from this library successfully, which bind more strongly to the EpCAM molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0025">Specifically, the present invention relates to a peptide having the ability to bind to EpCAM, the peptide comprising an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 (XHLXCXXXXCWX).</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0026">From sequence analysis on these obtained two peptides that strongly bind to EpCAM, it is considered that the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 11th amino acids in their sequences are conserved as histidine, leucine, cysteine, cysteine, and tryptophan, respectively, and these amino acids in the sequences are very important for strong binding to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0027">Since a peptide comprising a sequence in which these 5 amino acids are conserved is likely to strongly bind to EpCAM, a library containing such sequences with the conserved amino acids can be prepared and screened to thereby further obtain a novel peptide having the high ability to bind to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0028">The present invention also relates to a peptide that has the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 (EHLHCLGSLCWP; Ep133) or SEQ ID NO: 3 (KHLQCVRNICWS; Ep114).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0029">These two peptides bind approximately 10 times more strongly compared with the peptide Ep301 already disclosed by the present inventors. Thus, EpCAM can be detected with a high sensitivity, and highly accurate diagnosis can therefore be achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0030">The present invention further relates to any of the peptides labeled with a detectable marker, a fusion peptide comprised of any of the peptides and a marker protein and/or a peptide tag, an EpCAM-peptide complex in which any of the peptides or the fusion peptide is bound with EpCAM, a phage characterized by displaying any of the peptides on the surface of the particle thereof and having the ability to bind to EpCAM, an antibody recognizing any of the peptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0031">Binding of a detectable marker, a tag, or the like to the peptide mentioned above enables various applications and the peptides can therefore be widely exploited in diagnosis. Also, EpCAM can be sensitively detected by use of the peptide in a form displayed on a phage or an antibody recognizing the EpCAM-binding peptide. As a result, the accuracy of diagnosis can be enhanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0032">The present invention further relates to a DNA encoding any of the peptides, a recombinant vector (particularly, a recombinant plasmid vector) which comprises the DNA and is capable to express a peptide that has the ability to bind to EpCAM, and a transformant harboring the recombinant vector.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0033">Use of the DNA or the recombinant vector encoding any of the peptides enables the EpCAM-binding peptide to be produced conveniently in large amounts by use of publicly known genetic engineering techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0034">The present invention further relates to a method for detecting or quantifying EpCAM using any of the peptides or the fusion peptide. Because the peptides disclosed in the present invention have the high ability to bind to EpCAM, EpCAM can be detected very sensitively and thereby quantified reliably using the peptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0035">Since the expression of EpCAM is found in most cancers that have epitherial origin, highly accurate reliable detection enables diagnosis of cancer using the EpCAM peptide. Particularly, since EpCAM is known to an associated with metastasis of cancer, the prognosis of cancer can be accurately predicted.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0047">After extensive studies, the present inventors successfully cloned two types of peptides (disclosed as SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3) that strongly bind to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0048">The amino acid sequence EHLHCLGSLCWP shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 (hereinafter, this peptide is referred to as Ep133) and the amino acid sequence KHLQCVRNICWS shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 (hereinafter, this peptide is referred to as Ep114) have the ability to bind to EpCAM at least 10 times higher compared with the EpCAM-binding peptide Ep301 (sequence: KSLQCINNLCWP) which is previously developed by the present inventors.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0049">Peptides that have the common amino acid sequence XHLXCXXXXCWX (SEQ ID NO: 1) conserved in these two types of peptides of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3 may include a peptide that strongly binds to EpCAM. Thus, with use of a peptide library comprising the above sequence, it can be expected to clone a novel peptide having the high ability to bind to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0050">Each peptide of the present invention mentioned above can be produced by a general chemical synthesis method according to its amino acid sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0051">The above peptide of the present invention can also be prepared by a routine method using genetic engineering techniques on the basis of the nucleotide sequence information DNA encoding the peptide of the present invention that has the ability to bind to EpCAM. The thus-obtained peptide of the present invention that has the ability to bind to EpCAM can be appropriately purified according to a general method, for example, a method generally used in the field of peptide chemistry, such as ion-exchange resins, partition chromatography, gel chromatography, affinity chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or a countercurrent distribution method.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0052">The peptide of the present invention may be labeled with a detectable marker, which is not particularly limited as long as the marker is a conventionally known marker for labeling peptides. Specific examples thereof can include: radioisotopes such as <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>14</sup>C, and <sup>125</sup>I; fluorescent materials such as dansyl chloride and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; organism-derived molecules generally used as biochemical research tools, such as biotin and digoxigenin; bioluminescent compounds; chemiluminescent compounds; metal chelates; and image processing agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0053">The peptide of the present invention may be a fusion peptide of the peptide and a marker protein and/or a peptide tag. The fusion peptide of the present invention can be any fusion protein as long as the peptide of the present invention having the ability to bind to EpCAM is bound with a marker protein and/or a peptide tag. The marker protein or the peptide tag is not particularly limited as long as the marker protein or the peptide tag is conventionally known. Specific examples of the above marker protein can include: enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase (HRP); Fc regions of antibody; fluorescent proteins such as GFP; GST; maltose-binding protein (MBP); and ferritin. Specific examples of the peptide tag can include: epitope tags such as HA, FLAG, and Myc; and affinity tags such as biotinylated peptides and oligohistidine. Such a labeled peptide or a fusion peptide of the present invention can be prepared by a published method and is useful not only in the purification of the peptide of the present invention or the detection of the peptide of the present invention but in the detection or quantification of EpCAM in a test sample, and in the detection or separation of cells expressing EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0054">The present invention further encompasses an EpCAM-peptide complex in which the peptide or the fusion peptide is bound with the EpCAM protein. The EpCAM-peptide complex of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the complex in which the peptide or the fusion peptide of the present invention is bound with EpCAM, and can be usefully used in the functional analysis of EpCAM at the molecular level such as a study on the interaction of EpCAM with other intracellular molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0055">The phage of the present invention that has the ability to bind to EpCAM can be any phage as long as the phage displays, on the surface of its particle, the peptide of the present invention that has the ability to bind to EpCAM. The phage that has the ability to bind to EpCAM can be obtained by separating a peptide-presenting phage that binds strongly to EpCAM from other phage populations in the course of screening a phage library having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and can also be obtained by incorporating a DNA encoding the peptide of the present invention that has the ability to bind to EpCAM into a phagemid vector using a routine method and transforming host cells such as <i>E. coli </i>with the vectors and then infecting the host cells with helper phages.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0056">Specific examples of antibodies recognizing the peptide of the present invention can include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, single-chain antibodies, and humanized antibodies. These antibodies can be prepared by a routine method using the peptide of the present invention as an antigen.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0057">The antibodies against the peptide of the present invention are produced by immunizing an animal with the peptide of the present invention or a fragment thereof using a protocol commonly used. Specifically, the peptide of the present invention is synthesized and bound to a carrier protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize an animal such as a rabbit, a goat, or a mouse. After confirmation of a rise in antibody titer, the serum is collected.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0058">Any of methods can be used in the preparation of the monoclonal antibodies including a hybridoma method (Nature, 1975, Vol. 256, p. 495-497), a trioma method, a human B cell hybridoma method (Immunology Today, 1983, Vol. 4, p. 72), and an EBV-hybridoma method (Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, 1985, pp. 77-96, Alan R. Liss, Inc.), in which antibodies are prepared from cultures of continuous cell-culture systems.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0068">Ph.D.-12 peptide phage display kit (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used in this screening. This library was a phage library displaying 12-residue linear random peptides and has diversity of 2.7Ã10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0070">A method for panning is schematically shown in <figref>FIG. 1(A)</figref>. In order to remove phages adsorbed nonspecifically, phages were first allowed to bind to beads on which only antibodies were immobilized but purified EpCAM were not, and then phages that did not bind to the beads were recovered and used. This operation was carried out before every round to remove nonspecifically adsorbed phages. Biotinylated polyclonal EpCAM antibodies were immobilized on DynabeadsÂ® M-280 coated with streptavidin, and these beads are used for the immobilization of EpCAM. The panning was carried out in TBST (0.01% Tween 20 and Tris buffered saline). 3 Î¼g of EpCAM was immobilized on the beads. The phages were added to the EpCAM-immobilized beads. After washing, phages eluted from the beads by acid treatment were allowed to grow in <i>E. coli</i>, and subjected to the 2nd round of screening.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0071">A plasmid containing EpCAM cDNA was constructed in pINCY (Open Biosystems, Inc., MHS-1010-74356) with insertions myc and His tags at the C terminus of the extracellular domain, and was used to express the EpCAM protein in HEK-293T cells for purification.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0072">In the 2nd round of biopanning, 2.4 Î¼g of monoclonal EpCAM antibody (Vu-1D9, Abcam plc.) was immobilized on DynabeadsÂ® PROTEIN G coated with 300 Î¼g of Protein G, and 3 Î¼g of the purified EpCAM was further bound to the beads. The phages obtained in the 1st round were added thereto at a titer of 1Ã10<sup>11</sup>. After washing, phages eluted from the beads by acid treatment were allowed to grow in <i>E. coli</i>, and subjected to the 3rd round of palming. Subsequently, the 3rd and 5th rounds of palming were carried out under the same conditions as in the 1st round of panning, and the 4th round of panning was carried out under the same conditions as in the 2nd round of panning.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0073">The ratio of the titer of the finally eluted phages to the titer of the phages added to the EpCAM-immobilized beads was determined and plotted by the round (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0074">The titer ratio was compared among the 1st, 3rd, and 5th rounds and between the 2nd and 4th rounds of panning, which were carried out under the same conditions. In either case, the ratio of the titer of the eluted phages to the titer of the added phages was increased after each round, indicating that the enrichment of the phages that bind to EpCAM progressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0075">Measurement of titer and amplification of phages were carried out according to routine methods (Phage Display-A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001).

      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0077">Eleven phages eluted in the 4th round of panning were randomly selected, and the sequences of peptides displayed by these phages were determined by a routine method according to the DNA sequence of relevant part (Phage Display A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0078">The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy termination method using a primer (â96gIII sequencing primer: SEQ ID NO: 4 (ccctcatagt tagcgtaacg)) corresponding to a complementary chain of a nucleotide sequence located 96 bases downstream from the displayed peptide region (CEQ DTCS Quick start kit, Beckman Coulter Inc.). A capillary sequencer was used for the electrophoresis and data analysis of the reaction products. As a result, all of the 11 clones displayed a peptide having the identical sequence which was termed as Ep133. The sequence of Ep133 was EHLHCLGSLCWP (SEQ ID NO: 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0079">The cloned phage displaying Ep133 was used to analyze the ability of the phage to bind to EpCAM under different immobilization conditions (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>). The binding ability of the Ep133-displaying phage was compared with that of the EpCAM-binding peptide Ep301 which was already disclosed by the present inventors in Patent Literature 2 and with that of a phage displaying no peptide (#447). The conditions used are as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0080">Under Condition 1, each phage (in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 1 and 2 represent the Ep133-displaying phage, rows 3 and 4 represent the Ep301-displaying phage, and rows 5 and 6 represent the phage 447 displaying no peptide) was added at a titer of 1Ã10<sup>10 </sup>to 0.4 mg of TALONÂ® beads immobilized 1 Î¼g of EpCAM (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 1, 3, and 5,indicating with plus sign) or the beads alone (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 2, 4, and 6, indicating with minus sign). After washing with TBST five times, the titers of bound phages were measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0081">Under Condition 2, 2.4 Î¼g of anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibody (Vu-1D9, Abcam plc.) was immobilized on Protein G beads, and 3 Î¼g of purified EpCAM was immobilized thereon via the antibody. Each phage (in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 1 and 2 represent the Ep133-displaying phage, rows 3 and 4 represent the Ep301-displaying phage, and rows 5 and 6 represent the phage 447 displaying no peptide) was added at a titer of 1Ã10<sup>10 </sup>to the beads immobilized EpCAM (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 1, 3, and 5, indicating plus sign) or the beads alone (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, rows 2, 4, and 6, indicating with minus sign). After washing with TBST once, the titers of bound phages were measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0082">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>, under both of the conditions, the Ep133-displaying phage exhibited at least approximately 10 times higher ability to bind to EpCAM compared with Ep301 on the condition that the immobilized beads were used.</p>

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0084">A library ((KR)-X(LIMV)-Q-C-(ILMV)-X-(NQHK)-(ILMV)-C-W-X) was constructed and used for screening, in which four amino acids at positions 4, 5, 10, and 11 were conserved and other moieties were diversified because the alanine scanning analysis of the sequence (KSLQCINNLCWP) of the EpCAM-binding peptide Ep301 previously disclosed in Patent Literature 2 showed the importance of these four residues for binding to EpCAM.

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0086">1.5 Î¼g of biotinylated polyclonal EpCAM antibodies was immobilized on 300 Î¼g of DynabeadsÂ® M-280 coated with streptavidin, and 100 ng of purified EpCAM was added thereto to immobilize EpCAM onto the beads. The panning was carried out in TBST. In order to remove phages adsorbed nonspecifically, phages were first allowed to bind to beads on which only antibodies were immobilized and purified EpCAM were not, and phages that did not bind to the beads were recovered and used. The phages were added at a titer of 1Ã10<sup>11 </sup>to the EpCAM-immobilized beads and adsorbed thereon for 15 minutes in with the presence of 100 Î¼M Ep133 as a competitor. The adsorbed phages were recovered by acid treatment, and allowed to grow in <i>E. coli</i>, and used in the next round of panning. The 2nd and later rounds were carried out under the same conditions as above to perform a total of 5 rounds of panning.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0087">Measurement of titer and amplification of phages were carried out according to routine methods (Phage Display-A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001).

      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0089">The sequence was determined in the similar way as in Example 1. An EpCAM-binding peptide screened for as a peptide having the high ability to bind to EpCAM, Ep114, had a sequence of KHLQCVRNICWS (SEQ ID NO: 3).</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0090">4. Conserved Residues in EpCAM-Binding Peptides</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0091">Based on the sequences of the peptides Ep133 and Ep114 which were obtained in Examples 1 and 2 and strongly bound to EpCAM, the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 11th amino acids in their sequences are conserved and important for the high ability to bind to EpCAM. Therefore, a peptide having the amino acid sequence XHLXCXXXXCWX of SEQ ID NO: 1 is expected to have the high ability to bind to EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0092">Thus, screening of a peptide library in which these 5 amino acid residues are conserved may lead to select a new peptide having the high ability to bind to EpCAM.</p>

      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0096">EpCAM is diluted with PBS into several concentrations from 0 until reaching equilibrium (40 nM for the Ep133 peptide), and the FITC-modified peptide whose precise concentration has been measured by the aforementioned method is added to the dilutions thus prepared. The sample was left at a temperature for measurement for 30 minutes or longer and subjected to polarization measurement using a spectrofluorometer FP-6500 (JASCO Corp.) equipped with an automatic polarization measurement unit (JASCO Corp., APH-103). The obtained measurement results are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and Table 1. Kd was estimated by curve fitting according to the Hill equation.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0105">The alanine substitution variants of Ep114 were prepared by substituting one by one the amino acid residues constituting Ep114 by alanine using a site-directed mutagenesis kit based on inverse PCR, KOD-Plus-Mutagenseis Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd.). Hereinafter, as for the variants of Ep114, for example, a variant in which lysine (K) at the 1st residue was substituted by alanine (A) is indicated by Ep114(K1A), wherein the amino acid before the variation, the position, and the amino acid after the variation are described within the parenthesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0106">The prepared variant phages were analyzed for binding activity against EpCAM and binding activity against the anti-EpCAM antibody by the following methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0107">EpCAM or the anti-Ep114 antibody (1 Î¼g/well) was immobilized overnight at 4Â° C. onto a 96-well plate. The plate was blocked at room temperature for 1 hour with 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>containing 0.5% BSA and washed with TBST.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0108">The phages displaying the peptides in which each amino acid of Ep114 was substituted by alanine are added to the EpCAM- or anti-Ep114 antibody-immobilized plate, and the plate is left still at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing with TBST, HRP-labeled anti-M13 antibodies were reacted therewith, followed by detection using ABTS (2,2â²-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). The binding activity against EpCAM is shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, and the binding activity against the anti-Ep114 antibody is shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>. M13KE is a phage displaying no peptide and is a negative control.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0109">It was demonstrated that: the binding activity against EpCAM is greatly decreased by the alanine substitution of histidine at the 2nd residue, leucine at the 3rd residue, asparagine at the 8th residue, isoleucine at the 9th residue, cysteine at the 10th residue, or tryptophan at the 11th residue; and the recognition of the anti-Ep114 antibody is decreased by the alanine substitution of cysteine at the 5th residue, asparagine at the 8th residue, isoleucine at the 9th residue, and cysteine at the 10th residue.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0110">Particularly, asparagine at the 8th residue, isoleucine at the 9th residue, and cysteine at the 10th residue influence the binding activity of the peptide both against EpCAM and against the anti-Ep114 antibody, suggesting that these residues are important structurally. The variant Ep114 (L3A) in which lysine at the 3rd residue of Ep114 was substituted by alanine had low binding activity against EpCAM and also exhibited low nonspecific adsorption, and therefore used as a negative control in the subsequent experiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0111">2. Effect of Lysine at 1st Residue of Ep114 Peptide on Binding to EpCAM</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0112">Lysine at the 1st residue of the Ep114 peptide was substituted by different amino acids, and the binding activity against EpCAM was analyzed. Generally, for modification through binding with a fluorescent molecule or the like after peptide synthesis, a peptide is often synthesized with extra lysine added the C terminus in advance and use of the side chain of this lysine for modification. When lysine is also present at the N terminus, this N-terminal lysine is also modified, making it difficult to adjust the degree of the modification. Accordingly, when lysine at the 1st residue can be substituted by another amino acid, the modification can be achieved by use of only the side chain of the C-terminal lysine. Furthermore, when the N-terminal lysine is unnecessary, a peptide shorter by 1 residue can be synthesized and used for modification so that the cost for peptide synthesis might be saved.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0113">As with the alanine substitution variants, variant phages were prepared by the introducing specific mutations to lysine at the 1st residue based on inverse PCR method and analyzed for binding activity against EpCAM. The analysis method involved evaluation by ELISA in the same way as in the functional analysis of the Ep114 peptide by the alanine scanning. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. In the figure, EpCAM+ and EpCAMâ represent the presence and absence of EpCAM immobilization onto a plate, respectively. Corrected value represents a value subtracting the measurement of EpCAMâ from the measurement of EpCAM+. A higher value of EpCAMâ indicates that the nonspecific adsorption of the peptide is higher.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0114">The substitution of lysine at the 1st residue of Ep114 by another amino acid did not abolish the ability to bind to EpCAM, though the resulting ability to bind is slightly lower than that of Ep114. However, a tendency to increase nonspecific adsorption was shown, depending on the types of the amino acids. Particularly, the variants in which lysine is substituted by tryptophan (W), phenylalanine (F), methionine (M), or tyrosine (Y) are nonspecifically adsorbed onto a solid phase at an increased rate even when EpCAM is not immobilized on the plate. On the other hand, the variants in which lysine is substituted by asparagine (N), threonine (T), or serine (S) exhibit the similar level of nonspecific adsorption as that of Ep114.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0115">Based on the results of ELISA, the variants in which lysine was substituted by tryptophan (W), phenylalanine (F), methionine (M), or tyrosine (Y) have the reduced ability to bind to EpCAM with increased nonspecific adsorption. Thus, these variants were further analyzed for their ability to bind to EpCAM using beads.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0116">The analysis was conducted using the variants in which lysine at the 1st residue was substituted by alanine (A), asparagine (N), serine (S), or isoleucine (I), and M13KE, Ep114, and the variant in which leucine at the 3rd residue was substituted by alanine as controls. Each phage of 1Ã10<sup>10 </sup>PFU was bound to 1 Î¼g of EpCAM, and then mixed with 0.4 mg of beads pretreated overnight with 0.5% BSA and B&amp;W buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl). The number of phages bound to the beads was counted. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0117">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, based on results of the experiment using the beads, the variant phages in which lysine at the 1st residue was substituted by the amino acid mentioned above did not largely vary in the ability to bind from Ep114. On the other hand, the L3A variant phage showed the rate of EpCAM binding one digit lower than that of other phages.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0118">Although the result of ELISA and the result of the experiment using beads are seemed different, this is presumably attributed to the difference in the properties of background adsorption between the immobilization using physical adsorption onto a plastic substrate in ELISA and the immobilization using the His tag on magnetic beads. When the background adsorption is offset, it is considered that the ability to bind to EpCAM varies rarely when lysine at the 1st residue is changed to another amino acid.</p>

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">The present inventors have further found that the Ep301 peptide forms an SâS bond by oxidation treatment and thereby gain binding activity against EpCAM. As for Ep133 cloned this time, after formation of an SâS bond between the cysteine residues by oxidation treatment and fractionation by HPLC, only a fraction of the peptides having the SâS bond showed binding activity against EpCAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">By contrast, the Ep114 peptide showed no binding activity against EpCAM when the ability to bind is measured by the fluorescence depolarization method immediately after chemical synthesis. The peptide, however, was rapidly oxidized in the presence of 10% FCS so that its binding to EpCAM is observed even without active oxidation treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">
        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows staining cells using the FITC-modified Ep114 peptide. 293T cells expressing no endogenous EpCAM were transfected with pkk196, an expression plasmid in which the full-length EpCAM gene incorporated, and forced to express EpCAM, followed by staining using FITC-modified Ep114. The peptide in which an SâS bond was actively formed by oxidation treatment (left of <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, Ep114) and the peptide that did not undergo no oxidation treatment (right of <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, Ep114Cys) both had the equivalent ability to stain EpCAM. By contrast, the Ep133 peptide did not show the ability to bind to EpCAM unless active oxidation treatment was performed (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">The SâS bond formation of Ep114 was studied in detail using the fluorescence depolarization method and HPLC. As a result, it was demonstrated that this peptide in PBS at 4Â° C. or frozen at â20Â° C. is oxidized after 10 days to form an SâS bond (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">This property of Ep114 of forming an SâS bond even without oxidation treatment and thereby exhibiting the ability to bind to EpCAM means that the chemically synthesized peptide can be used as it is. Such a peptide is very useful for use in clinical application or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">As described above, the two types of EpCAM-binding peptides Ep133 and Ep114 disclosed in the present invention have the strong ability to bind to EpCAM, and as such, are very useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">As demonstrated above, the present invention provides a peptide that exhibits the high ability to bind to EpCAM, and shows application methods using the peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">Because of the strong ability to bind to EpCAM, the peptide of the present invention can be used as a carrier for a drug delivery system targeting cells expressing EpCAM on the surface of cells and can also be expected to be applied as an active substance for use in, for example, treatment through binding to a toxin such as diphtheria toxin, though these are not shown herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">Moreover, the peptide can be chemically synthesized and can therefore provide a large amount of a product with an inexpensive cost, stable quality and the reduced risk of being contaminated with impurities during the process of purification.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">Furthermore, since the antibody against the peptide of the present invention has already been obtained, a wide range of application based on immunological approaches commonly used can be achieved by use of the anti-peptide antibody.</p>
