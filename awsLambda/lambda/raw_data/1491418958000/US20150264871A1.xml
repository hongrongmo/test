      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to plant cultivation systems such as solar and indoor greenhouses and to plant cultivation methods employing such systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Modern plant cultivation systems (inclusive of plant cultivation structures) may be considered as belonging to one of three main types: outdoor greenhouses that depend upon solar radiation as the primary, if not the exclusive, source of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), indoor greenhouses that depend upon artificial lighting, for example, grow lights, as the primary, if not the exclusive, source of PAR, and greenhouses of a hybrid type, i.e., those that depend largely upon solar radiation for PAR during times of adequate sunshine and partially or entirely upon artificial lighting for PAR at other times.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Depending on their location, outdoor greenhouses that depend entirely on solar PAR may include one or more systems for maintaining a suitable plant cultivation environment, for example, heating, ventilation and/or dehumidification systems for maintaining a desired range of temperature and/or humidity, shading systems for adjusting the amount of solar radiation received at different times of the day and/or reducing the loss of solar heat that occurs on cloudy days and during the night, systems for monitoring and regulating the greenhouse environment, and the like. These systems require a source of energy for their operation, for example, the burning of fuel for heating and electricity for powering electrical, electromechanical and electronic devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Indoor greenhouses and hybrid-type greenhouses, in addition to incorporating one or more of the foregoing systems commonly associated with outdoor greenhouses, in their use of artificial lighting such as grow lights and horticultural lamps tend to consume large amounts of electricity all or most of which is typically drawn from the power grid.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">US 2012/0279121 discloses a wheeled vehicle having a chassis upon which are mounted a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), methanol fuel tank, electric drive system and control unit. The DMFC provides electricity for the operation of the electric drive system and control unit and for powering light emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted on the underside of the vehicle. The vehicle includes a skirt defining a plant growth chamber (which may be likened to an indoor greenhouse) on the underside of the vehicle. In operation, and utilizing the electrical output of its on-board DMFC, the vehicle is driven by its control unit to a predetermined location, for example, an area of damaged grass on a sports field. Once the vehicle is in place, its LEDs are switched on with the resulting PAR and carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor produced by the DMFC being directed toward the area of damaged grass thereby promoting new grass growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For reasons that will be explained below, there are a number of drawbacks and disadvantages to DMFCs as sources of electrical power, carbon dioxide, heat and water for greenhouse operation that make them less than ideal candidates for this application.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a plant cultivation system which comprises: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>a) a plant cultivation enclosure; and,</li><li>b) a solid oxide fuel cell electrically connected to at least one electrical power-consuming device disposed within the plant cultivation enclosure, waste heat and carbon dioxide outputs of the solid oxide fuel cell being in thermal and in gaseous flow communication, respectively, with the interior of the plant cultivation enclosure.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0010">Further in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of plant cultivation which comprises: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>a) placing at least one plant to be cultivated within a plant cultivation enclosure having a source of water, a source of nutrients essential to the growth of the plant and at least one electrical power-consuming source of photosynthetically active radiation;</li><li>b) operating at least one solid oxide fuel cell to provide electrical current for the operation of the at least one electrical power-consuming source of photosynthetically active radiation, waste heat and carbon dioxide outputs of the solid oxide fuel cell being introduced into the plant cultivation enclosure to at least partly bring about and/or maintain environmental conditions within the plant cultivation enclosure that are favorable to the growth of the plant; and,</li><li>c) cultivating the at least one plant under the favorable environmental conditions at least partly brought about and/or maintained by operating the at least one solid oxide fuel cell.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0014">The enclosed plant cultivation system and method of this invention, both of which utilize a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), have numerous advantages over enclosed plant cultivation systems and methods that utilize a DMFC such as the DMFC-powered mobile plant growth chamber disclosed in US 2012/0279121. These advantages lie in the nature of the fuels, working temperatures, electrical efficiencies and design features of SOFCs compared with those of DMFCs.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0015">While SOFCs can be designed to operate on methanol as a fuel (employing an altogether different type of chemistry/electrochemistry than that of a DMFC), they are advantageously operated with liquid and/or gaseous hydrocarbon fuels that have significantly higher energy contents than methanol and as storehouses of electrochemical energy are correspondingly superior to the latter. In addition, there are a far greater number of distribution outlets for liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons than there are for methanol. This is especially the case with natural gas which in addition to its lower cost, may be brought directly to such end use devices as SOFCs by an extensive network of pipeline distribution (gas grid).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0016">Another major advantage of SOFCs over DMFCs are the much higher working temperatures of the former (800-1100Â° C.) compared with the latter (90-120Â° C.). While usable high-grade waste heat can be readily recovered in the case of SOFCs and be used to provide heating for the plant cultivation enclosure, heat produced by the operation of DMFCs is fairly negligible and any attempt to recover this heat such as it is runs the risk of quenching the reaction whereby the methanol fuel is converted to hydrogen. Unlike SOFCs, DMFCs are not a practical or useful source of heat for plant cultivation enclosures.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0017">Yet another major advantage of SOFCs over DMFCs are their efficiencies (cell), in the case of SOFCs ranging from 60-65% and in the case of DMFCs ranging from 10-20%.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0018">Design differences between SOFCs and DMFCs (reflecting their different chemistries/electrochemistries) tend to weigh in favor of the former as sources of electrical power, carbon dioxide and waste heat for greenhouse operation. While SOFCs can utilize a variety of low cost catalytically active metals, for example, nickel containing catalysts, DMFCs require the use of expensive noble metal catalysts, for example, those based on platinum.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0019">SOFCs by virtue of their design are also far less susceptible to fuel crossover, i.e., fuel penetrating the electrolyte membrane separating the anode and cathode components of the fuel cell, than DMFCs. Methanol crossover in DMFCs continues to cause difficulty for the reliable operation of this type of fuel cell despite ongoing efforts to develop a satisfactory technical solution to the problem.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0020">The plant cultivation system and method of the invention featuring the utilization of an SOFC to provide electrical current, carbon dioxide and heating for the system and method will be more fully understood from the following figures, description, detailed explanatory embodiments and claims.</p>

      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0044">The expression âliquid reformable fuelâ shall be understood to include reformable carbon- and hydrogen-containing fuels that are a liquid at standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions, for example, methanol, ethanol, naphtha, distillate, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, diesel, biodiesel, and the like, that when subjected to reforming undergo conversion to hydrogen-rich reformates. The expression âliquid reformable fuelâ shall be further understood to include such fuels whether they are in the liquid state or in the gaseous state, i.e., a vapor.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0045">The expression âgaseous reformable fuelâ shall be understood to include reformable carbon- and hydrogen-containing fuels that are a gas at STP conditions, for example, methane, ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, dimethyl ether, their mixtures such as natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) which are mainly methane, petroleum gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), which are mainly propane or butane but include all mixtures made up primarily of propane and butane, and the like, that when subjected to reforming undergo conversion to hydrogen-rich reformates.</p>

      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0048">Referring now to the drawings, <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate, respectively, cross section and plan views of one embodiment of plant cultivation system, greenhouse <b>100</b>, in accordance with the present teachings.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0049">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, greenhouse <b>100</b> includes solar radiation-transmissive roof structure <b>101</b>, side walls <b>102</b> and <b>103</b>, front and rear walls <b>104</b> and <b>105</b>, at least one entrance, for example, sliding door(s) <b>106</b> in front wall <b>107</b>, plant cultivation beds <b>107</b>, and upper frame member <b>108</b> from which grow lights <b>109</b> providing PAR and/or one or more other devices, assemblies, systems, etc., including those that like grow lights <b>109</b> draw electrical current for their operation, may be suspended. Illustrative of such devices, assemblies, systems, etc., are pipes and conduits and their associated pumps, blowers, valves, servo motors, etc., for introducing and controlling the distribution and flow of water, nutrients and/or hot exhaust gas produced by SOFC <b>110</b> throughout greenhouse <b>100</b>. The hot exhaust from SOFC <b>110</b>, which if desired may be distributed throughout greenhouse <b>100</b> by a system of conduits closer to ground level, in addition to containing carbon dioxide, contains waste heat which can be recovered so as to provide and/or maintain a desirable range of temperature within greenhouse <b>100</b>. The carbon dioxide produced by SOFC <b>110</b> may be utilized by the plants under cultivation to promote their accelerated growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0050">Greenhouse <b>100</b> may also be equipped with environmental controls including temperature sensors, PAR meters, carbon dioxide sensors/meters, humidity meters, etc., and a controller operating on suitable software for the automated control of the greenhouse environment in accordance with data inputs therefrom. The environmental controls may also include devices for adjusting the amount of solar radiation received during periods of sunshine and reducing both the loss of heat (by radiation and conduction) and synthetic PAR (by diffusion beyond solar radiation-transmissive roof <b>101</b> and walls <b>102</b>-<b>105</b>). Such devices include electrochromic glass (âsmart glassâ) and solar shading apparatus various types of which are known. Suitable humidity levels for a particular plant cultivation environment may also be controlled in a variety of known and conventional ways, for example, ventilation means including moveable roof panels, blowers, and the like, and dehumidification devices, etc. These and other types of greenhouse equipment require electricity for their operation, the electricity being drawn directly or indirectly from the SOFC.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0051">SOFC <b>110</b> may be provided as a single unit of sufficient wattage output to meet the power requirements of greenhouse <b>100</b>, either by itself or supplemented with voltage from the power grid. It is also within the scope of the invention to combine two or more SOFCs of standardized construction into a correspondingly larger SOFC assembly in order to meet the electric power requirements of a given greenhouse design.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0052">SOFC <b>110</b> can be positioned outside, and advantageously within, greenhouse <b>100</b> in any suitable location, for example, the approximately central location to surrounding plant cultivation beds <b>107</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>. While SOFC <b>110</b> can operate on oxygen supplied by the ambient air external and/or internal to greenhouse <b>100</b> (in the case of the latter, air enriched by photosynthetically produced oxygen), its carbon dioxide-containing hot exhaust will be discharged within the greenhouse to provide or promote a desirable plant cultivation environment therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0053">SOFC <b>110</b> is connected to at least one electrical power-consuming device disposed within greenhouse <b>100</b>, for example, grow lights <b>109</b>. This electrical connectivity can be direct, i.e., at least a portion of the electrical current output of SOFC <b>110</b> can be routed directly to one or more electrical power consuming devices within greenhouse <b>100</b>, or indirectly, i.e., electricity produced by the SOFC can be routed to the power grid from which electricity for greenhouse operation can be drawn as needed and/or to a rechargeable battery system to be drawn upon as operational requirements of the greenhouse require.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0054">Since commercially-produced hydrogen for SOFC operation is not yet a commonplace reality, the SOFC component of the plant cultivation system of this invention must be capable of internally reforming a gaseous fuel feed, for example, a gaseous hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane, propane, butane or any of their mixtures in order to produce the hydrogen-rich reformate required for its operation, or the SOFC must be linked to an external CPDX reformer capable of processing a liquid and/or gaseous reformable fuel into hydrogen-rich reformate for utilization by the SOFC.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0055">Suitable SOFCs of both types that can be incorporated within the plant cultivation system of the invention include, for example, the internally reforming SOFC of Finnerty et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8,435,683, the integrated liquid fuel CPDX reactor and SOFC system of pending Finnerty et al. U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/900,529, filed Nov. 6, 2013, and the integrated gaseous fuel CPDX reactor and SOFC system of pending Finnerty et al. U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/900,552, filed Nov. 6, 2013. The entire contents of the aforementioned Finnerty et al. U.S. patent and published U.S. patent applications are incorporated by reference herein. Embodiments of the integrated CPDX reformer-SOFC systems of Finnerty et al. applications 61/900,529 and 61/900552 are described below in connection with <figref>FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B (liquid fuel) and <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B (gaseous fuel).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of SOFC that may be incorporated in greenhouse <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, specifically, integrated liquid fuel CPDX reformer and SOFC system <b>200</b> which processes any reformable liquid fuel, for example, naphtha, distillate, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, biodiesel, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0057">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, integrated liquid fuel CPDX reformer-SOFC system <b>200</b> includes liquid fuel CPDX reformer section <b>201</b> coupled to SOFC section <b>228</b>. Reformer section <b>201</b> includes centrifugal blower <b>202</b> for introducing oxygen-containing gas, exemplified here and in the other embodiments of the present teachings by air, into conduit <b>203</b>, and for driving this and other gaseous streams (inclusive of vaporized fuel-air mixture(s) and hydrogen-rich reformates) through the various passageways, including open gaseous flow passageways, of the reformer section and fuel cell section. Conduit <b>203</b> can include flow meter <b>204</b> and thermocouple <b>205</b>. These and similar devices can be placed at various locations within a liquid fuel CPDX reformer section and fuel cell section in order to measure, monitor and control the operation of an integrated reformer-fuel cell system as more fully explained in connection with the control system illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0058">In a start-up mode of operation of exemplary integrated liquid fuel CPDX reformer-fuel cell system <b>200</b>, air at ambient temperature, introduced by blower <b>202</b> into conduit <b>203</b>, passes through first heating zone <b>206</b>, where the air is initially heated by first heater <b>207</b>, for example, of the electrical resistance type, to within a preset, or targeted, first range of elevated temperature at a given rate of flow. The initially heated air then passes through heat transfer zone <b>208</b> which in the steady-state mode of operation of integrated liquid fuel CPDX reformer-fuel cell system <b>200</b> is heated by heat of exotherm recovered from the CPDX reaction occurring within CPDX reaction zones <b>210</b> of tubular CPDX reactor units <b>209</b>. Once such steady-state operation of integrated reformer-fuel cell system <b>200</b> is achieved, i.e., upon the CPDX reaction within CPDX reactor units <b>209</b> becoming self-sustaining, the thermal output of first heater <b>207</b> can be reduced or its operation discontinued since the incoming air will have already been heated by passage through heat transfer zone <b>208</b> to within, or approaching, its first range of elevated temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0059">Continuing further downstream within conduit <b>203</b>, the air which has initially been heated, either by passage through first heating zone <b>206</b> during a start-up mode of operation or by passage through heat transfer zone <b>208</b> during a steady-state mode of operation, passes through second heating zone <b>211</b> where it is further heated by second heater <b>212</b>, which can also be of the electrical resistance type, to within a second range of elevated temperature. A heater can operate to top-off the temperature of the previously heated air thereby satisfying several operational requirements of liquid fuel CPDX reformer section <b>201</b>, namely, assisting in the regulation and fine-tuning of the thermal requirements of the reformer on a rapid response and as-needed basis, providing sufficient heat for the subsequent vaporization of liquid reformable fuel introduced further downstream into conduit <b>203</b> and providing heated gaseous CPDX reaction mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0060">Liquid reformable fuel, exemplified by automotive diesel/domestic heating oil, is continuously introduced via pump <b>213</b> through fuel line <b>214</b> equipped with optional flow meter <b>215</b> and optional flow control valve <b>216</b> and into conduit <b>203</b> where the fuel is vaporized by vaporizer system <b>217</b> utilizing heat from the heated air flowing from second heating zone <b>211</b>. The vaporized, i.e., gaseous, fuel combines with the stream of heated air in mixing zone <b>218</b> of conduit <b>203</b>. A mixer, for example, a static mixer such as in-line mixer <b>219</b>, and/or vortex-creating helical grooves formed within the internal surface of conduit <b>203</b>, or an externally powered mixer (not shown), are disposed within mixing zone <b>218</b> of conduit <b>203</b> in order to provide a more uniform fuel-air gaseous CPDX reaction mixture than would otherwise be the case.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0061">The heated vaporized fuel-air mixture (heated gaseous CPDX reaction mixture) enters manifold, or plenum, <b>220</b> which functions to distribute the reaction mixture more evenly and, for example, at a more uniform temperature, into tubular CPDX reactor units <b>209</b>. While the conduit and the manifold will ordinarily be surrounded by thermal insulation, the CPDX reaction mixture can still undergo a drop in temperature due to heat loss through the walls of the manifold, which typically has a greater volume, and hence a greater wall surface area, than that of a comparable length of conduit <b>203</b>. Another factor that can cause a drop in the temperature of the CPDX reaction mixture within the manifold is the reduction in pressure and velocity which the mixture undergoes as it exits the conduit and enters the larger space of the manifold.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0062">Reductions in the temperature of a CPDX reaction mixture due to either of these factors, particularly those occurring in regions of the reaction mixture that are proximate to or in contact with walls, corners and/or other recesses of the manifold, can induce localized condensation of vaporized fuel. To minimize the possibility of such condensation, a manifold can be provided with means for maintaining the temperature of the gaseous CPDX reaction mixture above the condensation threshold of its vaporized fuel component. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, heater <b>221</b>, of the electrical resistance type, and thermocouple or thermistor probe <b>222</b> for purposes of temperature control, are disposed within manifold <b>220</b> in order to accomplish this objective. As an alternative to a heater or in addition thereto, a reformer section can be provided with thermally conductive structure(s) for transferring heat of exotherm recovered from the CPDX reaction occurring within CPDX reaction zones of tubular CPDX reactor units to such locations within a manifold where the potential for condensation of fuel vapor can be greatest, for example, wall surfaces in the vicinity of the fuel-air outlets and/or other sites such as corners and other recesses of the manifold that could cause localized condensation of vaporized fuel.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0063">From manifold <b>220</b>, the heated CPDX reaction mixture is introduced into tubular CPDX reactor units <b>209</b>. In one embodiment, a CPDX reactor unit <b>209</b> is configured as an elongate tube, the tube having an inlet for gaseous CPDX reaction mixture, an outlet for hydrogen-rich reformate, a wall with internal and external surfaces, the wall enclosing an open gaseous flow passageway with at least a section of the wall having CPDX catalyst disposed therein, thereon and/or comprising its structure, such catalyst-containing wall section and open gaseous flow passageway enclosed thereby defining a gaseous phase CPDX reaction zone <b>210</b>, the catalyst-containing wall section being gas-permeable to allow gaseous CPDX reaction mixture to diffuse therein and product hydrogen-rich reformate to diffuse therefrom while remaining structurally stable under CPDX reaction conditions. Advantageously, a hydrogen barrier is attached to the external surface of the catalyst-containing wall section of CPDX reactor unit <b>209</b> so as to prevent or inhibit the loss of hydrogen from the reactor unit that in the absence of the barrier would result from the diffusion of hydrogen through and beyond such wall section.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0064">In a start-up mode of operation of CPDX reformer section <b>201</b>, igniter <b>223</b> initiates the CPDX reaction of the gaseous CPDX reaction mixture within CPDX reaction zones <b>210</b> of tubular CPDX reactor units <b>209</b> thereby commencing the production of hydrogen-rich reformate. Once steady-state CPDX reaction temperatures have been achieved (for example, from about 250Â° C. to about 1,100Â° C.), the reaction becomes self-sustaining and operation of the igniter can be discontinued. Thermocouples <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> are provided to monitor the temperatures of, respectively, the vaporization operation occurring within conduit <b>203</b> and the CPDX reaction occurring within CPDX reactor units <b>209</b>, the temperature measurements being relayed as monitored parameters to reformer control system <b>226</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0065">Reformer section <b>201</b> can also include a source of electrical current, for example, rechargeable lithium-ion battery system <b>227</b>, to provide power, for example, during start-up mode of operation of integrated reformer-fuel cell system <b>200</b> for its electrically driven components such as blower <b>202</b>, flow meters <b>204</b> and <b>215</b>, heaters <b>207</b>, <b>212</b> and <b>221</b>, liquid fuel pump <b>213</b>, flow control valve <b>216</b>, igniter <b>223</b>, and thermocouples <b>205</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> and, if desired, to store surplus electricity, for example, produced by SOFC section <b>228</b> during steady-state operation, for later use.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0066">As further shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, hydrogen-rich reformate driven by blower <b>202</b> passes from CPDX reactor units <b>209</b> of reformer section <b>201</b> into SOFC stack <b>229</b>, advantageously of the tubular variety, of SOFC section <b>228</b> where the hydrogen and oxygen-containing gas introduced by blower <b>230</b> into manifold <b>231</b> and thereafter into stack <b>229</b> undergo electrochemical conversion to electricity which is delivered through line <b>233</b> to one or more external loads such as grow lights <b>109</b> and/or any of the other electrical power-consuming devices referred to above in connection with greenhouse <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the power grid and/or storage battery system. Combustible gas(es), for example, hydrocarbon(s), unconsumed hydrogen, and the like, contained in the spent gas(es) resulting from such electrochemical conversion can be made to undergo combustion in afterburner <b>232</b>. Heat resulting from combustion taking place in afterburner <b>232</b> can be recovered, if desired, and utilized for the operation of the reforming section, for example, to preheat oxygen-containing gas and/or fuel during a steady-state mode of operation of the integrated reformer-fuel cell system. Part or even all of the heat of combustion in afterburner <b>232</b> can be introduced into greenhouse <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> to maintain a plant growth-conducive temperature regime therein. The exhaust from afterburner <b>232</b>, in addition to its heat content, also contains carbon dioxide and moisture/water vapor both of which are essential to plant growth. The afterburner exhaust can be released directly from afterburner <b>232</b> into greenhouse <b>100</b> but for better distribution, is advantageously conducted through a system of conduits to suitably situated outlets therein. If desired, the afterburner exhaust can be routed to a condenser with the resulting water condensate being utilized for plant cultivation purposes, either as is or with a metered amount of one or more nutrients, agrochemicals, etc., contained therein, and with the carbon dioxide being released to the greenhouse interior, either directly or through a system of conduits as aforementioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0067">Control system <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> can control the operations of an integrated liquid fuel CPDX reformer-fuel cell system in accordance with the present teachings. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, control system <b>300</b> includes controller <b>301</b> to manage liquid fuel CPDX reformer <b>302</b> in its start-up, steady-state and shut-down modes of operation. The controller can be software operating on a processor. However, it is within the scope of the present teachings to employ a controller that is implemented with one or more digital or analog circuits, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0068">Control system <b>300</b> further includes a plurality of sensor assemblies, for example, fuel pressure meter <b>304</b>, air pressure meter <b>309</b>, mixing zone thermocouple <b>313</b> and CPDX reaction zone thermocouple <b>314</b>, cathode air pressure meter <b>318</b>, fuel cell stack thermocouple <b>319</b>, afterburner thermocouple <b>320</b>, and the like, in communication with controller <b>301</b> and adapted to monitor selected operating parameters of reformer section <b>302</b> and fuel cell section <b>315</b>.</p>

The flow chart can be executed by a controller at a fixed interval, for example, about every <b>10</b> milliseconds. The control logic illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> performs several functions including the management of gaseous flows, heating, fuel vaporization and CPDX reaction temperatures in start-up and steady-state modes of operation and management of the procedure for the shut-down mode of reformer operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0073">In various embodiments, the method can include, in a shut-down mode, reducing the fuel flow rate, for example, in step (viii), while maintaining a substantially constant molar ratio of oxygen to carbon. In certain embodiments, the method can include increasing the molar ratio of oxygen to carbon when the temperature within the CPDX reaction zones of CPDX reactor units approaches or falls below a level that would result in coke formation. Such an increase in the molar ratio can prevent or inhibit coke formation as the CPDX catalyst deactivates.</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0075">In contrast to CPDX reformer-SOFC system <b>200</b> of <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> which processes a liquid fuel such as diesel or kerosene as the source of hydrogen-rich reformate for the operation of its SOFC section <b>228</b>, CPDX reformer-SOFC system <b>400</b> of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> processes a gaseous fuel such as pipeline natural gas, re-gasified LNG, LPG or liquid butane as the source of hydrogen-rich reformate for the operation of its SOFC section <b>428</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0076">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, integrated gaseous fuel CPDX reformer-fuel cell system <b>400</b> includes gaseous fuel CPDX reformer section <b>401</b> coupled to SOFC section <b>428</b>. Reformer section <b>401</b> includes centrifugal blower <b>402</b> for introducing oxygen-containing gas, exemplified here and in the other embodiments of the present teachings by air, into conduit <b>403</b>, and for driving this and other gaseous streams (inclusive of gaseous fuel-air mixture(s) and hydrogen-rich reformates) through the various passageways, including open gaseous flow passageways, of the reformer section and fuel cell section. Conduit <b>403</b> can include flow meter <b>404</b> and thermocouple <b>405</b>. These and similar devices can be placed at various locations within a gaseous fuel CPDX reformer section and fuel cell section in order to measure, monitor and control the operation of an integrated reformer-fuel cell system as more fully explained in connection with the control system illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0077">In a start-up mode of operation of exemplary integrated gaseous fuel CPDX reformer-fuel cell system <b>400</b>, air at ambient temperature, introduced by blower <b>402</b> into conduit <b>403</b>, combines with gaseous reformable fuel, exemplified here and in the other embodiments of the present teachings by propane, introduced into conduit <b>403</b> at a relatively low pressure from gaseous fuel storage tank <b>413</b> through fuel line <b>414</b> equipped with optional thermocouple <b>415</b>, flow meter <b>416</b>, and flow control valve <b>417</b>. The air and propane combine in mixing zone <b>418</b> of conduit <b>403</b>. A mixer, for example, a static mixer such as in-line mixer <b>419</b>, and/or vortex-creating helical grooves formed within the internal surface of conduit <b>403</b>, or an externally powered mixer (not shown), are disposed within mixing zone <b>418</b> of conduit <b>403</b> in order to provide a more uniform propane-air gaseous CPDX reaction mixture than would otherwise be the case.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0078">The propane-air mixture (gaseous CPDX reaction mixture) enters manifold, or plenum, <b>440</b> which functions to distribute the reaction mixture more evenly into tubular CPDX reactor units <b>409</b>. In a start-up mode of operation of CPDX reformer section <b>401</b>, igniter <b>423</b> initiates the CPDX reaction of the gaseous CPDX reaction mixture within CPDX reaction zones <b>410</b> of tubular CPDX reactor units <b>409</b> thereby commencing the production of hydrogen-rich reformate. Once steady-state CPDX reaction temperatures have been achieved (for example, from about 250Â° C. to about 1,100Â° C.), the reaction becomes self-sustaining and operation of the igniter can be discontinued. Thermocouple <b>425</b> is positioned proximate to one or more CPDX reaction zones <b>410</b> to monitor the temperature of the CPDX reaction occurring within CPDX reactor units <b>409</b>. The temperature measurements can be relayed as a monitored parameter to reformer control system <b>426</b>.</p>

Hydrogen-rich reformate produced in gaseous CPDX reformer section <b>401</b> enters SOFC stack <b>429</b> and undergoes electrochemical conversion therein to electricity, delivered though line <b>434</b> to one or more external loads such as grow lights <b>109</b> and/or a any of the electrical power-consuming devices referred to above in connection with greenhouse <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the power grid and/or storage battery system, and gaseous effluent, or tail gas, containing by-product water (as steam), carbon dioxide, and in many cases, combustibles gas(es), such as hydrocarbon(s), unconsumed hydrogen and/or other electrochemically oxidizable gas(es) such as carbon monoxide. This gaseous effluent from SOFC stack <b>429</b> then enters afterburner <b>432</b> where any combustible components contained therein undergo combustion to water (steam) and carbon dioxide utilizing air provided by blower <b>430</b>. The hot exhaust gas from afterburner <b>432</b>, containing carbon dioxide and water vapor, can be introduced into greenhouse <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> to maintain a plant growth-conducive temperature therein and augment the ambient carbon dioxide level which further promotes plant growth.</p>
