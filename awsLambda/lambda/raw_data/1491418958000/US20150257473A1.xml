    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An integrated shoe comprises a first part and a second part directly attached to the first part. A method of making the integrated shoe comprises steps of injecting a first thermoplastic polymer mixture into a mold to obtain a first semi-molding part; injecting a second thermoplastic polymer mixture into the mold to obtain a second semi-molding part directly attached to a side surface of the first semi-molding part; and aging the first semi-molding part and the second semi-molding part to form a first part and a second part directly attached to the first part and obtain the integrated shoe. By omitting an adhesive layer, fabrication costs of the integrated shoe are lowered; in addition, yield of the method of making the integrated shoe is raised.</p>

A thermoplastic polymer is injected by an injection molding machine to fabricate a sole <b>30</b>. Another thermoplastic polymer is injected by another injection molding machine to fabricate an upper <b>40</b>. Then an adhesive layer <b>50</b> is mounted between the sole <b>30</b> and the upper <b>40</b> to combine the sole <b>30</b> and the upper <b>40</b>, so as to fabricate the shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, a two-step injection molding process is adopted in the conventional method for making a shoe to fabricate the sole <b>30</b> and the upper <b>40</b>. Also, after the sole <b>30</b> and the upper <b>40</b> are respectively fabricated, the adhesive layer <b>50</b> has to be applied to combine the sole <b>30</b> and the upper <b>40</b> and complete the fabrication of the shoe. As such, the conventional method for making a shoe simultaneously uses multiple injection molding machines for fabricating the shoe. Besides, hours or even days of time and complex fabrication steps are needed in order to obtain the shoe. Therefore, the conventional method for making a shoe has shortcomings of high fabrication costs and low yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To overcome the shortcomings, the present invention provides an integrated shoe without an adhesive layer and a method for making the shoe to mitigate or obviate the aforementioned problems.</p>

The first part includes a first thermoplastic polymer mixture. The second part includes a second thermoplastic polymer mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The description âa second part directly attached to the first partâ refers to that the first part and the second part are connected to each other seamlessly; that is, the first part and the second part are integrally formed as a single piece without use of any adhesive layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Further, the first thermoplastic polymer mixture includes at least one thermoplastic polymer.

The first semi-molding part and the second semi-molding part are aged to form the first part and the second part directly attached to the first part, so as to obtain the integrated shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Preferably, the first semi-molding part and the second semi-molding part are aged for a time ranging from 50 seconds to 130 seconds to form the first part and the second part directly attached to the side surface of the first semi-molding part, so as to obtain the integrated shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the first thermoplastic polymer mixture is melted and injected into the mold under a temperature ranging from 130Â° C. to 215Â° C. Then a cooling for 10 seconds to 140 seconds is followed after the injection to obtain the first semi-molding part. The second thermoplastic polymer mixture is melted and injected into the mold under a temperature ranging from 130Â° C. to 215Â° C. to obtain the second semi-molding part directly attached to the side surface of the first semi-molding part.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Preferably, the first thermoplastic polymer mixture comprises at least one thermoplastic polymer selected from a group consisting of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), polyamide (PA), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV), polyisoprene rubber (IR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer (SBR), styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS) and a chemically modified product thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The chemically modified product of the thermoplastic polymer of the first thermoplastic polymer mixture is designated to a product that is produced by connecting one polymer and another polymer via a chemical method. For example, but not limited thereto, the chemically modified product of the thermoplastic polymer of the first thermoplastic polymer mixture is maleic anhydride (MA) grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Preferably, the second thermoplastic polymer mixture comprises at least one thermoplastic polymer selected from a group consisting of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS), polyamide (PA), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polycarbonate (PC), thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV), polyisoprene rubber (PIR), polybutadiene rubber (PBR), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), styrene-butadiene rubber copolymer (SBR), styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS), styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS) and a chemically modified product thereof.</p>

For example, but not limited thereto, the chemically modified product of the thermoplastic polymer of the second thermoplastic polymer mixture is maleic anhydride (MA) grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene block copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Preferably, the first thermoplastic polymer mixture comprises a first expanding agent including a compound that changes volume or generates gas after being heated.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Preferably, the second thermoplastic polymer mixture comprises a second expanding agent including a compound that changes volume or generates gas after being heated.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">More preferably, the compound of the first expanding agent is selected from a group consisting of azodicarbonamide, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and ammonium carbonate (AMC). The content of the first expanding agent is 0.1 weight percent (wt %) to 20 weight percents based on the weight of the first thermoplastic polymer mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">More preferably, the compound of the second expanding agent is selected from a group consisting of azodicarbonamide, ethylene vinyl acetate and ammonium carbonate.

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Since the second part is directly attached to the first part and the use of an adhesive layer is omitted, fabrication steps of the integrated shoe in accordance with the present invention is simplified and fabrication time is reduced, thereby resulting in low fabrication costs and high yield of the integrated shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Under an elevated temperature, both the first thermoplastic polymer mixture and the second thermoplastic polymer mixture are in molten state, and the first semi-molding part in semi-molten state is formed by the first thermoplastic polymer mixture and directly attached to the second semi-molding part in semi-molten state formed by the second thermoplastic polymer mixture. After aging, the first part and the second part are formed and the integrated shoe is obtained. Accordingly, use of an adhesive layer is omitted and the fabrication time of the integrated shoe is shortened to less than 300 seconds. Therefore, the method of making the integrated shoe in accordance with the present invention has benefits of low fabrication costs and high yield.</p>
