      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Pursuant to the provisions of 37 C.F.R. Â§1.52(e)(5), the sequence listing text file named 103768_Seq_Lstng.txt, created on Mar. 9, 2015 and having a size of 21,198 bytes, and which is being submitted herewith, is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to nucleic acid sequences encoding <i>Clostridium botulinum </i>(<i>C. botulinum</i>) neurotoxins of serotype E (BoNT/E), and to methods for producing recombinant BoNT/E. The present invention also relates to corresponding medical uses of a recombinant BoNT/E.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Botulinum neurotoxin is produced by <i>C. botulinum </i>in the form of a large protein complex, consisting of BoNT itself complexed to a number of accessory proteins. There are at present seven different classes of botulinum neurotoxin, namely: botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C<sub>1</sub>, D, E, F and G, all of which share similar structures and modes of action. Different BoNT serotypes can be distinguished based on inactivation by specific neutralising anti-sera, with such classification by serotype correlating with percentage sequence identity at the amino acid level. BoNT proteins of a given serotype are further divided into different subtypes on the basis of amino acid percentage sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">BoNTs are the most potent toxins known, with median lethal dose (LD50) values for mice ranging from 0.5 to 5 ng/kg depending on the serotype. BoNTs are adsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and, after entering the general circulation, bind to the presynaptic membrane of cholinergic nerve terminals and prevent the release of their neurotransmitter acetylcholine. BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F and BoNT/G cleave synaptobrevin/vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP); BoNT/C, BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave the synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25); and BoNT/C cleaves syntaxin.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In nature, clostridial neurotoxins are synthesised as a single-chain polypeptide that is modified post-translationally by a proteolytic cleavage event to form two polypeptide chains joined together by a disulphide bond. Cleavage occurs at a specific cleavage site, often referred to as the activation site, that is located between the cysteine residues that provide the inter-chain disulphide bond. It is this di-chain form that is the active form of the toxin. The two chains are termed the heavy chain (H-chain), which has a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, and the light chain (L-chain), which has a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. The H-chain comprises a C-terminal targeting component (H<sub>C </sub>domain) and an N-terminal translocation component (H<sub>N </sub>domain). The cleavage site is located between the L-chain and the translocation components. Following binding of the H<sub>C </sub>domain to its target neuron and internalisation of the bound toxin into the cell via an endosome, the H<sub>N </sub>domain translocates the L-chain across the endosomal membrane and into the cytosol, and the L-chain provides a protease function (also known as a non-cytotoxic protease).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Non-cytotoxic proteases act by proteolytically-cleaving intracellular transport proteins known as SNARE proteins (e.g. SNAP-25, VAMP, or Syntaxin)âsee Gerald K (2002) âCell and Molecular Biologyâ (4th edition) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. The acronym SNARE derives from the term Soluble NSF Attachment Receptor, where NSF means N-ethylmaleimide-Sensitive Factor. SNARE proteins are integral to intracellular vesicle fusion, and thus to secretion of molecules via vesicle transport from a cell. The protease function is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase activity and exhibits a high substrate specificity for SNARE proteins. Accordingly, once delivered to a desired target cell, the non-cytotoxic protease is capable of inhibiting cellular secretion from the target cell. The L-chain proteases of Clostridial neurotoxins are non-cytotoxic proteases that cleave SNARE proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Botulinum neurotoxins are well known for their ability to cause a flaccid muscle paralysis. Said muscle-relaxant properties have led to botulinum neurotoxins (such as BoNT/A) being employed in a variety of medical and cosmetic procedures, including treatment of glabellar lines or hyperkinetic facial lines, headache, hemifacial spasm, hyperactivity of the bladder, hyperhidrosis, nasal labial lines, cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and spasticity.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Traditionally, production of BoNT is carried out by culture of <i>C. botulinum </i>bacteria, followed by isolation and purification of the botulinum neurotoxin complex. However, production of BoNT in this way is inefficient and provides low protein yields. In addition, <i>C. botulinum </i>are spore-forming bacteria and therefore require specialist culture equipment and facilities, which are not required for the culture of bacteria such as <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>). The increasing use of BoNTs has therefore led to a need for alternative and/or improved methods for producing and purifying BoNT.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">US 20080103098 describes a method for producing recombinant BoNT proteins in a di-chain form comprising expression of a recombinant nucleic acid construct in an <i>E. coli </i>host cell. However, said method requires the insertion of a specific, non-native (i.e. non-clostridial) pentapeptide sequence into a loop domain of the neurotoxin. The inserted pentapeptide sequence forms an activation cleavage site that is cleaved by an endogenous <i>E. coli </i>protease upon cell lysis. The method of US 20080103098 therefore teaches that in order to achieve optimal BoNT expression, the BoNT sequence must be modified by the insertion of a non-native cleavage site.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,259 describes recombinant nucleic acid molecules encoding BoNT proteins. However, the nucleic acid molecules of U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,259 are modified to replace the native cleavage site with a non-native cleavage site. Thus, the method of U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,259 also teaches that insertion of a non-native cleavage site is required for optimal BoNT expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,143 describes recombinant nucleic acid molecules encoding fragments of the heavy chain (H<sub>e</sub>) of a BoNT, for use in inducing immune responses (such as in vaccination). However, the nucleic acid molecules do not encode full length BoNT sequences. Expression in <i>E. coli </i>and purification of individual H and L chains of tetanus toxin and BoNT is achievable; these isolated chains are, by themselves, non-toxic. Following the separate production of these peptide chains and under strictly controlled conditions the H and L subunits can be combined by oxidative disulphide linkage to form active di-chains. Unfortunately, this strategy has several drawbacks. Firstly, it is not practical to express and isolate large amounts of the individual chains; in particular, in the absence of the H-chain the isolated L-chain is quite insoluble in aqueous solution and is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Secondly, the in vitro oxidation of the individually expressed and purified H and L chains to produce the active di-chain is very inefficient, and leads to low yields of active toxin and the production of many inactive incorrectly folded or oxidized forms. The purification of the correctly folded and oxidized H and L chain-containing toxin is difficult, as is its separation from these inactive forms and the unreacted separate H and L chains. Thus, the method of U.S. Pat. No. 6,495,143 is associated with considerable disadvantages.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">There is therefore a need in the art for improved methods for producing recombinant BoNTs, in particular activated di-chain BoNTs recombinant BoNT/E.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention solves one or more of the above-mentioned problems, by providing nucleic acid sequences and methods as specified in the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In one aspect, the present invention provides a nucleic acid sequence comprising a sequence of contiguous nucleotides, wherein said sequence of contiguous nucleotides has at least 80% (for example, at least 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 99.5, 99.9, or 100%) sequence identity to the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, and wherein said sequence of contiguous nucleotides encodes a single-chain BoNT/E1 protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The BoNT/E serotype is divided into eight subtypes, BoNT/E1 to BoNT/E8, which share at least 90% amino acid sequence identity; BoNT/E proteins within a given subtype share a higher amino acid percentage sequence identity (for example, at least 95% or higher). As described above, the nucleic acid sequences of the invention encode a BoNT/E1 protein. An example of a BoNT/E1 protein is the protein encoded by UniParc amino acid sequence UPI000016EA7F. Another example of a BoNT/E1 protein is the protein encoded by the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention have been designed to advantageously provide high levels of expression in <i>E. coli </i>cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A number of factors influence expression levels of a given protein. One such factor is the rate at which the mRNA sequence encoding that protein is translated. This factor itself is affected by which particular codons the mRNA uses to specify each amino acid of the protein. Some codons are translated more quickly than others. The choice of codon for each amino acid can vary because mRNA codons are degenerate in nature. Several different codons can all specify the same amino acid; therefore several different mRNA sequences can encode the same protein. Different codons that specify the same amino acid are called synonymous codons. The precise mixture of synonymous codons in a particular mRNA affects the translation rate of the encoded protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">There are a number of different reasons that account for why some codons are translated more quickly than others. Each codon specifies an amino acid by recruiting a tRNA molecule attached to that amino acid. The speed of translation is affected by the relative abundance of the various different tRNA molecules, by the affinity with which each particular tRNA molecule binds to the codon that recruits it and also by other factors such as how well the codon-tRNA molecule pair interacts with other elements of the translation machinery. Approximate codon translation rates can be estimated by determining the frequency at which different codons are found in highly-expressed genes. However, not all frequently occurring codons result in optimal expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the present inventors believe that optimal expression of BoNT/E1 nucleic acid sequences is achieved by reducing the frequency (i.e. the number of occurrences in a sequence) of certain codons, hereinafter deemed âslow codonsâ and set out below. In this regard, the present inventors believe that said slow codons are associated with reduced translation rates.</p>

      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0075">In one embodiment, the invention provides a method (as described above) for producing soluble di-chain BoNT/E1 protein, with the proviso that said sequence of contiguous amino acids includes one or more (for example, one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more, five or more, six or more, or seven) of the following amino acids (wherein the amino acid position numbering starts with the N-terminal amino acid residue and ends with the C-terminal amino acid residue of the BoNT/E1 protein): glycine at position 177; serine at position 198; alanine at position 340; leucine at position 773; leucine at position 963; glutamine at position 964; alanine at position 967; asparagine at position 1195.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0076">In one embodiment, the presence of said one or more amino acids, as described above (and with reference to the multiple permutations of said one or more amino acids as described above), provides a BoNT/E1 protein having improved solubility as compared to a BoNT/E1 protein lacking said amino acids. Said improved solubility can increase the yield of the protein in a heterologous expression system.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0077">In one embodiment, wherein the invention provides a method (as described above) for producing soluble di-chain BoNT/E1 protein, the soluble single-chain BoNT/E1 protein is provided by a method as described above for producing soluble single-chain BoNT/E1 protein in an <i>E. coli </i>host cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0078">In one embodiment, wherein the invention provides a method (as described above) for producing soluble di-chain BoNT/E1 protein, the method comprises separating the soluble BoNT/E1 protein from the trypsin by contacting the solution containing soluble BoNT/E1 protein and trypsin with a hydrophobic surface, wherein the soluble BoNT/E1 protein preferentially binds to the hydrophobic surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0079">The present inventors have found that high yields of activated di-chain BoNT/E1 protein can be obtained by using a process of hydrophobic purification to separate the activated di-chain polypeptide from trypsin. Surprisingly, this process provides superior purification to standard purification using ion exchange chromatography, which the present inventors have found to be ineffective for separating the activated di-chain polypeptide from trypsin. In addition, the process advantageously provides an activated di-chain BoNT/E1 protein that is free from the activating protease, as part of a general purification process.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0080">The production of active recombinant BoNT/E1 requires a proteolytic step that cleaves the molecule into the active di-chain form. This cleavage can be achieved by an in vitro activation step using the protease, trypsin. After the activation step, it is important to remove the protease from the final product, which also prevents any further non-specific cleavage of BoNT/E1.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0081">The isoelectric points (pI) of trypsin and BoNT/E1 are 9.32 and 6.2 respectively, which indicates that separation of the two proteins should be achieved by Ion Exchange (IEX) chromatography, exploiting the charge difference between the two molecules. A protein's net charge is affected by the pH of its surrounding environment and will become more positively or negatively charged depending on whether it gains or loses protons. The pI is the pH value at which a molecule carries no electrical charge and will therefore not interact with a charged IEX medium. This means that if a protein is at a pH above its pI then it will carry a net negative charge and will bind to a positively charged medium such as an anion exchanger. Similarly, if the buffer pH is below the pI then the protein will carry a net positive charge and will not bind to an anion exchanger.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0082">Based on this principle at pH 8, it would be expected that BoNT/E (which has a pI of 6.2) would bind to an anion exchange column, whilst trypsin with a pI of 9.32 would not, allowing the two proteins to be separated. IEX is a simple and inexpensive chromatography method, as it does not require the protein loaded onto the column to be in a high salt buffer, which can lead to protein losses by precipitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0083">The present inventors have tested a variety of anion exchange columns, using both strong and weak functional groups attached to cross-linked agarose beads, at pH 8. In each case a large proportion of trypsin was found not to bind to the column as predicted and was present in the flow-through. However when the columns were eluted with a linear gradient of increasing ionic strength, trypsin was eluted from the column indicating that a proportion of the trypsin was able to bind to the columns. When compared to the elution of BoNT/E1 it was found that, unexpectedly, trypsin eluted at a similar ionic strength (Table 1; <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) indicating that trypsin was not separated as predicted and would be present in the final purified BoNT/E1 product with the additional possibility of further BoNT/E1 degradation.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0084">The present inventors have solved the above problem. In more detail, the inventors have surprisingly identified that optimal trypsin-BoNT/E1 separation is achieved by use of a hydrophobic separation surface (for example, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), which separates proteins according to differences in their surface hydrophobicity by utilising a reversible interaction between these proteins and the hydrophobic surface of a HIC medium).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0085">In one embodiment, the hydrophobic surface is an inert matrix to which a ligand consisting of aryl or alkyl groups is attached.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0086">The term âarylâ refers to aromatic groups, for example phenyl, naphthyl, thienyl, and indolyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0087">The term âalkylâ refers to aliphatic groups including straight-chain, branched-chain, cyclic groups, and combinations thereof. An alkyl group may have 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl (e.g. n-propyl, isopropyl), butyl (e.g. n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl), pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0088">In one embodiment, the hydrophobic surface is selected from the group consisting of: butyl, phenyl or octyl ligands.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0089">In one embodiment, the hydrophobic surface comprises butyl ligands. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic surface comprises phenyl ligands. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic surface comprises octyl ligands.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0090">The present inventors have discovered that particularly preferable results for separating trypsin from BoNT/E are obtained with HIC using chromatography resins containing alkyl or aryl groups, for example butyl, phenyl, and octyl ligands, coupled to an inert matrix, such as cross-linked agarose or polystyrene beads (Table 2; <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">Construction of an Optimised BoNT/E1 Nucleic Acid Sequence</heading>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0140">The DNA sequence was initially designed by back translation of the BoNT/E1 amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2). A restriction sequence (PstI) was added to the N-terminus and a stop codon and additional restriction sequences, XbaI-Stop codon-HindIII, to the C-terminus. The DNA sequence was then optimised for expression based on the number and location of slow codons (as defined above).</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0141">The sequence was optimised to select against slow codons. This was applied particularly at the start of the sequence to get good initiation and start translation. Where slow codons were included (to allow for usage according to expression host codon bias), these were towards the end of the sequence (where the beginning of the sequence is defined as where translation is initiated).</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0142">Once the sequence had been designed, the optimised DNA sequence was synthesised in two parts using a unique/native PstI site for later assembly into the full-length toxin gene. The sequence of the first gene included an NdeI site at the amino terminus and a PstI site at the carboxyl terminus. This part of the gene was 2895 by in length, encoding the BoNT/E1 LC and amino portion of the HC. The sequence of the second gene included a PstI site at the N terminus and HindIII site at the carboxyl terminus, was 882 by in length and encoded the carboxyl portion of the BoNT/E1 HC.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Construction of the Expression Vector BoNT/E1 Nucleic Acid Sequence</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0143">An expression vector based on the vector pET-26b(+) (Novagen) was employed, which includes the cloning restriction sites NdeI and HindIII located at the start and end of the DNA encoding the BoNT/E1 ORF. The pET-26b(+) vector was mobilisable-deficient but could be mobilised if co-resident with other mobilisable plasmids. The pET-26b (+) vector was modified to remove mobility genes and render it non-mobilisable.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0144">The expression vector was digested with NdeI and PstI and the purified vector backbone was ligated with the first fragment of BoNT/E1 DNA that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes to create an intermediate product. In the second cloning step, BoNT/E1 DNA from the second fragment that had been digested with PstI and HindIII was ligated into the intermediate product from step one (that had also been digested with the same restriction enzymes). This led to the creation of the final product of BoNT/E1 DNA in the expression vector.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Insertion of BoNT/E1 Expression Vector into Host</heading>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0145">This example is based on the use of <i>E. coli </i>BLR (DE3) cells, though the procedures and methods are equally applicable to any other <i>E. coli </i>expression strain. <i>E. coli </i>BLR (DE3) competent cells were stored below â70Â° C. until required. The transformation of the cells was carried out using an adaptation of the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were defrosted on ice and sub aliquots of 10 Î¼L were prepared. An aliquot was transformed using heat shock at 42Â° C. for 80 seconds with 1 Î¼L of plasmid DNA. After recovering on ice for 5 minutes, 90 Î¼L of animal free SOC broth was added to the transformations which were then transferred to shaking incubators and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â° C. and 250 rpm. After incubation 90 Î¼L of each transformation was transferred and spread onto animal free LB agar plates supplemented with 50 Î¼g/mL kanamycin. The plates were incubated at 37Â° C. for 16 hours.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Culturing of Host and Expression of Soluble rBoNT/E1 Protein</heading>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0146">A single colony of BoNT/E1 transformed in BLR(DE3) cells was used to inoculate a 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml modified Terrific Broth (mTB) supplemented with 0.2% glucosamine and 30 Î¼g/ml kanamycin. This method would be equally applicable when using a Microbank bead or glycerol stock (10-100 Î¼l) to inoculate the flask.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0147">The flask was incubated for 16 hours at 37Â° C. with 250 RPM shaking 10 ml of this starter culture was used to inoculate 2 L conical flasks each containing 1 L supplemented with 0.2% glucosamine and 30 Î¼g/ml kanamycin. Cells were grown at 37Â° C. for Ë2 hours at 225 RPM until an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.5 was reached. At this point, the culture temperature was dropped to 16Â° C. After 1 hour, the cells were induced to express BoNT/E1 by addition of 1 mM IPTG for 20 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 20 min at 4Â° C., weighed and then stored at â20Â° C.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0148">Expression cell pastes of rBoNT/E1 were thawed at room temperature and resuspended by pipetting in 3 ml of Tris-NaCL re-suspension buffer per gram of cells supplemented with 10 Î¼l benzonase. Cells were lysed by sonication at a 4 Î¼m amplitude â10Ã30 s on+&gt;45 s off. The lysate was centrifuged at 4000 g for 1 h at 4Â° C. to obtain the soluble rBoNT/E1 in the supernatant.</p>

      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0149">A sample (50 Î¼L) of either diluted rBoNT/E1 lysate or BSA standard was added to 1 mL plastic cuvettes. 450 Î¼L of Coomassie Bradford Assay reagent was added to each cuvette and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes before reading OD<sub>600</sub>. The values obtained for the BSA standards were used to determine the amount of protein in the lysate samples.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Preparation of Lysate Samples for Semi-Quantitative Western Blotting Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0150">A commercial sample of BoNT/E1 protein purchased from Metabiologics was used to make up SDS-PAGE standards. SDS-PAGE samples were then prepared from the lysate samples from the expressed cell cultures to a known total protein concentration.</p>
      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="2">Western Blotting</heading>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0151">Gels were loaded and ran at 200V for 55 minutes and blotted 0.4 mA for 1 hour onto nitrocellulose membrane in methanol free blotting buffer. The nitrocellulose blots were blocked for 1 hour with 0.5% BSA in PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and then probed with an antibody to BoNT/E1 for 1 hour. The blots were detected with HRP conjugated secondary antibody developed with SuperSignal DuraWest substrate. The developed blots were imaged using a Syngene Imaging Instrument (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">Initial Purification and Activation of Target BoNT/E1 Protein to Di-Chain Form</heading>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0152">This example was based on one combination of capture and intermediate column steps, though the combination could be altered or reversed to use the same properties in a different order. The clarified supernatant was brought to a high salt concentration and loaded onto a hydrophobic capture column (butyl sepharose). The bound rBoNT/E1 was eluted from the column using a gradient of low salt Tris buffer. The eluted protein was then further purified using an ion-exchange column such as Q-sepharose, eluting a gradient of high salt Tris buffer. Trypsin was then added to the eluted rBoNT/E1 sample to a final concentration of 2.5 Î¼g/ml and incubated at 37Â° C. for 40 min. This nicked the BoNT/E1 activation loop and formed the final BoNT/E1 di-chain structure, as confirmed by reducing SDS-PAGE (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>).</p>

      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">Final Purification of Target BoNT/E1 Protein Free from Activating Protease</heading>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0153">The activated rBoNT/E1 sample was loaded immediately in high salt buffer onto a hydrophobic column (butyl sepharose). The column was washed with high salt buffer to remove the weakly associated trypsin, before a gradient of low salt Tris buffer was applied to further remove the trypsin from the column and the bound rBoNT/E1 protein. The rBoNT/E1 protein was then eluted late in the gradient, away from the trypsin.</p>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="2">Assay to Determine Trypsin Levels</heading>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0154">A trypsin ELISA was developed to determine the levels present in the column fractions and in the final BoNT/E1 sample. An anti-trypsin capture antibody was coated to micro-titre plates for 1 hour at 37Â° C. Trypsin standards and test samples were added onto the plate (100 Î¼L/well) and incubated for 1 h at 37Â° C. before detection with a second anti-trypsin antibody. The amount of trypsin in each sample/column fraction was then interpolated from the standards and overlaid on the purification chromatogram to confirm the separation of the trypsin from the BoNT/E1 (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>
