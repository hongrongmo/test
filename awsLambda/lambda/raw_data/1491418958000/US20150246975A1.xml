      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods of treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with anti-CD38 antibodies.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">CD38 is a multifunctional protein having function in receptor-mediated adhesion and signaling, as well as mediating calcium mobilization via its ecto-enzymatic activity catalyzing formation of cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and ADPR. CD38 mediates cytokine secretion and activation and proliferation of lymphocytes (Funaro et al., J Immunol 145:2390-6, 1990; Terhorst et al., Cell 771-80, 1981; Guse et al., Nature 398:70-3, 1999). CD38, via its NAD glycohydrolase activity, also regulates extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, which have been implicated in modulating the regulatory T-cell compartment (Adriouch et al., 14:1284-92, 2012; Chiarugi et al., Nature Reviews 12:741-52, 2012). In addition to signaling via Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CD38 signaling occurs via cross-talk with antigen-receptor complexes on T and B cells or other types of receptor complexes, e.g MHC molecules, involving CD38 in several cellular responses, but also in switching and secretion of IgG1.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">CD38 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on hemopoietic cells such as medullary thymocytes, activated T- and B-cells, resting NK cells and monocytes, lymph node germinal center lymphoblasts, plasma B cells, intrafollicular cells and dendritic cells. A portion of normal bone marrow cells, particular precursor cells as well as umbilical cord cells are CD38-positive. In addition to lymphoid precursor cells, CD38 is expressed on erythrocytes and on platelets, and expression is also found in some solid tissues such as gut, brain, prostate, bone, and pancreas. Mature resting T- and B-cells express limited to no surface CD38.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">CD38 is also expressed in a variety of malignant hematological diseases, including multiple myeloma, leukemias and lymphomas, such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, T- and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, primary systemic amyloidosis, mantle-cell lymphoma, pro-lymphocytic/myelocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, follicular lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia, NK-cell leukemia and plasma-cell leukemia. Expression of CD38 has been described on epithelial/endothelial cells of different origin, including glandular epithelium in prostate, islet cells in pancreas, ductal epithelium in glands, including parotid gland, bronchial epithelial cells, cells in testis and ovary and tumor epithelium in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Other diseases, where CD38 expression could be involved, include, e.g., broncho-epithelial carcinomas of the lung, breast cancer (evolving from malignant proliferation of epithelial lining in ducts and lobules of the breast), pancreatic tumors, evolving from the Î²-cells (insulinomas), tumors evolving from epithelium in the gut (e.g. adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma), carcinoma in the prostate gland, and seminomas in testis and ovarian cancers. In the central nervous system, neuroblastomas express CD38.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by impaired early lymphoid development and is classified as either B-cell or T-cell ALL. Buriktt's lymphoma (âMature B cell lymphomaâ) is also classified as ALL. Incidence of ALL is about 6000 new cases per year, or approximately 1 in 50,000. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to ALL, with several chromosomal rearrangement and submicroscopic genetic alterations identified (Inaba et al., Lancet 381:1943-55, 2013). Overall response rates to therapy in children having ALL is about 80%, and about 45%-60% in adults with ALL. Unfortunately, prognosis in relapsed ALL is poor.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, there remains a need for effective treatments for ALL.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">One embodiment of the invention is a method of treating a subject having acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an anti-CD38 antibody that competes for binding to CD38 with an antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region (VH) of SEQ ID NO: 4 and a light chain variable region (VL) of SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the anti-CD38 antibody induces in vitro killing of ALL cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), apoptosis, or in vitro modulation of CD38 enzymatic activity.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">âCD38â refers to the human CD38 protein (synonyms: ADP-ribosyl cyclase 1, cADPr hydrolase 1, cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 1). Human CD38 has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The term âantibodiesâ as used herein is meant in a broad sense and includes immunoglobulin molecules including polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies including murine, human, human-adapted, humanized and chimeric monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, bispecific or multispecific antibodies, dimeric, tetrameric or multimeric antibodies, and single chain antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Immunoglobulins can be assigned to five major classes, namely IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, depending on the heavy chain constant domain amino acid sequence. IgA and IgG are further sub-classified as the isotypes IgA<sub>1</sub>, IgA<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3 </sub>and IgG<sub>4</sub>. Antibody light chains of any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, namely kappa (Îº) and lambda (Î»), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The term âantibody fragmentsâ refers to a portion of an immunoglobulin molecule that retains the heavy chain and/or the light chain antigen binding site, such as heavy chain complementarity determining regions (HCDR) 1, 2 and 3, light chain complementarity determining regions (LCDR) 1, 2 and 3, a heavy chain variable region (VH), or a light chain variable region (VL). Antibody fragments include a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHI domains; a F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHI domains; a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody; a domain antibody (dAb) fragment (Ward et al (1989) <i>Nature </i>341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain. VH and VL domains can be engineered and linked together via a synthetic linker to form various types of single chain antibody designs where the VH/VL domains pair intramolecularly, or intermolecularly in those cases when the VH and VL domains are expressed by separate single chain antibody constructs, to form a monovalent antigen binding site, such as single chain Fv (scFv) or diabody; described for example in PCT Intl. Publ. Nos. WO1998/44001, WO1988/01649, WO1994/13804, and WO1992/01047. These antibody fragments are obtained using well known techniques known to those of skill in the art, and the fragments are screened for utility in the same manner as are full length antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The phrase âisolated antibodyâ refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody specifically binding CD38 is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than human CD38). An isolated antibody that specifically binds CD38, however, can have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as orthologs of human CD38, such as <i>Macaca fascicularis </i>(cynomolgus) CD38. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">An antibody variable region consists of a âframeworkâ region interrupted by three âantigen binding sitesâ. The antigen binding sites are defined using various terms such as Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), three in the VH (HCDR1, HCDR2, HCDR3), and three in the VL (LCDR1, LCDR2, LCDR3), are based on sequence variability (Wu and Kabat J Exp Med 132:211-50, 1970; Kabat et al Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991) or âHypervariable regionsâ, âHVRâ, or âHVâ, three in the VH (H1, H2, H3) and three in the VL (L1, L2, L3), refer to the regions of an antibody variable domains which are hypervariable in structure as defined by Chothia and Lesk (Chothia and Lesk Mol Biol 196:901-17, 1987). Other terms include âIMGT-CDRsâ (Lefranc et al., Dev Comparat Immunol 27:55-77, 2003) and âSpecificity Determining Residue Usageâ (SDRU) (Almagro, Mol Recognit 17:132-43, 2004). The International ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (http://www_imgt_org) provides a standardized numbering and definition of antigen-binding sites. The correspondence between CDRs, HVs and IMGT delineations is described in Lefranc et al., Dev Comparat Immunol 27:55-77, 2003.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">âChothia residuesâ as used herein are the antibody VL and VH residues numbered according to Al-Lazikani (Al-Lazikani et al., J Mol Biol 273:927-48, 1997).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">âFrameworkâ or âframework sequencesâ are the remaining sequences of a variable region other than those defined to be antigen binding sites. Because the antigen binding sites can be defined by various terms as described above, the exact amino acid sequence of a framework depends on how the antigen-binding site was defined.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">âHumanized antibodyâ refers to an antibody in which the antigen binding sites are derived from non-human species and the variable region frameworks are derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. Humanized antibodies may include substitutions in the framework regions so that the framework may not be an exact copy of expressed human immunoglobulin or germline gene sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">âHuman-adaptedâ antibodies or âhuman framework adapted (HFA)â antibodies refers to humanized antibodies adapted according to methods described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. US2009/0118127. Human-adapted antibodies are humanized by selecting the acceptor human frameworks based on the maximum CDR and FR similarities, length compatibilities and sequence similarities of CDR1 and CDR2 loops and a portion of light chain CDR3 loops.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">âHuman antibodyâ refers to an antibody having heavy and light chain variable regions in which both the framework and the antigen binding sites are derived from sequences of human origin. If the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from sequences of human origin.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions that are âderived fromâ sequences of human origin wherein the variable regions of the antibody are obtained from a system that uses human germline immunoglobulin or rearranged immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include human immunoglobulin gene libraries displayed on phage, and transgenic non-human animals such as mice carrying human immunoglobulin loci as described herein. A âhuman antibodyâ may contain amino acid differences when compared to the human germline or rearranged immunoglobulin sequences due to for example naturally occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of substitutions in the framework or antigen binding sites. Typically, a human antibody is at least about 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% identical in amino acid sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline or rearranged immunoglobulin gene. In some cases, âhuman antibodyâ may contain consensus framework sequences derived from human framework sequence analyses, for example as described in Knappik et al., J Mol Biol 296:57-86, 2000), or synthetic HCDR3 incorporated into human immunoglobulin gene libraries displayed on phage, for example as described in Shi et al., J Mol Biol 397:385-96, 2010 and Intl. Pat. Publ. No. WO2009/085462). Antibodies in which antigen binding sites are derived from a non-human species are not included in the definition of human antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Isolated humanized antibodies may be synthetic. Human antibodies, while derived from human immunoglobulin sequences, may be generated using systems such as phage display incorporating synthetic CDRs and/or synthetic frameworks, or can be subjected to in vitro mutagenesis to improve antibody properties, resulting in antibodies that do not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The term ârecombinant antibodyâ as used herein, includes all antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic or transchromosomal for human immunoglobulin genes or a hybridoma prepared therefrom (described further below), antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, and antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences, or antibodies that are generated in vitro using Fab arm exchange such as bispecific antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ as used herein refers to a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition. A monoclonal antibody composition displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope, or in a case of a bispecific monoclonal antibody, a dual binding specificity to two distinct epitopes.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The term âepitopeâ as used herein means a portion of an antigen to which an antibody specifically binds. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active (such as polar, non-polar or hydrophobic) surface groupings of moieties such as amino acids or polysaccharide side chains and can have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An epitope can be composed of contiguous and/or discontiguous amino acids that form a conformational spatial unit. For a discontiguous epitope, amino acids from differing portions of the linear sequence of the antigen come in close proximity in 3-dimensional space through the folding of the protein molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">âVariantâ as used herein refers to a polypeptide or a polynucleotide that differs from a reference polypeptide or a reference polynucleotide by one or more modifications for example, substitutions, insertions or deletions.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">âSynergyâ, âsynergismâ or âsynergisticâ mean more than the expected additive effect of a combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The term âin combination withâ as used herein means that two or more therapeutics can be administered to a subject together in a mixture, concurrently as single agents or sequentially as single agents in any order.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The terms âtreatâ or âtreatmentâ refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of tumor or tumor cells. Beneficial or desired clinical results include alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. âTreatmentâ can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if a subject was not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">âInhibits growthâ (e.g. referring to cells, such as tumor cells) refers to a measurable decrease in the cell growth in vitro or in vivo when contacted with a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics or drugs when compared to the growth of the same cells grown in appropriate control conditions well known to the skilled in the art. Inhibition of growth of a cell in vitro or in vivo may be at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%, or 100%. Inhibition of cell growth can occur by a variety of mechanisms, for example by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), apoptosis, necrosis, or by inhibition of cell proliferation.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A âtherapeutically effective amountâ refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve a desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of a therapeutic or a combination of therapeutics to elicit a desired response in the individual. Exemplary indicators of an effective therapeutic or combination of therapeutics include, for example, improved well-being of the patient, reduction of a tumor burden, arrested or slowed growth of a tumor, and/or absence of metastasis of cancer cells to other locations in the body.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">Antibodies can be evaluated for their competition with daratumumab having VH of SEQ ID NO: 4 and VL of SEQ ID NO: 5 for binding to CD38 using well known in vitro methods. In an exemplary method, CHO cells recombinantly expressing CD38 may be incubated with unlabeled daratumumab for 15 min at 4Â° C., followed by incubation with an excess of fluorescently labeled test antibody for 45 min at 4Â° C. After washing in PBS/BSA, fluorescence may be measured by flow cytometry using standard methods. In another exemplary method, extracellular portion of human CD38 may be coated on the surface of an ELISA plate. Excess of unlabelled daratumumab may be added for about 15 minutes and subsequently biotinylated test antibodies may be added. After washes in PBS/Tween, binding of the test biotinylated antibody may be detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidine and the signal detected using standard methods. It is readily apparent that in the competition assays, daratumumab may be labelled and the test antibody unlabeled. The test antibody competes with daratumumab when daratumumab inhibits binding of the test antibody, or the test antibody inhibits binding of daratumumab by 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100%. The epitope of the test antibody can further be defined for example by peptide mapping or hydrogen/deuterium protection assays using known methods, or by crystal structure determination.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">Antibodies binding to the same region on CD38 as daratumumab can be generated for example by immunizing mice with peptides having the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3 using standard methods and as described herein. Antibodies can be further evaluated for example by assaying competition between daratumumab and a test antibody for binding to CD38 using well known in vitro methods and as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">The Fc portion of the antibody may mediate antibody effector functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Such function may be mediated by binding of an Fc effector domain(s) to an Fc receptor on an immune cell with phagocytic or lytic activity or by binding of an Fc effector domain(s) to components of the complement system. Typically, the effect(s) mediated by the Fc-binding cells or complement components result in inhibition and/or depletion of target cells, for example CD38-expressing cells. Human IgG isotypes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 exhibit differential capacity for effector functions. ADCC may be mediated by IgG1 and IgG3, ADCP may be mediated by IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, and CDC may be mediated by IgG1 and IgG3.</p>

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">âAntibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicityâ, âantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicityâ or âADCCâ is a mechanism for inducing cell death that depends upon the interaction of antibody-coated target cells with effector cells possessing lytic activity, such as natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils via Fc gamma receptors (FcÎ³R) expressed on effector cells. For example, NK cells express FcÎ³RIIIa, whereas monocytes express FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII and FcvRIIIa. Death of the antibody-coated target cell, such as CD38-expressing cells, occurs as a result of effector cell activity through the secretion of membrane pore-forming proteins and proteases. To assess ADCC activity of an anti-CD38 antibody, the antibody may be added to CD38-expressing cells in combination with immune effector cells, which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes resulting in cytolysis of the target cell. Cytolysis is generally detected by the release of label (e.g. radioactive substrates, fluorescent dyes or natural intracellular proteins) from the lysed cells. Exemplary effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Exemplary target cells include Daudi cells (ATCCÂ® CCL-213â¢) or B cell leukemia or lymphoma tumor cells expressing CD38. In an exemplary assay, target cells are labeled with 20 Î¼Ci of <sup>51</sup>Cr for 2 hours and washed extensively. Cell concentration of the target cells can be adjusted to 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, and anti-CD38 antibodies at various concentrations are added. Assays are started by adding Daudi cells at an effector:target cell ratio of 40:1. After incubation for 3 hr at 37Â° C. assays are stopped by centrifugation, and <sup>51</sup>Cr release from lysed cells are measured in a scintillation counter. Percentage of cellular cytotoxicity may be calculated as % maximal lysis which may be induced by adding 3% perchloric acid to target cells. Anti-CD38 antibodies used in the methods of the invention may induce ADCC by about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100% of control (cell lysis induced by 3% perchloric acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">âAntibody-dependent cellular phagocytosisâ (âADCPâ) refers to a mechanism of elimination of antibody-coated target cells by internalization by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells. ADCP may be evaluated by using monocyte-derived macrophages as effector cells and Daudi cells (ATCCÂ® CCL-213â¢) or B cell leukemia or lymphoma tumor cells expressing CD38 as target cells engineered to express GFP or other labeled molecule. Effctor:target cell ratio may be for example 4:1. Effector cells may be incubated with target cells for 4 hours with or without anti-CD38 antibody. After incubation, cells may be detached using accutase. Macrophages can be identified with anti-CD11b and anti-CD14 antibodies coupled to a fluorescent label, and percent phagocytosis can be determined based on % GFP fluorescent in the CD11<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> macrophages using standard methods. Anti-CD38 antibodies used in the methods of the invention may induce ADCP by about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">âComplement-dependent cytotoxicityâ, or âCDCâ, refers to a mechanism for inducing cell death in which an Fc effector domain of a target-bound antibody binds and activates complement component C1q which in turn activates the complement cascade leading to target cell death. Activation of complement may also result in deposition of complement components on the target cell surface that facilitate ADCC by binding complement receptors (e.g., CR3) on leukocytes. CDC of CD38-expressing cells can be measured for example by plating Daudi cells at 1Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well (50 Î¼l/well) in RPMI-B (RPMI supplemented with 1% BSA), adding 50 Î¼l anti-CD38 antibodies to the wells at final concentration between 0-100 Î¼g/ml, incubating the reaction for 15 min at room temperature, adding 11 Î¼l of pooled human serum to the wells, and incubation the reaction for 45 min at 37Â° C. Percentage (%) lysed cells may be detected as % propidium iodide stained cells in FACS assay using standard methods. Anti-CD38 antibodies used in the methods of the invention may induce CDC by about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">The ability of monoclonal antibodies to induce ADCC can be enhanced by engineering their oligosaccharide component. Human IgG1 or IgG3 are N-glycosylated at Asn297 with the majority of the glycans in the well-known biantennary G0, G0F, G1, G1F, G2 or G2F forms. Antibodies produced by non-engineered CHO cells typically have a glycan fucose content of about at least 85%. The removal of the core fucose from the biantennary complex-type oligosaccharides attached to the Fc regions enhances the ADCC of antibodies via improved FcÎ³RIIIa binding without altering antigen binding or CDC activity. Such mAbs can be achieved using different methods reported to lead to the successful expression of relatively high defucosylated antibodies bearing the biantennary complex-type of Fc oligosaccharides such as control of culture osmolality (Konno et al., Cytotechnology 64:249-65, 2012), application of a variant CHO line Lec13 as the host cell line (Shields et al., J Biol Chem 277:26733-26740, 2002), application of a variant CHO line EB66 as the host cell line (Olivier et al., MAbs; 2(4), 2010; Epub ahead of print; PMID: 20562582), application of a rat hybridoma cell line YB2/0 as the host cell line (Shinkawa et al., J Biol Chem 278:3466-3473, 2003), introduction of small interfering RNA specifically against the Î± 1,6-fucosyltrasferase (FUT8) gene (Mori et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 88:901-908, 2004), or coexpression of Î²-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and Golgi Î±-mannosidase II or a potent alpha-mannosidase I inhibitor, kifunensine (Ferrara et al., J Biol Chem 281:5032-5036, 2006, Ferrara et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 93:851-861, 2006; Xhou et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 99:652-65, 2008).
