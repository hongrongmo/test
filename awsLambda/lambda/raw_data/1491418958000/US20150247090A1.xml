      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">An aspect of the present invention relates to a liquid crystal composition, a liquid crystal display device, a production method for a liquid crystal display device and so on. More particularly, an aspect of the present invention relates to a liquid crystal composition for forming a polymer layer by which alignment of liquid crystal molecules can be controlled, a liquid crystal display device having a polymer layer (hereinafter, also referred to as polymer sustained alignment (PSA) layer) which can control alignment of liquid crystal molecules and which is formed by polymerizing a monomer contained in a liquid crystal composition, a production method preferable for producing the liquid crystal display device and so on.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A liquid crystal display (LCD) device is an appliance capable of controlling transmission/blocking of light (on/off of display) by controlling alignment of liquid crystal molecules having birefringence. There are, as a liquid crystal alignment mode of LCD, a twisted nematic (TN) mode in which liquid crystal molecules having positive anisotropy of dielectric constant are aligned while being twisted at 90Â° in observation of the liquid crystal molecules from the normal direction of a substrate; a vertical alignment (VA) mode in which liquid crystal molecules having negative anisotropy of dielectric constant are aligned vertically to a substrate face; and an in-plane switching (IPS) or fringe field switching (FFS) mode in which liquid crystal molecules having positive or negative anisotropy of dielectric constant are aligned horizontally to a substrate face and a transverse electric field is applied; etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the vertical alignment mode, the initial alignment of liquid crystal molecules is orthogonal to a substrate face. A method for forming a vertical alignment film on a substrate face of a liquid crystal display device is the mainstream as a method for aligning liquid crystal molecules vertically to a substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Further, in recent years, a technique for forming a polymer layer (PSA layer) capable of controlling alignment of liquid crystal molecules on an alignment film or on a substrate having no alignment film has drawn attention. A PSA layer is formed by sealing a liquid crystal composition obtained by mixing a polymerizable component such as a monomer, an oligomer, or the like (hereinafter, referred to as monomer or the like for short) with a liquid crystal material between substrates and polymerizing the monomer or the like by heat or light (e.g. ultraviolet) irradiation. The alignment of liquid crystal molecules can be held by such a polymer layer. <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>Patent Document 1 discloses a liquid crystal display device having no alignment film but a hardened resin layer formed by light irradiation after liquid crystal injection instead. This resin layer is formed by injecting a liquid crystal into an intermediate product of a liquid crystal display panel and thereafter hardening a curable resin containing a monofunctional monomer and a polyfunctional monomer in combination and the functional groups capable of exhibiting vertical alignment of molecules composing the curable resin are generated while being tilted at almost a constant angle to the surface of a substrate to vertically align liquid crystal molecules.</li></ul></p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0007">Inventors of the present invention made investigations and found that there was a case that good display could not be obtained in accordance with materials to be used and production conditions to be employed even if a liquid crystal composition containing a liquid crystal material, a monomer, a polymerization initiator, etc. was injected between a pair of substrates and a polymer layer was formed by causing polymerization reaction in prescribed condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0008">In Patent Document 1, use of a polyfunctional monomer having a lower alkyl group as a monomer for forming a polymer layer is investigated. However, on the basis of investigations which the inventors of the present invention made, it was made clear that the monomer disclosed in Patent Document 1 had weak intermolecular interaction with liquid crystal molecules and was difficult to be aligned vertically to the substrate face since the carbon number of the alkyl group was small.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0009">The inventors of the present invention made further investigations on other monomers for forming a polymer layer and found that lauryl acrylate represented by the following formula (35) had alkyl with 12 carbon atoms and was capable of aligning liquid crystal molecules vertically to the substrate face, but lauryl acrylate caused alignment defects such as light spots and bright lines, and decrease of voltage holding ratio (VHR).</p>

      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Some of aspects of the present invention have made in view of the above state of the art and it is an object in an aspect of the present invention to provide a monomer and a liquid crystal composition capable of forming a polymer layer for maintaining high voltage holding ratio, a liquid crystal display device capable of maintaining high voltage holding ratio, and a production method for a liquid crystal display device capable of maintaining high voltage holding ratio.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Inventors of the present invention has made various investigations on a cause to decrease voltage holding ratio (VHR) and found that a radical polymerizable monomer generated a radical by ultraviolet irradiation and was polymerized to form a polymer layer, whereas lauryl acrylate had only one polymerizable group and therefore the polymerization speed was decreased and the radical generated in the polymerizable group at the polymerization terminal remained as an impurity in a liquid crystal layer to cause decrease of voltage holding ratio (VHR).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The inventors of the present invention have made investigations on a monomer which could stabilize alignment of liquid crystal molecules and could keep high voltage holding ratio and found that liquid crystal molecules could be aligned vertically to the substrate face and high voltage holding ratio (VHR) could be maintained by using a radical polymerizable monomer formed by bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">As a result, the inventors of the present invention can solve the above-mentioned problem and these findings have now led to completion in an aspect of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">One aspect of the present invention is a liquid crystal composition containing a liquid crystal material and one or more kind monomers, of which at least one of the monomers is a compound formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">A carbon atom of the above-mentioned cyclic aliphatic compound or aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more may be substituted with one or more oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, or sulfur atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The above-mentioned cyclic aliphatic compound or aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more and two polymerizable groups may be bonded directly to each other or through an atomic group. Examples of the atomic group may include Sp<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>1</sup>, Sp<sup>2</sup>, and R<sup>2 </sup>as described later. A compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more and a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more may be bonded directly to each other or through an atomic group. Examples of the atomic group may include Z<sup>2 </sup>and Z<sup>3 </sup>as described later.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The above-mentioned one or more kind monomers are polymerized to can form a polymer layer by which alignment of liquid crystal molecules can be controlled. Further, since having a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more, the monomers can stably control alignment of liquid crystal molecules by strong intermolecular interaction with the liquid crystal molecules. Further, since having two polymerizable groups, the monomers are easy to be taken in a polymer layer when the polymer layer is formed and hardly remain as an impurity in a liquid crystal layer and consequently hardly lower the voltage holding ratio (VHR).</p>

      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0145">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail referring to the drawings in the following embodiments, but is not limited to these embodiments.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Embodiment 1 </heading>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0146">A liquid crystal display device produced by using a liquid crystal composition in an aspect of the present invention and a liquid crystal display device produced by the production method in an aspect of the present invention exhibit excellent display properties while being used for display devices, for example, a television, a personal computer, a mobile phone, an information display, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0147">Hereinafter, one example of a production method of a liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 will be described. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> are schematic cross sectional views of a liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 and <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the view before a PSA polymerization step and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the view after the PSA polymerization step. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 has an array substrate <b>110</b>, a color filter substrate <b>120</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> sandwiched between a pair of the substrates, that is, the array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b>. The array substrate <b>110</b> has an insulating transparent substrate made of a material such as glass or the like, and various kinds of wiring, a pixel electrode, and a TFT (thin film transistor) formed on the transparent substrate. The color filter substrate <b>120</b> has an insulating transparent substrate made of a material such as glass or the like, and a color filter, a black matrix, and a common electrode formed on the transparent substrate. The array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b> are respectively provided with an alignment film <b>108</b> on the surfaces having contact with the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0148">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, before the PSA polymerization step, the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> contains a liquid crystal material and a radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b>. The radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b> is a compound formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more. More practically, the radical polymerizable monomer is a compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (1) and more practically a compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (2) and furthermore practically a compound represented by one of the above-mentioned formula (3-1) to (3-5).</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0149">The radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b> produces a radical by irradiating the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> with light and using the radical as active species, the radical polymerizable group of the radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b> successively starts and promotes chain polymerization to be polymerized. The polymer formed by the polymerization is deposited in the form of a polymer layer (PSA layer) <b>107</b> on the alignment film <b>108</b> formed on the substrates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0150">In the case where a common polymerization initiator (e.g. Irgacure 651 or the like) is used, products formed by cleavage by ultraviolet irradiation float as impurities in a liquid crystal and consequently lower the voltage holding ratio (VHR). In Embodiment 1, since producing a radical by itself, the radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b> does not require such a polymerization initiator and does not produce impurities derived from the polymerization initiator and consequently keeps high voltage holding ratio (VHR). Further, since having two polymerizable groups, the radical polymerizable monomer <b>104</b> is easy to be taken in a polymer layer <b>107</b> when the polymer layer <b>107</b> is formed and hardly remains as an impurity in the liquid crystal layer and consequently does not lower the voltage holding ratio (VHR).</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0151">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in Embodiment 1, the polymer layer <b>107</b> is formed on the surface of the alignment film <b>108</b> formed on the array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b>. Between the array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b>, a sealing material <b>103</b> is stuck to the alignment film <b>108</b> along the outer rim of these substrates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> and the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> is enclosed between the array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b> by the sealing material <b>103</b>. Radiation of the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> with light is carried out after sealing the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> by the sealing material <b>103</b> so that the polymer layer <b>107</b> is formed in the region surrounded with the sealing material <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0152">In Embodiment 1, at the time of carrying out the PSA polymerization step, a polymer layer can be produced and liquid crystal molecules can be aligned vertically to the substrate face without applying voltage not lower than the threshold value to the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> in the case where one or more kind radical polymerizable monomers are used in Embodiment 1. Further, at the time of carrying out the PSA polymerization step, a polymer is formed following the liquid crystal molecules aligned in the state that voltage not lower than the threshold value is applied to the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> by radiating the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> with light in the state that voltage not lower than the threshold value is applied. In this case, the polymer layer to be formed is to have a structure for defining the pre-tilt angle to the liquid crystal molecules even in the state that no voltage is applied thereafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0153">In Embodiment 1, use of a compound formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more can keep high voltage holding ratio (VHR).</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0154">Other constituent elements of a liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 will be described in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0155">In the liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1, the array substrate <b>110</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> and the color filter substrate <b>120</b> are layered in this order from the back side of the liquid crystal display device to the observation side. Polarizing plates are installed in the back side of the array substrate <b>110</b> and in the observation side of the color filter substrate <b>120</b>. A retardation film may be arranged for these polarizing plates and the polarizing plates may be circular polarization plates.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0156">The liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 may be a transmission type, a reflection type, and a transmission/reflection combined type. In the case of a transmission type or a transmission/reflection combined type, the liquid crystal display device of Embodiment 1 is further equipped with a back light unit . The back light unit is arranged in the further back side of the array substrate <b>110</b> and arranged in a manner that light is transmitted through the array substrate <b>110</b>, the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b>, and the color filter substrate <b>120</b> in this order. In the case of a reflection type or a transmission/reflection combined type, the array substrate <b>110</b> is equipped with a reflector for reflecting outside light. Further, in a region in which at least the reflected light is used for display, the polarizing plate of the color filter substrate <b>120</b> is required to have a circular polarization plate equipped with so-called Î»/4 retardation film.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0157">The liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> is filled with a liquid crystal material having a property of aligning in a specified direction by applying a certain voltage. The alignment property of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer <b>105</b> is controlled based on application of voltage not lower than the threshold value.</p>

      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0207">In the case where the initial alignment of liquid crystal molecules is orthogonal to a substrate face, a vertical alignment film is used preferably. An alignment film material to be used for a vertical alignment film may include those obtained by introducing a side chain showing a vertical alignment property into a polyamic acid and carrying out imidization. But such an alignment film material is poor in wettability and tends to be uneven when applied to a substrate and thus causes unevenness of alignment of liquid crystal molecules. As a method for improving the wettability of an alignment film material, an alignment film formed by using an alignment film material with a horizontally aligning property was used in Example 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0208">At first, a pair of substrates respectively having a transparent electrode on the surface were prepared and after the substrates were washed, an alignment film material having no vertically aligning property was applied to both substrates to form an alignment film. For example, a polyimide alignment film material showing a horizontally aligning property was used as the above-mentioned alignment film material. Use of such an alignment film material made it possible to form a uniform alignment film without coating unevenness. After the alignment film formation, the alignment film was pre-baked at 80Â° C. for 5 minutes and successively post-baked at 200Â° C. for 60 minutes.</p>

      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0216">In Sample A, an example in an aspect of the present invention, the liquid crystal molecules were aligned vertically to the substrate face. The initial voltage holding ratio (VHR) was as high as 99% or higher and voltage holding ratio (VHR) was scarcely decreased even after the aging test. On the other hand, in Sample B, Comparative Example, the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test were both high but the liquid crystal molecules were not aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0217">Based on investigations on the above-mentioned results, it is supposed that since the compound of Sample A represented by the formula (25) has a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more, liquid crystal molecules are aligned by strong intermolecular interaction with the hydrocarbon group and aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0218">On the other hand, since the compound of Sample B represented by the formula (26) does not have the hydrocarbon group included in the compound represented by the formula (25) has, intermolecular interaction with liquid crystal molecules is weak and the liquid crystal molecules cannot be aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0219">As described above, even in the case where a horizontal alignment film was used, use of a compound formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more and represented by the above-mentioned formula (25) could align liquid crystal molecules vertically to the substrate face by strong intermolecular interaction with the liquid crystal molecules. Further, with no need of a polymerization initiator, a polymer layer capable of controlling the alignment of liquid crystal molecules could be formed. Still further, it was made possible to keep a high voltage holding ratio and to obtain a highly reliable liquid crystal display device.</p>

The production method for a liquid crystal cell employed in Example 2 was the same as that employed in Example 1, except that a vertically aligned film was formed using an alignment film material with a low imidization ratio and the time for light irradiation to polymerize the radical polymerizable monomer was changed to be 20 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0221">As a method for improving the wettability of the alignment film material, a polyimide alignment film material with imidization ratio of 50% or lower for polyamic acid was used as the alignment film material for the vertical alignment film in Example 2. Use of such an alignment film material made it possible to form a uniform alignment film without coating unevenness.</p>

      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0227">In Samples C to F, Examples in an aspect of the present invention, the liquid crystal molecules were aligned vertically to the substrate face in all Samples. In all of Samples C to F, the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was as high as 99% or higher and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was scarcely lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0228">Regarding Samples G to I, Comparative Examples, in Sample G and H,the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was about 98%, and slightly low, and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was so significantly lowered. In Sample I, the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was as high as 99% and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was scarcely lowered, but the liquid crystal molecules were not aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0229">The above-mentioned results were comprehensively concluded as follows. Since no radical polymerizable monomer was added in Sample G, no polymer layer (PSA layer) was formed on the alignment film. Therefore, it was supposed that the carboxylic acid in the polyamic acid of the alignment film absorbed light from backlight unit and as a result, deterioration was promoted to result in decrease of the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0230">Since the compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (31) used for Sample H had one polymerizable group, the polymerization speed was so slow and the polymer was so hard to be taken in the polymer layer so that the radical generated in the polymerizable group at a polymerization terminal might remain in the liquid crystal layer and accordingly, it was supposed that the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was rather slightly lowered.</p>
      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0231">Since the compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (32) used for Sample I had two polymerizable groups, the reaction speed was high and the polymer layer was formed on the alignment film within a short time so that it was supposed that the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was high. Further, it was supposed that the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was not lowered owing to the formation of the polymer layer. However, since the compound represented by the formula (32) has the hydrocarbon group with carbon atoms as low as 8, it is supposed that intermolecular interaction with liquid crystal molecules is weak and the liquid crystal molecules cannot sufficiently be aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0232">As described above, even in the case where a vertical alignment film formed from the alignment film material with imidization ratio of 50% or lower was used, use of the compounds formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more and represented by the above-mentioned formulas (27) to (30) made it possible to form a polymer layer capable of controlling the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules. Further, use of a monomer represented by the above-mentioned formula (33) and having a structure for producing a radical by light irradiation in combination therewith made it possible to form the polymer layer with high alignment controllability for the liquid crystal molecules and to vertically align the liquid crystal molecules to the substrate face. Still further, it was made possible to keep a high voltage holding ratio and to obtain a highly reliable liquid crystal display device.</p>

      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0239">Regarding Samples N to P, Comparative Example, in Sample N, the liquid crystal molecules were not vertically aligned to the substrate face and although the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was high, the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was lowered to 97% level. In Sample O, although the liquid crystal molecules were vertically aligned to the substrate face, the initial voltage holding ratio (initial VHR) was slightly low and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was lowered to 92% level. In Sample P, both of the initial voltage holding ratio (VHR) and the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test showed high values but the liquid crystal molecules were not aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0240">The above-mentioned results were comprehensively concluded as follows. In Sample N, no polymer layer was formed so that the liquid crystal molecules could not be aligned vertically to the substrate face. Since having only one polymerizable group, the compound represented by the above-mentioned formula (31) used for Sample O remained in the liquid crystal layer and thus it was supposed that the voltage holding ratio (VHR) after the aging test was considerably lowered. The compound represented by the formula (32) used for Sample P had the hydrocarbon group with small carbon atoms and it was supposed that intermolecular interaction with liquid crystal molecules was weak and the liquid crystal molecules could not sufficiently be aligned vertically to the substrate face.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0241">As described above, even in the case where no alignment film was formed, use of compounds represented by the above-mentioned formulas (27) to (30) and formed by further bonding a hydrocarbon group with 12 carbon atoms or more to a compound formed by bonding two polymerizable groups to a cyclic aliphatic compound or an aromatic compound with 6 carbon atoms or more and use of a monomer represented by the above-mentioned formula (34) and having a structure for producing a radical by light irradiation in combination made it possible to form a polymer layer with high alignment controllability for liquid crystal molecules and to align liquid crystal molecules vertically to the substrate face. Still further, in the same manner as that in Example 2, it was made possible to keep a high voltage holding ratio and to obtain a highly reliable liquid crystal display device.</p>
