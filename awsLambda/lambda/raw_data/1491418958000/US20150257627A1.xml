      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0031065, filed on Mar. 17, 2014, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a home appliance, and more particularly, a home appliance having a drying apparatus capable of improving a drying performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the recent years, there are increasing demands for a home appliance having a drying function, for example, a dish washer, a washing machine, and a drier. A dish washer is provided with a drying function to remove wash water that remains on washed dishware, and a washing machine and a drier are provided with a drying function to dry wet laundry.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The dish washer is an apparatus designed to wash dishes in an effective and hygienic way, and wash and dry dishes having dirt. A dry process of the dish washer represents a process of removing moisture remaining on the dishes having finished with washing. The dry process includes increasing the temperature of dishware by increasing the temperature of water sprayed to the dishware in a final rinse process such that evaporation of water remaining on the dishware is enhanced, and removing the evaporated vapor by condensation in a cooling duct positioned inside or outside a dishwashing tub or by absorption through a dehumidifying agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">When the dehumidifying agent is used in order to remove a vapor, a reproduction process is required to dry the dehumidifying agent so that the dehumidifying agent may absorb a vapor in the next drying process. In the conventional technology, the dehumidifying agent is heated using a heater during a washing process or a rinsing process. The dehumidifying agent is heated using a heater to evaporate moisture of the dehumidifying agent to regenerate the dehumidifying agent so that the regenerated dehumidifying agent may absorb moisture again in the subsequent drying process.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In general, the dishwasher uses a porous dehumidifying agent, and a vapor absorbed into the dehumidifying agent is accommodated in a gas state or liquid state in the pores of the porous dehumidifying agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In order to regenerate the porous dehumidifying agent, energy (latent heat of vaporization) is needed to change water accommodated in the pores in a liquid state into a vapor state, and further, an additional energy is needed to allow the vapor to escape from the pores. Accordingly, there is a need for a great amount of thermal energy in regenerating the dehumidifying agent, which increases the energy consumption.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Therefore, it is an aspect of the present disclosure to provide a home appliance having a drying apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">It is another aspect of the present disclosure to provide a home appliance having a drying apparatus, capable of enhancing the drying efficiency while saving the energy required in a drying cycle.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure, a home appliance includes a body, a dishwashing tub and a drying apparatus. The dishwashing tub may be provided in the body and in which a washing operation and a drying operation are conducted. The drying apparatus may be provided in the dishwashing tub, and configured to suction air inside the dishwashing tub and discharge the suctioned air to the inside of the dishwashing tub again. The drying apparatus may include a drying duct and a heat pump unit and a heat pump unit. The drying duct may communicate with the dishwashing tub. The heat pump unit may include an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser and an expansion valve. The evaporator and the condenser may be disposed inside the drying duct such that air in the dishwashing tub passes through the evaporator first and then the condenser.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Each of the evaporator and the condenser may be formed in a panel shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The drying duct may include a suction port formed to communicate with the inside of the dishwashing tub so as to suction air of inside the dishwashing tub.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The drying apparatus may include a drain member to drain condensation water generated from the heat pump unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The drain member may be disposed at a lower side of the evaporator and downwardly inclined toward a drain hole formed at the drying duct such that the condensation water is discharged through the drain hole.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The evaporator may be disposed at an upper portion of the drying duct, and the condenser may be disposed at a lower portion of the drying duct.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The compressor may be disposed on a bottom surface of the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The compressor may have a power consumption of about 80 W to 300 W.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The compressor may have a capacity of about 2 C to 15 CC.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The heat pump unit may use a refrigerant including at least one of R-134a, R-600a, R-407C and R410A.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The drying apparatus may further include a circulation fan mounted inside the drying duct.</p>
