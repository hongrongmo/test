      <b>TECHNOLOGY FIELD</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to a device and physical support article for the installation and storage of wrapping material in a harvester, particularly to multiple material support cylinders in a wrapping mechanism which hold rolls of wrapping material and revolves about a support axis in a plurality of positions, and to related supporting systems, including brake, lever plate, and drum lock system.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>BACKGROUND</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">For many years harvesters, such as agricultural balers, have been used to consolidate and package crop material so as to facilitate the storage and handling of the crop material for later use. Usually, a mower-conditioner cuts and conditions the crop material for windrow drying in the sun. When the cut crop material is properly dried, a harvester, such as a round baler, the most frequently used in the industry, travels along the windrows to pick up the crop material and form it into cylindrically-shaped round bales.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">More specifically, the cut crop material is gathered at the front of the baler from along the ground, onto a pickup assembly, and introduced into a bale-forming chamber within the baler. Inside the cut crop is rolled up into a predetermined size. A conventional bale chamber may include a pair of opposing sidewalls with a series of belts, chains, and/or rolls that rotate and compress the crop material in to the cylindrically-shaped round bale. When the predetermined size is achieved, the cylindrically-shaped round bale is wrapped and bound by wrapping material, such as net wrapping, plastic wrapping, and/or wire. After the round bale is wrapped, the back of the baler, or tailgate, opens and the wrapped bale is discharged.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Wrapping material is fed into the baler off a wrapping material roll and into a wrapping mechanism, conventionally located in the front of the baler. As the baler forms, bounds, and distributes the bale, wrapping material is depleted until the roll needs to be replaced by a spare. Typically, one or two spare wrapping material rolls are stored on the baler, usually housed at the rear of the baler at the tailgate. When a roll of wrapping material needs to be replaced, the operator discards the depeted roll, walks to the back of the baler to acquire a stored roll, then walks the stored roll to the front of the baler, and installs the new roll. Wrapping material roll length typically measures 122 to 130 centimeters (48 to 51 inches) in length and between 30 and 45 kilograms (70 to 100 pounds) in weight. The size, weight, and typical location for spare roll storage create a burden for an operator to transport the roll from the rear of the baler and install the roll at the front of the baler. The operator is tasked to lift the roll to a material support cylinder and slide the roll onto the cylinder. The material support cylinder can be 4 to 5 feet off the ground. Additionally, once on the cylinder, the wrapping material roll is then pushed into the operating position. Thus, it is desireable to minimize operator effort to replace a roll of wrapping material. Relatedly, it is also desireable to improve storage capability of rolls of wrapping material on balers.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The invention relates to a storage location and a process for wrapping material roll indexing that minimizes manual operator effort for placement and access to wrapping material rolls in an active postions, and minimizes the time of total manual operator involvement when replacing and installing a roll of wrapping material. The purpose of the invention is to improve the efficiency of the baler operation by reducing the time it takes for a baler operator to replace a roll of warpping material.</p>

      <figref>FIG. 1</figref> depicts an example of a round baler. The round baler, generally designated 10 is enclosed by a main frame 12, comprising a plurality of rigid structural elements including a pair of side walls 14. Main frame 12 is supported by a pair of rear wheels 13. A forwardly mounted hitch 40, integrated with the main frame 12, provides for connection to a tractor, for examples. As shown, a power take off (PTO) shaft 46, is located herein about the hitch 40. In other balers, the PTO shaft may be located and connected to the tractor below the hitch. The PTO shaft draws energy from a tractor driving the hitch and transfer that energy to drive mechanisms in the baler 10. Rear side 16, typically comprises a tailgate what is closed during bailing and opened to eject finished bales. In conventional balers, storage to house spare rolls of wrapping material is typically located about the tailgate. The front side 15 of the baler faces the rear of a tractor as connected to by the hitch 40 and the PTO shaft 46. At the bottom of the front side, between a front pair of wheels 13a, and mounted to the mainframe 12, is the pickup 20. The pickup 20 is supported by the pair of front wheels 13a. Pickup tines 22 wrap around and connect within the pickup 20. The tips of the tines 22 are movable along a predetermined path along the ground to lift crop material from the ground and deliver it rearward along a generally horizontal path towards a floor roll (not shown) at the bottom of the later, which is rotatably mounted on main frame 12. During baling, the floor roll conveys crop material further rear into a bale chamber where belts then urge the material upwardly and forwardly into engagement with sledge rolls. The sledge rolls coil crop material in a round direction to form and add to a bale acre. Continued feeding by pick tines 22 urge additional crop material into the forming bale in a generally spiral fashion growing the bale core. A wrapping assembly 52 comprises an active roll cavity 54. When the baler is in use, the active roll cavity 54 would house a roll of wrapping material which would spin around a material support cylinder 150 as wrapping material is fed into a feeding entry 56.</p>

A coaxial element 420 is also on the linear axis 411. Connected to one end of the elongated member 410 is a lever 430 that is shown here in an engaged position. The brake system additionally consists of three non-coaxial elements. The first non-coaxial element 440 is not directly connected to either the elongated member 410 or the coaxial element 420, but it does support, in part, a counterwheel 441. The counterwheel 441 is designed to operably contact a roll of wrapping material (not shown) that is supported by a material support cylinder 442. The second non-coaxial element 450 is connected at one end to the coaxial element 420. The other end of the second non-coaxial element 450 is operably connected to the first non-coaxial element 440 by a spring 470, which translates the movement of the first non-coaxial element 440 to the second non-coaxial 450 element when the brake system 400 is in an engaged position. The third non-coaxial element 460 is connected to the coaxial element 420 at one end and to a brake pad 461 at the other end. The brake pad 461 is designed to operably contact a drum wheel 462 that is a part of the material support cylinder 442. The brake pad 461 is capable of applying pressure to the drum wheel 462, controlling, in part, the rotational speed of a roll of wrapping material on the material support cylinder 442. Optionally, the brake system 400 can also comprise a hooked element 480 that consists of a straight member 482 and a curved member 481. The hooked element 480 is connected to a feed plate of a wrapping system (not shown) at one end and to the coaxial element 420 at the other end.</p>
    <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">
      <figref>FIG. 5</figref> depicts the brake system 400 in a disengaged position. The elongated member 410 has been rotated by the lever (not shown) such that the first non-coaxial element 440 has been moved downward and away from the material support cylinder 442, such that the counterwheel 441 would not come in operable contact with a roll of wrapping material if one where present on the material support cylinder 442. In the position shown, the first non-coaxial element 440 is closer to the second non-coaxial element 450, causing a loss of tension in the spring 470. The coaxial element 420 is thus allowed freer rotation, causing the brake pad 461 of the third non-coaxial element 460 to become disengaged with the drum wheel 462 and allowing rotation of the material support cylinder 442. The overall position of the brake system 400 shown here would also allow the revolution of one or a plurality of material support cylinders around a central support axis.</p>
    <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">
      <figref>FIG. 6</figref> depicts a lever plate system, generally designated 600, in a locked position. A lever plate 610 is connected to a support plate 611 at a pivot point 612 such that in the closed position shown here the lever plate 610 occludes an opening in a notch 613 of the support plate 611, said notch 613 being designed to hold one end of a material support cylinder 614. Preventing the rotation of the lever plate 610 is a lever lock arm 620 which is also connected to the support plate 611 by a separate pivot point 621. In its locked position shown here, the lever lock arm 620 is operably in contact with the lever plate 610, preventing the rotation of the lever plate 610 around its pivot point 612. Maintaining the lever lock arm 620 in its locked position is a spring 621 that is connected to both the lever lock arm 620 and the lever plate 610. A release arm 640, shown here in a disengaged position, is not in operable contact with the lever lock arm 620. In this embodiment, the release arm 640 is operably connected with the elongated member 641 of the brake system, and the movement of the release arm 640 is controlled by the lever 642.</p>
    <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">
      <figref>FIG. 7</figref> depicts the lever plate system 600 in an unlocked position. The lever 642 has been rotated such that the lever release arm 640 is in a engaged position whereby it is in operable contact with the lever lock arm 620. The lever lock arm 620, in turn, has been pivoted around its pivot point 621 such that it is no longer in operable contact with the lever plate 610, as the force of the release arm 640 coming in contact with the lever lock arm 620 has overcome the retaining force of the spring 630. The lever plate 610 is now free to move around its pivot point 612, opening the notch 613 in the support plate 611 and allowing the material support cylinder 614 to pivot away from the notch 613.</p>
    <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">
      <figref>FIG. 8</figref> depicts a combined brake system and lever plate system in a disengaged/unlocked position. The brake system 400 is as described in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, with an elongated member 410 defining a linear axis 411. The lever 430 is in a disengaged position, moving the counterwheel 441 away from the material support cylinder 442, and moving the brake pad 461 away from the drum wheel 462. The position of the lever 430 also moved the release arm 640 of the lever plate system 600 to come in operable contact with lever lock arm 620 such that the lever plate 610 is free to move, allowing the material support cylinder 442 to pivot away from the support plate. The combination of the brake system 400 and the lever plate system 600 allows in part both the load/unloading of wrapping material onto the material support cylinder and the revolution of material support cylinder around the support axis of a multi-cylinder wrapping mechanism.</p>

      <figref>FIG. 9</figref> depicts a drum lock system, generally designated 900, comprising a sidewall 910 and a material support cylinder 920 with a drum wheel 921. A locking tab mechanism 930 is operably attached to a support plate (not shown) at one end and the drum wheel 921 at the other end, preventing the rotation of the drum wheel around an axis defined by the material support cylinder 920. A cam tab 940 is operably attached to the sidewall 910 at a fixed position, such that when the material support cylinder 920 is in the proper position, the cam tab 940 comes in operable contact with the locking tab mechanism 930, releasing contact between the locking tab mechanism 930 and the drum wheel 921.</p>
