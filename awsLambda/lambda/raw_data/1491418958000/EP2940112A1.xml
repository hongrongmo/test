    <heading id="h-00001-en">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of detergents. In particular, it relates to a cleaning composition, more in particular to a composition comprising a cleaning amine. The composition provides good cleaning, in particular good grease cleaning.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils are amongst the most severe types of soils to remove from surfaces. Traditionally, the removal of cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils from cookware and tableware requires soaking the soiled object prior to mechanical action. Manual dishwashing processes require a tremendous rubbing effort to remove cooked-, baked- and burnt-on greasy soils and this can be detrimental to the safety and condition of the cookware/tableware.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Another problem faced in manual dishwashing is grease removal, in particular grease removal from hydrophobic substrates such as plastics.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Users not only seek good cleaning but they also expect the washed items to be pleasant to the touch. Sometimes the washed items can have a greasy feeling during and or after rinse. One of the objectives of this invention is to provide a detergent good for grease cleaning, in particular on plastic items that leave the objects not only clean but also agreeable to the touch during and after the rinse.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Hand dishwashing trends are changing. Traditionally, the washing up has been done in a sink full of water with the cleaning composition diluted in it. Nowadays, the trend is towards the use of a cleaning implement, such as a sponge. The cleaning composition is dosed onto the sponge, before or after the sponge is wetted, a soiled item is then wiped and subsequently rinsed under running water. This new way of hand dishwashing, sometimes referred to as direct application, places the cleaning composition in a new environment that needs to be taken into account for the design of the composition. With the new preference of using direct application, there is a need to provide a cleaning composition that performs well under the new usage conditions.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a cleaning composition, preferably in liquid form. The composition comprises a surfactant system and a cleaning amine. The composition provides excellent grease removal from all types of hard surfaces. Preferably the composition is a hand dishwashing composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The surfactant system of the composition of the invention preferably comprises an anionic surfactant and a primary co-surfactant selected from the group consisting of amphoteric, zwitteronic and mixtures thereof. The composition can further comprise a non-ionic surfactant.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The anionic surfactant can be any anionic cleaning surfactant, especially preferred anionic surfactants are selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sufate, alkyl benzene sulfonate, paraffin sulfonate and mixtures thereof. Preferred anionic surfactants are selected from alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, a preferred alkyl alkoxy sulfate is alkyl ethoxy sulfate. Preferred anionic surfactant for use herein is a mixture of alkyl sulfate and alkyl ethoxy sulfate.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Extremely useful surfactant systems for use herein include those comprising anionic surfactants, in combination with amine oxide, especially alkyl dimethyl amine oxides, and/or betaine surfactants.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another preferred surfactant system for use herein is an anionic and amphoteric/zwitterionic system in which the amphoteric to zwitterionic weight ratio is preferably from about 2:1 to about 1:2.. In particular a system in which the amphoteric surfactant is an amine oxide surfactant and the zwitteronic surfactant is a betaine and the weight ratio of the amine oxide to the betaine is about 1:1.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Also preferred for use herein are surfactant systems further comprising non-ionic surfactants. Especially preferred nonionic surfactants are alkyl alkoxylated nonionic surfactants, especially alkyl ethoxylated surfactants.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Especially preferred surfactant systems for the composition of the invention comprise an anionic surfactant preferably selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfate, alkyl alkoxy sulfate and mixtures thereof, more preferably an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate, and an amphoteric surfactant, preferably an amino oxide surfactant and a non-ionic surfactant. In summary, the most preferred surfactant system for use herein comprises an alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant, amine oxide and non-ionic surfactant, especially an alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, alkyl dimethyl amine oxide and an alkyl ethoxylate nonionic surfactant.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The composition of the invention can further comprise a salt of a divalent cation. In particular, a salt of magnesium. It has been found that magnesium cations can work in combination with the cleaning amine by strengthening and broadening the grease cleaning profile of the composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The composition of the invention can further comprise a chelant. It has been found that chelants can act in combination with the cleaning amine of the invention to provide improved grease cleaning. Preferred chelants for use herein are aminophosphonate and aminocarboxylated chelants in particular aminocarboxylated chelants such as MGDA and GLDA.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to the second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of manually washing dishware using the composition of the invention in neat form (direct application). The composition of the invention can also be used in diluted form (full sink), however greater benefits in terms of grease cleaning are obtained when the composition is directly applied on the soiled surface or on a cleaning implement, such as sponge, to be used to clean the soiled surface. There is also provided the use of the composition of the invention for the removal of greasy soils in manual dishwashing.</p>
    <heading id="h-00004-en">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The present invention envisages a cleaning composition, preferably a hand dishwashing cleaning composition, comprising a surfactant system and a specific cleaning amine. The composition of the invention provides very good grease removal. The invention also envisages a method of hand dishwashing and use of the composition for the removal of greasy soils.</p>
    <heading id="h-00005-en">The cleaning composition</heading>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The cleaning composition is preferably a hand dishwashing cleaning composition, preferably in liquid form. It typically contains from 30% to 95%, preferably from 40% to 90%, more preferably from 50% to 85% by weight of a liquid carrier in which the other essential and optional components are dissolved, dispersed or suspended.

    <heading id="h-00016-en">Preservatives</heading>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The composition of the invention preferably comprises a preservative. A preservative is a naturally occurring or synthetically produced substance that is added to detergent compositions to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. Preservatives can be divided into two types, depending on their origin. Class I preservatives refers to those preservatives which are naturally occurring, everyday substances. Class II preservatives refer to preservatives which are synthetically manufactured. Most preferred preservatives for use in liquid detergent compositions include derivatives of isothiazolinones, including methylisothiazolinone, methylchloroisothiazolinone, octylisothiazolinone, 1,2-benzisothiazolinone, and mixtures thereof. Other non-limiting examples of preservatives typically used are phenoxyethanol, paraben derivatives such as methyl paraben and propyl paraben, imidazole derivatives, and aldehydes including glutaraldehyde.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The detergent composition herein may comprise a number of optional ingredients such as builders, conditioning polymers, cleaning polymers, surface modifying polymers, soil flocculating polymers, structurants, emollients, humectants, skin rejuvenating actives, enzymes, carboxylic acids, scrubbing particles, bleach and bleach activators, perfumes, malodor control agents, pigments, dyes, opacifiers, beads, pearlescent particles, microcapsules, antibacterial agents, enzymes, pH adjusters, buffering means or water or any other dilutents or solvents compatible with the formulation.</p>
    <heading id="h-00017-en">Method of washing</heading>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The second aspect of the invention is directed to a method of washing dishware with the composition of the present invention. Said method comprises the step of applying the composition, preferably in liquid form, onto the dishware surface, either directly or by means of a cleaning implement, i.e., in neat form.</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">By "in its neat form", it is meant herein that said composition is not diluted in a full sink of water. The composition is applied directly onto the surface to be treated and/or onto a cleaning device or implement such as a dish cloth, a sponge or a dish brush without undergoing major dilution (immediately) prior to the application. The cleaning device or implement is preferably wet before or after the composition is delivered to it. Especially good polymerized grease removal has been found when the composition is used in neat form. The cleaning mechanism that takes place when compositions are used in neat form seems to be quite different to that taken place when compositions are used in diluted form.</p>
    <heading id="h-00018-en">Examples</heading>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The removal of uncooked grease of hand dishwashing detergent compositions with and without amines according to the invention was evaluated.
