      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The presently disclosed invention relates to adjustable tables and, more particularly, tables that are ergonomically suitable for use in connection with beds, wheelchairs, patients' chairs and recliners such as used in hospitals and other health care institutions.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Adjustable tables have been used for many years for a variety of reasons and purposes. In the case where users are bedridden or have limited mobility such as patients in hospitals or nursing care facilities, such tables help provide meals and are otherwise useful in affording a platform for personal care. Such tables are also helpful in connection with the patient's pursuit of other activities such as reading or other enjoyments and interests.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Persons who are bedridden or have limited mobility have a limited range of motion and body positions available to them. If has been found that such limitations on range of motion or position can cause patient discomfort and, in some cases, can even be harmful to the patient. Accordingly, in health care setting and elsewhere, there has been increasing emphasis on beds and other furniture that is ergonomically suited to the user's needs</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">With regard to overbed tables, there have been significant improvements to their ergonomic character. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,316,777 describes an overbed table with improved stability. In that case, the table was provided with arm supports suitable for use by patients whose injuries or disabilities required adjustable arm supports by which they could gain leverage to move themselves or to support others who may be assisting them. To improve the stability of the overbed, the position of the arm rests relative to the supporting platform for the table was redesigned. The redesign allowed significantly greater leverage to be brought against the arm rests without the risk that the table would pitch forward and result in frustration or even injury to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">More recently, it has been recognized that overbed tables would be still further improved if they could better accommodate certain user activities. For example, when patients that participate in activities that involve very limited or highly repetitive movements or body positions such as reading, it would be preferable that the overbed table can accommodate the position that is most ergonomically favorable to them. It has been found that, in many cases, this involves an overbed table with capabilities for a foldable top surface. Particularly advantageous would be an overbed table that afforded a top surface that had a range of foldable positions as this would accommodate not only a number of activities, but also a variety of body types and sizes among those people who are engaging in such activities.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In addition to the forgoing, it also has been found that improved designs in overbed tables should also better accommodate the need for cleaning. It would be particularly beneficial if the design would enable easier, faster cleaning procedures. That would not only result in considerable costs savings, but would also tend to avoid resistance and objections to regular cleaning so as to result in cleaner, safer overbed tables.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In accordance with the presently disclosed invention, an overbed table includes a desktop body that is supported by at least one elongate member that is secured to a support platform. A flexible table top that is secured to the top of the desktop body includes a table top frame and a flex top. The table top frame is pivotally connected to the back of the desktop body so that the overbed table can be opened from the top for access to the desktop body by lifting the table top frame. In some cases, friction hinges are used to connect the table top frame to the desktop body so that the top will not close inadvertently.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A flex top that is connected to the table top frame includes two panels that are connected by an integrated hinge. The flex top includes pins that cooperate with stops that are configured along a track that is defined in the table top frame to control the position of the two flex top panels. In one position, the panels are in the same plane. When the pins of the flex top are moved to other stop positions in the track, the back of the flex top moves forward causing the two panels to form a peak along the axis of the integrated hinge that joins the panels. The rise in the peak is determined by the position of the pins in the track; the further forward the pins are moved, the steeper the peak that is formed by the two panels.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Preferably, the front of the flex top is connected to the front of the table top frame by a biased fastener that allows the front of the flex top to be manually uncoupled from the front of the table top frame. This allows the flex top to be pivoted away from the table top frame so that the bottom surface of the flex top can be cleaned quickly and easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Also preferably, the overbed table includes armrests that are connected to the desktop body by a slide assembly. The slide assembly includes a slide housing and a rail that cooperates with the slide housing and that is secured to the bottom of the armrest. The user can adjust to the position of the armrest relative to the position of the desktop body by pushing or pulling on the armrest to achieve the desired location. The slide housing is secured to the desktop body. Accordingly, the angular pitch of the armrest relative to the desktop body is determined by the orientation of the slide housing with respect to the desktop body.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some cases, a gasket may be attached to the desktop body at a location between the desktop body and the bottom of the armrest. The gasket acts to seal fluids from traveling underneath the armrest to locations that are difficult to access for purposes of cleaning the overbed table.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">It is sometimes preferable that the flex top includes third and fourth panels that are connected to the first and second panels by respective second and third integrated hinges. In that case, the third panel includes the biased fastener for coupling and uncoupling the front of the flex top to the front of the tale top frame and pins that cooperate with stops in the track extend from the fourth panel. In all cases, the integrated hinges provide a smooth, continuous surface on the top of the flex top so that there are no cracks or valleys between adjacent panels.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some embodiments, the flex top includes border segments with a top surface that is at elevation that is higher than the top surface of the non-border portions of the flex top. The border segments in combination with the continuous top surface of the flex top across the integrated hinges allows liquids that may be spilled on the top surface of the flex top to be contained on the flex top thus avoiding liquids flowing from the overbed table unto bedding or elsewhere. Preferably, the top surface of the flex top is inclined downwardly in the direction of the user. One advantage of this is that spilled liquids will be pooled on the top surface of the flex top for easier and faster cleanup.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">These and other objects, details and advantages of the presently disclosed overbed table will become better understood or apparent from the following descriptions and examples that are further disclosed herein.</p>

In this way, the user can access shell <b>100</b> and compartments <b>102</b> by raising the front of table top frame <b>38</b> to expose shell <b>100</b>. To avoid inadvertent closing of table top frame <b>38</b>, hinges <b>112</b> may be friction hinges.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>13</b> show table top frame <b>38</b> wherein raised edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> further define openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> that are located in raised edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> respectively. Openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are located between respective track <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> and front edge <b>42</b> of table top frame <b>38</b>. Correspondingly, flex top <b>40</b> includes fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> that are extendable through openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> of raised edges <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> at times when fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are respectively aligned with openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. In this way, flex top <b>40</b> is connected to table top frame <b>38</b>, preferably at a location near the front edge <b>42</b> of table top frame <b>38</b>. Fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are retractable in the longitudinal direction of the fasteners such that they are moveable out of openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to uncouple the front of flex top <b>40</b> from table top frame <b>38</b> thereby leaving flex top <b>40</b> pivotally connected to table top frame <b>38</b> by pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> at times when fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are out of opening <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In the presently preferred embodiment, fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are normally biased to extend through openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> at times when the fasteners are respectively aligned with the openings. Fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may be of the type that they can be manually displaced from openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Is some embodiments, fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> may be spring plungers.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">
        <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>13</b> also show that tracks <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of table top frame <b>38</b> define one or more stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> that are located at respective positions along tracks <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> respectively, Stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> are configured to allow respective pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to travel along the respective track <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> past stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. At the same time, stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> also provide a seat for maintaining pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> at the position of a selected stop <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> as the user of the overbed table may elect. The user may bypass stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> by moving pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> over or around the stops. The user may engage pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> with stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> by positioning the pins against a selected stop.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In the presently preferred embodiment, <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>13</b> show that flex top <b>40</b> includes a third panel <b>122</b> that is connected to first panel <b>54</b> by a second integral hinge <b>124</b>. Third panel <b>122</b> has a side <b>126</b> that is located on third panel <b>122</b> oppositely from second integral hinge <b>124</b>. Side <b>126</b> defines a concave edge to allow the user closer access to flex top <b>40</b>. Third panel <b>122</b> further defines first and second edges <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> that are oppositely disposed on third panel <b>122</b> from each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">At times when fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are in their normally biased state, the fasteners extend from first and second edges <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> respectively. To remove fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> from openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> respectively, the user manually presses inwardly against the ends of fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> in the longitudinal direction to overcome the bias force of fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and push the respective ends of the fasteners out of openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Flex top <b>40</b> is then pivotally connected to fable top frame <b>38</b> by pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> such that flex top <b>40</b> be pivoted upwardly from the front edge <b>42</b> to afford access to the bottom of flex top <b>40</b> so that it can be quickly and easily cleaned.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Also shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>13</b>, the preferred embodiment of flex top <b>40</b> may include a fourth panel <b>132</b> that is connected to second panel <b>56</b> by a third integral hinge <b>134</b>. Fourth panel <b>132</b> defines a side <b>136</b> that is located oppositely on said fourth panel <b>132</b> from third integral hinge <b>134</b>. Also, fourth panel <b>132</b> defines first and second edges <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> that are oppositely disposed on fourth panel <b>132</b> from each other. Pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> extend from first and second edges <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In the operation of flex top <b>40</b>, starting with fasteners <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> engaged in openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> engaged with the first stops <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> respectively, the flex top <b>40</b> has a planar geometry that is essentially parallel to the plane of table top frame <b>38</b>. To form the folded top feature of the disclosed overbed table as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 13</figref>, pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are moved from first stops <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and urged forward through tracks <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> to a selected one of stops <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. This movement causes first panel <b>54</b> to cooperate with second panel <b>56</b> to form a peak <b>86</b> along folding axis <b>66</b>. The steepness of the peak <b>86</b> depends on the stop <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> that the user, in their own discretion, selects. The closer the stop <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> to side <b>126</b> of flex top <b>40</b>, the steeper the peak that is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIGS. 10-12</figref> show that third panel <b>122</b> defines a bottom surface <b>142</b> and a top surface <b>144</b> that is oppositely disposed on the third panel from the bottom surface. Second integral hinge <b>124</b> defines a continuous, even surface between top surface <b>58</b> of first panel <b>54</b> and top surface <b>144</b> of third panel <b>122</b>. Similarly, fourth panel <b>132</b> defines a bottom surface <b>146</b> and a top surface <b>148</b> that is oppositely disposed on fourth panel <b>132</b> from bottom surface <b>146</b>. Third integral hinge <b>134</b> defines a continuous, even surface between top surface <b>62</b> of second panel <b>56</b> and top surface <b>148</b> of fourth panel <b>132</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">As shown in the drawings, second integral hinge <b>124</b> defines a groove <b>150</b> between bottom surface <b>60</b> of first panel <b>54</b> and bottom surface <b>142</b> of third panel <b>122</b>. Similarly, third integral hinge <b>134</b> defines a groove <b>152</b> between bottom surface <b>64</b> of second panel <b>56</b> and bottom surface <b>146</b> of fourth panel <b>132</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">As particularly shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>10</b>-<b>13</b>, at times when flex top <b>40</b> is in a folded position, top surface <b>58</b> and top surface <b>144</b> define an included angle that is less than 180 degrees and top surface <b>62</b> and top surface <b>148</b> also define an included angle that is less than 180 degrees. At the same time, the angle between top surface <b>54</b> and top surface <b>62</b> when flex top <b>40</b> is in a folded position is greater than 180 degrees. Nevertheless, grooves <b>72</b>, <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are all on the bottom side of flex top <b>40</b>. In this way, the top surface of flex top <b>40</b> that is formed by the top surfaces <b>58</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> in combination with integral hinges <b>68</b>, <b>124</b> and <b>134</b> forms a continuous, even, integral surface. The top surface of flex top <b>40</b> thus formed is without cracks or separations between panels <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>132</b> that could result in discontinuities between adjacent panels. Such features are potential sources for leakage of fluids spilled on flex top <b>40</b> or ridges that interfere with certain user activities such as writing as well as other annoyances and inconveniences. In this way, the integral surface of flex top <b>40</b> provides an overbed table that is easier to clean and less prone to penetration of fluids, dust and other contaminants that make cleaning the overbed table difficult and costly.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As also shown in the drawings, first panel <b>54</b> defines a first edge <b>154</b> and a second edge <b>156</b> that is oppositely disposed on first panel <b>54</b> from first edge <b>154</b>. The top surface <b>58</b> of panel <b>54</b> of flex top <b>40</b> defines a first border segment <b>158</b> and a second border segment <b>160</b>. Border segments <b>158</b> and <b>160</b> are adjacent first and second edges <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> respectively of first panel <b>54</b>. The top surface of first and second border segments <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> of first panel <b>54</b> are elevated from the top surface <b>58</b> of the portion of first panel <b>54</b> that is between first and second border segments <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>. Also, top surface <b>58</b> of the portion of first panel <b>54</b> that is between first and second border segments <b>158</b>, <b>160</b> is inclined with respect to the top surface of border segments <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>. The sense of the incline across the top surface is downwardly in the direction from first integral hinge <b>68</b> toward the concave side <b>126</b> of flex top <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Similarly to the top surface of first panel <b>54</b>, second panel <b>56</b> defines a first edge <b>162</b> and a second edge <b>164</b> that is oppositely disposed on second panel <b>56</b> from first edge <b>162</b>. The top surface of second panel <b>56</b> of flex top <b>40</b> defines a first border segment <b>166</b> and a second border segment <b>168</b>. First and second border segments <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> are adjacent first and second edges <b>162</b>, <b>164</b> of second panel <b>56</b>. The top surface of first and second border segments <b>166</b>, <b>168</b> of second panel <b>56</b> are elevated above the top surface <b>62</b> of the portion of second panel <b>56</b> that is between first and second border segments <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>.
