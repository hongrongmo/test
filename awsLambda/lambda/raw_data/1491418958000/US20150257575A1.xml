      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Slow cookers are countertop electrical cooking appliances that are used for simmering. They require maintaining a relatively low temperature for several hours, allowing unattended cooking of pot roast, stews, soups, “boiled” dinners and other suitable dishes. They are also used to maintain the food at serving temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">While the slow cooker is usually a single slow cooker used for preparing dinners of a family, recent versions include multiple slow cookers in the shape of multiple cooking pots (usually three) embedded in a single appliance. The multiple pots allow to serve guests with various dishes during a party. The multiple pots are disposed next to each other in a straight line or sometimes in a circle which make the device cumbersome to handle and to store. Further it may happen that only two out of the three pots of a slow cooker are in use at a given time, which leaves a pot unused empty on the party table. Also, a family typically owns a slow cooker as well as a multiple pots party appliance (e.g. a triple slow cooker) which makes the use of the two slow cookers redundant. In some cases, there is a need during a dinner party of multiple appliances for cooking and serving whether these are slow cookers or not. These appliances may not have cooperative shapes between each other, and they may take up large amounts of counterpace.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Accordingly, there is provided an assembly of cooking units. The assembly comprises a first cooking unit including a top surface and first and second side surfaces. The top surface includes an area adapted to receive a cooking device. A first portion of an electrical connector is disposed on the first side surface. A second cooking unit includes a top surface and first and second side surfaces. The top surface includes an area adapted to receive a cooking device. A second portion of the electrical connector is disposed on the second side surface of the second cooking unit. The second portion of the electrical connector is connectable to the first portion of the connector. When the second portion of the electrical connector is connected to the first portion of the connector, the electrical connector is adapted to conduct electricity between the first and second cooking units.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In one embodiment, the first side surface of the first and second cooking units is a left side surface, and the second side surface of the first and second cooking units is a right side surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, at least a portion of the first side surface of the first cooking unit is slidable into at least a portion of the second side surface of the second cooking unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one embodiment, in the first side surface of the first cooking unit includes a recess, and the second side surface of the second cooking unit includes a protrusion. The cooperates with the protrusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In one embodiment, the first portion of the electrical connector is a male connector, and the second portion of the electrical connector is a female connector.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one embodiment, at least one of the first and second cooking units includes an outlet. The outlet is adapted to connect to a power cable for connecting the first and second cooking units to the electric network.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one embodiment, the outlet is one of the first and second portions of the electrical connector.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In one embodiment, the first cooking unit includes a first lock portion, and the second cooking unit includes a second lock portion. The first lock portion cooperates with the second lock portion to connect the first and second cooking units to each other.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an assembly <b>10</b> of three connectable and stackable cooking units <b>12</b>, in the shape of slow cookers, will be described. The assembly <b>10</b> includes three cooking units <b>12</b> that are connectable, detachable and stackable with each other. The cooking units <b>12</b> are shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in a connected (or serving) position. In the connected position, the cooking units <b>12</b> are mechanically and electrically coupled to each other. They can be used for cooking or for keeping the food at serving temperature. Although the cooking units <b>12</b> described herein are slow cookers, it is contemplated that the assembly <b>10</b> could include cooking units other than slow cookers. For example, the assembly <b>10</b> could include one or more rice cooker, a deep fryer or a cooking/warming plate. Although the following description will refer to an assembly of three cooking units <b>10</b>, it is contemplated that the assembly could have only two or more than three cooking units. In one example, the assembly <b>10</b> includes six cooking units. In another example, power could allow the assembly <b>10</b> to include ten cooking units.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Turning now to <figref>FIGS. 3 to 6</figref>, each of the cooking unit <b>12</b> being identical, only one cooking unit <b>12</b> will be described. Although the cooking units <b>12</b> are identical to each other in the embodiment shown in the Figures, it is contemplated that one or more of the cooking units <b>12</b> could have a size and/or shape different from the other ones. For example, one of the cooking units <b>12</b> could be longer than the other ones to accommodate a griddle or a cooking plate while the other cooking units could be shorter and accommodate slow cooker and/or rice cookers.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The cooking unit <b>12</b> has a generally rectangular body <b>14</b> with blunt edges. It is contemplated that the body <b>14</b> could have a shape different from the shape shown in the</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Figures. For example, the body <b>14</b> could be round, oval, or shaped like a portion of a pie. In another example, the body <b>14</b> is rectangular and/or has sharp edges. The body <b>14</b> has a bottom surface <b>11</b>, a top surface <b>13</b>, a front surface <b>15</b>, a right side surface <b>16</b>, a rear surface <b>17</b>, and a left side surface <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring more specifically to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the front surface <b>15</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b> includes a dial <b>19</b>. The dial <b>19</b> allows to operate each of the cooking units <b>12</b> individually from one another even when the cooking units <b>12</b> are connected to each other in the manner shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The dial <b>19</b> has four settings: off, low, high and warm. Low is used to slow cook, warm is used to keep the food at tasting temperature while not cooking the food, and high is used for slow cooking in a faster way than regular slow cooking yet below simmering temperature. Since the dials <b>19</b> are independent from each other, when in operation one of the cooking unit <b>12</b> could be at a first cooking temperature, while another cooking unit <b>12</b> connected to the previous mentioned cooking unit <b>12</b> could be at a second temperature different from the first temperature. In another example, one of the cooking units <b>12</b> could be at a cooking temperature, while another cooking unit <b>12</b> could be at a serving temperature where the food is keep hot but is not cooking. It is contemplated that the dial <b>19</b> could be disposed elsewhere on the cooking unit <b>12</b>. For example, the dial <b>19</b> could be disposed on the front surface <b>15</b> toward a right side. It is also contemplated that operation of the cooking unit <b>12</b> could be achieved by ways other than the dial <b>19</b>. For example, a plurality of buttons or a touch screen could be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The top surface <b>13</b> of the body <b>14</b> includes an opening (not shown) to receive a slow cooker bowl <b>30</b>. It is contemplated that the top surface <b>13</b> could not have an opening. For example, should the cooking unit <b>12</b> be a stove top burner or a griddle. It is also contemplated that the top surface <b>13</b> could have an opening for receiving a bowl other than the cooking bowl <b>30</b> for a slow cooker. For example, the bowl could be a bowl for a rice cooker or for a deep fryer.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The cooking bowl <b>30</b> is made of ceramic and receives the food to be cooked. The cooking bowl <b>30</b> has a capacity of 2.5 Qt. The cooking bowl <b>30</b> has two handles <b>31</b> to facilitate its extraction and positioning into the opening. The cooking bowl <b>30</b> also includes a recess <b>32</b> on its rim to allow a serving spoon to rest there. It is contemplated that the handles <b>31</b> and/or the recess <b>32</b> could be omitted. The opening and cooking bowl <b>30</b> are oval, but it is contemplated that the recess and cooking bowl <b>30</b> could be circular or have another suitable shape. It is also contemplated that the cooking bowl <b>30</b> could have a higher or a smaller capacity. For example, the cooking bowl could have a capacity of 2.0 Qt. It is also contemplated that the cooking bowl <b>30</b> could have a divider so as to cook simultaneously two dishes. It is contemplated that the cooking bowl <b>30</b> could be made of a material other than ceramic. For example, the cooking bowl <b>30</b> could be made of aluminum or i-cast.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The cooking bowl <b>30</b> is removably covered by a lid <b>33</b>. The lid <b>33</b> is made of transparent glass and has a knob <b>34</b> at a top thereof to manipulate the lid <b>33</b>. The knob <b>34</b> is made of plastic and is attached to the lid <b>33</b> by a screw (not shown). The knob <b>34</b> includes an opening <b>35</b> to allow the lid to be placed onto a lid holder <b>44</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. It is contemplated that the lid <b>33</b> could be opaque or could be made of a material other than glass. For example, the lid <b>33</b> could be made of ceramic or plastic. It is also contemplated that the knob <b>34</b> could not include the opening <b>35</b>. It is contemplated that the lid holder <b>44</b> could be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The top surface <b>13</b> is generally flat around the opening and adapted to cooperate with the bottom surface <b>11</b> of another one of the cooking units <b>12</b> so that the cooking units <b>12</b> can be stacked on top of each other. The top surface <b>13</b> includes four recesses <b>40</b>, each one disposed at a corner of the top surface <b>13</b>. The recesses <b>40</b> are shaped and dimensioned to receive corresponding feet pads <b>48</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) of other ones of the cooking units <b>12</b> when disposed one on top of the other. It is contemplated that the recesses <b>40</b> could be omitted. It is also contemplated that the cooking units <b>12</b> could include locks to secure them to each other when disposed one on top of another.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the right and left side surfaces <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b> are designed to cooperate with left and right surfaces <b>18</b>, <b>16</b> respectively of the other cooking units <b>12</b>. The right side surface <b>16</b> includes a male connector <b>20</b>, and the left side surface <b>18</b> includes a female connector <b>22</b> which together forms an electric connection between the cooking unit <b>12</b>. As a consequence, only one cable <b>21</b> is needed to operate one, two or the three cooking units <b>12</b> when they are connected to each other by the male and female connectors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Should the assembly include more than three cooking units <b>12</b>, only on cable <b>21</b> would also be sufficient to power the assembly of cooking units <b>12</b> connected to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The male connector <b>20</b> is insertable into the female connector <b>22</b> via a vertical sliding action as best illustrated by arrow <b>50</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The male connector <b>20</b> is disposed in a generally V-shaped recess (or groove) <b>23</b><i>a </i>on the right side surface <b>16</b>, while the female connector <b>22</b> is disposed in a generally I-shaped protrusion or tongue <b>23</b><i>b </i>on the left side surface <b>18</b>. The recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>and protrusion <b>23</b><i>b </i>cooperate with each other to guide the cooking units <b>12</b> during connection to each other. The recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>and protrusions <b>23</b><i>b </i>also provide some mechanical connection between the cooking units <b>12</b> by preventing lateral motion (indicated by arrow <b>51</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) between the cooking unit <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The male connector <b>20</b> includes two prongs <b>20</b><i>a. </i>The female connector <b>22</b> includes two recesses <b>22</b><i>b </i>which are adapted to cooperate with the two prongs <b>20</b><i>a. </i>The recesses <b>22</b><i>b </i>are covered by a door which is spring biased toward a closed position. In the closed position, the recesses <b>22</b><i>b </i>are covered by the door. Upon insertion of the protrusion <b>23</b><i>b </i>in slits <b>23</b><i>c, </i>the prongs <b>20</b><i>a </i>force the door to open which allows the prongs <b>20</b> a to insert into the recesses <b>22</b><i>b </i>thereby connecting the male connector <b>20</b> to the female connector <b>22</b>. It is contemplated that electrical coupling of the cooking units <b>12</b> could be achieved by a suitable manner other than by the slidable male/female connectors <b>20</b>,<b>22</b>. For example, an inter-cooking-units cable or adaptor (that would not work in a wall outlet) could connect two cooking units to each other. The inter-cooking-units cable or adapter would allow the cooking units <b>12</b> to be electrically connected yet not abutting each other. It is also contemplated that the cooking units <b>12</b> which are disposed at extremities of the assembly <b>10</b> could be devoid of any connector <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> on those surfaces which are not to be connected to any other slow cooker. In that case, the cooking unit <b>12</b> would not be identical to each other. For example, the right side surface <b>16</b> of the most right cooking unit <b>12</b> could be without any male connector <b>20</b>, and that the left side surface <b>18</b> of the most left cooking unit <b>12</b> could be without any female connector <b>22</b>. It is also contemplated that the left side surface <b>18</b> could include the male connector <b>20</b> instead of the female connector <b>22</b>, and that the right side surface <b>16</b> could include the female connector <b>22</b> instead of the male connector <b>20</b>. In another example, one or more of the cooking units <b>12</b> could include instead or in addition, a male connector <b>20</b> and/or a female connector <b>22</b> on the rear surface <b>17</b>. Such connector on the rear surface <b>17</b> would allow to dispose the cooking units <b>12</b> in a L-shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The male connector <b>20</b> can also be used as an outlet to which the cable <b>21</b> is inserted for connecting the cooking unit <b>12</b> to the electricity network. The cable <b>21</b> is a breakaway cable, and houses a female socket (not shown), which can connect to the prongs <b>20</b><i>a </i>with a magnet (not shown). It is contemplated that the magnet could be omitted. Although each of the cooking units <b>12</b> includes the outlet, when the cooking units <b>12</b> are connected to each other, only one outlet is exposed (belonging to one of the two cooking units <b>12</b> disposed at extremities) is used by the cable <b>21</b> to power all three cooking units <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that the outlet could be distinct from the male connector <b>20</b>, and could be disposed elsewhere on the cooking unit <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The right and left side surfaces <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> further include a lock made of two parts which cooperate with each other to attach two cooking units <b>12</b> together. The lock includes a male portion <b>26</b> disposed on the right side surface <b>18</b> and a female portion <b>28</b> disposed on the right left surface <b>16</b>, both toward the bottom surface <b>11</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that female portion <b>28</b> could be disposed on the right side surface <b>16</b> and the male portion <b>26</b> could be disposed on the right side surface <b>18</b>. The lock is actuated by a knob <b>24</b> disposed on the rear surface <b>17</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b>. Upon rotation of the knob <b>24</b>, a mechanical coupling (not shown) within the cooking unit <b>12</b> ensures that a pin <b>27</b> extends outwardly from the male portion <b>26</b>. When two cooking units <b>12</b> are connected into another by the recess <b>23</b><i>a </i>and protrusion <b>23</b><i>b, </i>the pin <b>27</b>, when extended, fits into a recess <b>29</b> of the female portion <b>28</b> thereby locking the male portion <b>26</b> to the female portion <b>28</b>. Although the cooking units <b>12</b> can be connected to each other without the lock, the lock brings additional strength of the assembly <b>10</b>, such that the assembly <b>10</b> can be lifted all together and be carried, for example from the kitchen to the serving table. To disconnect the two cooking units <b>12</b>, the user just rotates the knob <b>24</b> in the other direction until the pin <b>27</b> is retracted from the recess <b>29</b>. It is contemplated that the lock could be different from shown herein and could be positioned elsewhere on the cooking unit <b>12</b>. For example, the lock could include a hook pivotally connected to the rear surface <b>17</b> toward one of the right and left side surfaces <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, and a knob fixedly connected to the rear surface <b>17</b> toward the other one of the right and left side surfaces to connect to the hook. The lock could be configured so that the hook of one of the cooking units <b>12</b> connects with the knob of another one of the cooking units <b>12</b>. It is contemplated that the pin <b>27</b> and recess <b>29</b> could be actuated by a lever instead of the knob <b>24</b>. It is also contemplated that the lock could be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Turning to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the bottom surface <b>11</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b> includes a plurality of air vents <b>46</b> and the four feet pads <b>48</b>. The air vents <b>46</b> allow to exchange heat with the outside environment to cool of the internal components. As mentioned above, the bottom surface <b>11</b> includes the feet pads <b>48</b> which are each disposed at a corner of the bottom surface <b>11</b>. The feet pads <b>48</b> provide added stability to the cooking unit <b>12</b> but can also be received in the recesses <b>40</b> to facilitate stacking of the cooking units <b>12</b> on top of each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Referring more specifically to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, to connect two cooking units <b>12</b> to each other, the user places the two cooking units <b>12</b> facing a same direction with male connector <b>20</b> of one of the cooking units <b>12</b> facing the female connector <b>22</b> of an other one of the cooking units <b>12</b>. The user then lifts one on the cooking units <b>12</b> and slides the female connector <b>22</b> into the male connector <b>20</b> as indicated by arrow <b>50</b>. The user repeats the same operation with yet another one of the cooking units <b>12</b> onto the newly formed assembly of two cooking units <b>10</b> should he/she would want to form an assembly of three cooking units. For additional connection, the user may attach the cooking units <b>12</b> to each other using the pins <b>27</b> and recesses <b>29</b> via the knobs <b>24</b>. To power the assembly of cooking units <b>12</b>, the user plugs the cable <b>21</b> to only one of the cooking units <b>12</b> and to the electric network.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The user may want to dispose the cooking units <b>12</b> in a manner different from the one shown in the Figures. For example, the user may want to disposed in a L-shape or in a U-shape so as to be disposed at table's corners. To do this, the user could use the inter-cooking-units connector or adapter between those two cooking units that are at the corner of the L-shape. In the case where the cooking unit has a female or male connector at the rear surface <b>17</b>, the user could just connect the rear surface <b>17</b> with a corresponding left or right surface <b>18</b>, <b>16</b> so as to form an L.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">To disconnect the cooking units <b>12</b>, the user turns the knob <b>24</b> in the other direction if the cooking units <b>12</b> were attached to each other by the pin <b>27</b> and recess <b>29</b>. The user then slides the female connector <b>22</b> of one of the cooking units <b>12</b> out of the male connector <b>20</b> of other one of the cooking units <b>12</b> to fully released the cooking units <b>12</b> from each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the cooking units <b>12</b> are shown in a stacked or stored position. To store the cooking units <b>12</b> the user disconnects all the cooking units <b>12</b> from each other, as described above. The user may remove the lids <b>32</b> or dispose the lids <b>32</b> upside down on the cooking bowls <b>30</b> to allow the bottom surfaces <b>11</b> to be stacked onto the top surfaces <b>13</b> of the corresponding cooking units <b>12</b> so as to form a vertical stack of cooking units <b>12</b>. The recesses <b>40</b> receive the feet pads <b>48</b> of the cooking unit <b>12</b> disposed directly above it. The recesses <b>40</b> provide additional coupling between the cooking units <b>12</b> when stacked vertically, as they forbid some lateral movement between the cooking units <b>12</b>. It is possible to store only two or three of the cooking units <b>12</b> in this manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As can be apparent from the above description, the cooking assembly <b>10</b> is a versatile device which allows to use either one, two or the three cooking units <b>12</b> depending on the dishes that the user wants to cook and/or served. One cable <b>21</b> is sufficient to connect either the one, two or the three cooking units <b>12</b> to the electric network. The cooking assembly <b>10</b> is easily stored by stacking either one, two or the three cooking units <b>12</b> on top of each other. Furthermore, with the cooking assembly <b>10</b> there is no need to own both a single cooker and a multiple pots party cooker.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Modifications and improvements to the above-described embodiments of the present may become apparent to those skilled in the art. The foregoing description is intended to be exemplary rather than limiting. The scope of the present is therefore intended to be limited solely by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
