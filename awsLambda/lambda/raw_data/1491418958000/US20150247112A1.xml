      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The ability to culture in vitro three-dimensional cellular constructs that mimic natural tissue has proven challenging. There are multiple dynamic biochemical and mechanical interactions that take place between and among cells in vivo, many of which have yet to be fully understood, and yet the complicated in vivo system must be accurately modeled if successful development of engineered tissues in vitro is to be accomplished. Growth of mammalian cells in vitro using traditional culture methods where cells are grown on a flat substrate, such as in a conventional cell culture plate or flask, fails to replicate the complexities cells encounter in vivo. One of the major physical differences relates to the shape and geometry cells acquire when grown on a flat substrate. Growth on two-dimensional surfaces (2D) results in cell flattening and remodeling of the cell and its internal cytoskeleton. Such changes have been shown to alter gene expression. Vergani et al. I<smallcaps>NT </smallcaps>J B<smallcaps>IOCHEM </smallcaps>C<smallcaps>ELL </smallcaps>B<smallcaps>IOL </smallcaps>2004, 36, 1447-1461. Cell flattening also affects nuclear shape, which can lead to differences in gene expression and protein synthesis. Thomas et al. PNAS 2002 99, 1972-1977. This has a significant impact on cell performance and can influence the usefulness of biological assays conducted on 2D cultures. For example, monolayers of cultured cells are though to be more susceptible to therapeutic agents. Bhadriraju &amp; Chen D<smallcaps>RUG </smallcaps>D<smallcaps>ISCOV </smallcaps>T<smallcaps>ODAY </smallcaps>2002 7, 612-620; Sun et al. J B<smallcaps>IOTECHNOL </smallcaps>2006, 122, 372-381. Furthermore, cell culture on rigid surfaces can enhance cell proliferation but inhibit cell differentiation due to limited cell interactions. Cukierman et al.

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Overview</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to bioreactor devices and systems that allow cultured cells to grow and develop with a three-dimensional aspect. In addition, the bioreactor systems described herein can be used for variation and independent control of environmental factors within the individual sub-wells which can be advantageously co-located in a common chamber. For example, the chemical make-up of a nutrient medium that can flow through a chamber as well as the mechanical force environment within the chamber, including the perfusion flow, shear stress, hydrostatic pressure, and the like, can be independently controlled and maintained for each separate culture chamber of the disclosed systems. Further, the bioreactor systems are designed for easy incorporation into automated systems and minimize or eliminate tubing. In certain example embodiments, the bioreactor devices provide small culture volumes within chambers that allow for direct analytics to be done on or by the device, allow full thickness imaging, and permit continuous monitoring and measurement of the growth of a cell culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In one aspect, the systems disclosed herein can be utilized for culturing product cells for medical use, for example, for transplant to a patient or for manufacture of a protein product, such as a biopharmaceutical. According to this embodiment, cells can be grown in an environment that includes the biochemical products of different cell types, at least some of which may be necessary for the growth and development of the desired cells. However, cell types can be maintained in a physically isolated state during their growth and development. As such, possible negative consequences due to the presence of aberrant or undesired cell types in the desired product cells can be avoided.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In another aspect, the systems disclosed herein can be used to more closely study the biochemical communication between different cell types and the influence of this biochemical communication on the growth and development of cells. As the local environment within each culture chamber of the system can be independently controlled while biochemical communication between chambers, or sub-wells within chambers, can be maintained, information regarding the growth and development of cells and the influence of the local environment on that growth and development can be examined through the use of the devices and systems disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In another aspect, the devices disclosed herein can be used to study the triggering mechanisms involved in stem cell differentiation or to provide isolated, differentiated cells for implantation. For example, undifferentiated stem cells can be located in a first chamber or well, and one or more types of feeder cells can be located in an adjacent chamber(s) or sub-wells.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In another aspect, the devices disclosed herein can be used to study the resistant cell populations that are either residual as a result of, or caused by, exposure of cells to a therapeutic agent. For example, primary cells of a single type or of multiple types obtained from a patient's tumor can be located in a well or chamber of the device, exposed to therapeutic agents that affect the cells resulting in a relative change in the ratio of certain residual or emergent cell populations to other cell populations, and maintain the residual or emergent cells for continued study. For example an assessment of the effect of a different therapeutic agent, or the same therapeutic agent over multiple exposures.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In another aspect, the devices disclosed herein can incorporate primary cells obtained from a patient, expose the cells to therapeutic agents, enable measurement of an effect of the therapeutic agent and be a source for information that is used to draw conclusions about the likelihood of an effect of the therapeutic agent that the patient would experience if actually administered the therapeutic agent or similar or related agents. By way of specific example, such conclusions can be drawn about the effect on either the original cell populations obtained from the patient, and/or about the effect on resistant cell populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In yet another aspect, the devices disclosed herein can be used to establish microtumor models. Tumors exist in a complex microenvironment composed of many cell types. For example, the microenvironment of the lung consists primarily of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in contact with ECM. The bioreactor devices disclosed herein can be used to develop microtumor models that more accurately reflect a cancer's microenvironment. The cancer cells may be obtained from established cancer cell line or obtained directly from patient biopsy samples. The cancer cells are then grown in combination with one or more other cell types to more closely replicate the appropriate microenvironment. Such microtumor models may then be used to assess the efficacy of different therapeutic agents. Where the sample is derived directly from a patient sample, such screening can be used to guide the course of therapeutic treatment by selecting the therapeutic agent or therapeutic agents that has shown the greatest efficacy in the context of the microtumor model.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In another aspect, the devices disclosed herein integrate micropump automation for perfusion flow and provide multiple replicates in a device footprint conducive to interfacing with existing instrumentation. This includes, for example, automated pipetting stations as well as spectrometer plate readers and microscopes for in situ monitoring and quantitative evaluation of culture conditions and outcomes. Each individual replicate on the device may represent an independent, closed system, with an integrated fluidic circuit that seamlessly transitions into the inlet and outlet ports contained on the device. Each replicate may be positioned in parallel fashion and each driven by its own micropump head. The devices disclosed herein may be utilized in a rack system that can accommodate multiple devices in a space-saving stacked configuration.</p>

      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In certain example embodiments, the portions of a sub-well may be different shapes, such as rectangles, squares, diamonds, or other shapes. For example, the sub-well may include a nested-type series of squares. In certain example embodiments, a single sub-well may include different shapes. For example, a circular sub-well may contain a square, and the square may contain a circle or other shape nested therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The layout of the culture area and associated sub-well <b>120</b> wall can be adjusted in both shape and size to, for example, reduce the distance proximity that the majority of cells have to the wall. Such adjustments may be useful, for example, when cells are cultured in a 3D cell anchorage and there is a need for higher levels of soluble factors produced by the cells to be introduced into the environment. For example, the shape may be circular versus linear, rectangular, or circular versus multiple, smaller circle-shaped sub-wells, allowing for adjustment of the surface area to volume ratio for the 3D cell construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In certain example embodiments, the sub-well may contain a cell scaffold with the insert ensuring dispersed perfusion to and around the cell-scaffold construct. The term âcell scaffoldâ as used herein refers to one or more articles upon which cells can attach and develop. For instance, the term âcell scaffoldâ can refer to a single continuous scaffold, multiple discrete 3D scaffolds, or a combination thereof. The terms âcell scaffold,â âcellular scaffold,â and âscaffoldâ are intended to be synonymous. Any suitable cell scaffold as is generally known in the art can be located in the culture chamber to provide anchorage sites for cells and to encourage the development of a three-dimensional cellular construct within the culture chamber. For purposes of the present disclosure, the term âcontinuous scaffoldâ is herein defined to refer to a construct suitable for use as a cellular scaffold that can be utilized alone as a single, three-dimensional entity. A continuous scaffold is usually porous in nature and has a semi-fixed shape. Continuous scaffolds are well known in the art and can be formed of many materials, e.g., coral, collagen, calcium phosphates, synthetic polymers, natural polymers and the like, and are usually pre-formed to a specific shape designed for the location in which they will be placed. Continuous scaffolds are usually seeded with the desired cells through absorption and cellular migration, often coupled with application of pressure through simple stirring, pulsatile perfusion methods or application of centrifugal force. Discrete scaffolds are smaller entities, such as beads, rods, tubes, fragments, or the like. When utilized as a cellular anchorage, a plurality of identical or a mixture of different discrete scaffolds can be loaded with cells and/or other agents and located within a void where the plurality of entities can function as a single cellular anchorage device. Exemplary discrete scaffolds suitable for use in the present invention that have been found particularly suitable for use in vivo are described further in U.S. Pat. No. 6,991,652 to Burg, which is incorporated herein by reference. A cellular scaffold formed of a plurality of discrete scaffolds can be preferred in certain embodiments of the present invention as discrete scaffolds can facilitate uniform cell distribution throughout the anchorage and can also allow good flow characteristics throughout the anchorage as well as encouraging the development of a three-dimensional cellular construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In one example embodiment, for instance when considering a cellular scaffold including multiple discrete scaffolds, the scaffold can be seeded with cells following assembly and sterilization of the system. For example, an embodiment including multiple discrete scaffolds can be seeded in one operation or several sequential operations. Optionally, the anchorage can be pre-seeded, prior to assembly of the system. In one embodiment, the scaffold can include a combination of both pre-seeded discrete scaffolds and discrete scaffolds that have not been seeded with cells prior to assembly of the system. The good flow characteristics possible throughout a plurality of discrete scaffolds can also provide for good transport of nutrients to and waste from the developing cells, and thus can encourage not only healthy growth and development of the individual cells throughout the scaffold, but can also encourage development of a unified three-dimensional cellular construct within the culture chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">The materials that are used in forming an scaffold can generally be any suitable biocompatible material. In one embodiment, the materials forming a cellular scaffold can be biodegradable. For instance, a cellular scaffold can include biodegradable synthetic polymeric scaffold materials such as, for example, polylactide, chondroitin sulfate (a proteoglycan component), polyesters, polyethylene glycols, polycarbonates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyacrylamides, polyamides, polyacrylates, polyesters, polyetheresters, polymethacrylates, polyurethanes, polycaprolactone, polyphophazenes, polyorthoesters, polyglycolide, copolymers of lysine and lactic acid, copolymers of lysine-RGD and lactic acid, and the like, and copolymers of the same. Optionally, an anchorage can include naturally derived biodegradable materials including, but not limited to chitosan, agarose, alginate, collagen, hyaluronic acid, and carrageenan (a carboxylated seaweed polysaccharide), demineralized bone matrix, and the like, and copolymers of the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">A biodegradable scaffold can include factors that can be released as the scaffold(s) degrade. For example, an anchorage can include within or on a scaffold one or more factors that can trigger cellular events. According to this embodiment, as the scaffold(s) forming the cellular anchorage degrades, the factors can be released to interact with the cells.</p>

A porous scaffold will be used to create a modular system composed of a fat module and an epithelial module that also contains fibroblasts. This modular system has been demonstrated to facilitate 1) the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells into a separate fatty tissue without the chemicals necessary for differentiation having a negative impact upon the breast cancer epithelial cells and 2) the development of tri-culture breast cancer tissue with patient derived tumor cells that became available with little notice.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">There are numerous benefits to utilizing a porous scaffolding system as they: 1) are biocompatible and many are FDA approved biomaterial, 2) have been utilized to sustain tissue structures for up to months/years, 3) are compatible with vascular systems, 4) can withstand the mechanical stresses of perfusion flow, 5) have been utilized for multiple tissue types, and 6) are adaptable for optical imaging systems.

The complexity of the created ex vivo microenvironment will be increased relative to previous tri-culture models by adding in both endothelial cells and an immune component cells in the form of monocytes/macrophages. The porous scaffold infused with cells in a mixture of Matrigel and Collagen I will be used as the ECM components as they have been shown to promote the formation of terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs) and acini while maintaining the cells in an environment where they remain healthy.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Previous tri-culture models will be further adapted to a tetra-culture model by utilizing the same cells as the tri-culture model, including human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) for the normal model and MCF7 (ER+) and HCC1143 (TNBC) for the cancer model, human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) and human adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) with the addition of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to form the tetra-culture. The HUVECs will be utilized for initial short-term testing, but will then be replaced by human mammary microvascular endothelial cells (HMMEC) so as to keep the system mammary specific. HUVEC/HMMEC will be seeded onto a porous scaffold which is precut to specific dimensions (5 mm diameter by 2.5 mm height) and allowed to grow for 1 week after which ASCs will be added to the scaffold. The scaffolds will be incubated in a mixture of ASC differentiation media and endothelial growth media for 1 week after which they will be cultured in a mixture of ASC growth media and endothelial growth media. The epithelial module will be formed by mixing HMEC, MCF7, or HCC1143 with HMF in a mixture of Matrigel to Collagen I. This mixture of cells and ECM will then be infused into a porous scaffold which is precut to specific dimensions (5 mm diameter by 2.5 mm height). These tissue disks will then be loaded into the sub-wells of the bioreactor devices disclosed herein. After loading the tissue disks into the sub-wells of the bioreactor devices, the devices will be assembled and connected to a perfusion circuit containing cell-specific medium. Gas exchange is enabled in the closed-loop perfusion system via a proprietary PET membrane, and media is dynamically perfused via a programmable syringe pump configuration (KD Scientific) with a dynamic medium perfusion flow of 1-50 uL/min for the length of the experiment. All bioreactor devices will be maintained under standard cell culture conditions (i.e. 37Â° C. humidified 5% CO2/95% air environment).</p>

The combo medium's effects upon cell viability (measured by PrestoBlue) and cell number (dsDNA measured via PicoGreen) will be measured with cell specific growth medium utilized as a control. A short-term 3D static experiment will also be performed to ensure proper tissue morphology which will consist of the formation of TDLU/acini in the normal model and endothelial cell branching/tubule formation (CD31+). Endothelial cells and ASCs will also be cultured in 2D in a mixture of endothelial growth medium and ASC differentiation medium over 7 days and monitored for cell viability and cell proliferation as compared to cell specific growth medium. ASC differentiation will also be monitored by oil red O staining.</p>

The formation of TDLUs/acini and endothelial cell branching/tubule formation as determined by brightfield microscopy and H&amp;E, production of caseins by RT-PCR, replication of the secreted biomarker profile and expression of cell specific markers (E-cadherin, CD31, leptin, adiponectin, Î±-sma, oil red O) by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence at weeks 2 and 4 will determine successful stromal culture conditions.</p>

VEGF will be applied and tubules will be visualized using confocal microscopy by staining with PECAM-1. HUVECs/HMMECs alone in Matrigel will be used as controls. A comparison between the tri- and tetra-culture models in terms of gene expression and both epigenetic and miRNA regulated gene expression will be conducted. This data may be utilized for comparison to patient generated data. To perform this comparison, whole genome cDNA microarray data will be generated as well as epigenetic and miRNA microarray data in-house.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">Triple-negative breast cancers are resistant to current targeted therapies but may see some benefit from anti-angiogenesis compounds. Bevacizumab will be used in combination with paclitaxel (as utilized in the clinic) as a baseline test on the microtumor model to see if it responds similar to clinical trial data. For this study, angiogenesis will be induced through VEGF addition and then a dose curve centered at the IC50 for each drug will be generated. The endothelial cells will be pre-labeled. Cellular cytotoxicity will be measured by LDH release into the supernatant, vascularization will be monitored by confocal microscopy of the labeled endothelial cells. Length and number of sprouts will be counted and related to bevacizumab dosage. Untreated cultures and the tri- culture model will be used as a control since bevacizumab cannot function in this tissue by affecting angiogenesis. The effectiveness of this model for modeling responses to traditional treatments (tamoxifen, cisplatin) will also be measured and the IC50s will be compared to static culture and data previously generated for the tri-culture model.</p>

This will be achieved by analyzing the immunophenotype of perfused THP-1 or differentiated PBMCs obtained from discarded blood or through commercial suppliers. Multiplex bead based immunoassays (Miltenyi) will be used to determine M1 versus M2. For invasion, myeloid-derived cells will be pre-labeled and infiltration over time will be monitored qualitatively with multi-photon microscopy (MPM). Pro-tumorigenic growth and promotion of endothelial structures will be compared with 3D microtumors without TAMs via immuno-histochemistry (IHC). MPM will be used to monitor the effect of macrophages on promotion of vascular structures (through the secretion of proangiogenic factors). J. D. Lathia et al. PLoS O<smallcaps>NE, </smallcaps>6 (2011) e24807. If a pro-tumorigenic effect of macrophages is demonstrated within the system, ibrutinib, dexamethasone, and anti-csf-1 antibodies will be applied to reverse the TAM mediated effects.</p>

Human tumor tissue will arrive in the lab after removal from the patient at which point cellular processing will immediately commence. Isolated primary breast cancer cells will be utilized in a number of assays all designed to better inform upon the utility of the personalized 3D microtumor. Cell samples will be utilized to isolate DNA, RNA, miRNA, and protein. The DNA will be used to compare to epigenetic biomarkers established above, RNA will be used to examine basic gene expression (ER, PR, Her2, casein), miRNA will be used to examine miRNA biomarkers in comparison to those determined above, and protein will be used to examine the expression of genes regulated by the epigenetic/miRNA biomarkers. Once the 3D breast model has been established with primary human epithelial and stromal breast cancer cells, a panel of patient derived 3D breast microtumors will be tested against a panel of combination therapies. In order to compare with existing databases next generation sequencing (NGS) will be performed, and molecular matched breast cancer cell lines will be compared with responses in 2D and simple 3D matrigel cultures. Normalized responses will be depicted as IC50s using 4 parameter linear regression.</p>

Immunophenotype of seeded cells and extracted cells in 3D culture will be assessed for similar markers by flow cytometry, to demonstrate multilineage differentiation. L. F. Pavon et al. F<smallcaps>RONT </smallcaps>N<smallcaps>EUROL., </smallcaps>4 (2014) 214. Soluble angiogenic factors will measured by multiplexed bead based immunoassay.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Short term assessment of viability and hypoxia will be used to identify the best flow rate, which will need to be re-assessed when endothelial cells are added. Perfused 3D cultures of GBM cell lines and GSCs will be performed over 2 weeks in optimized media conditions (stem cell versus differentiation supplements, acidic versus neutral pH, relative hypoxic versus standard incubator), with 4 analytical time points evaluated. Lytic Analysis: IHC will be performed on fixed 3D static tissues using established fixation and imbedding and slides will be immunostained as stated for GSC and differentiation markers. In addition to above IHC for expression markers, the BrdU incorporation assay will be used to better reflect the proliferative cell population over a 48 hour time period in situ, as this assay may better reflect proliferation than traditional IHC with Ki67. M. Witusik-Perkowska et al. J. N<smallcaps>EUROONCOL., </smallcaps>102 (2011) 395-407. Methylation changes will be examined over short term and long term culture experiments. The utilization of bioreactor array platform will enable more efficient and cost effective analysis of the GBM methylome. In addition, methylation status of primary samples can be compared directly with the TCGA to correlate sample tissues with that of the TCGA. Non-lytic analysis: As previously discussed, non-destructive analysis will consist of metabolism, cytotoxicity and in situ imaging using multi-photon microscopy to quantify the redox ratio of different cell populations (i.e. higher proliferating cells in outer layer of spheroids will have a lower redox ratio (NAD/FAD) and slower proliferating intermediate and inner layer cells will have a higher redox ratio. Angiogenic factors will be assessed as previously stated.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">The two mainstays of GBM therapy are external beam radiation and temozolomide TMZ. The bioreactor devices disclosed herein are perfectly suited for evaluating radiation sensitivity and resistance (dosimetry, tissue penetration, effects of hypoxia, soluble factors of cytotoxicity, etc.). TMZ will be applied to each system across multiple cell lines and multiple GCSs in 3D GBM microtumors over 7 days and normalized IC50s will be compared with molecular signature and methylation status of MGMT promoter and other 3D microtumor-specific methylome. Importantly, basic correlation with patient response (time to progression [TTP], overall survival [OS] and TCGA data will be established. Stratification will be according to patient demographics and GBM subtypes, as previously stated. Ultimately, TMZ therapy is not curative and progression ensues due to resistant cell populations. Thus, post-treatment analysis will consist of evaluation of the genomic, epigenetic and phenotypic changes of TMZ resistant populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">The established parameters of the 4 week perfusion 3D GBM microtumor with GSC alone will then be incorporated with endothelial cells (EC). The addition of EC will drive expansion of the GSC population, drive GSC differentiation towards tumor heterogeneity, demonstrate tubulogenesis towards hypoxic regions of GSC 3D aggregates and demonstrate effectiveness of anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab, axitinib, etc.). In recapitulating the perivascular niche for GSCs, it will be possible to test agents in combination with TMZ and anti-angiogenic agents to overcome treatment-related resistance seen in the clinic. Furthermore, patient-specific endothelial cells will further contribute to mimic the tumor heterogeneity seen in patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">In additional experiments, GBM-specific endothelial cells will be isolated, which will then be incorporated into the GBM microtumor for testing. Expression level changes can then be correlated with degree of microvascularity obtained in vitro as well as to anti-angiogenic treatment response that will be patient specific. GBM specific Ecs to be used in development and testing of 3D GBM Microtumors will be isolated, minimally characterized, and processed.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Optimized media and conditions (growth factors, pH, hypoxia) will be assessed using simple viability and cord formation on a small percentage of early passage (2-3) and late passage EC (7-8) of the first 2-3 patient samples to determine similar growth and function between early and late passage. Conditionally immortalized HBECs will be used as comparison throughout optimization experiments. Based on the optimal numbers of HBECs, GECs seeding density will be determined for future experiments. Once these parameters are set, scaffolds with HBECs will be perfused in the disclosed bioreactors at the optimized perfusion rate determined above, and similar non-destructive analysis as performed above will be performed over 2 week cultures to determine HBEC compatibility with 3D perfusion. Viability and cytotoxicity analysis will be performed non-destructively and terminal analysis will be performed with confocal microscopy to evaluate tubular morphology and branching. IL-8 secretion will be measured and correlated with static 2D and 3D conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Ratios of direct co-culture seeding of GSCs and GECs will be assessed in 2 week perfusion experiments. Using non-lytic multi-photon microscopy, two parameters at four time points over the two weeks will be monitored: redox ratio of GSCs in close proximity to Ecs and branching morphology of Ecs. In order to do this, Ecs will be pre-labeled with dyes which will mimic in vivo experiments using dextran to label vascular structures. Lathia et al. It is predicted that the redox ratio of GSCs will be increased (slower proliferation) the closer to branching structures, correlating with slower proliferating fraction and consistent with a more undifferentiated phenotype. Confirmation of redox ratio as a proliferation index will be confirmed by BrdU incorporation assay as described above. Once the optimal co-culture ratio is determined, the benefit of patient-matched GSC and GECs will be demonstrated by comparing unmatched tumor cell lines and unmatched Ecs and demonstrated relative decrease in viability of GSCs and relative decreased tube formation and branching structures in unmatched co-cultures.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">The perfused co-culture will be extended for 4 weeks to assess the capacity of GSCs to undergo multi-lineage differentiation, using the same analytical parameters above for comparison (3D GSC microtumor). It is expected that matched GECs will enhance growth of GSCs over the 4 week platform while promoting intra-microtumor multi-lineage heterogeneity as assessed by similar analytical parameters used above. The GSCs will promote enhanced differentiation of GECs towards tubule generation and branching phenotypic. It is expected that the total microtissue will contain a significantly more heterogeneous population, as determined by IHC and flow, than when GSCs are cultured alone in 3D perfusion or than cell lines in 3D co-culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">Anti-angiogenic agents (bevacizumab, sunitinib, axitinib) will then be tested in the perfused system and monitor the effects of the agents solely by in situ, non-destructive methods using multi-photon microscopy (redox ratio of tumor cells, morphology of structures of Ecs), metabolism, cytotoxicity and confirm a relative decrease in more differentiated, faster proliferating cell population than the GSC population (CD133+) using lytic methods. Effects of anti-angiogenic agents will be compared with cell lines and primary GSC and GECs in 2D.</p>
