      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having protease activity and isolated nucleic acid sequences encoding the proteases. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells, including plant and animal cells, comprising the nucleic acid sequences, as well as methods for producing and using the proteases, in particular the use of the proteases in animal feed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the use of proteases in animal feed (in vivo), and/or the use of such proteases for treating vegetable proteins (in vitro) it is noted that proteins are essential nutritional factors for animals and humans. Humans and livestock usually get the necessary proteins from vegetable protein sources. Important vegetable protein sources are e.g. oilseed crops, legumes and cereals.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">When e.g. soybean meal is included in the feed of mono-gastric animals such as pigs and poultry, a significant proportion of the soybean meal is not digested efficiently (the apparent ileal protein digestibility in piglets, growing pigs and poultry such as broilers, laying hens and roosters is only around 80%).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The gastrointestinal tract of animals consists of a series of segments each representing different pH environments. In mono-gastric animals such as pigs and poultry and many types of fish, the stomach is strongly acidic with a pH potentially as low as 1-2, while the intestine has a more neutral pH of around 6-7.5. Apart from the stomach and intestine, poultry also have a crop preceding the stomach. The pH in the crop is mostly determined by the feed ingested and hence typically lies in the range of pH 4-6. Protein digestion by a protease may occur along the entire digestive tract, provided that the protease is active and survives the conditions in the digestive tract. Hence, proteases which are highly acid stable and so can survive in the gastric environment and at the same time are efficiently active at the broad range of physiological pH of the digestive tract in the target animal are especially desirable. The novel S53 proteases of the invention are useful for these purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Since animal feed is often formulated in pelleted form, in which steam is applied in the pelleting process, it is also desirable that proteases used in animal feed are capable of remaining active after exposure to said steam treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In order to produce a protease for industrial use, it is important that the protease is produced in high yields making the product available in sufficient quantities in order to be able to provide the protease at a favourable price.</p>

      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0090">Allelic variant: The term âallelic variantâ means any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene.</p>

The residues of the catalytic triad are Glu, Asp, Ser, and there is an additional acidic residue, Asp, in the oxyanion hole. The order of the residues is Glu, Asp, Asp, Ser. The Ser residue is the nucleophile equivalent to Ser in the Asp, His, Ser triad of subtilisin, and the Glu of the triad is a substitute for the general base, His, in subtilisin.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0134">Mutation of any of the amino acids of the catalytic triad or oxyanion hole will result in a change or loss of enzyme activity. The amino acids of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(SEQ ID NO: 5) are probably positions Glu-85, Asp-89, Asp-175 and Ser-283. The amino acids of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of the S53 protease 1 from <i>Trametes versicolor </i>(SEQ ID NO: 19) are probably positions Glu-85, Asp-89, Asp-175 and Ser-283. The amino acids of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole of the S53 protease 2 from <i>Trametes versicolor </i>(SEQ ID NO: 24) are probably positions Glu-85, Asp-89, Asp-175 and Ser-283.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0135">The peptidases of the S53 family tend to be most active at acidic pH (unlike the homologous subtilisins), and this can be attributed to the functional importance of carboxylic residues, notably Asp in the oxyanion hole. The amino acid sequences are not closely similar to those in family S8 (i.e. serine endopeptidase subtilisins and homologues), and this, taken together with the quite different active site residues and the resulting lower pH for maximal activity, provides for a substantial difference to that family. Protein folding of the peptidase unit for members of this family resembles that of subtilisin, having the clan type SB.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0136">A new S53 protease from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>with high activity at low pH (3-4) on soybean-maize meal was identified and cloned in relation to the present invention. For determining whether a given protease is a Serine protease, and a family S53 protease, reference is made to the above Handbook and the principles indicated therein. Such determination can be carried out for all types of proteases, be it naturally occurring or wild-type proteases; or genetically engineered or synthetic proteases.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0137">The present invention provides polypeptides having protease activity and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. The proteases of the invention are serine proteases of the peptidase family S53. The proteases of the invention exhibit pH properties, especially pH stability properties, which make them of substantial interest as candidates for use in animal feed, and other applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0138">The proteases of the invention are acidic proteases with a preference for hydrophibic amino acid residues such as Leu, Tyr, Phe and Met in the P1 position.

Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 14, e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length. Preferably, the nucleic acid probe is at least 100 nucleotides in length, e.g., at least 200 nucleotides, at least 300 nucleotides, at least 400 nucleotides, at least 500 nucleotides, at least 600 nucleotides, at least 700 nucleotides, at least 800 nucleotides, or at least 900 nucleotides in length. Both DNA and RNA probes can be used. The probes are typically labeled for detecting the corresponding gene (for example, with <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>35</sup>S, biotin, or avidin). Such probes are encompassed by the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0307">Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New York. The most commonly occurring exchanges that are expected not to alter the specific activity substantially are Ala/Ser, Val/Ile, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0308">Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0309">Essential amino acids in a parent polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989<i>, Science </i>244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for protease activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996<i>, J. Biol. Chem. </i>271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992<i>, Science </i>255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992<i>, FEBS Lett. </i>309: 59-64. The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of identities with polypeptides that are related to the parent polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0310">Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988<i>, Science </i>241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991<i>, Biochemistry </i>30: 10832-10837; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986<i>, Gene </i>46: 145; Ner et al., 1988<i>, DNA </i>7: 127).</p>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0311">Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999<i>, Nature Biotechnology </i>17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art.

In one aspect, the polypeptide obtained from a given source is secreted extracellularly.</p>
      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0384">The polypeptide may be a fungal polypeptide. For example, the polypeptide may be a polypeptide having protease activity from within a phylum such as Basidiomycota.

      <p id="p-00394-en" num="0418">The control sequence may also be a signal peptide coding region that encodes a signal peptide linked to the N-terminus of a polypeptide and directs the polypeptide into the cell's secretory pathway. The 5â²-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5â²-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. The foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, the foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide. However, any signal peptide coding sequence that directs the expressed polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell of choice may be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0422">The control sequence may also be a propeptide coding sequence that encodes a propeptide positioned at the N-terminus of a polypeptide. The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>laccase (WO 95/33836), <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor.</p>

      <p id="p-00400-en" num="0424">It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that allow the regulation of the expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause the expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase promoter, <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>glucoamylase promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">Expression Vectors</heading>
      <p id="p-00401-en" num="0425">The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleotide and control sequences may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more (several) convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the sequence into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0426">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid.</p>
      <p id="p-00403-en" num="0427">The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0428">The vector preferably contains one or more (several) selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0429">Examples of bacterial selectable markers are <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>or <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>dal genes, or markers that confer antibiotic resistance such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin, or tetracycline resistance. Suitable markers for yeast host cells include, but are not limited to, ADE2, HIS3, LEU2, LYS2, MET3, TRP1, and URA3. Selectable markers for use in a filamentous fungal host cell include, but are not limited to, amdS (acetamidase), argB (ornithine carbamoyltransferase), bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase), hph (hygromycin phosphotransferase), niaD (nitrate reductase), pyrG (orotidine-5â²-phosphate decarboxylase), sC (sulfate adenyltransferase), and trpC (anthranilate synthase), as well as equivalents thereof. Preferred for use in an <i>Aspergillus </i>cell are <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>or <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>amdS and pyrG genes and a <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus </i>bar gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0430">The vector preferably contains an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0431">For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0432">For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question. The origin of replication may be any plasmid replicator mediating autonomous replication that functions in a cell. The term âorigin of replicationâ or âplasmid replicatorâ means a polynucleotide that enables a plasmid or vector to replicate in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0433">Examples of bacterial origins of replication are the origins of replication of plasmids pBR322, pUC19, pACYC177, and pACYC184 permitting replication in <i>E. coli</i>, and pUB110, pE194, pTA1060, and pAMÎ²1 permitting replication in <i>Bacillus. </i></p>

      <p id="p-00412-en" num="0436">More than one copy of a polynucleotide of the present invention may be inserted into a host cell to increase production of a polypeptide. An increase in the copy number of the polynucleotide can be obtained by integrating at least one additional copy of the sequence into the host cell genome or by including an amplifiable selectable marker gene with the polynucleotide where cells containing amplified copies of the selectable marker gene, and thereby additional copies of the polynucleotide, can be selected for by cultivating the cells in the presence of the appropriate selectable agent.</p>

      <p id="p-00441-en" num="0465">Also included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts, and plant cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00442-en" num="0466">The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing a polypeptide may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more (several) expression constructs encoding a polypeptide into the plant host genome or chloroplast genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00443-en" num="0467">The expression construct is conveniently a nucleic acid construct that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide operably linked with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the polynucleotide in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying host cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).</p>
      <p id="p-00444-en" num="0468">The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences, is determined, for example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague et al., 1988<i>, Plant Physiology </i>86: 506. For constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1, and the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et al., 1980<i>, Cell </i>21: 285-294; Christensen et al., 1992<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>18: 675-689; Zhang et al., 1991<i>, Plant Cell </i>3: 1155-1165). Organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards and Coruzzi, 1990<i>, Ann. Rev. Genet. </i>24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998<i>, Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 885-889), a <i>Vicia faba </i>promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from <i>Vicia faba </i>(Conrad et al., 1998<i>, J. Plant Physiol. </i>152: 708-711), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., 1998<i>, Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 935-941), the storage protein napA promoter from <i>Brassica napus</i>, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993<i>, Plant Physiol. </i>102: 991-1000), the chlorella virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Higgins, 1994<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>26: 85-93), the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., 1995<i>, Mol. Gen. Genet. </i>248: 668-674), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>22: 573-588). Likewise, the promoter may be inducible by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought, or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter, e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellic acid, and heavy metals.</p>
      <p id="p-00445-en" num="0469">A promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of a polypeptide in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron that is placed between the promoter and the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. For instance, Xu et al., 1993, supra, disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00446-en" num="0470">The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00447-en" num="0471">The nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation, virus-mediated transformation, microinjection, particle bombardment, biolistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al., 1990<i>, Science </i>244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990<i>, Bio/Technology </i>8: 535; Shimamoto et al., 1989<i>, Nature </i>338: 274).</p>
      <p id="p-00448-en" num="0472">Presently, <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated gene transfer is the method of choice for generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schilperoort, 1992<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>19: 15-38) and can also be used for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods are often used for these plants. Presently, the method of choice for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992<i>, Plant J. </i>2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994<i>, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. </i>5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992<i>, Bio/Technology </i>10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh et al., 1993<i>, Plant Mol. Biol. </i>21: 415-428. Additional transformation methods for use in accordance with the present disclosure include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,395,966 and 7,151,204 (both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p>
      <p id="p-00449-en" num="0473">Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using, for example, co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase.</p>
      <p id="p-00450-en" num="0474">In addition to direct transformation of a particular plant genotype with a construct prepared according to the present invention, transgenic plants may be made by crossing a plant having the construct to a second plant lacking the construct. For example, a construct encoding a polypeptide can be introduced into a particular plant variety by crossing, without the need for ever directly transforming a plant of that given variety. Therefore, the present invention encompasses not only a plant directly regenerated from cells which have been transformed in accordance with the present invention, but also the progeny of such plants. As used herein, progeny may refer to the offspring of any generation of a parent plant prepared in accordance with the present invention. Such progeny may include a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention, or a portion of a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention. Crossing results in the introduction of a transgene into a plant line by cross pollinating a starting line with a donor plant line. Non-limiting examples of such steps are further articulated in U.S. Pat. No. 7,151,204.</p>
      <p id="p-00451-en" num="0475">Plants may be generated through a process of backcross conversion. For example, plants include plants referred to as a backcross converted genotype, line, inbred, or hybrid.</p>
      <p id="p-00452-en" num="0476">Genetic markers may be used to assist in the introgression of one or more transgenes of the invention from one genetic background into another. Marker assisted selection offers advantages relative to conventional breeding in that it can be used to avoid errors caused by phenotypic variations. Further, genetic markers may provide data regarding the relative degree of elite germplasm in the individual progeny of a particular cross. For example, when a plant with a desired trait which otherwise has a non-agronomically desirable genetic background is crossed to an elite parent, genetic markers may be used to select progeny which not only possess the trait of interest, but also have a relatively large proportion of the desired germplasm. In this way, the number of generations required to introgress one or more traits into a particular genetic background is minimized.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="2">Use in Animal Feed</heading>
      <p id="p-00523-en" num="0554">The present invention is also directed to methods for using the proteases having protease activity in animal feed, as well as to feed compositions and feed additives comprising the proteases of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00524-en" num="0555">The term animal includes all animals. Examples of animals are non-ruminants, and ruminants. Ruminant animals include, for example, animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle, e.g. beef cattle, cows, and young calves. In a particular embodiment, the animal is a non-ruminant animal. Non-ruminant animals include mono-gastric animals, e.g. pigs or swine (including, but not limited to, piglets, growing pigs, and sows); poultry such as turkeys, ducks and chicken (including but not limited to broiler chicks, layers); horses (including but not limited to hotbloods, coldbloods and warm bloods), young calves; and fish (including but not limited to salmon, trout, tilapia, catfish and carps; and crustaceans (including but not limited to shrimps and prawns).</p>
      <p id="p-00525-en" num="0556">The term feed or feed composition means any compound, preparation, mixture, or composition suitable for, or intended for intake by an animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00526-en" num="0557">In the use according to the invention the protease can be fed to the animal before, after, or simultaneously with the diet. The latter is preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00527-en" num="0558">In a particular embodiment, the protease, in the form in which it is added to the feed, or when being included in a feed additive, is well-defined. Well-defined means that the protease preparation is at least 50% pure as determined by Size-exclusion chromatography (see Example 12 of WO 01/58275). In other particular embodiments the protease preparation is at least 60, 70, 80, 85, 88, 90, 92, 94, or at least 95% pure as determined by this method.</p>
      <p id="p-00528-en" num="0559">A well-defined protease preparation is advantageous. For instance, it is much easier to dose correctly to the feed a protease that is essentially free from interfering or contaminating other proteases. The term dose correctly refers in particular to the objective of obtaining consistent and constant results, and the capability of optimising dosage based upon the desired effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00529-en" num="0560">For the use in animal feed, however, the protease need not be that pure; it may e.g. include other enzymes, in which case it could be termed a protease preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00530-en" num="0561">The protease preparation can be (a) added directly to the feed (or used directly in a protein treatment process), or (b) it can be used in the production of one or more intermediate compositions such as feed additives or premixes that is subsequently added to the feed (or used in a treatment process). The degree of purity described above refers to the purity of the original protease preparation, whether used according to (a) or (b) above.</p>
      <p id="p-00531-en" num="0562">Protease preparations with purities of this order of magnitude are in particular obtainable using recombinant methods of production, whereas they are not so easily obtained and also subject to a much higher batch-to-batch variation when the protease is produced by traditional fermentation methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00532-en" num="0563">Such protease preparation may of course be mixed with other enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00533-en" num="0564">The protein may be an animal protein, such as meat and bone meal, feather meal, and/or fish meal; or it may be a vegetable protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00534-en" num="0565">The term vegetable proteins as used herein refers to any compound, composition, preparation or mixture that includes at least one protein derived from or originating from a vegetable, including modified proteins and protein-derivatives. In particular embodiments, the protein content of the vegetable proteins is at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60% (w/w).</p>
      <p id="p-00535-en" num="0566">Vegetable proteins may be derived from vegetable protein sources, such as legumes and cereals, for example materials from plants of the families Fabaceae (Leguminosae), Cruciferaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Poaceae, such as soy bean meal, lupin meal and rapeseed meal.</p>
      <p id="p-00536-en" num="0567">In a particular embodiment, the vegetable protein source is material from one or more plants of the family Fabaceae, e.g. soybean, lupine, pea, or bean.</p>
      <p id="p-00537-en" num="0568">In another particular embodiment, the vegetable protein source is material from one or more plants of the family Chenopodiaceae, e.g. beet, sugar beet, spinach or <i>quinoa. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00538-en" num="0569">Other examples of vegetable protein sources are rapeseed, sunflower seed, cotton seed, and cabbage.</p>
      <p id="p-00539-en" num="0570">Soybean is a preferred vegetable protein source.</p>
      <p id="p-00540-en" num="0571">Other examples of vegetable protein sources are cereals such as barley, wheat, rye, oat, maize (corn), rice, triticale, and sorghum.</p>
      <p id="p-00541-en" num="0572">In a particular embodiment of a treatment process the protease(s) in question is affecting (or acting on, or exerting its hydrolyzing or degrading influence on) the proteins, such as vegetable proteins or protein sources. To achieve this, the protein or protein source is typically suspended in a solvent, eg an aqueous solvent such as water, and the pH and temperature values are adjusted paying due regard to the characteristics of the enzyme in question. For example, the treatment may take place at a pH-value at which the activity of the actual protease is at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or at least 90%. Likewise, for example, the treatment may take place at a temperature at which the activity of the actual protease is at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or at least 90%. The above percentage activity indications are relative to the maximum activities. The enzymatic reaction is continued until the desired result is achieved, following which it may or may not be stopped by inactivating the enzyme, e.g. by a heat-treatment step.</p>
      <p id="p-00542-en" num="0573">In another particular embodiment of a treatment process of the invention, the protease action is sustained, meaning e.g. that the protease is added to the proteins, but its hydrolysing influence is so to speak not switched on until later when desired, once suitable hydrolysing conditions are established, or once any enzyme inhibitors are inactivated, or whatever other means could have been applied to postpone the action of the enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00543-en" num="0574">In one embodiment the treatment is a pre-treatment of animal feed or proteins for use in animal feed, i.e. the proteins are hydrolysed before intake.</p>
      <p id="p-00544-en" num="0575">The term improving the nutritional value of an animal feed means improving the availability of nutrients in the feed. In this invention improving the nutritional values refers in particular to improving the availability of the protein fraction of the feed, thereby leading to increased protein extraction, higher protein yields, and/or improved protein utilization. When the nutritional value of the feed is increased, the protein and/or amino acid digestibility is increased and the growth rate and/or weight gain and/or feed conversion (i.e. the weight of ingested feed relative to weight gain) of the animal might be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00545-en" num="0576">The protease can be added to the feed in any form, be it as a relatively pure protease or in admixture with other components intended for addition to animal feed, i.e. in the form of animal feed additives, such as the so-called pre-mixes for animal feed.</p>
      <p id="p-00546-en" num="0577">In a further aspect the present invention relates to compositions for use in animal feed, such as animal feed, and animal feed additives, e.g. premixes.</p>
      <p id="p-00547-en" num="0578">Apart from the protease of the invention, the animal feed additives of the invention contain at least one fat-soluble vitamin, and/or at least one water soluble vitamin, and/or at least one trace mineral, and/or at least one macro mineral.</p>
      <p id="p-00548-en" num="0579">Further, optional, feed-additive ingredients are colouring agents, e.g. carotenoids such as beta-carotene, astaxanthin, and lutein; stabilisers; growth improving additives and aroma compounds/flavorings, e.g. creosol, anethol, deca-, undeca- and/or dodeca-lactones, ionones, irone, gingerol, piperidine, propylidene phatalide, butylidene phatalide, capsaicin and/or tannin; antimicrobial peptides; polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs); reactive oxygen generating species; also, a support may be used that may contain, for example, 40-50% by weight of wood fibres, 8-10% by weight of stearine, 4-5% by weight of <i>curcuma </i>powder, 4-58% by weight of rosemary powder, 22-28% by weight of limestone, 1-3% by weight of a gum, such as gum arabic, 5-50% by weight of sugar and/or starch and 5-15% by weight of water.</p>

      <p id="p-00570-en" num="0600">The present invention also relates to animal feed compositions. Animal feed compositions or diets have a relatively high content of protein. Poultry and pig diets can be characterised as indicated in Table B of WO 01/58275, columns 2-3. Fish diets can be characterised as indicated in column 4 of this Table B. Furthermore such fish diets usually have a crude fat content of 200-310 g/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00571-en" num="0601">WO 01/58275 corresponds to U.S. Ser. No. 09/779,334 which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00572-en" num="0602">An animal feed composition according to the invention has a crude protein content of 50-800 g/kg, and furthermore comprises at least one protease as claimed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00573-en" num="0603">Furthermore, or in the alternative (to the crude protein content indicated above), the animal feed composition of the invention has a content of metabolisable energy of 10-30 MJ/kg; and/or a content of calcium of 0.1-200 g/kg; and/or a content of available phosphorus of 0.1-200 g/kg; and/or a content of methionine of 0.1-100 g/kg; and/or a content of methionine plus cysteine of 0.1-150 g/kg; and/or a content of lysine of 0.5-50 g/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00574-en" num="0604">In particular embodiments, the content of metabolisable energy, crude protein, calcium, phosphorus, methionine, methionine plus cysteine, and/or lysine is within any one of ranges 2, 3, 4 or 5 in Table B of WO 01/58275 (R. 2-5).</p>
      <p id="p-00575-en" num="0605">Crude protein is calculated as nitrogen (N) multiplied by a factor 6.25, i.e. Crude protein (g/kg)=N (g/kg)Ã6.25. The nitrogen content is determined by the Kjeldahl method (A.O.A.C., 1984, Official Methods of Analysis 14th ed., Association of Official Analytical Chemists, Washington D.C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00576-en" num="0606">Metabolisable energy can be calculated on the basis of the NRC publication Nutrient requirements in swine, ninth revised edition 1988, subcommittee on swine nutrition, committee on animal nutrition, board of agriculture, national research council.

ISBN 90-72839-13-7.</p>
      <p id="p-00578-en" num="0608">In a particular embodiment, the animal feed composition of the invention contains at least one vegetable protein as defined above.</p>
      <p id="p-00579-en" num="0609">The animal feed composition of the invention may also contain animal protein, such as Meat and Bone Meal, Feather meal, and/or Fish Meal, typically in an amount of 0-25%. The animal feed composition of the invention may also comprise Dried Destillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS), typically in amounts of 0-30%.</p>
      <p id="p-00580-en" num="0610">In still further particular embodiments, the animal feed composition of the invention contains 0-80% maize; and/or 0-80% sorghum; and/or 0-70% wheat; and/or 0-70% Barley; and/or 0-30% oats; and/or 0-40% soybean meal; and/or 0-25% fish meal; and/or 0-25% meat and bone meal; and/or 0-20% whey.</p>
      <p id="p-00581-en" num="0611">Animal diets can e.g. be manufactured as mash feed (non pelleted) or pelleted feed. Typically, the milled feed-stuffs are mixed and sufficient amounts of essential vitamins and minerals are added according to the specifications for the species in question. Enzymes can be added as solid or liquid enzyme formulations. For example, for mash feed a solid or liquid enzyme formulation may be added before or during the ingredient mixing step. For pelleted feed the (liquid or solid) protease/enzyme preparation may also be added before or during the feed ingredient step. Typically a liquid protease/enzyme preparation is added after the pelleting step. The enzyme may also be incorporated in a feed additive or premix.</p>
      <p id="p-00582-en" num="0612">The final enzyme concentration in the diet is within the range of 0.01-200 mg enzyme protein per kg diet, for example in the range of 0.5-25 mg enzyme protein per kg animal diet.</p>
      <p id="p-00583-en" num="0613">The protease should of course be applied in an effective amount, i.e. in an amount adequate for improving hydrolysis, digestibility, and/or improving nutritional value of feed. It is at present contemplated that the enzyme is administered in one or more of the following amounts (dosage ranges): 0.01-200; 0.01-100; 0.5-100; 1-50; 5-100; 10-100; 0.05-50; or 0.10-10âall these ranges being in mg protease protein per kg feed (ppm).</p>
      <p id="p-00584-en" num="0614">For determining mg protease protein per kg feed, the protease is purified from the feed composition, and the specific activity of the purified protease is determined using a relevant assay (see under protease activity, substrates, and assays). The protease activity of the feed composition as such is also determined using the same assay, and on the basis of these two determinations, the dosage in mg protease protein per kg feed is calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00585-en" num="0615">The same principles apply for determining mg protease protein in feed additives. Of course, if a sample is available of the protease used for preparing the feed additive or the feed, the specific activity is determined from this sample (no need to purify the protease from the feed composition or the additive).</p>

      <p id="p-00586-en" num="0616">The present invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, expression vectors and recombinant host cells comprising such polynucleotides encoding the proteases of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00587-en" num="0617">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a protease, comprising: (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell comprising such polynucleotide; and (b) recovering the protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00588-en" num="0618">The protein may be native or heterologous to a host cell. The term âproteinâ is not meant herein to refer to a specific length of the encoded product and, therefore, encompasses peptides, oligopeptides, and proteins. The term âproteinâ also encompasses two or more polypeptides combined to form the encoded product. The proteins also include hybrid polypeptides and fused polypeptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00589-en" num="0619">Preferably, the protein is a protease. For example, the protein may be a hydrolase, such as a proteolytic enzyme or protease.</p>

The S53 Protease 3 gene in the resulting <i>Aspergillus </i>expression construct, pMStr121, was sequenced, and the protease coding portion of the sequence was confirmed to agree with the original coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.

To identify transformants producing the recombinant protease, the transformants and BECh2 were cultured in 10 ml of YP+2% glucose medium at 30Â° C. and 200 RPM. Samples were taken after 3 days growth and resolved with SDS-PAGE to identify recombinant protease production. A novel band between 35 and 50 kDa was observed in cultures of transformants that was not observed in cultures of the untransformed BECh2. Several transformants that appeared to express the recombinant protease at high levels were further cultured in 100 ml of YP+2% glucose medium in 500 ml shake flasks at 30Â° C. and 200 RPM. Samples were taken after 2, 3, and 4 days growth and expression levels compared by resolving the samples with SDS-PAGE. A single transformant that expressed the recombinant protease at relatively high levels was selected and designated EXP01737. EXP01737 was isolated twice by dilution streaking conidia on selective medium containing 0.01% TRITONÂ® X-100 to limit colony size and fermented in YP+2% glucose medium in shake flasks as described above to provide material for purification. The shake flask cultures were harvested after 4 days growth and fungal mycelia was removed by filtering the fermentation broth through Miracloth (Calbiochem) then purified as described in example 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00622-en" num="0672">The culture broth was centrifuged (20000Ãg, 20 min) and the supernatant was carefully decanted from the precipitate. The supernatant was filtered through a Nalgene 0.2 Î¼m filtration unit in order to remove the rest of the <i>Aspergillus </i>host cells. The 0.2 Î¼m filtrate was transferred to 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.5 on a G25 Sephadex column (from GE Healthcare). The G25 sephadex transferred enzyme was applied to a Q-sepharose FF column (from GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.5. The run-through and wash with 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.5 was collected and contained the S53 protease (activity confirmed using the Kinetic Suc-AAPF-pNA assay at pH 4). The pH of the run-through and wash fraction was adjusted to pH 3.25 with 1M HCl while mixing the fraction thoroughly. The pH-adjusted solution was applied to a SP-sepharose FF column (from GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.25. After washing the column extensively with the equilibration buffer, the protease was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0--&gt;0.5M) in the same buffer over ten column volumes. Fractions from the column were analysed for protease activity (using the Kinetic Suc-AAPF-pNA assay at pH 4) and peak-fractions were pooled. Solid ammonium sulphate was added to the pool to 2.0M final (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>concentration. The enzyme solution was applied to a Phenyl-Toyopearl column (from TosoHaas) equilibrated in 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, 2.0M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, pH 3.25. After washing the column extensively with the equilibration buffer, the S53 protease was eluted with a linear gradient between the equilibration buffer and 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.25 over ten column volumes. Fractions from the column were analysed for protease activity (using the Kinetic Suc-AAPF-pNA assay at pH 4). Fractions with high activity were pooled and transferred to 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.5 on a G25 sephadex column (from GE Healthcare). The G25 sephadex transferred protease was applied to a SP-sepharose HP column (from GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Succinic acid/NaOH, pH 3.5. After washing the column extensively with the equilibration buffer, the protease was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0--&gt;0.5M) in the same buffer over five column volumes. Fractions constituting the major peak from the column were pooled as the purified product. The purified product was analysed by SDS-PAGE and one major band was seen on the gel and three minor bands. EDMAN N-terminal sequencing of the bands showed that all the bands were related to the S53 protease and therefore we expect that the minor bands represents nicking of some of the S53 protease molecules. The purified product was used for further characterization.</p>

      <p id="p-00638-en" num="0682">Substrate slurry (2 mL) was mixed for 30 min before protease addition and incubated for 3 hours at 40Â° C. (500 rpm).

      <p id="p-00639-en" num="0683">The results are shown in Table 6 below. The proteolytic activity of the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) on soybean-maize meal is at its highest at pH 3 and decreases with increasing pH. At pH 5, the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) is as active on soybean-maize meal as Protease 10R, whereas at pH 3 and pH 4 the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) is much more active than Protease 10R. These results indicate that the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) could be efficient for obtaining protein hydrolysis in the upper gastro-intestinal tract of monogastric animals such as e.g. pigs and poultry leading to improved utilization of feed protein in these species.</p>

      <p id="p-00641-en" num="0684">Crop, gizzard and ileum digesta material from 21 day old broiler chickens fed a corn-soy diet was collected; freeze dried and ground using a small coffee mill. The ground samples were suspended (47% w/v) in the following buffers and left to hydrate at 4Â° C. overnight (no stirring): <ul id="ul-00018-en" list-style="none"><li>Crop buffer: 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2 H<sub>2</sub>O, 150 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, adjusted to pH 5 using HCl</li><li>Gizzard buffer: 100 mM succinic acid, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2 H<sub>2</sub>O, 150 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, adjusted to pH 1.67 using HCl</li><li>Ileum buffer: 100 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 150 mM KCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, adjusted to pH 7.2 using HCl</li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00642-en" num="0688">The resulting pH was: pH 5 in crop samples; pH 3 in gizzard samples; and pH 7 in ileum samples. The suspensions were heated to 40Â° C. and 1 ml was dispensed into tubes kept at 40Â° C. Three tubes representing blank (T<sub>0</sub>) were immediately centrifuged (3000Ãg, 0Â° C., 10 min) and the supernatants frozen. Either enzyme (200 mg enzyme protein/kg substrate) in 50 Î¼L 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (9.565 g/l NaOAc, 1.75 g/l acetic acid, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.01% BSA, 0.01% Tween20, pH 6.0) or just sodium acetate buffer (50 Î¼L) for the blank samples was added to the tubes and crop and ileum samples were incubated for 3 hours (T<sub>3</sub>) while the gizzard samples were incubated for 1 hour (T<sub>1</sub>) at 40Â° C. while shaking (500 rpm). The samples were centrifuged (3000Ãg, 0Â° C., 10 min) and supernatants recovered and frozen. The proteolytic activity was determined by analyzing primary amines using the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00643-en" num="0689">The results are shown in Table 7. For each of the digesta types (crop, gizzard and ileum) there was a significant difference between the level of primary amines in the blank T<sub>0 </sub>sample and the blank samples incubated for 1 or 3 hours. This difference can be ascribed to activity of proteases present in the substrate and originating from either the diet raw materials or the animal. During incubation of the crop and gizzard digesta the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) further increased the level of primary amines compared to the blank sample, demonstrating that the protease had a proteolytic activity on this substrate under the given conditions. The S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) performed significantly better during crop and gizzard incubation than Protease 10R, indicating that the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) could be more efficient for feed protein hydrolysis in the upper gastro-intestinal tract of poultry leading to improved protein digestibility. As expected the S53 protease 3 from <i>Meripilus giganteus </i>(from example 2) did not significantly increase the level of free amines during ileum incubation at pH 7.</p>

Incubation is performed for 30 seconds while the temperature remains approximately constant at 90Â° C. Thereafter the plate is quickly removed from the box, the samples placed on ice, re-suspended and evaluated with respect to protease activity using e.g. the Suc-AAPF-pNA or o-Phthaldialdehyde (OPA) assay. Each enzyme sample is compared to a similar sample that had not been steam treated in order to calculate residual activity.</p>

Those two CDS sequences were synthesised by GeneArtÂ® (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) in a pMA-T vector at a 5 Î¼g scale with two flanking sites BamHI in 5â² and HindIII in 3â² compatible with the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735). 1 Î¼g of those plasmids was subsequently digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII from NEB (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main Germany) following manufacturer's recommendations, and the resulting fragments were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer. The 1.7 kb fragment corresponding to the synthetic protease genes were excised from the gel and purified using a GFXÂ® PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, HiHerod, Denmark) following the manufacturer's instructions. 100 ng of those inserts were cloned in the expression vector pDAu109 (WO 2005042735) previously digested with BamHI and HindIII by ligation with a T4 ligase from NEB (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt am Main Germany) following manufacturer's instructions.</p>
