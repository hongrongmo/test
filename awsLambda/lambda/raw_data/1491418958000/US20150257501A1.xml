      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Tablet display devices have become popular consumer products for use in a variety of applications. Many such devices are flat, thin computers with a display panel on most of the area of one surface. Although the majority of these incorporate the computational, communication and display circuitry of a general purpose computer, some are more specialized for limited functionality, such as readers for electronic books or special map or industrial data displays. Typical dimensions are 8 in×10 in×½ in (similar to a tablet of paper) and 8 in×6 in×⅓ in (for so-called “mini” tablets), with weights ranging from about 2 pounds to just over ½ pound.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Wireless telephone communication devices with computer circuitry, known as “smartphones” have similar relative dimensions, but on a smaller scale. A growing trend has been to offer smaller tablets on the one hand and larger smartphones on the other, so that the sizes of the respective devices may converge. As used herein, the term “tablet computer” shall refer to any thin handheld device with a display panel on one surface and circuitry to generate a display on that surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Many uses involve operating the tablet computer while standing. While a tablet is light enough to hold in the hand, using it for any length of time may be tiring. A touch screen is operated with the fingers of the dominant hand, while the tablet is grasped with the other hand by its edge. The weight of the unit is applied to a moment arm that makes the user's grip difficult to maintain for an extended period of time. The tablet computer usually has a flat back that can be supported on the open palm of the off hand, but balancing the device is difficult while the touch screen is being activated.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention addresses a need for a convenient way to hold a tablet computer in one hand while activating it with the other.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention provides a compact and convenient way to hold a tablet computer in one hand while activating and using the device with the other hand. The device, as seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, is a small grip and stand that is to be attached at the approximate center of the tablet on the back, or underneath, side. In one embodiment, it is removably attachable to the tablet, and can serve as a handle or a small stand that elevates the tablet at a slight angle. A stem connects a base portion attached to the tablet and a top portion. A central hole of appropriate size in the stem accommodates a finger inserted through the grip. Opposing walls of the stem are biconcave in the plane perpendicular to the plane of the hole in the stem, defining a shape convenient for gripping between two fingers.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">One embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>. The holder <b>1</b> comprises a base <b>10</b>, a top <b>2</b>, and a pair of vertical support elements, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, connecting the base <b>10</b> with the top <b>2</b>. The top <b>2</b> has a lower surface <b>5</b> and an upper surface <b>6</b>. The base has a lower surface <b>7</b> and an upper surface <b>8</b>. The vertical support elements have facing inner surfaces <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> and outwardly facing surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Each also has outwardly facing surfaces <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> in a plane orthogonal to the plane of inner surfaces <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>. See <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In this embodiment, the interior surfaces of the top, bottom, and sides define a generally-circular aperture space <b>9</b> sized to accept the insertion of a finger. The user can insert his finger with his palm toward the tablet, as in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, or away from the tablet. A diameter of about <b>0</b>.<b>9</b> in is a good compromise for the size of aperture <b>9</b>, but other dimensions may be desirable in particular applications. For example, it may be advisable to create three or more standard apertures to accommodate the different hand sizes of men, women and children.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As may be seen in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the vertical support elements <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> are curved inward in three directions, appearing as a triconcave pillar connecting the base and the top. The vertical support elements <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are concave in the plane of the finger aperture <b>9</b>, each combining with the inner surface <b>5</b> of the top <b>2</b> and inner surface <b>8</b> of base <b>10</b> to define an approximate circle. In the plane perpendicular to the plane of the finger aperture, the vertical support elements are biconcave, defining back to back approximate half circles <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> perpendicular to the finger aperture <b>9</b> with approximate diameters slightly larger than that of the finger aperture. The user may grasp the holder between two fingers, partially encased by the half circles, to comfortably support the tablet with one hand. See <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. In an embodiment, the outwardly facing surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in the plane of the finger aperture <b>9</b> are relatively straight. These surfaces may take any shape consistent with the need for structural support of the top <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The holder device is attachable to the back of a tablet computer, and preferably is removably attachable. In one embodiment, attachment is accomplished using a pair of magnetic discs. See <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. A holder magnet <b>25</b> is affixed in a cavity <b>21</b> in the base <b>10</b> of the holder device. The cavity <b>21</b> is just deep enough to envelop both the holder magnet <b>25</b> and a tablet magnet <b>26</b> affixed to the back of the tablet. In an embodiment, the base <b>10</b> is circular and the holder magnet <b>25</b> and the tablet magnet <b>26</b> are circular discs, a configuration that permits easy orientation of the finger aperture <b>9</b> when the holder is attached to the tablet.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In an embodiment, the holder magnet <b>25</b> and tablet magnet <b>26</b> are plated magnetic discs, each about 0.125″ thick, with attracting poles directed toward each other, providing a strong bond that can be broken with the deliberate application of moderate force. In another embodiment, the holder magnet <b>25</b> is a strong magnetic disc and the tablet attachment component <b>26</b> is a <b>16</b> gauge polished steel disc or a magnetic metal of suitable thickness. Known pressure sensitive adhesive tapes or materials may be used to affix the tablet attachment disc to the back of the tablet computer without damaging the tablet.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Attachment of the holder to the computer tablet may alternatively be accomplished in many other ways. <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, for example, show a back cover <b>35</b> with an aperture <b>36</b> through which the holder <b>1</b> is removably inserted. In this embodiment, when the holder <b>1</b> is not in place, the cover <b>35</b> could conveniently remain on the tablet without distorting the tablet's thin profile. It may be noted that in the illustration, the top of the holder comprises an alternative configuration to the curved top shown in other embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A different embodiment of the invention is shown in <figref>FIGS. 12-17</figref>. In this embodiment, an attachment unit comprising a base with a plurality of vertical tines fits into a cavity in the base of the holder. As seen in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, holder <b>1</b> has a cavity <b>21</b> in base <b>10</b>. Instead of a magnet, a retainer ring <b>41</b> is inserted into the top portion of cavity <b>21</b> and affixed. The retainer ring <b>41</b> has an angled retainer ledge <b>42</b> around its inside surface, with a slight downward angle. Although one embodiment includes an inserted ring <b>41</b>, which is convenient for placement in units configured to accommodate a holder magnet <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, it also may be desirable to fabricate a holder having an angled retainer ledge integral with the unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, attachment unit <b>50</b> comprises a base <b>43</b> and a plurality of vertical tines <b>44</b>. Each tine <b>44</b> has an engagement lip <b>45</b> at its free end. Engagement lip <b>45</b> has a slight upward angle to match the angle of angled retainer ledge <b>42</b> on retainer ring <b>41</b> in base <b>10</b> of the holder. This locks the attachment unit <b>50</b> and the holder <b>1</b> together, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>. The tines <b>44</b> may be made of plastic or another material that affords slight flexure when force is applied at the tip so that they slide past the angled retainer ledge <b>42</b> when pressed into the cavity <b>21</b> of the holder and can be pulled away from the retainer ring <b>41</b> with the application of moderate force. Preferably the flexure of the tines <b>44</b> will also allow a user to rotate the orientation of the holder when the engagement lips <b>45</b> and the angled retainer ledge <b>42</b> are engaged.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Attachment unit <b>50</b> may be affixed to the back of the tablet device, using glue or other suitable adhesive, and holder <b>1</b> may then be attached and removed as needed. Alternatively, attachment unit <b>50</b> may be affixed to the tablet in a manner similar to that shown in <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, wherein the base <b>43</b> is held in place by a tablet cover that has an aperture <b>36</b> larger than the diameter of the tines <b>44</b> but smaller than the diameter of the base <b>43</b>. An attachment unit designed for use with a tablet cover will be dimensioned so that the length of the tines protruding past the tablet cover is long enough to permit engagement with the retainer ring in the holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The holder device may be fabricated or constructed of a variety of materials, with polymers or plastics particularly suitable. In an embodiment, a hard plastic molded endoskeleton <b>31</b> is enveloped by a softer plastic or polymer overmold <b>32</b>. The overmold skin, which in one embodiment is about 0.02 in thick, can be clear, revealing the endoskeleton, or any of a variety of colors. The skin may be seamless and sanitizable, for use in clean environments such as medical operating rooms. In some embodiments, the endoskeleton <b>31</b> may be configured to hold a dime-sized disc <b>33</b> that may incorporate a printed, engraved or embossed design or logo. See <figref>FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
