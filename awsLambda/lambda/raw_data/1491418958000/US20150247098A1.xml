      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for hydroprocessing reformate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Catalytic reforming is one of the major processes for petroleum refining, and is a process in which raw oil such as naphtha is transformed into reformate rich in aromatics at specific temperature and pressure in presence of hydrogen and catalyst, and hydrogen gas is obtained as a byproduct. The reformate obtained through gas liquid separation of the mixture produced in catalytic reforming may be directly used as an additive for vehicle fuels; alternatively may be used for producing chemicals such as benzene, methyl benzene, and dimethyl benzene etc through an aromatics extraction process.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Reformate not only is rich in fractions of aromatics and solvent oil, but also contains a few olefins. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the olefins so as to produce qualified products of aromatics and solvent oil. Furthermore, in recent years, as the developing of wide fraction reforming technique and the increasing of the reaction severity, the olefin content in reformate increased accordingly. Therefore, the necessity of removing olefins from reformate is more obvious.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">At present, the methods for removing olefins from reformate include clay adsorption refining, and post-hydrogenation for distillate or full range of reformate. For clay adsorption refining, there exist the drawbacks that the adsorptive capacity of clay is limited, and the waste clay can not be regenerated. In recent years, the distillate or full range of reformate is subject to selective hydrogenation in presence of Pd or Pt based noble metal catalysts, so as to remove olefins from reformate.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">CN1004421B discloses a hydrorefining method of reformate, in which reformate with a bromine index in a range of 0.5-8 g bromine/100 g and an aromatic content in a range of 35% to 55% by weight is used as the raw material, the reaction is preformed at a temperature in a range of 200Â° C. to 300Â° C. and a partial pressure of hydrogen in a range of 5-20 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>with a liquid-volume space velocity in a range of 6 h<sup>â1 </sup>to 20 h<sup>â1 </sup>and a volume ratio of hydrogen to oil in a range of 200 to 1,000. A thin-shell strip-shaped PdâAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>catalyst with a Pd content in a range of 0.15% to 0.6% by weight (in relation to the support) is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">CN1049001C discloses a hydrorefining method of reformate, in which reformate with a bromine index in a range of 0.5-8.0 g bromine/10.0 g is used as the raw material, and the hydrogenation catalyst is thin-shell Pd/Î³-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>with a Pd content in a range of 0.15% to 6% by weight (in relation to the support). Aromatics with carbon number higher than 9 have been removed from the raw material, and the aromatic content is in a range of 20% to 85% by weight. The reaction temperature is in a range of 150Â° C. to 200Â° C., the partial pressure of hydrogen in the reactor is in a range of 0.5 MPa to 3.0 MPa, the liquid-volume space velocity is in a range of 3 h<sup>â1 </sup>to 15 h<sup>â1</sup>, and the volume ratio of hydrogen to oil is in a range of 100 to 500.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Both of the methods disclosed by CN1004421B and CN1049001C employ a trickle-bed hydrogenation process, a large quantity of circulating hydrogen has to be maintained in the apparatus. As a result, on one hand, a compressor for circulating hydrogen is required; on the other hand, the apparatus is bulky.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The object of the present invention is to provide a method for hydroprocessing reformate, which employs a liquid phase hydrogenation process, and thereby the demand for circulating hydrogen is eliminated, and the dissolved hydrogen innately contained in reformate can be fully utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The inventors of the present invention has found in their practice that there is dissolved hydrogen derived from the catalytic reforming process in the reformate obtained by contacting hydrocarbon oil with a catalyst having a catalytic reforming action under catalytic reforming conditions and treating the resulted mixture by gas liquid separation in a gas liquid separating tank. If the reformate obtained from the bottom of the gas liquid separating tank is directly subject to liquid-phase hydroprocessing, the dissolved hydrogen innately contained in the reformate can be used as the hydrogen source or one of the hydrogen sources for hydroprocessing, as a result, the residual dissolved hydrogen in the reformate can be utilized fully to remove the olefins in the reformate, and the demand for circulating hydrogen can be eliminated. The present invention is implemented on the above basis.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention provides a method for hydroprocessing reformate, comprising contacting reformate with a catalyst having a catalytic hydrogenation action under a liquid-phase hydroprocessing condition in a hydrogenation reactor, at least part of hydrogen gas for hydroprocessing is from dissolved hydrogen contained in the reformate.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to the method for hydroprocessing reformate disclosed by the invention, the reformate separated from the reforming product separating tank is directly subjected to liquid-phase hydroprocessing, so that not only the dissolved hydrogen innately contained in the reformate is fully utilized, but also the olefins in the reformate are removed; at the same time, a demand for circulating hydrogen and circulating equipment thereof is eliminated. Therefore, the method for hydroprocessing reformate according to the present invention simplifies the process route, reduces capital cost and operation cost, and realizes efficient and energy-saving industrial production.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Furthermore, the reformate obtained by the method according to the present invention can achieve a bromine index lower than 50 mgBr<sub>2/100 </sub>g or even lower than 10 mgBr<sub>2/100 </sub>g, and a loss of aromatics less than 0.5% by weight.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present invention provides a method for hydroprocessing reformate, comprising contacting reformate with a catalyst having a catalytic hydrogenation action under a liquid-phase hydroprocessing condition in a hydrogenation reactor, at least part of hydrogen gas for hydroprocessing is from dissolved hydrogen contained in the reformate.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, the reformate is obtained from bottom of gas liquid separating tank by injecting a catalytic reforming mixture into the gas liquid separating tank, the catalytic reforming mixture is obtained by contacting hydrocarbon oil with a catalyst having a reforming catalytic action under a catalytic reforming condition. That is, according to the method of present invention, a mixture obtained by contacting hydrocarbon oil with a catalyst having a catalytic reforming action under a catalytic reforming condition is subject to gas liquid separation in a gas liquid separating tank, and a reformate obtained from bottom of the separating tank is directly subjected to liquid-phase hydroprocessing.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, the reformate contains residual hydrogen derived from the catalytic reforming process, and the reformate is obtained only after the reformed mixture output from the reforming reactor is treated by gas liquid separation; and thus, the hydrogen in the reformate (i.e., the residual hydrogen derived from the catalytic reforming process) exists substantially in form of dissolved hydrogen. In the present invention, the dissolved hydrogen in the reformate refers to the residual hydrogen gas derived from the catalytic reforming process. The content of the dissolved hydrogen in the reformate is slightly different depending on the conditions of gas liquid separation and the composition of the reformate. Generally, based on the total weight of the reformate, the reformate may contain the dissolved hydrogen in a content of 0.001-0.025% by weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, when hydroprocessing the reformate, the hydrogen gas may solely come from the hydrogen innately contained in the reformate; alternatively, the hydrogen gas may come from the hydrogen innately contained in the reformate and hydrogen gas supplemented into the reformate. That is, according to the method disclosed by the present invention, the hydroprocessing may be carried out with or without supplemental hydrogen gas. The supplemental hydrogen gas refers to hydrogen gas injected into the reformate in one time or in several times before the contacting and/or during the contacting.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, whether the supplemental hydrogen gas is required and the amount of the supplemental hydrogen gas may be determined appropriately according to the content of dissolved hydrogen in the reformate and the content of olefins in the reformate. In the case that the dissolved hydrogen in the reformate is enough to remove the olefins in the reformate to a satisfactory level, the residual dissolved hydrogen contained in the reformate, which is derived from the catalytic reforming process, is preferably used solely as the source of hydrogen for hydroprocessing without the supplemental hydrogen gas. In the case that the dissolved hydrogen in the reformate is not enough to remove the olefins in the reformate to a satisfactory level, according to the method disclosed by the present invention, the hydroprocessing is preferably carried out in presence of the supplemental hydrogen gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, in the case that the supplemental hydrogen exists, the supplemental hydrogen may be injected into the reformate in one time, for example, the supplemental hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate before the reformate is fed into the hydrogenation reactor. Alternatively, the supplemental hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate in several times, for example, at least one supplemental hydrogen gas inlet may be arranged on the hydrogenation reactor, a part of the supplemental hydrogen gas is injected into the reformate at the inlet side of the hydrogenation reactor, while the remaining part of the supplemental hydrogen gas is injected into the reformate via the supplemental hydrogen gas inlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">According to the method disclosed by the present invention, in the case that the supplemental hydrogen gas exists, the hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate in a variety of ways.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In a preferred example of the present invention, the method for injecting the supplemental hydrogen gas into the reformate comprises injecting the supplemental hydrogen gas through pores with an average pore diameter in nanometer size into the reformate. By injecting the supplemental hydrogen gas through pores with an average pore diameter in nanometer size into the reformate, the supplemental hydrogen gas can be dispersed highly and dissolved more quickly in the reformate, so as to eliminate the demand for a diluent or circulating oil in the prior liquid-phase hydroprocessing of hydrocarbon oil for the purpose of increasing the amount of hydrogen carried in the raw oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the present invention, the pores are through-holes. The pores may have an average pore diameter in a range of 1 nm to 1,000 nm, preferably in a range of 30 nm to 1,000 nm. For the purpose of further improving the degree of dispersion and the rate of dissolution of the supplemental hydrogen gas in the reformate, the pores more preferably have an average pore diameter in a range of 30 nm to 800 nm, even more preferably in a range of 50 nm to 500 nm. The average pore diameter is measured with a scanning electron microscopy.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate in a static state or in a flowing state. Preferably, the hydrogen gas is injected into the reformate in a flowing state, so that the hydrogen gas can be injected into the reformate during the period of transporting the reformate, and thereby the production efficiency can be further improved. In the case that the hydrogen gas is injected into the reformate in a flowing state, the hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate at a rate of v<sub>1 </sub>by gÂ·h<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2 </sup>(the total amount of the hydrogen gas passing through the pores in per unit area within per unit time), the reformate may have a flow rate of v<sub>2 </sub>by kgÂ·h<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2 </sup>(the mass of reformate passing through per unit area of cross section within per unit time), ratio of v<sub>1</sub>/v<sub>2 </sub>may be in a range of 0.000625 to 0.09, so as to achieve a further improved effect of dispersing and dissolving hydrogen gas. Preferably, the ratio of v<sub>1</sub>/v<sub>2 </sub>is in a range of 0.005 to 0.01, so as to achieve better effect of dispersing and dissolving hydrogen gas, and higher production efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The hydrogen gas may be injected into the reformate at a rate in a range of 0.0001 kgÂ·h<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2 </sup>to 2,000 kgÂ·h<sup>â1</sup>Â·m<sup>â2</sup>.</p>
