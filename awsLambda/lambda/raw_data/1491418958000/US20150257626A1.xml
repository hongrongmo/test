      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/750,038, filed Mar. 30, 2010, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to offset inlet dishwasher pumps and related assemblies and methods.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dishwashers commonly include a tub for holding dishware and a sump located in the bottom of the tub. A pump is connected to the sump and is driven by a motor. Some dishwashers are designed so that the sump, the pump and the motor can be removed as an assembly from an interior side of the tub, without moving the dishwasher from its installed position (e.g. under a countertop or cabinet). As tub size increases, the space beneath the tub typically shrinks. This can make it difficult or impossible to remove the sump, pump and motor as an assembly from the interior side of the tub without moving the dishwasher from its installed position.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a method of installing a sump/pump assembly in a dishwasher is disclosed. The dishwasher includes a tub having a bottom with an opening therethrough. The assembly includes a sump, a pump, and a motor coupled to the sump. The pump includes a fluid inlet. The motor includes a shaft operably coupled to the pump for driving the pump. The method comprises positioning the assembly within an interior portion of the tub, inserting at least the motor and the pump of the assembly through the bottom opening of the tub, and coupling the assembly to the dishwasher with the motor and the pump positioned below the tub bottom and with a center axis of the fluid inlet positioned vertically closer to a bottom surface of the tub bottom than is a center axis of the motor shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p>

      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ and âtheâ may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms âcomprises,â âcomprising,â âincluding,â and âhaving,â are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">When an element or layer is referred to as being âonâ, âengaged toâ, âconnected toâ or âcoupled toâ another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being âdirectly on,â âdirectly engaged toâ, âdirectly connected toâ or âdirectly coupled toâ another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., âbetweenâ versus âdirectly between,â âadjacentâ versus âdirectly adjacent,â etc.). As used herein, the term âand/orâ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms.

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">A dishwasher pump assembly according to one example embodiment of the present disclosure is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and indicated generally by reference number <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the assembly <b>100</b> includes a pump <b>102</b> and a motor <b>104</b>. The pump <b>102</b> includes a housing <b>105</b> and a pumping chamber <b>106</b> within the housing <b>105</b>. The pumping chamber <b>106</b> has a fluid inlet <b>108</b> and a fluid outlet <b>110</b>. The fluid inlet <b>108</b> has a center axis <b>112</b>. The motor <b>104</b> includes a shaft <b>116</b> operably coupled to the pump <b>102</b> for rotating the pump. The motor shaft has a center axis <b>118</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the center axis <b>118</b> of the motor shaft <b>116</b> is offset from the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. Among other advantages, this offset provides a sufficient amount of space between the motor <b>104</b> and a sump (not shown) to facilitate installation or removal of the assembly <b>100</b> in a dishwasher.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the example embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the center axis <b>118</b> of the motor shaft <b>116</b> extends through the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the shaft center axis <b>118</b> may not extend through the fluid inlet <b>108</b>, e.g., if the offset between the axes <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> is greater than one-half the width or radius of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. Additionally, the center axis <b>118</b> of the motor shaft <b>116</b> is substantially parallel to the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the axes <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> may be non-parallel.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The pump <b>102</b> includes an impeller <b>114</b> within the housing <b>105</b> for moving fluid between the fluid inlet <b>108</b> and the fluid outlet <b>110</b>. In the example of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the center axis of the impeller is coextensive with (i.e., not offset from) the center axis <b>118</b> of the motor shaft <b>116</b>. Accordingly, the impeller's center axis (which is also represented by reference number <b>118</b> in the example of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) is offset from the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the impeller's center axis may be offset from the center axes <b>112</b>, <b>118</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b> and the motor shaft <b>116</b>, or coextensive with the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b> but offset from the center axis <b>118</b> of the motor shaft <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Additionally, in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the impeller's center axis is substantially parallel to the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. Alternatively, these two axes can be non-parallel without departing from the teachings of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Further, in the example embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the impeller's center axis extends through the fluid inlet <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the impeller's center axis may not extend through the fluid inlet <b>108</b>, e.g., if the offset between the impeller's center axis and the center axis <b>112</b> of the fluid inlet <b>108</b> is greater than one-half the width or radius of the fluid inlet <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The motor shaft <b>116</b> is operably coupled to the impeller <b>114</b> for rotating the impeller <b>114</b>. The motor shaft <b>116</b> may be coupled to the impeller <b>114</b> directly, or via one or more gears, belts or other components, for driving rotation of the impeller <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The pump <b>102</b> is configured to operate as a dishwasher pump. For example, pump <b>102</b> may contain a food chopper to break down food removed by the dishwasher. The food chopper may be coupled to the motor shaft <b>116</b>. Pump <b>102</b> may also include seals configured to tolerate, for example, dishwasher cleaning solutions, cleaning agents, hot water, sanitizers, etc. Additionally, impeller <b>114</b> is configured to operate as a dishwasher pump impeller. For example, impeller <b>114</b> may be designed with sufficient clearance (e.g., about 5 mm) between its blades to allow food to pass therethrough.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate one example construction of the dishwasher pump assembly <b>100</b> described above with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the assembly <b>200</b> includes a pump <b>202</b> and a motor <b>204</b>. As best shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the pump <b>202</b> includes a housing <b>205</b> having a pumping chamber <b>206</b> that has a fluid inlet <b>208</b> and a fluid outlet <b>210</b>. The fluid inlet <b>208</b> has a center axis <b>212</b>. The pump <b>202</b> also includes an impeller <b>214</b>. The motor <b>204</b> includes a shaft <b>216</b> having a center axis <b>218</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The impeller <b>214</b> is located within the pumping chamber <b>206</b> and is driven by the motor shaft <b>216</b>. Further, the center axis of the impeller <b>214</b> is coextensive with the shaft center axis <b>218</b>. The fluid inlet center axis <b>212</b> is offset from the shaft center axis <b>218</b>, and the shaft center axis <b>218</b> extends through the fluid inlet <b>208</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The dishwasher pump assembly <b>200</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> also includes a bracket <b>220</b> for attaching the assembly <b>200</b> to a sump. As further explained below, the bracket <b>220</b> can be dimensioned to provide a sufficient gap between the motor <b>204</b> and a sump (after the motor is coupled to the sump) to facilitate installation and/or removal of the pump <b>202</b>, the motor <b>204</b>, and the sump as a single assembly in a dishwasher without requiring the dishwasher to be moved from its installed location.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the particular example shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the bracket <b>220</b> is molded into the housing of the motor <b>204</b>. Alternatively, the bracket <b>220</b> may be formed with the pump <b>202</b> or with the sump, or formed separately and coupled to the pump <b>202</b>, the motor <b>204</b>, or the sump for coupling the motor <b>204</b> and/or the pump <b>202</b> to the sump.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As best shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the center axis <b>212</b> of the fluid inlet <b>208</b> is positioned closer to the bracket <b>220</b> than is the center axis <b>218</b> of the motor shaft <b>216</b>. In other words, the distance between the fluid inlet center axis <b>212</b> and the bracket <b>220</b> is less than the distance between the shaft center axis <b>218</b> and the bracket <b>220</b>. Alternatively, the shaft center axis <b>218</b> maybe positioned closer to the bracket <b>220</b> than the fluid inlet center axis <b>212</b>, e.g., to reduce or eliminate the gap between the motor <b>204</b> and a sump (after the motor is coupled to the sump).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Further, the fluid outlet <b>210</b> is positioned closer to the bracket <b>220</b> than is the fluid inlet <b>208</b>, the impeller <b>214</b>, and the motor shaft <b>216</b>. In other embodiments, the fluid outlet <b>210</b> may be positioned farther from the bracket <b>220</b> than is the fluid inlet <b>208</b>, the impeller <b>214</b> and/or the motor shaft <b>216</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref> illustrate an assembly <b>400</b> according to another example embodiment. As shown therein, the assembly <b>400</b> includes the pump <b>202</b> and the motor <b>204</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and a sump <b>404</b>. In this particular example, the pump <b>202</b> is directly coupled to the motor <b>204</b> and plumbed to the sump <b>404</b>. Additionally, the motor <b>204</b> is rigidly mounted to the sump <b>404</b> and hangs from the sump via the bracket <b>220</b>. Further, the mounting between the motor <b>204</b> and the sump <b>404</b> is tuned to reduce noise. Alternatively, the motor <b>204</b> (and/or the pump <b>202</b>) may be flexibly mounted to the sump <b>404</b>. Further, it should be understood that other suitable pumps, motors and sumps may be employed in the assembly <b>400</b> without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The sump <b>404</b> may include a support surface <b>500</b> for coupling the sump <b>404</b> to a dishwasher tub. The support surface <b>500</b> may be coupled to the dishwasher tub directly, via a gasket, or otherwise. Alternatively, other approaches may be employed for coupling the sump to the dishwasher tub.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As noted above with reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the center axis <b>212</b> of the fluid inlet <b>208</b> is positioned closer to the bracket <b>220</b> than is the center axis <b>218</b> of the motor shaft <b>216</b>. Likewise, in the example assembly <b>400</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the shaft center axis <b>218</b> is spaced further from the support surface <b>500</b> than is the center axis <b>212</b> of the fluid inlet <b>208</b>. Alternatively, the shaft center axis <b>218</b> may be positioned closer to the support surface <b>500</b> than the fluid inlet's center axis <b>212</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a dishwasher <b>900</b> according to another example embodiment. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the dishwasher includes a tub <b>902</b> having a bottom <b>904</b> with an opening therethrough. A sump <b>906</b> is positioned in the bottom opening of the tub <b>902</b> and is coupled to a pump assembly <b>908</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, a gap <b>912</b> exists between the top of the pump assembly <b>908</b> and an overlying portion of the sump <b>906</b>. In this embodiment, the gap <b>912</b> is about twenty-two millimeters, and allows the sump <b>906</b> and the pump assembly <b>908</b> to be removed as a single assembly (if desired) from an interior side of the tub, without moving the dishwasher <b>900</b> from its installed position. In other embodiments, a larger or smaller gap (or no gap) may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The pump assembly <b>908</b> includes a motor having a shaft (not shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The pump assembly also includes a fluid inlet <b>916</b>. The motor shaft has a center axis <b>914</b>, and the fluid inlet <b>916</b> has a center axis <b>918</b>. The tub bottom <b>904</b> includes a bottom surface <b>920</b>. The sump <b>906</b> includes a support surface <b>922</b> for coupling the sump <b>906</b> to the tub <b>902</b>. The shaft center axis <b>914</b> is spaced further from the sump surface <b>922</b> than is the center axis <b>918</b> of the fluid inlet <b>916</b>. Further, the fluid inlet's center axis <b>918</b> is closer (in the vertical direction) to the bottom surface <b>920</b> of the tub bottom <b>904</b> than is the shaft center axis <b>914</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The dishwasher <b>900</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref> also includes an access panel <b>910</b> located on its front side. The sump <b>906</b> may be the sump <b>404</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref> or any other suitable sump. Similarly, the pump assembly <b>908</b> may be the assembly <b>200</b> of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> or any other suitable assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In the particular example of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the pump assembly <b>908</b> is mounted in the rear portion of the dishwasher <b>900</b> away from the access panel <b>910</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">According to another aspect of this disclosure, a method of installing a sump/pump assembly in a dishwasher is provided. The method includes positioning the assembly within an interior portion of a dishwasher tub having a bottom opening, inserting at least the motor and the pump of the assembly through the bottom opening of the tub, and coupling the assembly to the dishwasher with the motor and the pump positioned below the tub bottom and with a center axis of the pump's fluid inlet positioned vertically closer to the tub bottom than is a center axis of the motor shaft. In this manner, the sump/pump assembly can be installed in the dishwasher preferably without moving the dishwasher from its installed position. For retrofit or replacement applications, the method may also include removing an existing sump/pump assembly from the dishwasher prior to inserting at least the motor and the pump through the bottom opening of the tub.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The method described above can be used to install any suitable sump/pump assembly in a dishwasher, including the assembly <b>400</b> of <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>. For example, <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the assembly <b>400</b> as the pump <b>202</b> and the motor <b>204</b> are inserted through a bottom opening in a dishwasher tub <b>808</b> from an interior side of the tub <b>808</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the bottom opening in the tub <b>808</b> is defined by a rim <b>810</b>. A portion of the rim <b>810</b> is positioned in the gap between the motor <b>204</b> and the sump <b>404</b> to facilitate installation of the assembly <b>400</b>, preferably without moving the dishwasher from its installed position. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a bottom view of the assembly <b>400</b> installed in a dishwasher <b>902</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Alternatively, the sump and the pump assembly can be installed separately and then coupled together (e.g., during manufacture of the dishwasher). For example, the sump can be installed in the dishwasher tub (e.g., from an interior side of the tub) with at least a portion of the sump positioned in the bottom opening of the tub (e.g., as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Following that, the pump assembly can be positioned below the already installed sump (e.g., by passing the pump assembly through the dishwasher's front side opening that will subsequently be covered by the access panel <b>910</b>). The pump assembly can then be coupled to the sump with the fluid inlet's center axis positioned vertically closer to (or, alternatively, farther from) the bottom surface of the tub bottom than is the shaft center axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention. Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described.
