      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This disclosure relates to food product presses, such as presses for lemons, limes, garlic, and other foods. The presses are manually operated, and can include one or more handles enabling a user to exert pressure upon a food product. Among other things, such pressure can be exerted to extract fluid from the food product (e.g., press juice from lemons, limes, or other fruits), to extract any other part of the food product (e.g., remove pits or seeds from a food item), and/or to crush, crack, cut shape, or change the food product in any number of different manners.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the description herein is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The described embodiments may be carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The press <b>10</b> comprises a first handle part <b>12</b>, a press part <b>14</b>, and a second handle part <b>16</b>. Each portion cooperates to press the food product placed therebetween. Each of the parts <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> can be made of a single integral piece of material manufactured in any suitable manner, such as by molding, casting, stamping, pressing, machining, and/or other manufacturing operations. In other embodiments, any one or more of these parts <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>,<b>16</b> can be constructed of multiple elements connected together in any suitable manner, such as by welding or brazing, adhesive or cohesive bonding material, screws, bolts, nails, rivets, pins, clasps, clamps, and other fasteners, threaded, snap fits, or other inter-engaging connections, and the like. The parts <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>,<b>16</b> of the press <b>10</b> are connected by a compound hinge <b>18</b>. The compound hinge <b>18</b> enables movement of each of the parts <b>12</b>,<b>14</b>,<b>16</b> relative to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The first handle part <b>12</b> comprises a handle <b>20</b> with opposite first and second ends <b>22</b>,<b>24</b> and a hinge portion <b>26</b> at the first end <b>22</b>. The hinge portion <b>26</b> allows the first handle part <b>12</b> to be pivotally connected with the second handle part <b>16</b>. The first handle part also includes a web member <b>28</b> with a slot <b>30</b> just inboard of the first end <b>22</b>. The web member <b>28</b> may extend in a gap formed by bifurcations of the hinge portion <b>26</b> at the first end <b>22</b>. The web member <b>28</b> may extend from the handle <b>20</b> in the area adjacent to the proximal end <b>22</b> and the hinge portion <b>26</b>. The slot <b>30</b> of the web member <b>28</b> allows the press part <b>14</b> to be slidingly connected to the first handle part <b>12</b>. As will be explained in greater detail below, the pivoting and translating connection between the first handle part <b>12</b> and the press part <b>14</b>, and the pivoting connection between the first and second handle parts <b>12</b>,<b>16</b>, enables the press part to be moved in tandem with the first handle part when the first handle part is pivoted relative to the second handle part; and vice versa, the press part may be moved in tandem with the second handle part when the second handle part is pivoted relative to the first handle part. The first handle part <b>12</b> may be any shape, and the handle <b>20</b> and hinge portions <b>26</b> may be shaped as desired to allow the first handle part to pivotally connect the second handle part <b>16</b> and to accommodate the web member <b>28</b> on the underside of the handle of the first handle part. For instance, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the handle <b>20</b> has a slight bending shape at the hinge portion <b>26</b> adjacent to the first end <b>22</b>. The hinge portion <b>26</b> may be birfucated to allow a pivot connection with the second handle part <b>16</b>.</p>
