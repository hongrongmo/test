      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Gas turbine engines include compressor blades that rotate to compress inlet gases and turbine blades that rotate to harness energy from expansion of outlet gases. Gas turbine blades are attached to gas turbine disks. The gas turbine disks rotate with the gas turbine blades and may experience peak stresses in excess of about 1000 megapascals (MPa) due to centrifugal loading from the gas turbine blades and weight of the gas turbine disks themselves.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In some examples, gas turbine disks may not be directly exposed to the flow path of hot gases in the gas turbine engine. Thus, in some implementations, maximum surface temperatures of the gas turbine disks may be about 650Â° C. The thermal and mechanical stresses to which the gas turbine disks are exposed impose design criteria which the alloys that form the gas turbine disks may satisfy. These design criteria include relatively high yield strength and tensile strength to inhibit yield and fracture of the gas turbine disk, relatively high ductility and fracture toughness to impart tolerance to defects, relatively high resistance to initiation of fatigue cracks, and relatively low fatigue crack propagation rates. In some implementations, gas turbine disks may be formed from nickel (Ni)-based superalloys, which may satisfy at least some of these design criteria.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The disclosure describes an article that includes a substrate, a diffusion barrier layer on the substrate, and a wear resistant oxide layer on the diffusion barrier layer, and techniques for forming such an article. The diffusion barrier layer may reduce diffusion of elements between the wear resistant oxide layer and the substrate and/or between the substrate and the wear resistant oxide layer. In some examples, this may help maintain the chemical composition, phase constitution and/or microstructure of the wear resistant oxide layer and/or the substrate, which may help maintain the properties of the wear resistant oxide layer and/or the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The wear resistant oxide layer may include at least one of silica, chromia, or zirconia. The diffusion barrier layer and the wear resistant oxide layer may be applied to a substrate at locations where the substrate is likely to come into contact with another substrate. For example, the diffusion barrier layer and the wear resistant oxide layer may be applied to a gas turbine disk at locations of a fir tree connection where the disk a gas turbine engine blade to couple the blade and disk. Locations such as these may be subject to rubbing during operation of the gas turbine engine. The oxide coating may provide a layer that is resistant to mechanical wear due to the rubbing between the substrates. Additionally, the oxide coating may have relatively low surface roughness compared to a bare metal surface or a surface coated with a metallic coating. This low surface roughness may reduce fretting of the gas turbine engine surfaces that contact the coating, e.g., compared to examples where the gas turbine engine surfaces contact bare metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The diffusion barrier layer may include iridium (Ir) or an alloy including iridium. The diffusion barrier layer may reduce or substantially prevent diffusion between the substrate and the wear resistant oxide layer and/or between the wear resistant oxide layer and the substrate. This may result in properties of the wear resistant oxide layer and the substrate being more consistent over time than if diffusion between the wear resistant oxide layer and substrate occurs.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In some examples, the coating system may additionally include a metallic protective layer between the diffusion barrier layer and the oxide coating. The metallic protective layer may include an element or elements that provide to the substrate environmental protection against hot gases and chemical species in the gas turbine environment. For example, the metallic protective layer may provide protection from oxidation and/or hot-corrosion of the substrate. The metallic protective layer may include aluminum, chromium, an alloy including aluminum, an alloy including chromium, or a NiFeCrMnSi alloy.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In some examples, the disclosure describes an article including a superalloy substrate and a coating on the superalloy substrate. In accordance with this example, the coating includes a diffusion barrier layer on the substrate and a wear resistant oxide layer over the diffusion barrier layer. The diffusion barrier layer may include iridium and the wear resistant oxide layer may include at least one of silica, zirconia, or chromia.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In some examples, the disclosure describes a method including depositing a diffusion barrier layer on a superalloy substrate and depositing a wear resistant oxide layer over the diffusion barrier layer. In accordance with this example, the diffusion barrier layer may include Ir and the wear resistant oxide layer comprises at least one of silica, zirconia, or chromia.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As described above, a gas turbine disk may include a substrate and a wear resistant oxide layer on a surface of the substrate, which may provide wear resistance to the surface of the substrate. However, in some examples, interdiffusion of elements or compounds between the substrate and the wear resistant oxide layer or between the wear resistant oxide layer and the substrate may deleteriously affect properties of the substrate and/or the wear resistant oxide layer. For example, the substrate may include a Ni-based superalloy that includes additional elements such as titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), or aluminum (Al), which beneficially affect the properties of the substrate. However, diffusion of Ti or Co from the substrate into the wear resistant oxide layer may adversely affect the coefficient of friction of the wear resistant oxide layer. As another example, diffusion of Al from the substrate to the wear resistant oxide layer may lower Al content in at least a portion of the substrate, which may result in a reduced gamma prime (Î³â²) phase volume fraction in the portion of the substrate. A reduced Î³â² phase volume fraction may adversely impact mechanical properties of the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Additionally, in some examples, diffusion of elements from the substrate to the wear resistant oxide layer or from the wear resistant oxide layer to the substrate may result in formation of additional phases or layers during prolonged exposure to high temperatures, such as thousands of hours around 700Â° C., hundreds of hours around 750Â° C., or tens of hours around 800Â° C. For example, a brittle and/or non-strain compliant phase may form in the protective layer during exposure to high temperatures, which may adversely impact performance of the protective layer. One example of a brittle and/or non-strain compliant phase includes a topologically close-packed phase that may form from chromium and a refractory element, such as molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, an article may include a diffusion barrier layer between the substrate and the wear resistant oxide layer. The diffusion barrier layer may reduce or substantially prevent diffusion between the substrate and the wear resistant oxide layer and/or between the wear resistant oxide layer and the substrate. In some examples, this may reduce or substantially eliminate one or more of the deleterious effects due to diffusion that were discussed above. The diffusion barrier layer includes Ir or an Ir alloy.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a cross-sectional view of an example article <b>10</b> that includes a gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b> and a gas turbine engine blade <b>14</b>. In gas turbine engines, turbine blades <b>14</b> may be connected to turbine disks <b>12</b> using fir tree connections.

In some examples, the rubbing between gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b> and gas turbine engine blade <b>14</b> at these contact points may result in fretting.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In accordance with some examples of this disclosure, a diffusion barrier layer and a wear resistant oxide layer may be applied to a gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b> at the points of contact between gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b> and gas turbine engine blade <b>14</b>. For example, the coating including the diffusion barrier layer and the wear resistant oxide layer may be applied to the surface of fir tree recess <b>18</b>. The oxide coating may provide a layer that is resistant to mechanical wear due to the rubbing between the substrates. Additionally, the oxide coating may have relatively low surface roughness compared to a bare metal surface or a surface coated with a metallic coating. This lower surface roughness may reduce fretting of portions of gas turbine engine blade <b>14</b> that contact gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Substrate <b>32</b> may include a superalloy, such as a Ni-based or Co-based superalloy. In some examples, substrate <b>32</b> includes a Ni-based superalloy suitable for use in a gas turbine engine disk or gas turbine engine spacer. As described above, the superalloy from which a gas turbine engine disk is formed may satisfy certain design criteria, including, for example, relatively high yield strength and tensile strength to inhibit yield and fracture of the gas turbine engine disk, relatively high ductility and fracture toughness to impart tolerance to defects, relatively high resistance to initiation of fatigue cracks, and relatively low fatigue crack propagation rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Properties of the superalloy from which substrate <b>12</b> is formed may be a function of the composition of the superalloy and the phase constitution and microstructure of the superalloy. The microstructure of the superalloy may include the grain size of the superalloy and a precipitate phase composition, size, and volume fraction. In some examples, the phase constitution and microstructure of the superalloy may be affected by mechanical and thermal processing of the superalloy. For example, thermal processing, e.g., heat treatment, of the superalloy may affect grain structure of the superalloy, precipitate phase size and/or composition, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In some examples, substrate <b>32</b> includes a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy, which includes a plurality of grains. Substrate may include at least one of Al, Ti, or Ta in addition to Ni. In some examples, a concentration of elements, such as between about 2 weight percent (wt. %) and about 5 wt. % Al, between about 2 wt. % and about 5 wt. % Ti, and less than about 3 wt. % tantalum (Ta), in substrate <b>32</b> may be sufficient to result in gamma-prime (Î³â²) precipitate formation in substrate <b>32</b>. For example, the concentration of Al, Ti, and/or Ta in substrate <b>32</b> may result in a Î³â² precipitate phase volume fraction between about 40 volume percent (vol. %) and about 55 vol. %. In some instances, higher or lower elemental contents of the individual gamma prime forming elements can be employed while maintaining the overall gamma prime phase fraction at desired levels for properties such as strength and ductility. The volume fraction, size, and distribution of the Î³â² precipitate phase may be influenced by the alloy composition, heat treatment temperature, heat treatment duration, and cooling rate during heat treatment. Additionally, substrate <b>32</b> may include grain sizes between about 5 micrometers (Î¼m) in diameter to between about 30 Î¼m and about 50 Î¼m or more in diameter, engineered for a combination of yield strength, resistance to fatigue crack initiation, creep strength, and resistance to fatigue crack growth. In some examples, substrate <b>32</b> may include additional elements that segregate to grain boundaries of substrate <b>32</b>. The segregating elements may affect creep resistance and low-cycle fatigue resistance of substrate <b>32</b>. Examples of segregating elements include boron (B; up to about 0.03 weight percent (wt. %) of substrate <b>12</b>), carbon (C; up to about 0.05 wt. % of substrate <b>32</b>), and zirconium (Zr; up to about 0.1 wt. % of substrate <b>32</b>). Examples of compositions and heat treatment techniques that may result in suitable Ni-based disk alloys are described in U.S. patent application Ser.

Diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> includes a composition that reduces diffusion between substrate <b>32</b> and wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> and/or between wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> and substrate <b>32</b>. For example, when diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> is initially deposited on substrate <b>32</b>, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include Ir or an Ir alloy (and may include elements other than those listed described as being present in diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b>). In some examples, when diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> is initially deposited on substrate <b>32</b>, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may consist essentially of Ir; that is, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include Ir and elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> when diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> initially is formed on substrate <b>32</b>. In other examples, when diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> is initially deposited on substrate <b>32</b>, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may consist essentially of an Ir alloy; that is, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include the elements specified in the Ir alloy and elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> when diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> initially is formed on substrate <b>32</b>. In other examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may consist of Ir or an Ir alloy when initially formed on substrate <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include various alloys of Ir and other elements. For example, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include an alloy of Ir and Cr. As another example, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include an alloy of Ir and Si. As another example, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include an alloy of Ir and at least one additional platinum group metal, such as Pt, Pd, Re, Ru, or Rh. In some examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include an alloy of Ir, Cr, and Si or an alloy of Ir, Cr, Si, and at least one of Pt, Pd, Re, Ru, or Rh. As described above, when initially formed on substrate <b>32</b>, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may include, consist essentially of, or consist of any of the alloys described herein. In general, the composition of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may be selected to be chemically stable at the interface between substrate <b>32</b> and diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> (e.g., surface <b>40</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In some examples in which diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> includes an Ir alloy, the Ir alloy may include a predominance of Ir. In other words, the Ir alloy may include more Ir than any other single element in the alloy, determined on a weight basis.

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some examples, the Ir alloy may include a majority Ir. A majority Ir means greater than 50 wt. % Ir. In other examples, the Ir alloy may not include a majority Ir, e.g., the alloy may include other elements in a total amount greater than the amount of Ir.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">An example of an Ir composition that may be utilized in diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> includes between about 10 wt. % and about 40 wt. % Ir, between about 26.2 wt. % and about 65 wt. % Ni, between about 15 wt. % and about 30 wt. % Fe, between about 10 wt. % and about 30 wt. % Cr, less than about 1 wt. % Mn, less than about 2 wt. % Al, and less than about 0.8 wt. % Si.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In some examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may be essentially free of elements that are deleterious to oxidation- or hot corrosion-resistance of a metallic protective layer that may be deposited on diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). For example, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may be essentially free of Ti and Co, which may be deleterious to oxidation- or hot corrosion-resistance of the metallic protective layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may be formed on substrate <b>32</b> using, for example, directed vapor deposition (DVD), electroplating, ion-assisted electron-beam deposition, or nano-scale electroplating. Some of these techniques, such as DVD, allow depositing diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> at locations that are not line-of-site with the coating source. This may facilitate deposition of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> on surfaces with complex geometry, such as fir tree recess <b>18</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Any of these techniques may facilitate deposition of single or multiple layers of material with a controlled composition and thickness. In some examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> may be deposited at temperatures below a temperature that could result in microstructure changes in substrate <b>32</b>. This may allow diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> to be formed on substrate <b>32</b> substantially without affecting the physical properties of substrate <b>32</b>. In some examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> and wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be deposited using the same technique, while in other examples, diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> and wear resistant wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be deposited using different techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Coating <b>34</b> also includes wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> disposed on diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b>. Wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may include an oxide of at least one of silicon (Si), chromium (Cr), or zirconium (Zr). In some examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> includes, consists essentially of, or consists of silica. In other examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> includes, consists essentially of, or consists of silica and an oxide of chromium. In other examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> includes, consists essentially of, or consists of silica and an oxide of zirconium. In other examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> includes, consists essentially of, or consists of silica, an oxide of chromium, and an oxide of zirconium. The wear resistant oxide layer may be thermally stable up to temperatures of about 800Â° C. to 900Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be deposited on diffusion barrier layer rather than thermally grown on diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b>. By depositing wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> rather than thermally growing a wear resistant oxide layer, the composition, thickness, and surface properties of wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be better controlled. For example, a thermally grown wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may include a mixture of oxides of constituents of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> in ratios that are affected by the composition of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b> and the reactivities with oxygen of the constituents of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b>. Thermally growing a wear resistant oxide layer also may result in less control over the thickness of the wear resistant oxide layer compared to depositing wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD), radio frequency (RF) sputtering, sol-gel coating, or the like.

      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">By depositing wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> using one of these methods, rather than thermally growing wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b>, the properties of wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be better controlled. For example, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be resistant to mechanical wear due to the rubbing between article <b>30</b> and another component. For example, article <b>30</b> may be a gas turbine engine disk (e.g., disk <b>10</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Coating <b>34</b> may be applied to surfaces of fir tree recess <b>18</b>. Wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be resistant to mechanical wear due to rubbing between surfaces of blade root <b>16</b> and fir tree recess <b>18</b>. Additionally, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may have relatively low surface roughness compared to a bare metal surface (e.g., surface <b>40</b>) or a surface of diffusion barrier layer <b>36</b>.

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Additionally, in some examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may provide environmental resistance to substrate <b>12</b> by providing a barrier to oxygen or corrosive chemical species from accessing substrate <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In some examples, coating <b>34</b> may be selectively applied to portions of gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b>.

In this way, coating <b>34</b>, including wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b>, may provide wear resistance to appropriate portions of portions of gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b>, while allowing other portions of gas turbine engine disk <b>12</b> to be appropriately coated.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some examples, wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> may be relatively thin, which may result in wear resistant oxide layer <b>38</b> being less prone to cracking under thermal cycling.

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, for the bare nickel disk alloy, the coefficient of friction fluctuated over the 8,500 tested cycles and was nearly 0.6 at the end of the testing. Similarly, the coefficient of friction for the nickel disk alloy coated with NiCrMnSi generally increased as testing proceeded, and ended at about 0.6. On the other hand, for both the sol-gel SiO<sub>2 </sub>coated nickel disk alloy and the nickel disk alloy coated with an Ir diffusion barrier layer and a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer deposited using PVD, the coefficient of friction remained at or below about 0.52 for a majority of the testing, and ended at between about 0.50 and 0.52. The coefficient of friction for the sol-gel SiO<sub>2 </sub>coated nickel disk alloy was relatively constant throughout the testing.</p>
