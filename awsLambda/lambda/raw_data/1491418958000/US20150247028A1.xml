      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Olefin-based polymers have been widely used in many applications because of their low cost and ease in polymer property design. Such polymers are finding many relatively new applications, for example, as shoe soles in the footwear industry. Currently the materials used in footwear midsole are dominated by ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA). Compared with EVA, olefin-based polymers have several advantages, such as imparting less weight to the final article, which is a general trend in sole designs for footwear products.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, olefin-based polymers are typically non-polar in nature, making them difficult to be bonded, painted, and printed, due to a low surface energy. For example, in the footwear assembling process, the midsole is typically bonded with both the outsole (usually made of vulcanized rubber or thermoplastic polyurethane) and the shoe upper (usually made from natural/artificial leather). Similar bonding is used in other applications, such as toys and sporting goods.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">To enhance the surface energy and thus improve the bondability and paintability of olefin-based polymers, techniques such as flame treatment, plasma treatment, and acid treatment have been used. These techniques, however, are complicated, costly, and hazardous to workers. A need exists for a composition that is safe, effective and easy to apply for improving the bondability and paintability of olefin-based polymers.</p>

Melt viscosity is measured using a Brookfield rotational viscometer in accordance with ASTM D 1084 (at 177Â° C., 350Â° F.). Nonlimiting examples of suitable C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>10 </sub>Î±-olefin comonomer include propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene and 1-octene.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The low viscosity ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer can have a melt viscosity from 1.0 Pa-s, or 2.0 Pa-s, or 3.0 Pa-s, or 4.0 Pa-s, or 5.0 Pa-s, or 6.0 Pa-s, to less than 20.0 Pa-s, or 15.0 Pa-s, or 10.0 Pa-s, or 8.0 Pa-s.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In an embodiment, the low viscosity ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer has an Mw/Mn from 1.5 to 5.0 and a density from 0.85 g/cc to 0.90 g/cc.</p>

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In an embodiment the low viscosity ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer has one, some, or all of the following properties: a melt viscosity from 1.0 Pa-s to less than 10.0 Pa-s, a density from 0.86 g/cc to 0.88 g/cc, and a weight average molecular weight (Mw) less than 25,000, an Mw/Mn from 1.5 to 2.5, a melting temperature (Tm) from 68-70Â° C. (DSC), a melt index (I2) greater than 500 g/10 minute, and a crystallinity less than 25%, or from 5% to less than 25% (as determined by DSC).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In an embodiment, the low viscosity ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer is a homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer. A âhomogeneously-branched ethylene/Î±-olefin copolymer,â as used herein, is an ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymer, in which the Î±-olefin comonomer is randomly distributed within a given polymer molecule, and all of the polymer molecules have the same or substantially the same comonomer-to-ethylene ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymer is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,272,236; 5,278,272; 6,054,544; 6,335,410 and 6,723,810; each incorporated herein by reference. Substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymer has long chain branching. The long chain branches have the same comonomer distribution as the polymer backbone, and can have about the same length as the length of the polymer backbone. The term âsubstantially linear,â typically, is in reference to a polymer that is substituted, on average, with â0.01 long chain branches per 1000 carbonsâ to â3 long chain branches per 1000 carbons.â The length of a long chain branch is longer than the carbon length of a short chain branch, formed from the incorporation of one comonomer into the polymer backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Some polymers may be substituted with 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 3 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons, further from 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 2 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons, and further from 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 1 long chain branch per 1000 total carbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The substantially linear homogeneously branched linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers form a unique class of ethylene polymers. They differ substantially from the conventional, homogeneously branched linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers, as discussed above, and, moreover, they are not in the same class as conventional heterogeneous âZiegler-Natta catalyst polymerizedâ linear ethylene polymers (for example, ultra-low density polyethylene (ULDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) or high density polyethylene (HDPE), made, for example, using the technique disclosed by Anderson et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698); nor are they in the same class as high pressure, free-radical initiated, highly branched polyethylenes, such as, for example, low density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer.</p>

      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The concept of a numerical solubility parameter, capable of describing the solubility properties of a solvent or polymer, was first described by Hildebrand. Charles Hansen divided the Hildebrand solubility parameter into three partial solubility parameters, namely dispersion (Î´<sub>d</sub>), polar (Î´<sub>p</sub>), and hydrogen-bonding (Î´<sub>h</sub>), each having values in (J/cc)<sup>1/2</sup>. These three Hansen solubility parameters, or HSP, define a point, in three-dimensional solubility space, that describes the solubility properties of a solvent. HSP theory states that solvents with similar HSP should be compatible or soluble in each other. Polymers are larger molecules, which exhibit a more complex solubility behavior than pure solvents, and their solubility properties are best described as a sphere in solubility space, with the three HSP parameters, as its center coordinates, and a radius R (also in (J/cc)<sup>1/2 </sup>that defines the size of the solubility sphere. The interaction between a solvent and a polymer is calculated as an Energy Difference (ED) using the equation 1:</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]<i>ED</i>=(4(Î´<sub>d1</sub>-Î´<sub>d2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(Î´<sub>p1</sub>-Î´<sub>p2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(Î´<sub>h1</sub>-<sub>h2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>,ââEquation 1[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the HSP of the solvent and the polymer, respectively. If the ED is divided by the radius R of the sphere, one obtains the Relative Energy Difference or RED value (Equation 2).</p>

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0060">Solvents with REDâ¦1 (J/cc)<sup>1/2 </sup>should interact strongly with the polymer by swelling it or dissolving it. In theory, the closer the RED is to zero, the stronger the interaction. In practice, this is not always observed, as the determination of solvent solubility parameters always has an error associated with it.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0061">To characterize a polymer by its HSP and R values, it is necessary to actually measure, or at least visually rate, its solubility in a set of solvents with known solubility parameters. The solubility behavior is then fitted with a computer program that minimizes the radius of interaction, while maintaining the best agreement with the empirical solubility observations. The publicly available program SPHERE is available as part of the Hansen software (HSPiP) which is available on the internet and can be used for this purpose.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0062">Once a polymer is characterized by its HSP and R values, a search for suitable solvents in a solvent HSP database can be conducted, using RED as the key criteria. This search can be simplified using a spreadsheet-type program, like MICROSOFT EXCEL, containing the solvent database and programmed to solve Equation 2. A second solvent modeling program allows for evaluation of other criteria, such as solvent class and boiling point. A tailored single computer program is used to perform these functions. If lacking in the database, the HSP of a given solvent can be calculated by various methods described by Hansen in his book âHansen Solubility ParametersâA User's Handbookâ, 2<sup>nd </sup>Edition, CRC Press, 2007. Solvent HSP values not available in our database are calculated using the Yamamoto Molecular Break method (Y-MB) contained within the commercial HSPiP program. This program returns the HSP values for a solvent structure entered in the SMILES format (molecular structures that omit hydrogens).</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0081">In an embodiment, the substrate surface includes an olefin block copolymer. An âolefin block copolymerâ (or âOBCâ), as used herein, is a multi-block or segmented copolymer and includes two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as âblocksâ) joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In certain embodiments, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystallinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), region-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. The olefin block copolymer is characterized by unique distributions of polydispersity index (PDI or M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process making of the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, embodiments of the OBC may possess a PDI ranging from 1.7 to 8; or from 1.7 to 3.5; or from 1.7 to 2.5; and from 1.8 to 2.5; or from 1.8 to 2.1. When produced in a batch or semi-batch process, embodiments of the OBC may possess a PDI ranging from 1.0 to 2.9; or from 1.3 to 2.5; or from 1.4 to 2.0; or from 1.4 to 1.8.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0082">In an embodiment, the OBC is an ethylene/Î±-olefin multi-block copolymer. The ethylene/Î±-olefin multi-block copolymer comprises a majority mole fraction of units derived from ethylene, the ethylene comprising at least 50 mol %, or at least 60 mol %, or at least 70 mol %, or at least 80 mol % with the remainder of the multi-block copolymer comprising the comonomer. The ethylene/Î±-olefin multi-block copolymer further includes ethylene and the co-polymerizable Î±-olefin comonomer in polymerized form, characterized by multiple (i.e., two or more) blocks or segments of two or more polymerized monomer units differing in chemical or physical properties (block interpolymer), and is a multi-block copolymer. In some embodiments, the multi-block copolymer may be represented by the following formula:</p>

      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">where n is at least 1, preferably an integer greater than 1, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or higher; âAâ represents a hard block or segment; and âBâ represents a soft block or segment. The A's and B's are linked in a linear fashion, not in a branched or a star fashion. âHardâ segments refer to blocks of polymerized units in which ethylene is present in an amount greater than 95 weight percent in some embodiments, and in other embodiments greater than 98 weight percent. In other words, the comonomer content in the hard segments is less than 5 weight percent in some embodiments, and in other embodiments, less than 2 weight percent of the total weight of the hard segments. In some embodiments, the hard segments comprise all, or substantially all, ethylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">The âsoftâ segments, on the other hand, refer to blocks of polymerized units in which the comonomer content is greater than 5 weight percent of the total weight of the soft segments in some embodiments, greater than 8 weight percent, greater than 10 weight percent, or greater than 15 weight percent in various other embodiments. In some embodiments, the comonomer content in the soft segments may be greater than 20 weight percent, greater than 25 eight percent, greater than 30 weight percent, greater than 35 weight percent, greater than 40 weight percent, greater than 45 weight percent, greater than 50 weight percent, or greater than 60 weight percent in various other embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">Because the respective distinguishable segments or blocks formed from two or more monomers are joined into single polymer chains, the polymer cannot be completely fractionated using standard selective extraction techniques. For example, polymers containing regions that are relatively crystalline (high density segments) and regions that are relatively amorphous (lower density segments) cannot be selectively extracted or fractionated using differing solvents. In an embodiment, the quantity of extractable polymer using either a dialkyl ether or an alkane solvent is less than 10, or less than 7, or less than 5, or less than 2, percent of the total polymer weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">In addition, the OBC disclosed herein possesses a PDI fitting a Schulz-Flory distribution rather than a Poisson distribution. The present OBC is produced by the polymerization process described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,858,706 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,608,668 which results in a product having both a polydisperse block distribution as well as a polydisperse distribution of block sizes. This results in the formation of OBC product having distinguishable physical properties.

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0117">Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to measure crystallinity in polyethylene (PE) based samples and polypropylene (PP) based samples. About five to eight milligrams of sample is weighed and placed in a DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The sample pan is placed in a DSC cell, and then heated, at a rate of approximately 10Â° C./min, to a temperature of 180Â° C. for PE (230Â° C. for PP). The sample is kept at this temperature for three minutes. Then the sample is cooled at a rate of 10Â° C./min to â60Â° C. for PE (â40Â° C. for PP), and kept isothermally at that temperature for three minutes. The sample is next heated at a rate of 10Â° C./min, until complete melting (second heat). The percent crystallinity is calculated by dividing the heat of fusion (H<sub>f</sub>), determined from the second heat curve, by a theoretical heat of fusion of 292 J/g for PE (165 J/g, for PP), and multiplying this quantity by 100 (e.g., for PE, % cryst.=(H<sub>f</sub>/292 J/g)Ã100; and for PP, % cryst.=(H<sub>f</sub>/165 J/g)Ã100).</p>

      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0120">The concentration of maleic anhydride is determined by the ratio of peak heights of the maleic anhydride at wave number 1791 cm<sup>â1 </sup>to the polymer reference peak, which, in case of polyethylene, is at wave number 2019 cm<sup>â1</sup>. Maleic anhydride content is calculated by multiplying this ratio with the appropriate calibration constant. The equation used for maleic grafted polyolefins (with reference peak for polyethylene) has the following form, as shown in Equation 3.</p>

      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0121">The calibration constant A can be determined using <sup>13</sup>C NMR standards. The actual calibration constant may differ slightly depending on the instrument and polymer. The second component at wave number 1712 cm<sup>â1 </sup>accounts for the presence of maleic acid, which is negligible for freshly grafted material. Over time however, maleic anhydride is readily converted to maleic acid in the presence of moisture. Depending on surface area, significant hydrolysis can occur in just a few days under ambient conditions. The acid has a distinct peak at wave number 1712 cm<sup>â1</sup>. The constant B in Equation 3 is a correction for the difference in extinction coefficients between the anhydride and acid groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0122">The sample preparation procedure begins by making a pressing, typically 0.05 to 0.15 millimeters in thickness, in a heated press, between two protective films, at 150-180Â° C. for one hour. MYLAR and TEFLON are suitable protective films to protect the sample from the platens. Aluminum foil must never be used (maleic anhydride reacts with aluminum). Platens should be under pressure (Ë10 ton) for about five minutes. The sample is allowed to cool to room temperature, placed in an appropriate sample holder, and then scanned in the FTIR. A background scan should be run before each sample scan, or as needed. The precision of the test is good, with an inherent variability of less than Â±5%. Samples should be stored with desiccant to prevent excessive hydrolysis. Moisture content in the product has been measured as high as 0.1 weight percent. The conversion of anhydride to acid however is reversible with temperature, but may take up to one week for complete conversion. The reversion is best performed in a vacuum oven at 150Â° C.; a good vacuum (near 30 inches Hg) is required. If the vacuum is less than adequate the sample tends to oxidize resulting in an infrared peak at approximately 1740 cm<sup>â1</sup>, which will cause the values for the graft level to be too low. Maleic anhydride and acid are represented by peaks at about 1791 and 1712 cm<sup>â1</sup>, respectively.</p>

The spindle used, in general, is a SC-31 hot-melt spindle, suitable for measuring viscosities in the range from 10 to 100,000 centipoise. The sample is poured into the chamber, which is, in turn, inserted into a Brookfield Thermosel, and locked into place. The sample chamber has a notch on the bottom that fits the bottom of the Brookfield Thermosel, to ensure that the chamber is not allowed to turn when the spindle is inserted and spinning. The sample (approximately 8-10 grams of resin) is heated to the required temperature, until the melted sample is about one inch below the top of the sample chamber. The viscometer apparatus is lowered, and the spindle submerged into the sample chamber. Lowering is continued, until the brackets on the viscometer align on the Thermosel. The viscometer is turned on, and set to operate at a shear rate which leads to a torque reading in the range of 40 to 60 percent of the total torque capacity, based on the rpm output of the viscometer. Readings are taken every minute for about 15 minutes, or until the values stabilize, at which point, a final reading is recorded.</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0152">Polymer 1 is made on a â92 mmâ co-rotating twin screw extruders (TSE). The process is summarized in the following steps: (a) the TSE is set to run at the selected barrel temperature profiles, and the screw speeds set to the desired RPMs; (b) polymer pellets are fed into the extruder hopper of the extruder by a gravimetrically, controlled auger feeder, at the desired polymer feed rate; (c) molten MAH is injected into the barrel; (d) peroxide is added via a 1:1 mineral oil solution, at a target feed rate, and injected into the barrel, downstream from the MAH; (e) kneading blocks distributed the reactive ingredients and heated the polymer melt through mechanical energy dissipation, and the reaction occurred following thermal decomposition of peroxide initiator; (f) volatile unreacted components and byproducts are removed at a vacuum port; (g) the melt is cooled in the final barrel section and fed to a gear pump; (h) the gear pump feeds a die, from which the melt travels to an underwater pelletizer. A pellet slurry cooling line of sufficient length is used to achieve residence time greater than 60 seconds, to cool pellets to less than 25Â° C.). The pelletized product is dried and collected.</p>

      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0156">Samples are prepared by weighing 0.5 g of the polymer beads into a 5-dram vial. The first test solvent (5.0 ml) is added into the vial with a pipette, and the vial is then capped with a polyethylene-lined lid, and labeled with the solvent loaded. This procedure is repeated with the remaining 17 test solvents. The final polymer concentration in the vial is 10% (weight/volume relationship). The vials are placed in an Eberbach shaker on the low setting at 25Â° C. After 24 hours, the samples are removed from the shaker, and allowed to sit for 30 minutes, before they are visually rated on a scale of 1 to 6, as per the criteria shown in Table B.</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0162">Two solvents from the list, namely ethylcyclohexane and d-limonene, are evaluated for compatibility with Polymer 1 at the 10% w/v concentration. The polymer/solvent mixtures are prepared in a 5-dram vial as described before, and gently heated with a heat gun, to get the polymer beads to melt. During this process, the vial is placed on, and off, a vortex mixer for about 15 seconds, at a time to get the contents to mix, until a clear solution was observed. The vials are left standing on a lab bench overnight. A clear homogeneous solution is still present in each vial after 24 hours, demonstrating good compatibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0163">Since ethyl cyclohexane and polymer have RED of 1.03 and form a solution, it follows that other solvents in the table which have the same or lower RED should also dissolve the polymer (ex. d-limonene dissolves the polymer and the RED is 0.94).</p>

      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0170">The above mentioned IE1 is used to improve the bonding strength of two rectangular substrates, each substrate formed from a polypropylene/OBC blend. Each substrate has a width of 1 cm. Each substrate is first cleaned manually with acetone. Then the substrates are left in a fume hood for several minutes to remove the acetone. The primer composition prepared in IE1 is heated to 70Â° C., before applying to the substrate surfaces as a thin film. The primer composition is manually brushed onto the substrate surfaces. After the primer dries, a two-part adhesive (LOCTITE 3038) is applied onto the primed surface (denoted as âPrimerâ in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Next, the two rectangular substrates are pressed and glued together with an overlapped area about 1Ë2 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

The maximum tensile force (F<sub>m</sub>, unit: N) is recorded, and the tensile shear stress (Ï, unit: MPa) is calculated by the following equation: Ï=F<sub>m</sub>/S, where S is the area (unit: mm<sup>2</sup>) of the glued part. As seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the tensile shear stress for the Primer treated surfaces is greater than the tensile shear stress for surfaces treated with glue only. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> demonstrates that the bonding strength, is significantly improved after the application of IE1 primer composition to the polypropylene/OBC substrates.</p>
