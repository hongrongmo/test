      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to polishing compositions and methods. More particularly, this invention relates to chemical-mechanical polishing compositions suitable for polishing tungsten surfaces.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A semiconductor wafer typically includes a substrate, such as silicon or gallium arsenide, on which a variety of metal layers have been deposited. Tungsten (W) is used in a variety of semiconductor applications, including as a thin-film layer or as a tungsten plug to connect between multilevel interconnections.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In one common use of tungsten, metallized vias or contacts are formed by a blanket tungsten deposition followed by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In a typical process, “via holes” are etched through an interlevel dielectric and a thin TiN adhesion layer is generally formed over the interlevel dielectric and into the via hole. Next, a tungsten film is deposited as a blanket over the adhesion layer and into the via. The deposition is continued until the via hole is completely filled with tungsten. The metal films formed on the top surface of the interlevel dielectric are then removed by chemical mechanical polishing, thereby forming metal vias or plugs.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Compositions and methods for CMP of the surface of a substrate are well known in the art. Polishing compositions (also known as polishing slurries, CMP slurries, and CMP compositions) for CMP of metal-containing surfaces of semiconductor substrates (e.g., integrated circuits) typically contain an abrasive, various additive compounds, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In conventional CMP techniques, a substrate carrier or polishing head is mounted on a carrier assembly and positioned in contact with a polishing pad in a CMP apparatus. The carrier assembly provides a controllable pressure to the substrate, urging the substrate against the polishing pad. The pad and carrier, with its attached substrate, are moved relative to one another. The relative movement of the pad and substrate serves to abrade the surface of the substrate to remove a portion of the material from the substrate surface, thereby polishing the substrate. The polishing of the substrate surface typically is further aided by the chemical activity of the polishing composition (e.g., by oxidizing agents or other additives present in the CMP composition) and/or the mechanical activity of an abrasive suspended in the polishing composition. Typical abrasive materials include silicon dioxide, cerium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, and titanium oxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The CMP process used to remove the tungsten layer can result undesirably in the formation of recesses in the tungsten layer or the tungsten plug. Tungsten recessing increases when over-polishing is used to ensure complete removal of the tungsten film across the surface of a wafer. Tungsten recessing leads to surface non-planarity which can compromise circuit integrity. Recessing also creates a variety of complications to the deposition of layers on subsequent levels of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There is an ongoing need for compositions and methods for CMP of tungsten-containing substrates that will reduce recessing of tungsten, while at the same time maintaining useful rates of tungsten removal. The present invention addresses these ongoing needs.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A CMP method suitable for polishing a tungsten-containing substrate is described. The method comprises abrading a surface of the substrate with a CMP polishing composition that comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of an aqueous carrier fluid containing a particulate silica abrasive, a polyamino compound, at least one metal ion selected from a transition metal ion (e.g., ferric ion) and a group IIIA/IVA metal ion (e.g., a tin ion), a chelating agent, an oxidizing agent, and optionally, an amino acid. These additives, when used in compositions as described herein, result in the reduction of tungsten recesses that occur when tungsten is polished according to general CMP processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Preferably, the particulate silica abrasive material is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 0.05 percent by weight (wt %) to about 3 wt % (e.g., about 0.1 to about 1.5 wt %). The particulate silica abrasive material can be any silica abrasive material suitable for use in CMP compositions for polishing semiconductor materials, preferably colloidal silica.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In some embodiments, the polyamino compound comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least one poly(ethleneimine) compound, e.g., triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and pentaethylenehexamine. Preferably, the polyamino compound is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 1 to about 2000 parts-per-million (ppm) (e.g., about 5 to about 1000 ppm).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The metal ion is capable of cycling between multiple oxidation states, and preferably is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 5 to about 1000 ppm (e.g., about 10 to about 500 ppm).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The chelating agent can be any compound capable of chelating the metal ion component of the CMP composition, and preferably comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of malonic acid, methylmalonic acid, ethylmalonic acid, phenylmalonic acid, and hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (e.g., DEQUEST 2010). Preferably, the chelating agent is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 10 to about 4000 ppm (e.g., about 50 to about 2000 ppm).</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some embodiments, the methods described herein utilize a polishing composition having a molar ratio of metal ion-to-chelating agent in the range of about 0.5:1 to about 2:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The oxidizing agent preferably is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight (e.g., about 0.5 to about 5 wt %). In some preferred embodiments, the oxidizing agent comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The polishing composition can optionally include an amino acid, e.g., at a concentration in the range of about 500 ppm (0.05 wt %) to about 3000 ppm (0.3 wt %). The amino acid can be any amino acid suitable for use as a corrosion inhibitor in CMP compositions. In some embodiments, the amino acid comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of glycine or lysine.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The CMP methods described herein preferably comprise the steps of abrading a surface of the substrate with a polishing pad and a CMP composition of the invention, and causing relative motion between the polishing pad and the substrate while maintaining a portion of the CMP composition in contact with the substrate surface between the pad and the substrate for a time period sufficient to remove at least a portion of the tungsten from the surface.</p>

Colloidal silica is a preferred abrasive. Preferably, the silica abrasive is present in the composition at concentration in the range of about 0.05 to about 3 percent by weight, e.g., about 0.1 to about 1.5 wt %. The abrasive particles preferably have a mean particle size in the range of about 10 nm to about 100 nm.

When the abrasive is suspended in the CMP composition, the abrasive preferably is colloidally stable. The term “colloid” refers to the suspension of abrasive particles in the liquid carrier. “Colloidal stability” refers to the maintenance of that suspension over time. In the context of this invention, an abrasive is considered colloidally stable if, when the abrasive is placed into a 100 ml graduated cylinder and allowed to stand without agitation for a time of 2 hours, the difference between the concentration of particles in the bottom 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([B] in terms of g/ml) and the concentration of particles in the top 50 ml of the graduated cylinder ([T] in terms of g/ml) divided by the initial concentration of particles in the abrasive composition ([C] in terms of g/ml) is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., {[B]−[T]}/[C]&lt;0.5). The value of [B]−[T]/[C] desirably is less than or equal to 0.3, and preferably is less than or equal to 0.1.</p>

Non-limiting examples of such transition metal and group IIIA/IVA metal ions include, e.g., Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Mn, Nb, Ni, Os, Pd, Ru, Ti, V, and Sn ions. In some embodiments, preferred metal ions are Ag, Cu or Fe ions. Fe ion (e.g., ferric ion) is particularly preferred.

In aqueous solution the metal ion typically is present as a hydrate or as a complex including one or more other ligands such as a halide, a hydroxide, or a chelating agent, in addition to or replacing water molecules of a hydrate. A preferred source of ferric ion is ferric nitrate (e.g., ferric nitrate nonahydrate). In the CMP compositions described herein, at least a portion, and in some embodiments, substantially all, of the transition metal ions and group IIIA/WA metal ions in the composition are present as a complex with the chelating agent component of the composition. Preferably, the metal ion is present in the composition, at point of use, at a concentration in the range of about 5 to about 1000 ppm, e.g., about 10 to about 500 ppm.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Preferred chelating agents comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of malonic acid; methylmalonic acid; ethylmalonic acid; phenylmalonic acid; and hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid; salts of any of the foregoing; or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Preferably, the chelating agent is present in the CMP compositions in an amount in the range of about 10 to about 4000 ppm, e.g., about 50 to about 2000 ppm. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of metal ion-to-chelating agent is in the range of about 0.5:1 to about 2:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Oxidizing agents suitable for use in the CMP compositions and methods of the present invention include, without limitation, hydrogen peroxide, persulfate salts (e.g., ammonium monopersulfate; ammonium dipersulfate; potassium monopersulfate; and potassium dipersulfate); periodate salts (e.g., potassium periodate), salts thereof, and a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Hydrogen peroxide is a preferred oxidizing agent. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is present in the composition in an amount of about 0.1 wt % to about 10 wt % (e.g., about 0.5 wt % to about 5 wt %).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The CMP compositions described herein optionally can include one or more amino acids. Preferably, the amino acid is a corrosion inhibitor such as glycine, lysine, and the like, e.g., at a concentration in the range of about 500 ppm to about 3000 ppm.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in the CMP compositions described herein, the polyamino compounds act as a tungsten recess inhibitor and a corrosion inhibitor; the metal ion (e.g., ferric ion) acts as a tungsten removal rate catalyst; the chelating agent acts as a metal ion stabilizer; the amino acid acts as a tungsten corrosion inhibitor; and the particulate silica abrasive acts as a tungsten removal rate booster.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The CMP compositions described herein also, optionally, can include suitable amounts of one or more other additive materials commonly included in CMP compositions, such as viscosity modifying agents, biocides, and the like.</p>

The teiin “component” as used herein includes individual ingredients (e.g., abrasives, chelating auents, acids, bases, oxidizing agents, and the like), as well as any combination of ingredients. For example, an abrasive can be dispersed in water, and the chelating agent and the polyamino compound can be added, and mixed by any method that is capable of incorporating the components into the CMP composition. Typically, an oxidizing agent is not added to the CMP composition until the composition is ready for use in a CMP process, for example, the oxidizing agent can be added just prior to initiation of polishing. The pH can be adjusted at any suitable time.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The CMP compositions used in the methods of the present invention also can be provided as a concentrate, which is intended to be diluted with an appropriate amount of aqueous solvent (e.g., water) prior to use. In such an embodiment, the CMP composition concentrate can include the various components dispersed or dissolved in aqueous solvent in amounts such that, upon dilution of the concentrate with an appropriate amount of aqueous solvent, each component of the polishing composition will be present in the CMP composition in an amount within the appropriate range for use.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The CMP methods of the present invention are particularly suited for use in conjunction with a chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus. Typically, the CMP apparatus comprises a platen, which, when in use, is in motion and has a velocity that results from orbital, linear, and/or circular motion, a polishing pad in contact with the platen and moving relative to the platen when in motion, and a carrier that holds a substrate to be polished by contacting and moving relative to the surface of the polishing pad. The polishing of the substrate takes place by the substrate being placed in contact with the polishing pad and a CMP composition and then moving the polishing pad relative to the substrate, so as to abrade at least a portion of the substrate.</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0043">Representative samples of the tungsten recess depth results from Table 2 are plotted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows the tungsten recess depth obtained by polishing with Composition 6. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows the tungsten recess depth obtained by polishing with Composition 7. The tungsten recess depth obtained by polishing with STAND-A and STAND-B are also included in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> for comparative purposes. Removal rates for Compositions 6 and 7 were in the range of about 600 to about 800 Å/min.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0044">Composition 6 is identical to Composition 7 except that Composition 6 contains pentaethylenehexamine and Composition 7 contains tetraethylenepentamine as the polyamino compound. Composition 6 also contains three times as much abrasive as Composition 7. Even though Composition 6 contains a higher concentration of abrasive, the tungsten recess depth for Composition 6 is less than the recess depth of Composition 7 for each one of the wafers polished. Therefore, the use of a pentaethylenehexamine is advantageous for reduction in tungsten recessing, at least when compared to the use of tetraethylenepentamine.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0045">In all cases, the compositions reduced the size of tungsten recesses that occur upon polishing compared to the comparative examples of Standard A, Standard B, and Standard C.</p>
