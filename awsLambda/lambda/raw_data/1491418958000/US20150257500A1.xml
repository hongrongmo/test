      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present application generally relates to a diaper changing pad or station. More particularly, the present invention relates to a portable, collapsible infant changing pad having a pop-up canopy that also serves as an accessory bag.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Babies and infants in diapers must periodically have their diapers changed. At home, this is not an issue as the parent or caretaker can usually change the baby's diaper on a dedicated changing table. Otherwise, the infant's diaper can be changed on a bed, a carpeted floor, or the like. These situations provide a safe environment for the infant's diaper to be changed, and is relatively private as either only the parent or caretaker is changing the diaper, with perhaps immediate family members in the area.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">However, when traveling outside of the house the infant's diaper must be changed in public. The parent must place the infant on a bathroom counter, a hinged changing table sometimes found in bathrooms, a bench, or even the ground. The hinged infant changing tables in bathrooms are notoriously unstable. Laying the infant on the elevated surface is dangerous since the child can easily roll or slip and fall, resulting in serious injury.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There are instances where a bathroom or bench is not readily available, such as when at a park, camping or hiking. In such cases, when changing the diaper the infant is often placed on the grass or ground. This is both unsanitary and uncomfortable for the infant.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Furthermore, a parent often wishes to conceal the infant from public view when the infant's diaper is changed. Those passing by may not want to view a soiled diaper as it is being changed, and the parent or caretaker may be very self-conscious of this. The parent or caretaker may want to have privacy for the infant as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Portable diaper changing pads are well known. Such changing pads are typically of a size so as to at least partially place the infant thereon and have an upper surface material which can easily be cleaned in the event it becomes soiled while changing the infant.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, these changing pads, while portable, have various drawbacks. The changing pad may have insufficient padding so as to keep the baby or infant comfortable on the ground or other hard surface while the infant's diaper is changed. Moreover, many of these changing pads are of a size so as to only fit under a portion of the infant, the infant's feet and/or upper torso and head at times extending to the underlying supporting surface, which may be a hard counter, the grass, or even dirt. Furthermore, such conventional changing pads do not include any means for providing privacy to the infant and parent while the diaper is changed, or otherwise protect the infant from the sun, wind, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In the case of portable diaper changing pads, the parent or caretaker of the infant must also have a supply of diapers, wipes, ointment and the like. This requires that the parent or caretaker have a bag, in addition to the diaper changing pad, for carrying such diaper changing accessory items. However, such diaper bags are typically large and bulky as they are often sized and configured to carry many other items, such as a baby's blanket, toys, bottles, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a diaper changing pad which provides a clean, comfortable place to place the infant on so that the infant can sleep or have his or her diaper changed. There is also a continuing need to have such a diaper changing pad which provides privacy and conceals the baby from public view when changing the baby's diaper, and protects the baby from harmful UV rays or the wind while the infant's diaper is being changed. There is also a continuing need to provide such an infant diaper changing pad which is both collapsible so as to be readily stored and transported. There is also a continuing need to provide such an infant diaper changing pad which is collapsible into an accessory bag which can easily be carried and transported and which is configured to hold the accessories necessary for changing a baby's diaper. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention resides in an accessory bag which can be unfolded to create a diaper changing station having a pop-up canopy. The invention generally comprises a casing comprising at least one flexible sheet of material configured to be folded into an accessory bag and unfolded into a diaper changing station base. A canopy is attached to the casing and an arm of the frame assembly. The canopy and the arm are selectively movable between a collapsed position adjacent to the base and an extended position away from the base to form an open-ended tent structure at a first end of the base.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The frame assembly comprises a hinge between the arm and a first base frame. A locking mechanism locks the arm in a collapsed or extended position. The locking mechanism may comprise a push-button locking mechanism and hinge assembly. The first base frame comprises generally parallel rods attached to or disposed within the base. A cross-member may extend between the parallel rods. The frame assembly may include a second base frame, separate from the first base frame, attached to or disposed within the base. The second base frame comprises generally parallel rods and may include a cross-member extending between the rods.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The canopy comprises first and second side walls and a rear wall, each having an edge thereof attached to the base. A window may be formed in at least one of the canopy first wall, second wall or rear wall. The window may be comprised of a mesh material.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">A padded diaper changing pad is disposed under the canopy. The changing pad may be removable from the open-ended tent structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">A pocket is formed in, or attached to, the base or canopy. The pocket may be formed in or attached to an inner surface of a flap portion of a second end of the base. The pocket may include a closure for selectively closing and opening the pocket.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Fasteners may be attached to the flap portion of the base and a corresponding portion of the casing for selectively fastening the flap portion to the casing when the casing is folded into the accessory bag. A carry strap may be attached to the casing, so as to enable the user to easily carry and transport the folded accessory bag.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As shown in the accompanying drawings, for purposes of illustration, the present invention relates to an apparatus, generally referred to by the reference number <b>10</b>, which is a combination accessory bag and diaper changing station. As will be more fully explained herein, the apparatus, when in the folded accessory bag configuration is capable of being easily transported and stored. However, when unfolded into the diaper changing station, a pop-up canopy provides privacy as well as protection from outdoor elements, such as the sun and wind, to the infant having his or her diaper changed.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">With reference now to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> is shown in its folded, accessory bag configuration. An outer surface <b>12</b> of a casing <b>14</b> is generally visible in such a folded, accessory bag configuration. The casing <b>14</b> is comprised of at least one flexible sheet of material which is configured to be folded into an accessory bag, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and unfolded into a diaper changing station base, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The casing <b>14</b> may be comprised of multiple flexible sheets of material, such as a sheet of material <b>12</b> which forms an outer surface of the folded accessory bag, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and which is placed on the ground or other supporting surface, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The outer surface sheet of material <b>12</b> may be comprised of any suitable material. However, it is contemplated by the invention that the outer or bottom surface <b>12</b> be comprised of a material which is sufficiently rugged so as to be placed on varying supporting surfaces, including carpet, counters, glass, or even dirt and rock. However, the material may be of a nature and design so as to be aesthetically pleasant when folded into the accessory bag configuration, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, as well as being comfortable to the user carrying the apparatus <b>10</b> when folded into the accessory bag. For example, the outer surface or sheet of material <b>12</b> may comprise polyester with patterned rubber grip to prevent slippage or a canvas material, either of which would meet the objectives discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">With reference now to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an inner surface <b>16</b> of the casing <b>14</b> may also be comprised of any suitable material. While the material of the outer and inner surfaces <b>12</b> and <b>16</b> may be comprised of the same type of material, or even the same sheet of material, they may also be different from one another. For example, the inner or upper surface sheet of material <b>16</b> may be comprised of a patterned, quilted polyester or the like. It is contemplated by the present invention that the upper surface material <b>16</b> be of a type which is fluid-resistant or impermeable and easily cleaned. Preferably, the inner or upper surface material <b>16</b> is comprised of a material which is not uncomfortable or damaging to skin as it is possible that the infant will come into contact with the upper surface <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">With reference again to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> may include one or more handles <b>18</b> or carrying straps <b>20</b> for facilitating carrying and transporting the apparatus <b>10</b> in the accessory bag, folded configuration. The handle <b>18</b> and/or carrying strap <b>20</b> may be attached to the outer surface or sheet of material <b>12</b> of the casing <b>14</b>, as is illustrated with the case of the handle <b>18</b> being attached directly to the outer surface <b>12</b> of the casing <b>14</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the handle <b>18</b> and/or the carrying strap <b>20</b> may be removably attached to the apparatus <b>10</b>, such as by the means of clips <b>22</b> which are attachable to loops, rings, or the like <b>24</b> attached to or extending from the casing <b>14</b>. The carrying strap <b>20</b> may be of sufficient length so as to comprise a shoulder carry strap, and which may be adjustable in length so as to be of a proper length for a particular user. It is also contemplated that the apparatus <b>10</b> have more than one carrying strap or a strap configuration which would enable it to be carried as a backpack. However, in a particularly preferred embodiment, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the folded apparatus <b>10</b> in the accessory bag configuration is in the form of a messenger bag or the like having a shoulder carry strap <b>20</b> attached thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">With reference now to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in order to convert the apparatus <b>10</b> from an accessory bag configuration to a diaper changing station configuration, a flap portion <b>26</b> of the apparatus <b>10</b> is unfolded or otherwise lifted away from the folded accessory bag, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The flap may include fasteners <b>28</b> which removably attach to a corresponding fastener <b>30</b> so as to retain the flap <b>26</b> in a folded state against the casing <b>14</b> when in the accessory bag configuration, until it is desired that the flap <b>26</b> be opened, such as to remove items from the accessory bag or to unfold the apparatus <b>10</b> into a diaper changing station. The fasteners <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> may be comprised of a variety of different fasteners as is known in the art, such as friction snaps, magnetic snaps, hook and loop tape, etc. Such fasteners <b>28</b> may be formed on at least an inner surface of the flap <b>26</b> and an outer surface of a corresponding portion of the casing <b>14</b> so as to be engageable with one another when the apparatus <b>10</b> is folded into the accessory bag configuration, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">With reference now to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in order to convert the apparatus into a diaper changing station, as described above, the flap portion <b>26</b> is unfolded outwardly. The casing <b>14</b> is then unfolded completely until a generally horizontal and flat base is achieved, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, this comprises the further step of unfolding a portion <b>32</b> of the casing or base away from the flap portion <b>26</b> so as to expose an intermediate portion <b>34</b> of the casing or base, over which the first end portion <b>32</b> and the flap portion <b>26</b> were folded over.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">When the casing <b>14</b> is unfolded, it may have visual and/or physical fold lines or breaks or variations so as to facilitate unfolding and folding, such that the user may intuitively know to fold the casing or base <b>14</b> at such fold lines or areas. The apparatus <b>10</b> may include a frame assembly at least partially disposed within the casing, which is shown by the dashed lines in <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>. The frame assembly gives structure and stability to the apparatus <b>10</b> and facilitates the folding and unfolding of the apparatus <b>10</b> and the raising and lowering of a canopy thereof, as will be more fully described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">An exemplary frame assembly <b>36</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The frame assembly <b>36</b> includes an arm <b>38</b> which is selectively moveable from an upright position, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, and a collapsed position, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. A first base frame <b>40</b> is disposed within or otherwise attached to the first end portion of the base or casing <b>32</b>. The arm <b>38</b> is pivotally connected or associated with the first base frame <b>40</b>. The first base frame <b>40</b> comprises generally parallel rods attached to or disposed within the first portion of the base or casing <b>32</b>. The rods <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> extend to hinge members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, which are also attached to arm <b>38</b>, and allow the arm <b>38</b> to be pivotally moved upwardly and downwardly. A crossbar <b>50</b> may extend between the rods <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, or the hinge members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> attached to the rods <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">With continuing reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in order to provide structure and stability to the apparatus <b>10</b>, and facilitate folding and unfolding of the apparatus <b>10</b>, a second base frame <b>52</b> is provided which is separate from the first base frame <b>40</b> and attached to or disposed within the base or casing <b>14</b>, typically in the intermediate section <b>34</b> thereof. The second base frame <b>52</b> also comprises generally parallel rods <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> disposed in or otherwise attached to generally an outer edge of the base or casing <b>14</b>. A cross member <b>58</b> may extend between the rods <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. The rods <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> may be interconnected to one another, or formed integrally to form a unitary generally U-shaped member, as illustrated.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The frame assembly <b>36</b> is preferably comprised of one or more materials which are lightweight and provide sufficient rigidity. As such, the arm <b>38</b>, the first base frame <b>40</b> and second base frame <b>52</b> may be comprised of metal, such as aluminum, fiber pole, plastic or the like. The members comprising the arm <b>38</b>, first base frame <b>40</b> and second base frame <b>52</b> may be tubular or solid, and are typically only a fraction of an inch, to provide the necessary stability structure and rigidity while being lightweight. It will be appreciated that the number and configuration and size of the internal frame members and the materials that the internal frame members are comprised of may be varied as needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">With reference now to <figref>FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, an open-ended canopy <b>60</b> is attached to both the arm <b>38</b> of the frame assembly <b>36</b> and at least a portion of the base or casing <b>14</b>. The canopy <b>60</b> is generally comprised of first and second side walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> and a rear wall <b>66</b> all of which have a lower edge which is connected to the base or casing <b>14</b>. This may be, for example, by means of stitching, adhesive, or other suitable manufacturing processes to attach a lower edge of the canopy <b>60</b> to the base or casing <b>14</b>. The canopy <b>60</b> is comprised of any suitable fabric material which enables it to be selectively collapsed and extended upwardly to form the open-ended tent structure as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. For example, a nylon material, such as that used in the manufacture of tents, can be used. Preferably, the material or fabric is of a type that provides a degree of privacy. The material or fabric of the canopy <b>60</b> may also provide for UV and sun and wind protection.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The canopy <b>60</b> may also be provided with one or more windows <b>68</b> formed therein to enable light to enter into the open-ended tent structure of the opened canopy <b>60</b>. Such one or more windows <b>68</b> also enable the infant to view outside of the extended canopy <b>60</b>. The one or more windows <b>68</b> may be comprised of a transparent or translucent material to achieve such purposes. Alternatively, the one or more windows <b>68</b> may be comprised of a mesh material, which would also facilitate air flow through the opened canopy structure <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">With reference again to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, after the apparatus <b>10</b> has been unfolded, as shown, the canopy <b>60</b> is raised. This may be done, for example, by grasping arm <b>38</b> or the portion of the canopy <b>60</b> attached to the arm <b>38</b> and manually lifting the arm, and thus the canopy <b>60</b> into an upright position away from the base or casing <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The canopy <b>60</b> is raised to a height sufficient so as to enable the infant to be placed within the open-ended tent structure of the canopy <b>60</b>. This could be, for example, between one and two feet in height in the uppermost extended position.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one embodiment of the apparatus <b>10</b>, as illustrated, when the canopy arm <b>38</b> is lifted to an uppermost position, it will automatically lock into place, thus requiring unlocking in order to be lowered and collapsed. Although both hinge members <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> can comprise dual hinge and locking mechanisms, in a particularly preferred embodiment only one of the hinge members <b>46</b> or <b>48</b> comprises a locking mechanism so as to allow for single-handed operation of the apparatus <b>10</b>. It is anticipated that the user will also be holding an infant while using the apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention. This provides convenience and ease of use as the user must only lock and unlock a single hinge. The locking mechanism of hinge <b>46</b> or <b>48</b> may be a push-button or other easy latch release.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">With reference now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, hinge member <b>48</b> is illustrated, which comprises both a push-button locking mechanism and hinge assembly. The assembly <b>48</b> includes a housing <b>70</b> in which is disposed a spring <b>72</b> and from which extends a push-button actuator member <b>74</b>. The push-button actuator member includes an aperture or slot <b>76</b> for receiving a portion of the first base frame assembly <b>40</b>, such as rod <b>44</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. A generally L-shaped aperture or groove <b>78</b> receives an end of the canopy arm <b>38</b> therein. This aperture <b>78</b> has a vertical slot portion <b>80</b> and a generally horizontal slot portion <b>82</b>. When in the collapsed position, the arm <b>38</b> rests within the generally vertical slot portion <b>80</b> of the aperture <b>78</b>. However, when the arm <b>38</b> is raised, it is allowed to slide into the horizontal slot area <b>82</b>, which enables the compression of spring <b>72</b>, which is illustrated as a coil spring, to push the push-button actuator member <b>74</b> outwardly and lock the arm <b>38</b> in place. In this manner, the arm <b>38</b> and canopy <b>60</b> will remain locked in an upright position until selectively unlocked and moved into the collapsed position, so as to prevent the arm <b>38</b> and canopy from inadvertently collapsing and falling upon the infant while the infant is within the open-ended tent structure of the expanded canopy <b>60</b>. In order to unlock the mechanism, the push-button actuator member <b>74</b> is pushed inwardly until the arm <b>38</b> is moved into slot <b>80</b> of aperture <b>78</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">While an exemplary hinge and locking mechanism assembly <b>48</b> has been described and illustrated, it will be appreciated that other hinge and locking mechanisms could be used to accomplish the needs of the invention. For example, it is contemplated by the present invention that the locking and non-locking hinges <b>48</b> and <b>46</b> be substituted with spring-loaded elbow joints, allowing for a hands-free lift. In this case, as the apparatus <b>10</b> is unfolded, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the canopy arm <b>38</b> would automatically raise. When collapsing, the user would merely need to apply downward pressure on the canopy arm <b>38</b> to push it towards the base or casing <b>14</b>, and then fold the casing, in the reverse manner as discussed above, into the accessory bag configuration, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">One or more pockets <b>84</b> are formed in the apparatus <b>10</b> which can be used to store diaper changing accessories, such as wet wipes, diapers, ointment and the like. Such pockets <b>84</b> could be formed in or onto the canopy structure <b>60</b> or the casing or base <b>14</b>. In a particularly preferred embodiment, pockets <b>84</b> are formed on an inner surface of the flap portion <b>26</b> of the casing or base. These pockets <b>84</b> are of a sufficient size so as to hold the necessary items to change the infant's diaper, such as a diaper, wet wipes, and the like. Although two pockets <b>84</b> are illustrated formed on the inner surface of flap portion <b>26</b>, it will be understood that only a single pocket <b>84</b> may be formed, or more than two pockets formed on the flap portion <b>26</b>, or even other areas of the apparatus <b>10</b>. Preferably, the one or more pockets <b>84</b> include a closure <b>86</b>, such as the illustrated zipper.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">While the one or more pockets <b>84</b> may be formed in or on any portion of the apparatus <b>10</b>, it has been found to be particularly advantageous to form or attach the pockets <b>84</b> to the inner surface of the flap portion <b>26</b>. This provides the convenience of accessing the items within the one or more pockets <b>84</b> when the apparatus <b>10</b> is folded into the accessory bag, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, by merely unfastening and lifting flap <b>26</b> to gain access to the one or more pockets <b>84</b> and the contents therein. Moreover, when the apparatus is unfolded and arranged into the diaper changing station configuration, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, the one or more pockets <b>84</b> are close to the parent or caregiver who is changing the infant's diaper, and thus the supplies are readily available in a convenient location. Furthermore, the contents of the pockets <b>84</b> are disposed away from the first end of the base or casing where the infant's head and hands and arms are, reducing the possibility that the infant would undesirably grab items from the pockets <b>84</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The casing or base <b>14</b> may be sufficiently padded, at least under the portion of the canopy <b>60</b> where the infant is to be placed, so as to provide cushion and comfort to the infant while lying thereon. Alternatively, or in addition to, a changing pad <b>88</b> is formed in the intermediate <b>34</b> and first end <b>32</b> portions of the apparatus <b>10</b> where the infant is to be placed. The changing pad <b>88</b> may be advantageously removable from under the canopy <b>60</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, such that the changing pad <b>88</b> may be more easily cleaned. Preferably, at least one surface of the changing pad <b>88</b> is comprised of a material which can be easily cleaned and which is water resistant or impermeable. The changing pad <b>88</b> may also be comprised of a sheet of material which is sufficiently thick so as to be cushioned or have a foam cushion disposed within one or more sheets of material to form the changing pad.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">With reference now to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, it is contemplated by the present invention that a decorative element or distraction device <b>90</b>, such as a musical mobile or toy, be attachable or otherwise extend downwardly within the canopy <b>60</b>, such as downwardly from the canopy arm <b>38</b>. The mobile or distraction element <b>90</b> would provide the infant something of interest and distract the infant and garner its attention while the parent is changing the infant's diaper. Alternatively, if the infant is placed within the tent-like structure of the canopy <b>60</b> in order to rest, sleep, etc. such device <b>90</b> could be useful in entertaining the infant or helping the infant to fall asleep. Such a distraction device <b>90</b> may be permanently affixed to the canopy <b>60</b> or canopy arm <b>38</b>, or may be selectively attached thereto such as after the canopy <b>60</b> is lifted. Such may be done, for example, by means of a clip and loop arrangement or other releasable connection means.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">It will be appreciated that the apparatus <b>10</b> of the present invention can be of varying sizes as determined to meet the needs of the user. However, the apparatus <b>10</b> is of such a size so that when fully collapsed and in a closed state of the accessory bag, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> is of a sufficiently small size so as to be carried easily. However, the apparatus <b>10</b> must be of a sufficiently large size so as to function as a diaper changing station and support an infant within the raised canopy <b>60</b>. By way of example, the apparatus <b>10</b> may be approximately eighteen inches in width and approximately thirty inches to forty-five inches in length when fully unfolded. As can be seen in <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, the side walls <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> of the canopy <b>60</b> extend substantially the length of the first end <b>32</b> and intermediate <b>34</b> sections, and the rear wall <b>66</b> of the canopy <b>60</b> extends substantially the width of the casing or base of the apparatus <b>10</b>. This creates a canopy of sufficient size so as to substantially, if not entirely, encompass the infant therein, while providing sufficient access to the infant through the open-ended tent structure which the canopy <b>60</b> forms, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, when the canopy is erected.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In order to reconfigure the apparatus <b>10</b> from the diaper changing station, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, to the accessory bag configuration as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the canopy arm <b>38</b> is lowered towards the base or casing <b>14</b>. This may require the unlocking of locking mechanism <b>48</b>, such as by pushing push-button actuator member <b>74</b> and physically lowering the arm <b>38</b>, causing the canopy <b>60</b> to fold and collapse upon the base. The first end portion of the base or casing <b>32</b> is then folded upon the intermediate segment <b>34</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The flap portion <b>26</b> is then folded over the first end portion and stacked intermediate portion <b>34</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The flap portion <b>26</b> may be releasably fastened in place, as described above. The apparatus <b>10</b> can then be easily carried by means of the handle <b>18</b>, shoulder carry strap <b>20</b>, or other strap arrangement.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the appended claims.</p>
