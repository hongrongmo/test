      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The subject matter of the present disclosure relates generally to methods and systems for monitoring the cooktop of an oven range appliance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Over-the-range microwave appliances are generally mounted above a cooktop of an oven range appliance. Conventionally, cooktop appliances have been largely dependent upon a user monitoring the cooktop during use to determine, e.g., whether a pot of water is boiling or if a spill-over has occurred. There may be times, however, when a user may not be able to monitor the cooktop during use. Accordingly, a sensor may be contained in a sensor housing mounted over the range, e.g., on an over-the-range microwave appliance to monitor the cooktop positioned beneath the sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, a sensor mounted above the cooktop could become contaminated by, e.g., grease and moisture generated during use of the cooktop, which could impede the ability of the sensor to sense the cooktop. Thus, the sensor should be kept free from contamination by protection of the sensor lens.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In addition to providing for heating of food and beverage items, certain over-the-range microwave appliances include an air circulation system. When activated, the circulation system can draw fumes, smoke, grease, and/or steam away from the cooktop of the oven range appliance. Circulation systems generally include a fan for drawing a flow of air into the circulation system and a pathway for the flow of air. Additional fans or other elements may work with the circulation system to enhance the flow of air through the pathway or other components, such as the sensor housing. Therefore, the microwave appliance may provide a flow of air for keeping the sensor free from contamination.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, a system for sensing a cooktop positioned beneath the system would be useful. In particular, such a system with features for keeping the sensor free from contamination would be advantageous. A system incorporated into an appliance, such as e.g., microwave appliance, would be useful.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention provides an appliance with a sensor directed toward a cooking surface positioned beneath the sensor. One or more features are provided for directing a flow of air across the sensing end of the sensor to protect or shield it during cooking operations. Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a first exemplary embodiment, the appliance includes a cooling air system and a sensor system. The cooling air system includes a pathway for a flow of air for cooling that has an air inlet and an air outlet. The cooling system also includes a cooling fan configured to cause air to flow along the pathway from the air inlet to the air outlet. The sensor system is supported by the appliance and includes an outer housing defining a chamber that is in fluid communication with the pathway. An inner housing is positioned in the chamber. The inner housing and the outer housing define a channel therebetween for a flow of air. The channel has a channel inlet and a channel outlet, and the channel inlet is positioned downstream of the cooling fan and is in fluid communication with the pathway to receive air flow from the cooling fan. The inner housing also defines a sensor aperture. A sensor is positioned in the inner housing, and the sensor has a sensing end positioned at the sensor aperture such that air flowing from the channel outlet flows past the sensing end of the sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In a second exemplary embodiment, the appliance includes a cooling air system and a sensor system. The cooling air system includes a pathway for a flow of air for cooling that has an air inlet and an air outlet. The sensor system is supported by the appliance and includes an outer housing defining a chamber that is in fluid communication with the pathway. An inner housing is positioned in the chamber. The inner housing and the outer housing define a channel therebetween for a flow of air. The channel has a channel inlet and a channel outlet, and the channel inlet is in fluid communication with the pathway. The inner housing also defines a sensor aperture. A sensor is positioned in the inner housing, and the sensor has a sensing end positioned at the sensor aperture such that air flowing from the channel outlet flows past the sensing end of the sensor. The sensor system also includes a sensor fan positioned within the chamber adjacent the channel inlet, and the sensor fan is configured for creating a flow of air through the channel.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In a third exemplary embodiment, the appliance includes a cooling air system and a sensor system. The cooling air system includes a pathway for a flow of air for cooling that has an air inlet and an air outlet. The cooling system also includes a cooling fan configured to cause air to flow along the pathway from the air inlet to the air outlet. The sensor system is supported by the appliance and includes an outer housing defining a chamber that is in fluid communication with the pathway. A rotatable housing is positioned within the chamber and is in fluid communication with the chamber. The rotatable housing is also rotatable with respect to the outer housing. An inner housing is positioned within the rotatable housing. The inner housing and the rotatable housing define a channel therebetween for a flow of air. The channel has a channel inlet and a channel outlet, and the channel inlet is positioned downstream of the cooling fan and is in fluid communication with the pathway to receive air flow from the cooling fan. The inner housing also defines a sensor aperture. A sensor is positioned in the inner housing, and the sensor has a sensing end positioned at the sensor aperture such that air flowing from the channel outlet flows past the sensing end of the sensor.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Upper set of kitchen cabinets <b>14</b> is positioned above a base set of kitchen cabinets <b>16</b>, e.g., along the vertical direction V. Base set of kitchen cabinets <b>16</b> includes countertops <b>18</b> and drawers <b>17</b>. Oven range appliance <b>12</b> is received within base set of kitchen cabinets <b>16</b> below microwave appliance <b>10</b>. In particular, a cooking surface <b>30</b> of oven range appliance <b>12</b> is positioned, e.g., directly, below microwave appliance <b>10</b> along the vertical direction V. Microwave appliance <b>10</b> can include features such as an air handler or fan <b>52</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) that can draw cooking vapors and/or smoke away from cooking surface <b>30</b> and out of the kitchen containing microwave and oven range appliances <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Microwave appliance <b>10</b> is configured for receipt of food items for cooking In particular, microwave appliance <b>10</b> includes a cabinet or casing <b>20</b> and a door <b>22</b> that permits selective access to an interior of microwave appliance <b>10</b> and casing <b>20</b>.

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> provides a side, section view of microwave appliance <b>10</b> and oven range appliance <b>12</b>. As illustrated, casing <b>20</b> extends between a top portion <b>42</b> and a bottom portion <b>44</b>, e.g., along the vertical direction V. Thus, top and bottom portions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> of casing <b>20</b> are spaced apart from each other, e.g., along the vertical direction V. Casing <b>20</b> defines a cooking chamber <b>40</b> configured for receipt of food items for cooking Door <b>22</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> permits selective access to cooking chamber <b>40</b> of casing <b>20</b>. In particular, door <b>22</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> is selectively adjustable between an open position (not shown) and a closed position (<figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). In the closed position, door <b>22</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> hinders access to cooking chamber <b>40</b> of casing <b>20</b>. Conversely, door <b>22</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> permits access to cooking chamber <b>40</b> of casing <b>20</b> in the open position. A user can pull on handle <b>24</b> of door <b>22</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> in order to shift door <b>22</b> from the closed position shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> to the open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Casing <b>20</b> also defines a cooling air pathway or conduit <b>46</b>. Pathway <b>46</b> has an inlet <b>48</b> and an outlet <b>50</b>. Pathway <b>46</b> extends between inlet <b>48</b> and outlet <b>50</b>. Inlet <b>48</b> of pathway <b>46</b> is positioned at or adjacent bottom portion <b>44</b> of casing <b>20</b>, e.g., such that inlet <b>48</b> of pathway <b>46</b> faces cooking surface <b>30</b> of oven range appliance <b>12</b>. Conversely, outlet <b>50</b> of pathway <b>46</b> is positioned at or adjacent top portion <b>42</b> of casing <b>20</b>, e.g., such that outlet <b>50</b> of pathway <b>46</b> faces away from cooking surface <b>30</b> of oven range appliance <b>12</b>. Outlet <b>50</b> could face in other direction as well, although preferably not toward cooking surface <b>30</b>. Thus, inlet <b>48</b> and outlet <b>50</b> of pathway <b>46</b> are spaced apart from each other, e.g., along the vertical direction V.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Microwave appliance <b>10</b> also includes a cooling fan <b>52</b>, such as an axial fan or a radial fan. Fan <b>52</b> is positioned within or adjacent pathway <b>46</b>. Fan <b>52</b> draws or urges a flow of air (shown with arrows F) through pathway <b>46</b> when fan <b>52</b> is in an activated state. Conversely, fan <b>52</b> does not draw or urge flow of air F through pathway <b>46</b> when fan <b>52</b> is in a deactivated state. When fan <b>52</b> is in the activated state, flow of air F enters pathway <b>46</b> at or through inlet <b>48</b> of pathway <b>46</b>. Flow of air F is directed through pathway <b>46</b> to outlet <b>50</b>, and flow of air F can exit pathway <b>46</b> at outlet <b>50</b> of pathway <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, microwave appliance <b>10</b> may further include a controller <b>56</b>. Operation of microwave appliance <b>10</b> may be regulated by controller <b>56</b>. Controller <b>56</b> is operatively coupled or in communication with various components of microwave appliance <b>10</b>, including controls <b>26</b>. In response to user manipulation of controls <b>26</b>, controller <b>56</b> operates the various components of microwave appliance <b>10</b> to execute selected cycles and features.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Controller <b>56</b> may include a memory and microprocessor, such as a general or special purpose microprocessor operable to execute programming instructions or micro-control code associated with a cleaning cycle. The memory may represent random access memory such as DRAM, or read only memory such as ROM or FLASH. In one embodiment, the processor executes programming instructions stored in memory. The memory may be a separate component from the processor or may be included onboard within the processor. Alternatively, controller <b>56</b> may be constructed without using a microprocessor, e.g., using a combination of discrete analog and/or digital logic circuitry (such as switches, amplifiers, integrators, comparators, flip-flops, AND gates, and the like) to perform control functionality instead of relying upon software. Controls <b>26</b> and other components of microwave appliance <b>10</b> may be in communication with controller <b>56</b> via one or more signal lines or shared communication busses.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Controller <b>56</b> may also be in operative communication with cooling air fan <b>52</b>. Thus, controller <b>56</b> can selectively adjust cooling fan <b>52</b> between the activated and deactivated states to regulate the flow of air F through pathway <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Additionally, microwave appliance <b>10</b> may support a sensor system <b>60</b> such that cooking surface <b>30</b> is positioned beneath sensor system <b>60</b>. Sensor system <b>60</b> includes a sensor <b>62</b> for monitoring cooking surface <b>30</b> and any cooking utensils containing food items for cooking, such as, e.g., cooking utensil <b>28</b>, on cooking surface <b>30</b>. More particularly, sensor <b>62</b> is configured, e.g., to detect whether a cooking utensil is present on cooking surface <b>30</b> and, if so, to provide a signal indicative of the same to controller <b>56</b>. Sensor <b>62</b> may also be equipped with other features such as, e.g., the ability to determine (and provide a signal indicative of) the temperature of the cooktop, a utensil placed on the cooktop, and/or food present on the cooktop. Sensor <b>62</b> may be an optical sensor or any other sensor suitable for monitoring cooking surface <b>30</b>. Further, sensor <b>62</b> may be in operative communication with controller <b>56</b>, which may output an indicator signal to, e.g., a controls display <b>58</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b> or another suitable source to alert a user to the status of cooking surface <b>30</b> or food items within cooking utensils <b>28</b> on cooking surface <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, sensor system <b>60</b> is in fluid communication with pathway <b>46</b>. More particularly, air flowing through pathway <b>46</b> also causes air to flow through sensor system <b>60</b> as will be further described.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">It should be understood that, in alternative embodiments, sensor system <b>60</b> could be positioned at other locations on microwave appliance <b>10</b> or could be supported by any other suitable appliance or surface, such as, e.g., a range hood or upper cabinets <b>14</b>. As an example, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, microwave appliance <b>10</b> includes a microwave fan <b>51</b> that creates a flow of air F through the controls compartment <b>57</b>, in which controller <b>56</b> is positioned. More particularly, microwave fan <b>51</b> draws air through inlet <b>48</b> and past controller <b>56</b>, magnetron <b>120</b>, and power supply <b>122</b>. Additionally, an exhaust fan <b>53</b> draws or urges air flow F to exit controls compartment <b>57</b> through outlet <b>50</b>. Sensor system <b>60</b> is in fluid communication with controls compartment <b>57</b> such that air flowing through controls compartment <b>57</b> also causes air to flow through sensor system <b>60</b> as will be described. Other configurations of microwave appliance <b>10</b> and sensor system <b>60</b> may also be used, or sensor system <b>60</b> could be supported by any other suitable appliance or surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, sensor <b>62</b> of sensor system <b>60</b> is contained within an inner housing <b>68</b> that is positioned within an outer housing <b>64</b>. Outer housing <b>64</b> defines a chamber <b>66</b> that is in fluid communication with pathway <b>46</b> Inner housing <b>68</b> is positioned within chamber <b>66</b> such that inner housing <b>68</b> and outer housing <b>64</b> define a channel <b>70</b> for a flow of air F. Moreover, the inner housing defines a sensor aperture <b>76</b>, and the sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b> is positioned at the sensor aperture <b>76</b>. Sensor aperture <b>76</b> may be open or may have a protective covering such as, e.g., a glass lens.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The channel <b>70</b> has a channel inlet <b>72</b> positioned downstream of cooling fan <b>52</b> and in fluid communication with chamber <b>66</b> to receive a flow of air F from pathway <b>46</b>. Further, channel <b>70</b> has a channel outlet <b>74</b> from which the flow of air F flows past the sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b>. The flow of air F acts to protect the sensing end <b>78</b> by blowing away, e.g., moisture, grease, or other contaminants generated during use of the cooking surface <b>30</b> that might otherwise block or impede the proper operation of sensor <b>62</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, channel <b>70</b> may be defined by an angled inner portion <b>82</b> of inner housing <b>68</b> and an angled outer portion <b>84</b> of outer housing <b>64</b>. Angled inner portion <b>82</b> is positioned at an angle Î± with respect to the vertical direction and angled outer portion <b>84</b> is positioned at an angle Î² with respect to the vertical direction. Angled inner portion <b>82</b> and angled outer portion <b>84</b> direct the flow of air F past the sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b> to keep the sensing end <b>78</b> free from contamination. In one exemplary embodiment, angles Î± and Î² are in a range of about 30 to about 60 degrees. In still another embodiment, angles Î± and Î² are about 45 degrees. Other values for angles Î± and Î² may be used as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in certain embodiments of the invention, a sensor fan <b>80</b> is positioned within chamber <b>66</b> of outer housing <b>68</b> adjacent channel inlet <b>72</b>. Sensor fan <b>80</b> may be used in addition to fan <b>52</b> to create air flow F or may be used instead of fan <b>52</b> to create air flow F. The sensor fan <b>80</b> is in operative communication with controller <b>56</b> and is configured to create a flow of air F through channel <b>70</b> and past sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b> to keep the sensing end <b>78</b> free from contamination. Sensor fan <b>80</b> may be used in addition to an air flow created by fan <b>52</b> or may be used separately from the operation of fan <b>52</b>. Alternatively, where sensor system <b>60</b> is not mounted onto another appliance such a microwave <b>10</b> having a fan for air flow, sensor fan <b>80</b> can be used to provide the proper air flow F.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, which uses the same reference numerals to denote the same or similar features, in another exemplary embodiment of the invention, the sensor system <b>60</b> includes a rotatable housing <b>86</b> positioned within chamber <b>66</b> of outer housing <b>64</b>. In this embodiment, inner housing <b>68</b> is positioned within rotatable housing <b>86</b>. Rotatable housing <b>86</b> is manually rotatable such that a user of the microwave appliance <b>10</b> may position the sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b> in a desired position.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Further, rotatable housing <b>86</b> and inner housing <b>68</b> define channel <b>70</b> for the flow of air F. Channel inlet <b>72</b> of channel <b>70</b> is positioned downstream of cooling fan <b>52</b> to receive a flow of air F from pathway <b>46</b> such that air flows out of channel outlet <b>74</b> and past sensing end <b>78</b>. In yet another embodiment, sensor system <b>60</b> includes a sensor fan <b>80</b> in operative communication with controller <b>56</b> and positioned in chamber <b>66</b> adjacent channel inlet <b>72</b> to create a flow of air F through channel <b>70</b> and past sensing end <b>78</b>. Sensor fan <b>80</b> may be used in addition to an air flow created by fan <b>52</b> or may be used separately from the operation of fan <b>52</b>. Alternatively, where sensor system <b>60</b> is not mounted onto another appliance such a microwave <b>10</b> having a fan for air flow, sensor fan <b>80</b> can be used to provide the proper air flow F.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, which uses the same reference numerals to denote the same or similar features, in still other exemplary embodiments of the invention, the sensor system <b>60</b> may be angled with respect to the microwave appliance. More particularly, outer housing <b>64</b> is positioned at a non-orthogonal angle Î¸ with respect to the lower portion <b>44</b> of microwave appliance <b>10</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, angle Î¸ is in a range of about 30 to about 60 degrees. In still another embodiment, angle Î¸ is about 45 degrees. Other values for angle Î¸ may be used as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Further, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, inner housing <b>68</b> is positioned within chamber <b>66</b> of outer housing <b>64</b> such that inner housing <b>68</b> and outer housing <b>64</b> define channel <b>70</b> to direct a flow of air F past the sensing end <b>78</b> of sensor <b>62</b>. Channel <b>70</b> includes channel inlet <b>72</b> positioned downstream from cooling fan <b>52</b> to receive a flow of air from pathway <b>46</b>. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, sensor fan <b>80</b> may be in operative communication with controller <b>56</b> and may be positioned within chamber <b>66</b> adjacent channel inlet <b>72</b> to provide a flow of air F through channel <b>70</b> and past sensing end <b>78</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the present disclosure is further directed to methods for operating sensor <b>62</b>. A method may include, for example, the step <b>100</b> of activating sensor <b>62</b> with controller <b>56</b>, and the step <b>102</b> of detecting the cooking surface <b>30</b> to determine if a cooking utensil <b>28</b> is on cooking surface <b>30</b>, as discussed above. Step <b>102</b> may be performed by the controller <b>56</b>, e.g., by running a detecting algorithm.
