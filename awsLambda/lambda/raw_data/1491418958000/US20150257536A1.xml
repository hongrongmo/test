      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Â§119(a) on Patent Application No(s). 103204394 filed in Taiwan, R.O.C. on Mar. 14, 2014, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to the technical area of downwardly mounted slides for drawers, and more particularly to a concealed slide module with the design of a middle plate and having a roof portion and a guide wheel on two sidewalls to improve the stability and reliability.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In general, a piece of furniture having a drawer such as a file cabinet, a cupboard and a desk usually comes with a pair of slides connected between the drawer and the furniture to facilitate users to push/pull the drawer to shut or open the drawer, and the slides are provided for carrying the load of the drawer and sliding the drawer. The conventional slide module is mainly divided according to its function and appearance into two main types, respectively: a side-mounted slide module and a downwardly mounted slide module. The side-mounted slide module is mounted onto a side of the drawer and coupled to the furniture, and the downwardly mounted slide module (also known as concealed slide module) is mounted onto the bottom of the drawer and coupled to the furniture to provide a concealed form.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">When the concealed slide module is used, the weight of the drawer directly presses on the slide module, and thus its force exertion direction differs from that of the side-mounted slide module. In general, the cross-section of the concealed slide module is substantially in a rectangular shape, which is obviously unlike the long flat cross-section of the general slide module, so that the concealed slide module can bear a relatively larger perpendicular weight, and the concealed slide module comes with a ball design that is different from the design of the side-mounted slide module, and related components have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,277,003 entitled âUndermount drawer slideâ and invented by Charles A. Milligan and U.S. Pat. No. 8,152,252 entitled âSlide assemblyâ and invented by Ken-Ching Chen, and both of the aforementioned patents are designed with the structure of a middle plate and an outer plate. With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> for a schematic view of the structure as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,277,003, a roof portion <b>11</b> is extended outwardly from both sides of a top side of the middle plate <b>1</b>, and two abutting surfaces <b>21</b> disposed on an inner side of the outer plate <b>2</b> and opposite to each other, so that the distance between the outermost sides of the two roof portions <b>11</b> is greater than the width of an opening of a ball set <b>3</b> for preventing the ball set <b>3</b> from falling out while sliding and reducing the gap between the ball set <b>3</b> and the middle plate <b>1</b> to improve the close contact, so as to achieve the effects of enhancing the sliding smoothness and stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In addition, an âUndermount drawer slideâ as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Publication No. US 2005/0231083 A1 comprises a wheel installed on two sidewalls of the middle plate separately for replacing the extending structure of the roof portion <b>11</b> to improve the sliding smoothness, so that a relatively larger gap is formed between the wheels and the outer plate to provide sufficient moving space. However, the drawers may produce vibrations and noises in practical applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It is noteworthy that dimensions and symmetrical positions must be taken into consideration for manufacture the drawer slide with of the design of the dual roof portions <b>11</b>, and thus having a very high level of difficulty of the manufacture and incurring a high manufacturing cost. On the other hand, the dual wheel design comes with a too-large gap, and thus causing vibrations and noises easily. Obviously, the conventional drawer slides require further improvements.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In view of the problems of the prior art, it is a primary objective of the present invention to overcome the problems of the prior art by providing a concealed slide module, wherein a roof portion is disposed on a sidewall of a middle plate, and a guide wheel is installed on the other sidewall of the middle plate. Therefore, the two roof portions formed and bent from symmetrical positions of the two sidewalls of the middle plate are no longer required, and the level of difficulty of the manufacture and the manufacturing cost can be lowered. In addition, design of the guide wheel can guide an outer plate to move accordingly to achieve the effects of minimizing the gap of the assembly, improving the stability, reducing noises, and preventing the drawer slides from falling out. In addition, the guide wheel further acts as a stop structure between the middle plate and the outer plate to prevent these plates from falling out during use.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">To achieve the aforementioned objective, the present invention provides a concealed slide module installed between a bottom side of a drawer and a cupboard, comprising:</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">an inner plate, having a folded plate disposed on a side of the inner plate and installed on an inner side of the cupboard, and a connecting section bent perpendicularly upward from the inner plate opposite to the other edge of the folded plate, and a platform formed and bent from the top of the connecting section, so that the platform and the bottom side of the inner plate are parallel to each other;</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">at least one first ball plate, covered onto an outer side of the platform, and the first ball plate including a first stand and a plurality of first rollers, and the first rollers being installed at a top side, a bottom side and an outer side of the first stand separately;</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0000">a middle plate, covered onto the exterior of the first ball plate, and having a roof portion facing towards an inner sidewall of the inner plate and protruded outwardly in a horizontal direction of the top side, a sliding section inwardly bent from a lower edge of the inner sidewall such that the sliding section and the platform are parallel to each other, and a guide wheel protruded from an outer sidewall at an end of the middle plate, and the middle plate sliding through the first ball plate with respect to the inner plate;</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">at least one second ball plate, covered onto the exterior of the middle plate, and the second ball plate including a second stand, a plurality of second balls and a plurality of second rollers, and the second stand being an inverted U-shaped structure, and the second balls being installed on two lateral sides of the second stand, and the second rollers being installed at the top side of the second stand; and</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">an outer plate, installed at the bottom side of the drawer, and the outer plate being an inverted U-shaped structure covered onto the exterior of the second ball plate, and an anti-loose portion being inwardly protruded from edges of the two sidewalls of the outer plate separately, such that the first balls and the guide wheel are coupled to the two anti-loose portions, and the outer plate slides with respect to the middle plate through the second ball plate and the guide wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment, the guide wheel has a protruding length equal to the distance between the middle plate and the outer plate, and the guide wheel has a diameter equal to the distance between the axis of the guide wheel and the anti-loose portion. In addition, the bottom side of the roof portion is in a cambered shape corresponsive to the second ball and disposed opposite to the anti-loose portion for clamping the second ball therebetween. The outer sidewall of the bottom of the guide wheel has a section deviated to the outside, so that the first rollers are coupled to surfaces of the middle plate and the connecting section respectively. The invention can minimize the gap produced after the assembling process to prevent producing vibrations or noises easily when the concealed slide module performs an extending or contracting movement.</p>
