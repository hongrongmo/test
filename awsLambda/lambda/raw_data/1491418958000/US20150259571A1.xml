      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The industrial, protective and decorative coating industries are very large markets and have largely depended on the availability of raw materials from the petrochemicals industry. An increase in the demand for environmentally friendly and sustainable products, together with the growing uncertainty of the variable and volatile petrochemical market, has created the need for inexpensive, environmentally friendly, coatings and membranes for the industrial, protective and decorative coating industries.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Some embodiments described herein are directed to a method of coating a substrate with a biopolymer coating, the method comprising: dissolving a biopolymer in an ionic liquid solvent to form a single phase biopolymer solution; adding a phase separation solvent to the single phase biopolymer solution to form a colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates; separating the colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates from the ionic liquid solvent; depositing the biopolymer aggregates onto the substrate to form a coated substrate; and curing the coated substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Some embodiments described herein are directed to a method of producing a hydrophilic biopolymer membrane, the method comprising: dissolving a biopolymer in an ionic liquid solvent to form a single phase biopolymer solution; adding a phase separation solvent to the single phase biopolymer solution to form a colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates; separating the colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates from the ionic liquid solvent; depositing the biopolymer aggregates onto the substrate to form a substrate coated with a deposited colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates; and curing the substrate coated with a deposited colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates to form the hydrophilic biopolymer membrane; and peeling away the hydrophilic biopolymer membrane from the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Some embodiments described herein are directed to a hydrophilic biopolymer coating comprising a cured colloid suspension of biopolymer aggregates. In some embodiments, the biopolymer aggregates comprise lignin, lignosulfonate, cellulose, sulfonated cellulose, hemicellulose, sulfonated hemicellulose, dextrin, sulfonated dextrin, a wood-derived biopolymer, a sulfonated wood-derived biopolymer or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the biopolymer aggregates have a polydisperse molecular weight of about 500 Daltons to about 500,000 Daltons. In some embodiments, the biopolymer aggregates are bonded to each other via ether crosslinks.</p>

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In the present disclosure, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be used, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figure, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds, compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">While various compositions, methods and devices are described in terms of âcomprisingâ various components or steps (interpreted as meaning âincluding, but not limited toâ), the compositions, methods, and devices can also âconsist essentially ofâ or âconsist ofâ the various components and steps, and such terminology should be interpreted as defining essentially closed-member groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as âopenâ terms (e.g., the term âincludingâ should be interpreted as âincluding but not limited to,â the term âhavingâ should be interpreted as âhaving at least,â the term âincludesâ should be interpreted as âincludes but is not limited to,â etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases âat least oneâ and âone or moreâ to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles âaâ or âanâ limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases âone or moreâ or âat least oneâ and indefinite articles such as âaâ or âanâ (e.g., âaâ and/or âanâ should be interpreted to mean âat least oneâ or âone or moreâ); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of âtwo recitations,â without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to âat least one of A, B, and C, etc.â is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., âa system having at least one of A, B, and Câ would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to âat least one of A, B, or C, etc.â is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., âa system having at least one of A, B, or Câ would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase âA or Bâ will be understood to include the possibilities of âAâ or âBâ or âA and B.â</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as âup to,â âat least,â and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 substituents refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 substituents. Similarly, a group having 1-5 substituents refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 substituents, and so forth.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0026">Lignin has a tenacious phenolic structure akin to phenol formaldehyde or cresol-formaldehyde based resins. In the past phenolic resins were one of the major sources of structural polymers. Much of lignin's natural strength is due to the phenolic ether linkages and much of the structural integrity of plant life is due to the expansive three-dimensional covalent network intrinsic to lignocellulosic structure. In processes that produce excess lignin (such as second generation bio-refineries) its chemical and structural tenacity combined with its high energy density instigate many processing facilities to simply burn it for energy. This structural robustness of lignin has promoted the inclusion of lignin in coatings whereby it is mechanically processed (pulverized, shredded, etc.) and simply used as a filler. In some embodiments, new solvents for lignocellulosic biomass can be used to formulate completely new lignin applications. In some embodiments, lignin can be molecularly broken down and reassembled to form a material as structurally stable as in its natural state, creating new class of robust and âgreenâ/environmentally friendly coatings.</p>
