    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An electronically controlled bladder assembly includes an adjustable pressure bladder and a constant pressure reservoir connected by an electronically controlled valve. The electronically controlled valve is operated in a manner that inflates the adjustable bladder when the current pressure is below a target pressure and in a manner that deflates the adjustable bladder when the current pressure is above the target pressure. The inflation and deflation of the adjustable bladder are achieved in an iterative manner by controlling the flow of fluid between the constant pressure reservoir and the adjustable bladder over several cycles of heel strikes.</p>

      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/717,389, titled “Electronically Controlled Bladder Assembly” and filed Dec. 17, 2012, which application is incorporated by reference herein.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present embodiments relate generally to footwear and in particular to articles of footwear with bladder assemblies and methods of controlling bladder assemblies.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Articles of footwear generally include two primary elements: an upper and a sole structure. The upper is often formed from a plurality of material elements (e.g., textiles, polymer sheet layers, foam layers, leather, synthetic leather) that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form a void on the interior of the footwear for comfortably and securely receiving a foot. More particularly, the upper forms a structure that extends over instep and toe areas of the foot, along medial and lateral sides of the foot, and around a heel area of the foot. The upper may also incorporate a lacing system to adjust the fit of the footwear, as well as permitting entry and removal of the foot from the void within the upper. In addition, the upper may include a tongue that extends under the lacing system to enhance adjustability and comfort of the footwear, and the upper may incorporate a heel counter.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The sole structure is secured to a lower portion of the upper so as to be positioned between the foot and the ground. In athletic footwear, for example, the sole structure may include a midsole and an outsole. The midsole may be formed from a polymer foam material that attenuates ground reaction forces (i.e., provides cushioning) during walking, running, and other ambulatory activities. The midsole may also include fluid-filled chambers, plates, moderators, or other elements that further attenuate forces, enhance stability, or influence the motions of the foot, for example. The outsole forms a ground-contacting element of the footwear and is usually fashioned from a durable and wear-resistant rubber material that includes texturing to impart traction. The sole structure may also include a sockliner positioned within the upper and proximal a lower surface of the foot to enhance footwear comfort.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one aspect, an article of footwear includes a bladder and a reservoir, where the pressure of the bladder is adjustable and wherein the pressure of the reservoir is substantially constant. The article also includes an electronically controlled valve including a first fluid port in fluid communication with the bladder and a second fluid port in fluid communication with the reservoir. The article also includes a pressure sensor associated with the bladder and an electronic control unit for controlling the electronically controlled valve, where the electronic control unit receives information from the pressure sensor. The electronic control unit is configured to operate the electronically controlled valve in an iterative manner to achieve a target pressure for the bladder.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another aspect, a method of controlling an electronically controlled valve in an article of footwear, where the electronically controlled valve provides controllable fluid communication between an adjustable bladder and a constant pressure reservoir, includes receiving a current bladder pressure for the adjustable bladder, receiving information associated with a first heel strike event and receiving information associated with a second heel strike event. The method further includes comparing the current bladder pressure with a target pressure. The method includes lowering the current bladder pressure when the current bladder pressure is substantially greater than the target pressure by opening the electronically controlled valve for a first period of time in response to the first heel strike event and opening the electronically controlled valve for a second period of time in response to the second heel strike event, and by closing the electronically controlled valve for a third period of time that occurs between the first period of time and the second period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another aspect, a method of controlling an electronically controlled valve in an article of footwear, where the electronically controlled valve provides controllable fluid communication between an adjustable bladder and a constant pressure reservoir, includes receiving a current bladder pressure for the adjustable bladder, receiving information associated with a first heel strike event and receiving information associated with a second heel strike event. The method further includes comparing the current bladder pressure with a target pressure. The method also includes increasing the current bladder pressure whenever the current bladder pressure is substantially less than the target pressure by closing the electronically controlled valve for a first period of time in response to the first heel strike event and closing the electronically controlled valve for a second period of time in response to the second heel strike event, and by opening the electronically controlled valve for a third period of time that occurs between the first period of time and the second period of time.</p>

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, for purposes of reference, article <b>100</b> may be divided into forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b>. Forefoot portion <b>10</b> may be generally associated with the toes and joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot portion <b>12</b> may be generally associated with the arch of a foot. Likewise, heel portion <b>14</b> may be generally associated with the heel of a foot, including the calcaneus bone. It will be understood that forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b> are only intended for purposes of description and are not intended to demarcate precise regions of article <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">For consistency and convenience, directional adjectives are employed throughout this detailed description corresponding to the illustrated embodiments. The term “longitudinal” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a length of a component. In some cases, the longitudinal direction may extend from a forefoot portion to a heel portion of the article. Also, the term “lateral” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a width of a component, such as an article. For example, the lateral direction may extend between a medial side and a lateral side of an article. Furthermore, the term “vertical” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction that is perpendicular to both the longitudinal and lateral directions. In situations where an article is placed on a ground surface, the upwards vertical direction may be oriented away from the ground surface, while the downwards vertical direction may be oriented towards the ground surface. It will be understood that each of these directional adjectives may be also be applied to individual components of article <b>100</b> as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Article <b>100</b> can include upper <b>102</b> and sole structure <b>110</b>. Generally, upper <b>102</b> may be any type of upper. In particular, upper <b>102</b> may have any design, shape, size and/or color. For example, in embodiments where article <b>100</b> is a basketball shoe, upper <b>102</b> could be a high top upper that is shaped to provide high support on an ankle. In embodiments where article <b>100</b> is a running shoe, upper <b>102</b> could be a low top upper.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In some embodiments, sole structure <b>110</b> may be configured to provide traction for article <b>100</b>. In addition to providing traction, sole structure <b>110</b> may attenuate ground reaction forces when compressed between the foot and the ground during walking, running or other ambulatory activities. The configuration of sole structure <b>110</b> may vary significantly in different embodiments to include a variety of conventional or non-conventional structures. In some cases, the configuration of sole structure <b>110</b> can be configured according to one or more types of ground surfaces on which sole structure <b>110</b> may be used. Examples of ground surfaces include, but are not limited to: natural turf, synthetic turf, dirt, as well as other surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Sole structure <b>110</b> is secured to upper <b>102</b> and extends between the foot and the ground when article <b>100</b> is worn. In different embodiments, sole structure <b>110</b> may include different components. For example, sole structure <b>110</b> may include an outsole, a midsole, and/or an insole. In some cases, one or more of these components may be optional.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Some embodiments of article <b>100</b> can include provisions for shock absorption, cushioning and comfort. In some cases, article <b>100</b> may be provided with one or more bladders. A bladder may be filled with one or more fluids, including gases and/or liquids. In some embodiments, a bladder can be configured to receive a gas including, but not limited to: air, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen or any other type of gas including a combination of any gases. In other embodiments, the bladder can be configured to receive a liquid, such as water or any other type of liquid including a combination of liquids. In an exemplary embodiment, a fluid used to fill a bladder can be selected according to desired properties such as compressibility. For example, in cases where it is desirable for a bladder to be substantially incompressible, a liquid such as water could be used to fill the inflatable portion. Also, in cases where it is desirable for a bladder to be partially compressible, a gas such as air could be used to fill the inflatable portion. It is also contemplated that some embodiments could incorporate bladders filled with any combinations of liquids and gases.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In one embodiment, article <b>100</b> includes bladder assembly <b>120</b>, which may include provisions to enhance shock absorption, cushioning, energy return and comfort. Bladder assembly <b>120</b> may incorporate one or more bladders, as well as additional provisions for controlling or otherwise facilitating the operation of these bladders. Bladders may comprise fixed pressure bladders and/or adjustable pressure bladders (also referred to simply as adjustable bladders). Additionally, a bladder assembly can include various provisions such as valves, fluid lines, housing and additional provisions for controlling the flow of fluid into and/or out of one or more bladders.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic isometric view of bladder assembly <b>120</b> in isolation from other components of article <b>100</b>. Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, in some embodiments, bladder assembly <b>120</b> may include bladder <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, bladder <b>122</b> may be an adjustable pressure bladder, also referred to simply as an adjustable bladder. In contrast to fixed pressure bladders, the internal pressure of an adjustable bladder may vary. In particular, an adjustable bladder may include provisions for receiving and/or releasing fluid, using one or more valves, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Bladder <b>122</b> may generally comprise an outer barrier layer <b>115</b> that encloses an interior cavity <b>123</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). Outer barrier layer <b>115</b> may be impermeable to some fluids such that outer barrier layer <b>115</b> prevents some kinds of fluids from escaping interior cavity <b>123</b>. Although a single outer barrier layer is shown in these embodiments, other embodiments could incorporate bladders having any other number of layers. In some other embodiments, for example, a bladder could comprise various layers that define one or more distinct interior chambers. Moreover, as discussed below, some embodiments of a bladder may incorporate additional provisions, such as structures disposed within an interior cavity to help control compression and response of the bladder to other forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Bladder <b>122</b> may be disposed on any portion of article <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, bladder <b>122</b> could be disposed in upper <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, bladder <b>122</b> could be disposed in sole structure <b>110</b>. Moreover, bladder <b>122</b> could be disposed in one or more of forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and/or heel portion <b>14</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in the figures, bladder <b>122</b> is disposed in the heel portion <b>14</b> of sole structure <b>110</b>. This location may facilitate cushioning, energy storage and/or shock absorption for the heel of the foot, which may contact the ground first in some kinds of activities (e.g., during a heel strike).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In different embodiments, the geometry of bladder <b>122</b> can vary. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, bladder <b>122</b> has a geometry that approximately corresponds to the heel portion of sole structure <b>110</b> into which bladder <b>122</b> is embedded. However, in other embodiments, bladder <b>122</b> could have any other geometry that could be selected according to various factors including location, structural requirements of the bladder, aesthetic or design factors as well as possibly other factors.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Although a single adjustable pressure bladder is shown in the current embodiment, other embodiments could include any other number of adjustable pressure bladders. For example, another embodiment could include two or more stacked adjustable pressure bladders. In still another embodiment, multiple adjustable pressure bladders could be incorporated into various different regions of sole structure <b>110</b> and/or upper <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A bladder may incorporate additional structural provisions for controlling compressibility as well as possibly other structural characteristics. As an example, some bladders can include one or more tensile materials disposed within an internal cavity of the bladders, which can help control the shape, size and compressibility of the bladders. Some examples of bladders with tensile materials that could be used with bladder assembly <b>120</b> are disclosed in Langvin, U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2012/0255196 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/081,069, filed Apr. 6, 2011, and titled “Adjustable Bladder System for an Article of Footwear”) and in Langvin, U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2012/0255198 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/081,091, filed Apr. 6, 2011, and titled “Adjustable Multi-Bladder System for an Article of Footwear”), the entirety of both being hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Bladder assembly <b>120</b> can include valve housing <b>126</b> that facilitates the inflation of bladder <b>122</b>. Valve housing <b>126</b> may be disposed adjacent to bladder <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, valve housing <b>126</b> comprises a plug-like member that receives intake valve <b>128</b> and supports the transfer of fluid into bladder <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, valve housing <b>126</b> may be substantially more rigid than bladder <b>122</b>. This arrangement helps protect valve <b>128</b> as well as any tubing or fluid lines connected to valve <b>128</b>. In other embodiments, however, the rigidity of valve housing <b>126</b> could be substantially less than or equal to the rigidity of bladder <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, bladder assembly <b>120</b> may include one or more fluid reservoirs. In one embodiment, bladder assembly <b>120</b> includes reservoir <b>124</b>. In particular, in some embodiments, reservoir <b>124</b> may be a constant pressure reservoir. In the current embodiment, reservoir <b>124</b> is shown schematically as including an outer barrier layer <b>117</b> and an interior cavity <b>125</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). However, in other embodiments, reservoir <b>124</b> could include additional structures or provisions to provide an approximately constant interior pressure for interior cavity <b>125</b>. Maintaining reservoir <b>124</b> at a constant pressure can be achieved using any methods known in the art. Any combination of valves, pumps and/or other features could be used to maintain a substantially constant pressure for reservoir <b>124</b> throughout various operating states of bladder assembly <b>120</b>. Moreover, any valves and/or pumps that may be used could be mechanically actuated and/or electromagnetically actuated.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Reservoir <b>124</b> is generally associated with valve housing <b>126</b> and may be in fluid communication with portions of valve housing <b>126</b> as described in detail below. In some embodiments, bladder <b>122</b> and reservoir <b>124</b> may be disposed on opposing sides, or faces, of valve housing <b>126</b>. For example, in the current embodiment reservoir <b>124</b> is disposed forwards of both bladder <b>122</b> and valve housing <b>126</b>, so that reservoir <b>124</b> may be disposed in the midfoot portion <b>12</b> and/or forefoot portion <b>10</b> of sole structure <b>110</b>. However, in other cases, the relative arrangement of bladder <b>122</b> and reservoir <b>124</b> with respect to valve housing <b>126</b> could vary to achieve desired geometries, structural constraints or other desirable properties for bladder assembly <b>120</b>.</p>

Other examples of possible user input devices that could receive user set information (such as a desired pressure for the bladder as well as possibly other settings) include, but are not limited to: control buttons, control panels, voice actuated devices as well as other user input devices. As described here, in some embodiments, a user input device may communicate with ECU <b>150</b> remotely, while in other embodiments a user input device could be communicate in a wired manner with ECU <b>150</b>. It is also contemplated that in some other embodiments, a remote device or other device could receive information from ECU <b>150</b>, including, for example, the current bladder pressure of bladder <b>122</b>. This information may be displayed to a user in real time for monitoring various aspects of bladder assembly <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In some embodiments, one or more components of a bladder assembly may be configured as part of a bladder control system. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, ECU <b>150</b>, pressure sensor <b>160</b>, first sensor <b>162</b>, second sensor <b>164</b>, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b>, remote device <b>168</b>, and pressure control knob <b>169</b> may all be collectively referred to as a bladder control system <b>180</b>. In particular, bladder control system <b>180</b> may comprise various provisions for sensing or otherwise receiving information and controlling electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> accordingly. The components described here as comprising bladder control assembly <b>180</b> are only intended to be exemplary, and in other embodiments some of these components could be optional. Moreover, in embodiments including various additional sensors or devices that communicate with ECU <b>150</b>, these additional sensors or devices can be considered as part of bladder control system <b>180</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Throughout the detailed description and in the claims a bladder control system can be configured to operate in one or more operating modes. In some embodiments, a bladder control system can operate in an “inflation mode”, which is a mode where the pressure in an adjustable bladder is increased through the automated operation of an electronically controlled valve. In some embodiments, a bladder control system can operate in a “deflation mode”, which is a mode where the pressure in an adjustable bladder is decreased through the automated operation of an electronically controlled valve. Detailed methods for operating in the inflation mode or the deflation mode are discussed in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a process for selecting an operating mode for a bladder control system according to information about the state of an adjustable bladder. In some embodiments, some of the following steps could be accomplished by a bladder control system, such as bladder control system <b>180</b>. For example, some steps may be accomplished by an ECU of a bladder control system, such as ECU <b>150</b> of bladder control system <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, some of the following steps could be accomplished by other components or systems associated with article <b>100</b>. It will be understood that in other embodiments one or more of the following steps may be optional.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In step <b>202</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may receive target pressure information. In particular, in some cases, bladder control system <b>180</b> receives a target pressure, which is a value indicating the desired or preset pressure for bladder <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the target pressure may be preset by a user, for example, using remote device <b>168</b>, pressure control knob <b>169</b> or any other user input devices. In other embodiments, the target pressure may be automatically determined by bladder control system <b>180</b> using information from one or more sensors or other systems. As an example, bladder control system <b>180</b> may sense when the user is running on a rigid surface such as concrete or asphalt, and automatically adjust the target pressure to increase cushioning and/or shock absorption. This could be determined, for example, using information from pressure sensors, accelerometers as well as other kinds of sensors. As still another example, bladder control system <b>180</b> may sense when the user is engaged in low shock activities such as biking or walking, and could automatically lower the target pressure accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In step <b>204</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may receive information from one or more sensors. In some embodiments, bladder control system <b>180</b> may receive information from a pressure sensor, such as pressure sensor <b>160</b>. In such cases, the information may be used to determine a current pressure value indicative of the pressure inside bladder <b>122</b>. Next, in step <b>206</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may determine if the bladder pressure is equal to the target pressure. If so, bladder control system <b>180</b> may return to step <b>202</b>. Otherwise, bladder control system <b>180</b> may proceed to step <b>208</b>. It will be understood that during step <b>206</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may determine if the current bladder pressure is within a predetermined error, or percentage, of the target pressure. For example, in one embodiment, bladder control system <b>180</b> may determine if the current bladder pressure is within 5% of the value of the target pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In step <b>208</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> determines if the bladder pressure is above the target pressure. If not, bladder control system <b>180</b> proceeds to step <b>210</b>. In other words, bladder control system <b>180</b> proceeds to step <b>210</b> when the bladder pressure is not equal to the target pressure (determined in step <b>206</b>) and not above the target pressure (step <b>208</b>), which implies that the bladder pressure must be less than the target pressure. Therefore, in step <b>210</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> enters the inflation mode, in which the pressure of bladder <b>122</b> is increased towards the desired target pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">If, in step <b>208</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> determines that the bladder pressure is above the target pressure, bladder control system <b>180</b> may proceed to step <b>212</b>. In step <b>212</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> enters the deflation mode, in which the pressure of bladder <b>122</b> is decreased towards the desired target pressure.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view of various stages of the inflation mode, according to an embodiment. Referring to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, during the inflation mode, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> is automatically opened and closed during different phases of a walking/running motion. At the top of <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, article <b>600</b> is seen to be in different relative positions with respect to ground surface <b>602</b> during a sequence of motions that occur as a user takes steps forward (i.e., walks or runs). In particular, article <b>600</b> is shown in alternating heel strike positions (including first heel strike position <b>610</b> and second heel strike position <b>612</b>) and lift-off positions (including first lift-off position <b>614</b> and second lift-off position <b>616</b>). Below the schematic positions of article <b>600</b> are different operating stages of bladder assembly <b>120</b>, which include different configurations of bladder <b>122</b> and different operating modes for electronically controlled valve <b>140</b>. These operating stages include a first operating stage <b>620</b>, a second operating stage <b>622</b>, a third operating stage <b>624</b> and a fourth operating stage <b>626</b>. Finally, the bottom of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic plot of the pressure inside bladder <b>122</b> as a function of time. This plot includes bladder pressure <b>630</b>, which varies in time, as well as reservoir pressure <b>632</b> and target pressure <b>634</b>, which are substantially constant with time. Moreover, the times indicated in the plot generally correspond with the various article positions and operating stages of bladder assembly <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">During the inflation mode, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> is closed during heel strikes and opened in between heel strikes. For example, in the first operating stage <b>620</b> and third operating stage <b>624</b>, which correspond to first heel strike position <b>610</b> and second heel strike position <b>612</b>, respectively, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> is closed. In contrast, in the second operating stage <b>622</b> and fourth operating stage <b>624</b>, which correspond to first lift-off position <b>614</b> and second lift-off position <b>616</b>, respectively, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> is open. This arrangement prevents fluid from escaping bladder <b>122</b> during heel strikes, when downward forces (indicated schematically as first downward forces <b>640</b> and second downward forces <b>642</b>) tend to compress bladder <b>122</b>. Furthermore, this arrangement allows fluid to flow from reservoir <b>124</b> into bladder <b>122</b> in between heel strikes (the fluid flow is indicated schematically as first arrow <b>644</b> and second arrow <b>646</b>), as the bladder pressure between heel strikes is substantially less than the reservoir pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">For purposes of describing the operation of bladder control system <b>180</b>, reference is made to several periods of time. In particular, a first period of time <b>660</b> is a period of time when article <b>600</b> is in the first heel strike position <b>610</b>. A second period of time <b>662</b> is a period of time when article <b>600</b> is in the second heel strike position <b>612</b>. In addition, a third period of time <b>664</b> is a period of time between the first period of time <b>660</b> and the second period of time <b>662</b>, and is generally a period of time between sequential heel strikes. Additionally, a fourth period of time <b>666</b> is a period of time that occurs after second period of time <b>662</b>, and is generally a period of time when article <b>600</b> is in the second lift-off position <b>616</b>. Each period of time is only intended to be approximate and in other embodiments the duration of each period could vary.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The process described here allows the bladder pressure to be iteratively increased towards the target pressure. In the current embodiment, for example, the bladder pressure has an initial value <b>650</b> that is substantially below target pressure <b>634</b>. As article <b>100</b> contacts ground surface <b>602</b> in the first heel strike position <b>610</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may detect a heel strike event and close (or keep closed) electronically controlled valve <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the heel strike event is determined using sensed pressure information. However, other embodiments could use any other means for detecting a heel strike event. In some cases, bladder control system <b>180</b> controls electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> in a closed position throughout the duration of the first period of time <b>660</b>, which approximately corresponds with the time of the first heel strike event.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Next, as article <b>600</b> is lifted from ground surface <b>602</b> in the first lift-off position <b>614</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> may open electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> in order to allow fluid to flow from reservoir <b>124</b> to bladder <b>122</b>. During this stage of operation, the bladder pressure gradually increases. In some cases, bladder control system <b>180</b> controls electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> in an opened position or state throughout the duration of the third period of time <b>664</b>, which approximately corresponds with the time between the first heel strike event and a second heel strike event.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Next, article <b>100</b> makes contact again with ground surface <b>602</b> in the second heel strike position <b>612</b>. At this point, bladder control system <b>180</b> may detect another heel strike event and closes electronically controlled valve <b>140</b>. In some cases, bladder control system <b>180</b> controls electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> in a closed position or state throughout the duration of the second period of time <b>662</b>, which approximately corresponds with the time of the second heel strike event.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Next, as article <b>100</b> is raised from ground surface <b>602</b> to the second lift-off position <b>616</b>, bladder control system <b>180</b> opens electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> again in order to allow fluid to flow from reservoir <b>124</b> to bladder <b>122</b>. During this stage of operation, the bladder pressure increases to the target pressure. Once the bladder pressure is equal to the target pressure, electronically controlled valve <b>140</b> may be closed once again, thereby maintaining the current bladder pressure of bladder <b>122</b> at the target pressure. Thus, this arrangement allows bladder <b>122</b> to be inflated during the time periods in between heel strikes, since the reservoir pressure is maintained at a high constant pressure so that absent of any compression forces, fluid will tend to flow from reservoir <b>124</b> to bladder <b>122</b>.</p>

In particular, article <b>700</b> is shown in alternating heel strike positions (including first heel strike position <b>710</b>, second heel strike position <b>714</b> and third heel strike position <b>718</b>) and lift-off positions (including first lift-off position <b>712</b> and second lift-off position <b>716</b>).
