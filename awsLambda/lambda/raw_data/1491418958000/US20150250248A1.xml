    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A helmet can comprise an upper-body comprising an upper outer shell and an upper energy-absorbing material coupled the upper outer shell. The helmet can comprise a lower-body comprising a lower outer shell and a lower energy-absorbing material coupled the outer shell, wherein the lower-body is nested within the upper-body. A strap anchor can be formed without a web and embedded within the upper-body or the lower-body between the upper-body and the nested lower-body. A strap can be coupled to the strap anchor, wherein the strap extends between the upper-body and the lower-body and is threaded through the lower-body to couple the helmet to a head of a user. The strap anchor can comprise a size less than or equal to 10-30 millimeters (mm), by 10-50 mm, by 2-10 mm. The strap anchor can be sandwiched between the upper-body and the lower-body and hidden from view within the helmet.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Protective headgear and helmets have been used in a wide variety of applications and across a number of industries including sports, athletics, construction, mining, military defense, and others, to prevent damage to a user's head and brain. Damage and injury to a user can be prevented or reduced by helmets that prevent hard objects or sharp objects from directly contacting the user's head. Damage and injury to a user can also be prevented or reduced by helmets that absorb, distribute, or otherwise manage energy of an impact.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For helmet-wearing athletes in many applications, such as sports, beyond the safety aspects of the protective helmet, additional considerations can include helmet fit and airflow through the helmet. Improvements in fit comfort and airflow can reduce distractions to the athlete and thereby improve performance. The multi-body helmet construction and a strap attachment device, as disclosed in this document, relate to safety, as well as improvements in fit, airflow, and comfort without reducing safety for customers.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An aspect of providing a proper fit between a user's head and the helmet can include the straps that are used to couple the helmet to the head of the user. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a strap anchor or ski type strap anchor <b>10</b> that has been conventionally used for in-molded helmets, including ski helmets or other snow helmets, for coupling a strap to the in-molded helmet. The strap anchor <b>10</b> can comprise two basic portions, i) a strap anchor body <b>14</b>, which can include the opening <b>12</b> and ii) a web, reinforcing attachment, fins, parachutes, anchoring geometry, or reinforcing attachment point <b>16</b> that couples the strap anchor <b>10</b> to a helmet or helmet body.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The opening <b>12</b> of the strap anchor <b>10</b> can receive a strap can be inserted into the opening to couple the strap to the strap anchor <b>10</b>. Afterwards, the strap can then couple the ski helmet to a head of a user. When the strap anchor <b>10</b> is coupled to the helmet, the web <b>16</b> of the strap anchor <b>10</b> can be disposed within an energy-absorbing material or layer of the helmet, such as a layer of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam or other suitable material. The web <b>16</b> can be sufficiently large, and include sufficient anchoring geometry, to secure the strap anchor <b>10</b> to the helmet by fixing the web <b>16</b> within the energy-absorbing material and remain firmly coupled during impacts. When the ski anchor <b>10</b> is coupled to a helmet body, the web <b>16</b> can be imbedded within the helmet body.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The strap or webbing of the helmet can be coupled to the strap anchor <b>10</b> by forming a loop in an end of the strap and inserting a pin through the loop of strap. Then, the pin and the loop of the strap can be passed through the opening <b>12</b> and disposed within the strap anchor body <b>14</b>. When the strap is coupled to the strap anchor <b>10</b>, the strap anchor body <b>14</b> is conventionally disposed at an edge of the helmet to allow for access to the opening <b>12</b>. As such, at least a portion of the strap anchor <b>10</b>, and particularly at least a portion of the strap anchor body <b>14</b>, remains visible to the helmet user and others observing the user wearing the helmet.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">This disclosure, its aspects and implementations, are not limited to the specific helmet or material types, or other system component examples, or methods disclosed herein. Many additional components, manufacturing and assembly procedures known in the art consistent with helmet manufacture are contemplated for use with particular implementations from this disclosure. Accordingly, for example, although particular implementations are disclosed, such implementations and implementing components may comprise any components, models, types, materials, versions, quantities, and/or the like as is known in the art for such systems and implementing components, consistent with the intended operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The word âexemplary,â âexample,â or various forms thereof are used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as âexemplaryâ or as an âexampleâ is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Furthermore, examples are provided solely for purposes of clarity and understanding and are not meant to limit or restrict the disclosed subject matter or relevant portions of this disclosure in any manner. It is to be appreciated that a myriad of additional or alternate examples of varying scope could have been presented, but have been omitted for purposes of brevity.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">While this disclosure includes a number of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail, particular embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the disclosed methods and systems, and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the disclosed concepts to the embodiments illustrated.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">This disclosure provides a device, apparatus, system, and method for providing a protective helmet that can include an outer shell and an inner energy-absorbing layer, such as foam. The protective helmet can be a bike helmet used for mountain biking or road cycling, as well as be used for a skier, skater, hockey player, snowboarder, or other snow or water athlete, a football player, baseball player, lacrosse player, polo player, climber, auto racer, motorcycle rider, motocross racer, sky diver or any other athlete in a sport. Other industries also use protective headwear, such that individuals employed in other industries and work such as construction workers, soldiers, fire fighters, pilots, or types of work and activities can also use or be in need of a safety helmet, where similar technologies and methods can also be applied. Each of the above listed sports, occupations, or activities can use a helmet that includes either single or multi-impact rated protective material base that is typically, though not always, covered on the outside by a decorative cover and includes comfort material on at least portions of the inside, usually in the form of comfort padding.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Generally, protective helmets, such as the protective helmets listed above, can comprise an outer shell and in inner energy-absorbing material. For convenience, protective helmets can be generally classified as either in-molded helmets or hard shell helmets. In-molded helmets can comprise one layer, or more than one layer, including a thin outer shell, an energy-absorbing layer or impact liner, and a comfort liner or fit liner. Hard-shell helmets can comprise a hard outer shell, an impact liner, and a comfort liner. The hard outer shell can be formed by injection molding and can include Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) plastics or other similar or suitable material. The outer shell for hard-shell helmets is typically made hard enough to resist impacts and punctures, and to meet the related safety testing standards, while being flexible enough to deform slightly during impacts to absorb energy through deformation, thereby contributing to energy management. Hard-shell helmets can be used as skate bucket helmets, motorcycle helmets, snow and water sports helmets, football helmets, batting helmets, catcher's helmets, hockey helmets, and can be used for BMX riding and racing. While various aspects and implementations presented in the disclosure focus on embodiments comprising in-molded helmets, the disclosure also relates and applies to hard-shell helmets.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show side profile views of a non-limiting example of a multi-body helmet <b>30</b> that comprises vents or openings <b>31</b> and an upper-body <b>40</b> and a lower-body <b>50</b>. For convenience, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> is referred to throughout the application as a two-body helmet, or bifurcated helmet, comprising the upper-body <b>40</b> and a lower-body <b>50</b>, or first and second bodies or portions. However, the present disclosure encompasses multi-body helmets that comprise more than two bodies, such as three, four, or any suitable number of bodies. The upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> can be joined to form a single multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, which is a departure from the conventional single body helmets described generally above. <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> shows the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> vertically separated by a gap or space while aligned with respect to each other, such as before the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> are placed in contact and adjacent each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The upper-body <b>40</b> can comprise an outer shell <b>42</b> and an energy-absorbing layer or impact liner <b>44</b>, although the upper-body <b>40</b> need not have both. For example, in some embodiments the upper-body <b>40</b> can comprise the energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b> without the outer shell <b>42</b>. Vents or openings <b>41</b> can be formed in the upper-body <b>40</b> that form, comprise, or align with at least a portion of the vents <b>31</b>. Similarly, the lower-body <b>50</b> can comprise an outer shell <b>52</b> and an energy-absorbing layer or impact liner <b>54</b>, although the lower-body <b>50</b> need not have both. For example, in some embodiments the lower-body <b>50</b> can comprise the energy-absorbing layer <b>54</b> without the outer shell <b>52</b>. Vents or openings <b>51</b> can be formed in the lower-body <b>50</b> that form, comprise, or align with at least a portion of the vents <b>31</b>, vents <b>41</b>, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can each, without limitation, be formed of a plastic, resin, fiber, or other suitable material including polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), vinyl nitrile (VN), fiberglass, carbon fiber, or other similar material. The outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can be stamped, in-molded, injection molded, vacuum formed, or formed by another suitable process. Outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can provide a shell into which the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, can be in-molded. Outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can also provide a smooth aerodynamic finish, a decorative finish, or both, for improved performance, improved aesthetics, or both. As a non-limiting example, the outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can comprise PC shells that are in-molded in the form of a vacuum formed sheet, or are attached to the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, with an adhesive. The outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b> can also be permanently or releasably coupled to the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b>, respectively, using any suitable chemical or mechanical fastener or attachment device or substance including without limitation, an adhesive, permanent adhesive, pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), foam-core adhesive, tape, two-sided tape, mounting foam adhesive, fastener, clip, cleat, cutout, tab, snap, rivet, hog ring, or hook and loop fasteners.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can each be disposed inside, and adjacent, the outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively. The energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can be made of plastic, polymer, foam, or other suitable energy-absorbing material or impact liner to absorb, deflect, or otherwise manage energy and to contribute to energy management for protecting a wearer during impacts. The energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can include, without limitation, EPP, EPS, EPU, EPO, or other suitable material. As indicated above, in-molded helmets can be formed with the outer shell of the helmet being bonded directly to the energy-absorbing layer by expanding foam into the outer shell. As such, the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can, in some embodiments, be in-molded into outer shells <b>42</b> and <b>52</b>, respectively, as single monolithic bodies of energy-absorbing material. Alternatively, in other embodiments the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can be formed of multiple portions or a plurality of portions. In any event, the energy-absorbing layers <b>44</b> and <b>54</b> can absorb energy from an impact by bending, flexing, crushing, or cracking.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">By forming the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> with multiple bodies or portions, such as upper-body <b>40</b> and lower-body <b>50</b>, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can advantageously and easily provide a multiple density design. For example, the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> can be formed of energy-absorbing materials of different densities and energy management properties, wherein the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> can comprise a first density, and the energy-absorbing material <b>54</b> can comprise a second density different from the first density. The first density can be greater than or less than the first density. In an embodiment, the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> can comprise a density in a range of 70-100 g/L and the energy-absorbing material <b>54</b> can comprise a density in a range of 50-80 g/L. Additionally, multiple layers of varying density, including increasing density, decreasing density, or mixed density, can be combined. By forming a single multi-body helmet <b>30</b> that comprises a plurality of densities for a plurality of bodies or components, helmet performance including helmet weight, and testing performance, can be manipulated and optimized with greater freedom and fewer restrictions than is available with a single bodied helmet.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">By forming the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> with multiple interlocking bodies or portions, such as upper-body <b>40</b> and lower-body <b>50</b>, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can also provide increased design flexibility with respect to conventional one-body or monolithic protective helmets. Increased design flexibility can be achieved by forming the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> comprising shapes, geometric forms, and orientations that would be difficult to accomplish with a single body liner. Constraints restricting shapes, geometric forms, and orientations of a single body liner include constraints for injecting foam or energy-absorbing material into a mold, constraints of removing the molded foam or energy-absorbing material from the mold, and constraints of machining or removing the single body liner from a template or standard blank of material such as a block of energy-absorbing material. For example, use of multiple interlocking body pieces for a single helmet can allow for helmet shapes, geometric forms, and orientations that would be difficult or impossible to remove or pull from a 1-piece mold. As a non-limiting example, increased design flexibility with respect to helmet shape for the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can include a helmet comprising a curvature or profile that follows a contour of the occipital region or occipital curve of user's head. Furthermore, increased design flexibility can be achieved because forming the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, including upper-body <b>40</b> and lower-body <b>50</b>, can simplify assembly of energy-absorbing material at an EPS press.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">By forming the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> with multiple bodies or portions, such as the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can also provide advantages with respect to the attachment and positioning of straps or webbing <b>70</b> that can be used to couple or releasably attach the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> to a user's head. For example, <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> shows the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can comprise a space, gap, or void between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>, into which the straps <b>70</b> can be nested or concealed. <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> shows a non-limiting example in which the outer shell <b>52</b> can be limited to a lower portion of the lower-body <b>50</b> that will not be covered or will remain exposed with respect to outer shell <b>42</b> of upper-body <b>40</b>. As such, the upper portion of the lower-body <b>50</b> can be formed without outer shell <b>52</b>, and can include a strap opening <b>55</b> that can be formed through the energy-absorbing material <b>54</b> and can be configured of a size that allows for a portion of the strap <b>70</b> to pass from the upper-body <b>40</b>, through the lower-body <b>50</b>, to secure the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> the user's head. The upper portion of the lower-body <b>50</b> can be formed with a strap recess <b>56</b> adjacent, or comprising, the strap opening <b>55</b>. The strap recess <b>56</b> can direct an alignment and location of the strap <b>70</b> as it passes from a strap anchor <b>60</b>, through portions of the multi-body helmet, to a head of the helmet user. Additional detail of how the straps <b>70</b> can be included within, and coupled to, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> are shown in, and discussed with respect to, the subsequent figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can also provide advantages with respect to a strap anchor <b>60</b> being concealed or hidden within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. Additionally, and as a non-limiting example, in some instances additional advantages of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can include the strap anchor <b>60</b> being smaller than conventional strap anchors, such as strap anchor <b>10</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. More specifically, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be formed without a web <b>16</b>, such as, although in other embodiments a web can be included. Thus, in some instances the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be reduced in size by omitting the webs <b>16</b>. Strap anchors can retain sufficient strength while being decreased in size for a number of reasons. First, an entrapping effect of the strap <b>70</b> between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> can reduce a force applied on the strap anchor <b>60</b> itself, thereby reducing the need for a web. Next, the strap <b>70</b> can be fed through a slot or opening in one or more of, the upper-body <b>40</b>, the outer shell <b>42</b>, the lower-body <b>50</b>, or the outer shell <b>22</b>, to provide strength similar to that provided by the conventional anchor <b>10</b> or strap bone, where a majority of resistance strength can come from an outer shell such as a PC cap. As such, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can differ from a conventional strap bone or strap anchor, like strap anchor <b>10</b>, by being embedded within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, and by not being visible to a user at an outer surface or exposed surface of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. Various examples of the strap anchor <b>60</b> are shown in, and discussed with respect to, <figref>FIGS. 3-6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows a perspective view of the upper-body, in which the strap anchors are visible and shown embedded within the energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b>. Thus, the relative number and positions of the strap anchors can vary, but as a non-limiting example, are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> to include two front strap anchors <b>60</b> and a rear strap anchor <b>60</b> configured to receive straps <b>70</b> as part of the strapping system for releasably coupling the helmet <b>30</b> to a user's head. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows one of the front strap anchors <b>60</b>, which would otherwise be obscured by the upper-body <b>40</b>, in dashed lines to indicate an approximate relative position of the strap anchor <b>60</b> as positioned on the inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b>. While <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment in which a single strap anchor <b>60</b> is being used, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can also comprise two rear strap anchors <b>60</b>, any desirable number and orientations of strap anchors <b>60</b> can be used. The strap anchors <b>60</b> can be disposed within the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> such that the strap anchors <b>60</b> reside on the inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b> and are not visible, or can be completely blocked from view, from the outer side of the upper-body <b>40</b>. Whatever the number and position of strap anchors <b>60</b>, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be positioned and arranged, oriented, or aligned, at a relative angle of about 90 degrees, such as plus or minus 0-20 degrees, to an applied load or an expected applied load. As such, the straps <b>70</b> can releasably couple the helmet <b>30</b> to the user's head while the straps <b>70</b> can be oriented to lie flatter on the face of the user, and to reduce or minimize twisting of the straps <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">While <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows that the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be exposed at the inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b>, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can also be wholly hidden from view within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> when the lower-body <b>50</b> is coupled to, or nested within, the upper-body <b>40</b>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> also shows that the strap anchors <b>60</b> can comprise an opening, slot, notch, channel, keyhole, or other suitable receiving apparatus <b>62</b> within the strap anchor for securely coupling the strap <b>70</b> to the strap anchor <b>60</b>. More specifically, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be hidden from view within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> by being placed with openings <b>62</b> of the strap anchors <b>60</b> at, co-planar with, or substantially co-planar with, an inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b>. As used herein, the strap anchor <b>60</b> or the opening <b>62</b> of the anchor <b>60</b> can be substantially co-planar with the inner surface of the upper-body <b>40</b> when the strap anchor <b>60</b> or the opening <b>62</b> of the anchor <b>60</b> are offset by a distance less than or equal to 10 millimeters (mm), 5 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or less than 1 mm. The openings <b>62</b> of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be the portion of the anchor <b>60</b> through which the strap <b>70</b> exits the strap anchor <b>60</b> to hold the helmet <b>30</b> to the user's head. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be embedded in energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b> with the openings <b>62</b> exposed away from lower edges <b>48</b> the upper-body. As such, the openings <b>62</b> of anchors <b>60</b> can be positioned along the inner surface <b>46</b> of upper-body <b>40</b> so as to be sandwiched between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>. Thus, the strap anchors <b>60</b> need not be in-molded on an inner surface of a helmet as the conventional strap anchors <b>10</b> would be. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional strap anchors <b>10</b> that would be exposed for receiving a pin and webbing loop, as well as being visible to a user and subject to disassembly by the user, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be concealed from the user and thus be tamper-proof.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> show additional detail of a non-limiting example of the strap anchor <b>60</b>. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows the strap anchor <b>60</b> can comprise the opening <b>62</b> formed in the anchor body or housing <b>64</b> to accommodate, and be coupled to, the strap <b>70</b>. The strap <b>70</b> can be coupled to the strap anchor <b>60</b> by placing a fastening device such as a rod, hook, button, key, or other suitable device <b>74</b> coupled to the strap <b>70</b>, such as passing through a loop <b>72</b> in an end of the strap <b>70</b>. While <figref>FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> show additional detail of a non-limiting example in which the rod <b>74</b> is formed as a rod, pin, cylinder, or pillar, the rod <b>74</b> and the mateable or receiving portion for the rod <b>74</b>, such as the opening <b>62</b> in the strap cover <b>60</b>, can comprise a cul-de-sac design, or a key-hole slide lock design in which the webbing end employs a plastic part shaped like a button, the button fitting into the strap anchor housing, which is shaped with an appropriate key-hole slot to receive it as the button is pulled into a locked position during assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Accordingly, when the rod is formed as a rod, pin, cylinder, or pillar, the rod <b>74</b> can comprise a length L that is less than a width W<b>1</b> of the opening <b>62</b> for receiving the rod <b>74</b>. The length L or the rod <b>74</b> can comprise a distance that is greater than a width W<b>2</b> of the opening <b>62</b> for retaining the rod <b>74</b> within the anchor body <b>64</b> after the rod <b>74</b> has passed through he opening <b>62</b>. As a non-limiting example, the width W<b>1</b> can be positioned at a top of the opening <b>62</b> and the width W<b>2</b> can be positioned at a bottom of the opening <b>62</b>. More specifically, the rod <b>74</b> can be fitted into the opening <b>62</b> such that the rod <b>74</b> and the opening <b>62</b> can be coupled or locked together with the rod being tucked down into a locking position within the anchor body <b>64</b>. The opening <b>62</b> can further comprise tabs, knobs, notches, gates, latches, or other fastening devices inside or in conjunction with the opening <b>62</b> or the anchor housing <b>64</b> that can prevent the rod <b>74</b> from undesirably or unintentionally coming out from the opening <b>62</b>, thereby ensuring proper assembly, attachment, or both, of the rod <b>74</b> and the opening <b>62</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In addition to the rods <b>74</b> being used to secure loops <b>72</b> of strap <b>70</b> within strap anchors <b>60</b>, different kinds of mounting systems for coupling the strap anchor <b>60</b> and the strap <b>70</b> can also be used. While use of rods or metal pins have been used in other helmets, including ski helmets, and can be adapted to use within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> disclosed herein, persons of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that other anchor devices are also contemplated. Thus, any method for securing the ends of the straps <b>70</b> to the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be used, and advantageously, can hide the strap anchors <b>60</b> from the consumer or user, as made possible by the multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. While the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be in-molded into an energy-absorbing layer such as energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b> during an in-molding process, the loop <b>72</b> of the strap <b>70</b> and the rod <b>74</b> can be subsequently disposed within the strap anchor <b>60</b> as described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> also shows a non-limiting example in which the strap anchor <b>60</b> can comprise a cover or strap anchor cover <b>66</b> sized and configured to be coupled to, and disposed over, an open outer edge <b>65</b> of the anchor body <b>64</b> opposite the opening <b>62</b>. While in some embodiments the strap anchor <b>60</b> can comprise multiple discrete or separately formed pieces to facilitate formation or molding, such as the cover <b>66</b> and the anchor body <b>64</b>, in other embodiments, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can comprise a single integrally formed body, piece, or unit. For example, <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows separate discrete portions of the strap anchor <b>60</b> and the anchor body <b>64</b> formed with an open back to accommodate tooling of the anchor body <b>64</b>. When the strap anchor is formed of multiple bodies, such as with the anchor body <b>64</b> and the cover <b>66</b>, the anchor body <b>64</b> and the cover <b>66</b> can be coupled together using any suitable chemical or mechanical fastener or attachment device or substance including without limitation, an adhesive, permanent adhesive, PSA, foam-core adhesive, tape, two-sided tape, mounting foam adhesive, fastener, clip, cleat, cutout, tab, snap, rivet, hog ring, or friction fit based on geometries of the anchor body <b>64</b> and the cover <b>66</b>. In some embodiments, the anchor body <b>64</b> and the cover <b>66</b> can be coupled together by snapping together the anchor body <b>64</b> and the cover <b>66</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> shows a perspective view of the strap anchor <b>60</b>, the strap <b>70</b>, and the rod <b>74</b> similar to that shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> differs from <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> by the angle of the view that shows the opening <b>62</b> in the strap anchor <b>60</b> oriented away from the viewer and further shows the cover <b>66</b> in place on the anchor body <b>64</b>. As a non-limiting example, the cover <b>66</b> can be coupled to the anchor body <b>64</b> and held together by an engagement snap <b>68</b>. The engagement snap <b>68</b> can comprise an engagement snap opening <b>68</b><i>a </i>and an engagement snap prong <b>68</b><i>b</i>. As a non-limiting example, the <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows the engagement snap opening <b>68</b><i>a </i>can be formed in the cover <b>66</b> and the engagement snap prong <b>68</b><i>b </i>can be formed as part of the anchor body <b>64</b>. However, the portions of the engagement snap <b>68</b> can also be reversed so that the engagement snap opening <b>68</b><i>a </i>can be formed in the anchor body <b>64</b> and the engagement snap prong <b>68</b><i>b </i>can be formed as part of the cover <b>66</b>. The cover <b>66</b> can be coupled to the anchor body <b>64</b> to prevent the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b>, such as EPS foam or EPS foam beads, from invading or being disposed within an open cavity or void within the strap anchor <b>60</b> that is configured to receive a portion of the strap <b>70</b> or the rod <b>74</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be formed without a web or reinforcing member that is used as a reinforcing attachment point between a strap anchor and a helmet body, similar to the web <b>16</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The web <b>16</b>, or a similar web or structure can be omitted from the strap anchor <b>60</b>, or cam be formed at a smaller or reduced size, for a number of reasons. First, the web <b>16</b> can be removed or eliminated due to coupling or placing the strap anchor <b>60</b> into direct contact with an outer shell of the multi-body helmet, such as with the outer shell <b>42</b> or the outer shell <b>52</b>. Placing the strap anchor <b>60</b> into direct contact with an outer shell, such as a PC cap or similar structure, can increase strength of the strap anchor <b>60</b>, and allow the outer shell to provide reinforcement in place of reinforcement from a web, such as web <b>16</b>. Second, the web <b>16</b> can be removed or eliminated because of the positioning of the strap anchor <b>60</b> and the strap <b>70</b> between bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, such as upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-boy <b>50</b>. Positioning, sandwiching, or entrapping the strap anchor <b>60</b> and the strap <b>70</b> between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> can place the strap <b>70</b> in compression and reduce a tension or force applied along the strap <b>70</b> to the strap anchor <b>60</b> itself, thereby reducing the need for a web coupled to the strap anchor <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">By forming the strap anchors <b>60</b> without a web, a size of the strap anchor can be reduced with respect to conventional ski type strap anchors, such as strap anchor <b>10</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As a non-limiting example, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can comprise a height H, a width W<b>3</b>, and a depth D, which taken together, yield a product that comprises a size or volume that is less than a size or volume of conventional strap anchors, such as the strap anchor <b>10</b>. In an embodiment, the height H of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be in a range of 10-30 mm, or 15-20 mm, or about 17 mm; the width W<b>3</b> of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be in a range of 10-50 mm, or 35-45 mm, or about 38 mm; and a depth D of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be in a range of 2-10 mm, 4-7 mm, or about 5 mm. As such, a total volume occupied by the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be in a range of about 600-15,000 mm<sup>3</sup>. As such, embedding the strap anchors <b>60</b> within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, such as within the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b>, requires a size, area, or volume that is less than the size, area, or volume that would be required by a ski type strap anchor such as a ski type strap anchor <b>10</b> comprising a web <b>16</b>. Accordingly, the use of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be more versatile than conventional strap anchors like strap anchors <b>10</b>, and the reduced size, area, or volume of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can allow for an increased number of placement options within a helmet without interfering with vent openings or other design constraints of the helmet.</p>

In <figref>FIG. 6</figref> the outer shell <b>52</b> is shown as being formed at an outer surface <b>53</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b> so that the outer shell <b>42</b> and the outer shell <b>52</b> can be disposed adjacent opposing sides to sandwich the strap <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> additionally shows a non-limiting example of how the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be coupled to the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the outer shell <b>42</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b> is shown disposed or residing inside a groove or channel <b>61</b> disposed around the strap anchor <b>60</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the groove <b>61</b> around the strap anchor <b>60</b> can serve for mounting the strap anchor <b>60</b> within an opening of a shell, such as an opening <b>43</b> in the outer shell <b>42</b>. Without limitation, the opening <b>43</b> in the outer shell <b>42</b> can be formed by punching the opening <b>43</b> in the outer shell <b>42</b>, placing the strap anchor <b>60</b> with groove <b>61</b> in the opening <b>43</b>, and then in-molding the energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b> around the strap anchor <b>60</b> as the strap anchor <b>60</b> is coupled to the outer shell <b>42</b>. The opening <b>43</b> in the outer shell <b>42</b> can be sized with a specific size and shape approximately equal to, or slightly smaller than, a size and shape of the strap anchor <b>60</b>. As such, the outer shell <b>42</b> can receive the strap anchor <b>60</b> and hold the strap anchor <b>60</b> in place during subsequent formation or molding of the energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b>, so that the energy-absorbing layer <b>44</b> can be disposed adjacent the outer shell <b>42</b> and around the strap anchor <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In some embodiments, formation of the strap anchor <b>60</b> within in the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can be accomplished by a method similar to a method used for forming ski type strap anchors <b>10</b> within a conventional ski type helmet. The method used for mounting the strap anchors <b>60</b> within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can comprise mounting the strap anchors <b>60</b> on a blade that protrudes from a base of a male side of an EPS tool as part of an EPS press. As used herein, the use of âEPSâ with respect to the EPS tool and the EPS press are exemplary and non-limiting, and as such other any suitable energy absorbing material that is contemplated herein. The blade can act as a sturdy mount for the strap anchor <b>60</b>, while the blade can also evacuate or prevent the opening <b>62</b> within the strap anchor <b>60</b> from being filled with energy-absorbing material so that the opening <b>62</b> is readily available to subsequently receive the web <b>70</b>, the rod <b>74</b>, or both. After molding, the EPS press can open and the helmet can be taken from the tool and from a female side of the EPS press with the strap anchors <b>60</b> residing in the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. In some instances, mounting the strap anchor <b>60</b> to the male side of the EPS press can cause an orientation of blades, and consequently an orientation of the strap anchors <b>60</b>, to be aligned with a pull direction of the EPS press as the EPS press opens and closes. By determining an orientation of the strap anchors <b>60</b> based on the pull direction of the EPS press, the resulting orientation of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can cause the straps <b>70</b> coupled to the strap anchors <b>60</b> to twist because a preferred alignment for the EPS press is different from a preferred alignment for causing the straps <b>70</b> to lie flat across the face of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In other embodiments, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be formed within in the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> by mounting the strap anchor <b>60</b> in any orientation with respect to an outer shell, such as the outer shell <b>42</b>, without regard to a position or orientation of a pull direction of the EPS mold. By so doing, the position and orientation of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be positioned and arranged, oriented, or aligned, at a relative angle of about 90 degrees to an applied load or an expected applied load. As such, the straps <b>70</b> can releasably couple the helmet <b>30</b> to the user's head while the straps <b>70</b> can be oriented to lie flatter on the face of the user, and to reduce or minimize twisting of the straps <b>70</b>. More specifically, the nature and design of the strap anchor <b>60</b>, including one or more of a small web, no web, a small overall size, and the groove <b>61</b>, can allow for the strap anchor <b>60</b> to be held in a desired position with respect to the outer shell <b>42</b> wherever the openings <b>43</b> are formed in the outer shell <b>42</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be positioned or aligned within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> so that the rods <b>74</b> can be disposed within the strap anchors <b>60</b> in an orientation or direction that is perpendicular, transverse, or at a relative angle of about 90 degrees to a desired path of the strap <b>70</b>. By so doing, securing the strap <b>70</b> with the rod <b>74</b> to the strap anchor <b>60</b>, twisting of the strap <b>70</b> used for coupling the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> to the head of the user will be reduced. Furthermore, and as indicated above, attaching the strap anchor <b>60</b> to an outer shell of the upper-body <b>40</b>, such as outer shell <b>42</b>, improves strength of the strap anchor <b>60</b>, allowing a decreased size of the strap anchor <b>60</b> and removal or omission of webs <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the strap recess <b>56</b> between the upper-body <b>40</b> and lower-body <b>50</b> can be large enough and provide sufficient offset to accommodate the loop <b>72</b> and the strap <b>70</b> within the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> or between the upper-body <b>40</b> and lower-body <b>50</b> before the strap extends away from the helmet, such as through the strap opening <b>55</b> to interface with, or be coupled around, the helmet user's head, face, or chin. While <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a non-limiting example in which the strap opening <b>55</b> is formed in the lower-body <b>50</b>, the strap opening <b>55</b> can also be formed in the upper-body <b>40</b> or both the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> also shows a non-limiting example of an optional comfort liner or fit liner <b>90</b> that can be disposed inside the lower-body <b>50</b> adjacent the inner surface <b>57</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b>. The comfort liner <b>90</b> can be made of textiles, plastic, foam, polyester, nylon, or other suitable materials. The comfort liner <b>90</b> can be formed of one or more pads of material that can be joined together, or formed as discrete components, that are coupled to the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. The comfort liner <b>90</b> can be releasably or permanently attached to the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, such as the lower-body <b>50</b>, using an adhesive, permanent adhesive, PSA, foam-core adhesive, tape, two-sided tape, mounting foam adhesive, fastener, clip, cleat, cutout, tab, snap, rivet, hog ring, or hook and loop fasteners, or other interlocking surfaces, features, or portions. As such, the comfort liner <b>90</b> can provide a cushion and improved fit for the wearer of the in-molded helmet.</p>

The energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> can then be formed adjacent the outer shell <b>42</b> and around the strap anchor <b>60</b>. The cover <b>66</b> can be included as part of the strap anchor <b>60</b> to prevent a portion of the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> from entering within the strap anchor <b>60</b> during formation of the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b>, such as during an in-molding process. Keeping the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> out of the strap anchor <b>60</b> prevents the energy-absorbing material <b>44</b> from interfering with the subsequent reception of the rod <b>74</b> and the strap <b>70</b> within the strap anchor <b>60</b>.

By way of example and not by limitation, the loops <b>72</b> can pass through corresponding strap openings <b>55</b> from within the lower-body <b>50</b> to without the lower-body <b>50</b> by passing from an inner surface <b>57</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b> to the outer-surface <b>58</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b> opposite the inner surface <b>57</b>. After passing each of the loops <b>72</b> through the strap openings <b>55</b>, a number of the rods <b>74</b> can be passed through each of the loops <b>72</b> of the straps <b>70</b>. In some instances, the length L of the rods <b>74</b> can be greater than a length or opening size of the strap openings <b>55</b> so that the rods <b>74</b> must be placed within the loops <b>72</b> after the loops <b>72</b> have passed through the strap openings <b>55</b>. In other embodiments, the length L of the rods <b>74</b> can be less than the length or opening size of the strap openings <b>55</b> so that the rods <b>74</b> can be placed within the loops <b>72</b> either before or after the loops <b>72</b> have passed through the strap openings <b>55</b>. After the loops <b>72</b> in the straps <b>70</b> have passed through the strap openings <b>55</b> in the lower-body <b>50</b>, and the rods <b>74</b> have been inserted into the loops <b>72</b>, the rods <b>74</b> can be disposed within the openings <b>62</b> in the strap anchors <b>60</b> as shown in, and described with respect to, <figref>FIGS. 4A-4E</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">With the straps <b>70</b> coupled to the strap anchors <b>60</b> and joining the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>, the straps <b>70</b> can then be gradually pulled, removing slack and increasing tension in the straps <b>70</b>, to draw the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> together to form a unitary multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. While drawing the upper and lower bodies together, the upper and lower bodies can also be coupled or adhered to lower-body <b>50</b> using any suitable chemical or mechanical fastener, attachment device, or substance including without limitation, an adhesive, permanent adhesive, PSA, foam-core adhesive, tape, two-sided tape, mounting foam adhesive, fastener, clip, cleat, cutout, tab, snap, rivet, hog ring, or hook and loop fasteners, or other interlocking surfaces, features, or portions. Such interlocking features can limit, prevent, or regulate undesired relative movement between the multiple bodies such as the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>. In some instances, a predetermined shear strength can be built into the interlocking features to shear or fail at predetermined levels of force. As a non-limiting example, the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can comprise bumps or pop-outs <b>80</b> and <b>84</b> as well as indents <b>82</b> and <b>86</b> to assist in coupling together the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> together to form the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. More specifically, <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows the bumps <b>80</b> are formed on the outer surface <b>58</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b> so that the bumps <b>80</b> are configured, by size, shape, and position, to be mateably coupled with the indents <b>86</b> shown on inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> also shows the indents <b>82</b> can be formed on the outer surface <b>58</b> of the lower-body <b>50</b> so that the indents <b>82</b> are configured, by size, shape, and position, to be mateably coupled with the bumps <b>84</b> shown on inner surface <b>46</b> of the upper-body <b>40</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The interlocking features of bumps <b>80</b> and <b>84</b> as well as indents <b>82</b> and <b>86</b> can help facilitate a stronger connection and better alignment between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b> of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show various views of a user wearing the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> when the multi-body helmet is fully formed and comprising the upper-body <b>40</b> coupled together with the lower-body <b>50</b> with the straps <b>70</b>. <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> shows a side profile view of the user having the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> coupled to the head of the user with the straps <b>70</b> laying flatly, and without twisting, on the face of the user. <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows a perspective view of a rear and left side portion of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> as the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> is being worn by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Attaching or coupling the upper-body <b>40</b> to the lower-body <b>50</b>, through the straps <b>70</b>, as well as through other chemical and mechanical attachment as described herein, provides a number of advantages for the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. First, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be hidden from view, or not visible, by being sandwiched between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>, instead of being disposed at lower edges <b>48</b> of upper-body <b>40</b> or at lower edges of the lower-body <b>50</b>. The hidden position of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can reduce, minimize, or eliminate a risk of the user tampering with, or harming, the strap anchor <b>60</b> or the connection between the strap <b>70</b> and the strap anchor <b>60</b>. In some embodiments, in order for the user to be able to tamper with the attachment or coupling of the strap anchor <b>60</b> and the strap <b>70</b> the helmet would need to be damaged or destroyed, which would discourage most users from proceeding with such tampering. Additionally, by covering portions of the strap or webbing anchor systems including the strap anchors <b>60</b> and the straps <b>70</b>, the strap or webbing anchor systems are not exposed to view so that an aesthetic of the helmet can improve. The helmet aesthetic can be improved inasmuch as strap or webbing anchor systems on an exterior of a helmet are generally considered unsightly.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Second, the multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, such as the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>, can be adjacent and closely aligned one with another so as to apply pressure to the strap anchors <b>60</b>, thereby assisting in keeping the strap anchors securely in place within the multi-body helmet for securing the strap <b>70</b> to a body of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Third, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be formed as lightweight structures without a web, reinforcing attachments, fins, parachutes, or anchoring geometry, like the web <b>16</b>, to reduce a size and weight of the strap anchors <b>60</b> as well as reducing an overall weight of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. An ability to safely produce a minimalist design for the strap anchors <b>60</b> with sufficient strength to remain firmly coupled to the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> and the straps <b>70</b> can result, at least in part, from the support that the strap anchors <b>60</b> receive from multiple sources. First, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can receive strength from being in direct contact with an outer shell, such as a PC cap or similar structure. Second, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can receive strength from being sandwiched between the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>. Additionally, reducing an overall profile of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can reduced design constraints and allow increased versatility in helmet design without creating concerns for the positioning of the strap anchors <b>60</b>, such as with a position of the strap anchors <b>60</b> interfering with vents <b>31</b>, or other helmet design features or elements of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Fourth, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be placed in a favorable orientation to contribute to reducing, minimizing, or eliminating undesired twisting of the straps <b>70</b> when the user wears the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>. The favorable orientation of the strap anchors <b>60</b> can be achieved by forming the strap anchors <b>60</b> comprising a groove <b>61</b> around a perimeter and substantially parallel to a main plane of the strap anchors <b>60</b> that allow the strap anchors <b>60</b> to snap into the opening <b>43</b> in the outer shell <b>42</b> of the upper-body <b>50</b>. A related advantage of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can comprise improved aerodynamics resulting from less webbing being exposed to airflow and wind movement around the helmet, thereby reducing movement, flapping, or flopping of the straps <b>70</b> in in the wind. A reduction of movement of the straps <b>70</b> can also reduce noise and irritation to a user wearing the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Fifth, the straps <b>70</b> can extend between, and be held in place by, multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, such as the upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>. As a result, the straps <b>70</b> can be trapped or fixed in a desired alignment between multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> such that tension along a length of the straps <b>70</b> can be reduced by applying a force of compression to the straps <b>70</b> when sandwiching the straps <b>70</b> between the multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Sixth, an advantage of creating continuity between multiple helmet bodies to anchor or hold together the multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> can be achieved by threading the straps <b>70</b> through the lower-body <b>50</b> and coupling the straps <b>70</b> to the strap anchors <b>60</b> in the upper-body <b>40</b>. By threading the strap <b>70</b> through the lower-body <b>50</b> and securing the strap <b>70</b> to the upper-body <b>40</b>, the strap anchors <b>60</b> can prevent the lower-body <b>50</b> and the upper-body <b>40</b> from separating from each other during an impact, thus increasing integrity of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b> during a crash. In some embodiments, by having the straps <b>70</b> threaded through and coupled to multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet <b>30</b>, an impact or crash can increase tension in the straps <b>70</b> as a helmet is pulled or forced away from a user's head that in turn draws the multiple bodies of the multi-body helmet together, such as upper-body <b>40</b> and the lower-body <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Seventh, the strap anchor <b>60</b> can act as an improved strap bone to simplify and improve helmet function and helmet aesthetics. The improvements of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can include coupling the strap anchor to an outer shell of the helmet, such as the outer shell <b>42</b>, to improve structural strength, while also being in-molded at an advantageous position with respect to the completed multi-body helmet <b>30</b> to reduce twisting of the straps <b>70</b>. The advantageous position of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can also include hiding the strap anchor <b>60</b> from view of the user once the helmet is assembled, and reduce a likelihood of tampering with the strap anchor. The above improvements and advantages of the strap anchor <b>60</b> can be in contrast to conventional strap bones that are visible at an exterior of the helmet, and are placed with respect to molding considerations at the expense of strap position.</p>
