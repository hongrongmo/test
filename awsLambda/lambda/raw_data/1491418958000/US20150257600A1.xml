      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Technical Field This disclosure generally relates to grinding mechanisms, and more particularly to grinders or mills with high speed and adjustable grinding mechanisms for grinding materials, such as spices and grains.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Traditional spice and grain mills are common household and kitchen tools. They often comprise a hollow cylindrical body with a grinding rasp and rasp ring at one end and a grind knob at the other. A grinder shaft typically runs along the central axis of the body and connects the rasp and knob together such that a user may hold the body and turn the knob, causing the rasp to rotate relative to the rasp ring and grind the material contained within the body. Most mills also provide a means for adjusting the grind coarseness between fine and coarse settings.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The means for adjusting the grind is usually an additional knob threaded onto an extreme end of the grinder shaft, either at the top, above the grind knob, or at the bottom, below the grinding rasp. In either case, to adjust the grind setting, a user must adjust their hold on the grinder, reposition their hands to grab the grind adjustment knob, and tighten or loosen the knob. The knob is usually a small nut that requires fine motor skill to adjust. In the case of a bottom mounted grind adjustment knob, the user's fingers usually get covered in spice or grain dust that may accumulate at the outlet of the mill. Once the user has adjusted the grind they must reposition their hands again before they resume grinding. If the grind needs additional adjustment, then the user must interrupt the grinding process again, reposition their hands, and make further adjustments with the grind adjustment knob. This traditional method for adjusting the grind coarseness is awkward and time consuming.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In existing mills, the turn handle or knob the user turns to grind the material connects directly to a shaft and the shaft then connects to a rasp such that for every rotation of the knob or handle, the rasp completes one rotation. In an effort to reduce the force necessary for grinding material, some mills include handles offset from the axis of rotation of the grind shaft, creating a lever arm and increasing the torque delivered to the grinder. Gear mechanisms have also been developed to increase the torque to the grinder. These gear mechanisms slow the grinding process because they reduce the output speed of the grinder such that a single rotation of the turn knob or handle causes less than one rotation of the rasp.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is desirable to have a mill that allows for a simple, easy, and straightforward grind adjustment. Further, it is desirable to have a mill with a grind adjustment mechanism that does not require the user to significantly reposition their hands to change the grind setting. In addition, it is desirable to have a mill that quickly grinds spices and grains with a grinding mechanism that makes more than one rotation for each rotation of a turn knob or handle.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present disclosure is directed to systems and apparatus for grinding spices and grains. One system includes a mill for grinding a spice or grain material, comprising a body and a handle rotatably coupled to the body. The handle is also coupled to an input of a speed boost assembly. An output of the speed boost assembly is coupled to a grind assembly, which includes a rasp. The speed boost assembly is configured to cause the rotational rate or displacement of the rasp to be greater than a rotational rate or displacement of the handle.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">One system includes a body, a grind adjuster including at least one set of stepped detents and being rotatable between a first and a second position, a follower coupled to a grind shaft, the follower riding on the stepped detents, a rasp having a rasp grinding surface and being coupled at an end of the grind shaft, and a grinder ring coupled to the body and having a ring grinding surface. The rasp is operatively positionable between at least a coarse spacing and a fine spacing. When the grind adjuster is in the first position, the rasp grinding surface is at a course spacing from the ring grinding surface, and when the grind adjuster is in a second position, the rasp grinding surface is at a fine spacing from the ring grinding surface and the rotation of the adjuster relative to the body causes the follower to move between a first detent and a second detent.</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures associated with mills and grinding mechanisms have not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring descriptions of the embodiment of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a grinder or mill <b>100</b> for grinding a material such as spices or grains. The mill <b>100</b> includes an exterior body <b>120</b> and a turn knob assembly <b>110</b> coupled to each other. The body <b>120</b> and turn knob assembly <b>110</b> may be rotatably coupled to each other and rotate relative to each other about an axis of rotation, or longitudinal axis, when grinding material. See, for example, axis âXâ in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">
        <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show an exploded view of the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> and portions of the lower body assembly <b>300</b> of the mill <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, a turn knob includes a place for a user to grip the mill and turn or operate the grinding operation of the mill. In addition, in some embodiments, a turn knob may also include some or all of the gear mechanism for increasing the grinding speed of a mill. In still other embodiments, the turn knob is coupled to a gear mechanism that is located outside the turn knob, for example, in a body assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> includes a speed boost assembly <b>210</b>, a handle <b>220</b>, a carrier <b>230</b>, a shaft coupler <b>310</b>, a top cover <b>202</b>, and an accent cover <b>201</b>. The speed boost assembly <b>210</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a gear train and includes a set of gears that increases the speed and lowers the torque of the output gear as compared to the input gear. The embodiment of the speed boost assembly <b>210</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a planetary gear train, which is sometimes also referred to as an epicyclic gear train. A planetary gear train comprises an annular gear (or ring gear), a sun gear, and one or more planet gears supported by a carrier. The speed boost assembly <b>210</b> comprises a ring gear <b>211</b>, a sun gear <b>213</b>, and three planet gears <b>212</b>. The carrier <b>230</b> supports the three planet gears <b>212</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Planetary gear trains typically have an input, an output, and a stationary or held gear or gear set. Different combinations of these three properties will change the gear ratio, output torque, and direction of rotation of the gears. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the ring gear <b>211</b> is the input, the planet gears <b>212</b> are pinned to the stationary carrier <b>230</b>, and the sun gear <b>213</b> is the output. In addition, in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the ring gear <b>211</b> has 34 teeth, the sun gear <b>213</b> has 16 teeth, and the planet gears <b>212</b> have 9 teeth each. In this configuration, the gear ratio is calculated by dividing the number of teeth on the ring gear by the number of teeth on the sun gear. Thus, the speed boost assembly <b>210</b> has a gear ratio of 2.125:1. A gear ratio of 2.125:1 means that the output gear makes 2.125 rotations for each rotation of the input gear. As an additional example, if the handle <b>220</b> rotates at a rotational frequency of 0.5 rotations per second, the rasp <b>460</b> will rotate at a rotational frequency of 1.0625 rotations per second. In addition, the illustrated sun gear (the output gear) rotates in a direction opposite of the ring gear, the input. In some embodiments the gear ration may range between about 1.2:1 to about 3:1. In some embodiments the gear ratio is greater than 1.0:1, greater than 1.2:1, greater than 1.5:1, or greater than 2:1</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the handle <b>220</b> contains the speed boost assembly <b>210</b>, the carrier <b>230</b>, the shaft coupler <b>310</b>, the top cover <b>202</b>, and the accent cover <b>201</b>. The carrier <b>230</b> sits within the cavity <b>222</b> of the handle <b>220</b>. More particularly, a flange <b>236</b> on the carrier <b>230</b> sits on a flange <b>405</b> on the interior of the carrier <b>230</b> (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Both of the flanges <b>236</b> and <b>405</b> may have a circular cross section such that the handle <b>220</b> may rotate relative to the carrier <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Additionally, tabs <b>235</b> of the carrier <b>230</b> work in cooperation with recesses <b>121</b> to releasable couple the carrier <b>230</b>, and the rest of the turn knob assembly <b>110</b>, to the body <b>120</b>. The tabs <b>235</b> and recesses <b>121</b> may be arranged such that when the carrier <b>230</b> is coupled to the body <b>120</b>, the carrier <b>230</b> may not rotate with respect to the body <b>120</b>, but the turn handle <b>220</b> may rotate with respect to the carrier <b>230</b> and the body <b>120</b>. This arrangement allows a user to remove the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> from the body <b>120</b> without disassembling any other parts of the mill and fill or refill the mill <b>100</b> with spices or grains through the aperture <b>127</b> in the upper end of the body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Coupler <b>310</b> sits in cavity <b>232</b> of the carrier <b>230</b>. The cavity <b>232</b> and coupler <b>310</b> can both have a circular cross section. This allows the coupler <b>310</b> to rotate with respect to the carrier <b>230</b>. The sun gear <b>213</b> may include a coupling means <b>215</b> that helps couple the sun gear <b>213</b> to the shaft coupler <b>310</b>. The coupling means <b>215</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a shaft with a hexagonal cross section that engages with a corresponding hexagonal shaped coupling means <b>311</b> located in the shaft coupler <b>310</b>. The coupling means <b>215</b> and <b>311</b> may be non-circular or otherwise fixed such that the rotation of the sun gear <b>213</b> causes a corresponding rotation of the shaft coupler <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, for example, the coupling means <b>215</b> and <b>311</b> may be of a generally circular cross section and may include a keyway and key that cause the shaft coupler <b>310</b> to rotate with the sun gear <b>213</b>. The coupler <b>310</b> may also include a shaft coupling means <b>312</b> that couples the shaft coupler <b>310</b> to the grind shaft <b>410</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the grind shaft <b>410</b> and coupling means <b>312</b> have complementary square cross sections such that the grind shaft <b>410</b> may slide into the coupling means <b>312</b> and both the grind shaft <b>410</b> and shaft coupler <b>310</b> rotate with one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In some embodiments, the grind shaft <b>410</b> and sun gear <b>213</b> may be coupled directly to each other. In such embodiments, a shaft coupler <b>310</b> may not be necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The carrier <b>230</b> and planet gears <b>212</b> also include coupling means <b>231</b> and <b>214</b>, respectively, for coupling the planet gears <b>212</b> to the carrier <b>230</b>. The planet gear coupling means may be a shaft or axle <b>214</b> that is concentric with an axis of rotation of the planet gear <b>212</b>, while the carrier coupling means <b>231</b> may be a hole or aperture for receiving a shaft or axle. In some embodiments, the coupling means may be different, for example, the planet gear coupling means may be a hole or aperture for receiving a shaft or axle or the carrier coupling means may be a shaft or axle.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The ring gear <b>211</b> may be coupled or mounted to the handle <b>220</b> such that rotation of the handle <b>220</b> causes a corresponding rotation of the ring gear <b>211</b>. For example, the exterior circumferential surface of the ring gear may include a protrusion <b>216</b> that interacts with a notch <b>221</b> on the interior surface of the handle <b>220</b> such that the ring gear <b>211</b> is coupled to or mounted to the handle <b>220</b>. In some embodiments the ring gear <b>211</b> may be glued, welded, or otherwise affixed to the handle <b>220</b>. In some embodiments the ring gear may be an integral part of the handle, for example, the ring gear <b>211</b> may be gear teeth formed or molded with and around the interior surface of the handle <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Finally, the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> may also include the top cover <b>202</b> and the accent cover <b>201</b>. The top cover <b>202</b> can include protrusions <b>203</b> that releasably couple the top cover <b>202</b> to the handle <b>220</b> via corresponding notches <b>223</b> on an interior surface of the handle <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> and speed boost assembly <b>210</b> work together to drive the grind shaft <b>410</b>. To use the mill <b>100</b> to grind spices or grains a user might hold the mill <b>100</b> in their hands. The user may grasp the body <b>120</b> in their non-dominant hand while grasping the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> in their dominant hand and rotating the handle <b>220</b> in a clockwise direction relative to the body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Rotating the handle <b>220</b> clockwise relative to the body <b>120</b> causes the ring gear <b>211</b> to also rotate clockwise. The teeth of the ring gear <b>211</b> mesh with the teeth of the planet gears <b>212</b> such that the clockwise rotation of the ring gear <b>211</b> causes a clockwise rotation of the planet gears <b>212</b>. The ring gear <b>211</b> to planet gear <b>212</b> gear ratio in the illustrated embodiment is 34:9. Thus, for every 9 rotations of the ring gear, the planet gears rotate 34 times. Although the planet gears <b>212</b> rotate about their axis of rotation, which may coincide with the central axis of their respective coupling means <b>214</b>, the carrier <b>230</b> fixes the location of the planet gears <b>212</b> relative to the body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The teeth of the planet gears <b>212</b> mesh with the teeth of the sun gear <b>213</b> such that the clockwise rotation of the planet gears <b>212</b> causes a counterclockwise rotation of the sun gear <b>213</b>. The illustrated planet gear <b>212</b> to sun gear <b>213</b> gear ratio is 9:16. Thus, for every 16 rotations of the planet gears <b>212</b>, the sun gear <b>213</b> rotates about its axis 9 times. This gear arrangement gives an overall gear ratio, from the ring gear <b>211</b> input to the sun gear <b>213</b> output, of 34:16 or 2.125:1. Thus, as indicated above, for every one rotation of the ring gear <b>211</b>, the sun gear rotates 2.125 times.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The sun gear <b>213</b> connects to the grind shaft <b>410</b> which connects to the rasp <b>460</b> such that the rotation of the sun gear <b>213</b> causes the rasp <b>460</b> to rotate relative to the grind ring <b>440</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The rotation of the rasp <b>460</b> relative to the grind ring <b>440</b> grinds or mills the spices or grains contained within the mill <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The Applicant has surprisingly found that, contrary to conventional understanding, users do not need increased torque to mill grains and spices. Applicants have found that, in certain circumstances, users prefer a mill that increases the output speed of the rasp as compared to the input speed at the turn knob and they easily grind spices and grains, even with the reduction in output torque.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the body assembly <b>300</b> includes a grind assembly <b>350</b> and a grind adjustment assembly <b>370</b>. The grind assembly <b>350</b> includes a grind ring <b>440</b> and a rasp <b>460</b>, among other parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A grind ring frame <b>430</b>, grind ring <b>440</b>, and base capture <b>450</b> can use a series of alignment keys and key slots, along with a flange and a retention mechanism, to hold the grind ring <b>440</b> in place and prevent its rotation relative to the exterior body <b>120</b> of the mill <b>100</b>. The grind ring frame <b>430</b> sits in the interior of the exterior body <b>120</b> and uses keyways <b>437</b> that interface with keys <b>124</b> on the lower interior surface of the exterior body <b>120</b> to prevent the grind ring frame <b>430</b> from rotating. In addition, an upper portion <b>438</b> of the circumference of the grind ring frame <b>430</b> may rest on the shoulder <b>123</b> of the exterior body <b>120</b> (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). This arrangement may prevent the grind ring frame <b>430</b> from moving in a longitudinal direction, e.g., along or parallel to axis âXâ, shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The grind ring frame <b>430</b> may also include a two-sided key <b>431</b>. The two-sided key <b>431</b> may include a first side <b>432</b> configured to interface with keyway <b>451</b> of the base capture <b>450</b> and a second side <b>433</b> configured to interface with the keyway <b>441</b> of the grind ring <b>440</b>. The base capture <b>450</b> may also include keyways <b>458</b> that interface with keys <b>124</b> on the lower interior surface of the exterior body <b>120</b> to prevent the base capture from rotating. In addition, the base capture <b>450</b> may include retention tabs <b>452</b> that interface with recess <b>125</b> to couple the base capture <b>450</b> to the exterior body <b>120</b> and prevent the base capture <b>450</b> from moving in a longitudinal direction. Thus, the lower portion of the exterior body <b>120</b> retains the grind ring frame <b>430</b> and the base capture <b>450</b> and prevents them from moving laterally or rotating with respect to the exterior body <b>120</b>. In addition, the grind ring <b>441</b> is captured between the grind ring frame <b>430</b> and base capture <b>450</b> to prevent longitudinal movement while the keys <b>431</b> interface with the keyway <b>441</b> to prevent the grind ring <b>440</b> from rotating with respect to the body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The rasp <b>460</b> is retained at the end of the grind shaft <b>410</b> and within the rasp ring <b>440</b> by a rasp screw <b>480</b> and rasp cap <b>490</b>. A washer <b>415</b>, spring <b>417</b>, rasp <b>460</b>, and rasp bushing <b>470</b> slide over an end of the grind shaft <b>410</b>. The rasp screw <b>480</b> couples the rasp bushing <b>470</b> to the grind shaft <b>410</b>. The bushing <b>470</b>, in turn, couples the rasp <b>460</b> to the grind shaft <b>410</b>. The rasp <b>460</b> and washer <b>415</b> capture the spring <b>417</b> on the grind shaft <b>410</b>. The grind ring frame <b>430</b> captures the bushing <b>470</b> and prevents it from moving longitudinally up the grind shaft <b>410</b>. In this way, the spring <b>417</b> pushes against the bottom of the grind ring frame <b>430</b>, which is held by the body <b>120</b>, and the top of the rasp <b>460</b> such that the rasp <b>460</b> and the grind shaft <b>410</b> to which it is attached, are pushed downward and away from the grind ring frame <b>430</b>. In addition, the cross-sectional shape of the shaft hole <b>461</b> can be substantially similar to that of the grind shaft <b>410</b> such that rotation of the grind shaft <b>410</b> causes the rasp <b>460</b> to rotate.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Finally, a retention tab <b>491</b> and recess <b>471</b> couple the rasp cap <b>490</b> and rasp bushing <b>470</b> together in an arrangement similar to that of the base capture <b>450</b> and exterior body <b>120</b> coupling.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The mill <b>100</b> may also include a grind adjustment mechanism. Because some recipes or cooking styles require spices and grains ground to different sizes and because preferences among consumers may vary, a single mill may need to grind spices and grains into more than one size. A mill may include a grind adjustment mechanism to adjust the grinding size or coarseness of the ground material. For example, in the embodiment shown in the figures, one embodiment of a grind adjustment mechanism is shown and it includes an external, or accent ring <b>130</b>, an adjuster <b>340</b>, a follower <b>421</b>, a coupler <b>411</b>, and a grind shaft <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The adjuster <b>340</b> includes a set of stepped detents <b>341</b> on which a follower <b>421</b> rides. The follower <b>421</b> may be integrated into a coupler or adjuster frame <b>420</b> for coupling the follower <b>421</b> to a grind shaft <b>410</b>. In some embodiments, the follower <b>421</b> may be directly coupled to the shaft <b>410</b> or integrated into the shaft. In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the frame is coupled to the grind shaft via aperture <b>422</b> and coupler <b>411</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the adjuster frame <b>420</b> includes to two followers <b>421</b>. The followers <b>421</b> are located at opposite ends of the frame <b>420</b> on arms <b>423</b> and may ride in a set of stepped detents <b>341</b> located on radially opposed sides of the adjuster <b>340</b>. Using a set of two followers <b>421</b>, balances the load on the frame <b>420</b> and helps prevent it from jamming.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The arms <b>423</b> of the frame <b>420</b> may be engaged with or pass through slots <b>126</b> in the body <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The grind setting of the mill is adjusted by rotating the accent ring <b>130</b>, which is rotatably coupled to the adjuster <b>340</b> by key <b>131</b>. The key <b>131</b> sits between two protrusions <b>342</b>. Rotating the accent ring <b>130</b> will cause the key <b>131</b> to contact one of the protrusions <b>342</b>, which can thus cause the adjuster <b>340</b> to rotate. When the adjuster <b>340</b> rotates, the follower <b>421</b> rides up or down between the stepped detents <b>341</b>. Rotation of the adjuster <b>340</b> may not cause rotation in the follower <b>421</b> because the slots <b>126</b>, through which the arms <b>423</b> pass, oppose rotation of the arms <b>423</b> and thus the follower <b>421</b>. As the follower <b>421</b> rides up or down on the stepped detents <b>341</b> it acts on the grind shaft <b>410</b> and causes it to translate along the longitudinal axis X of the mill <b>100</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the follower <b>421</b> is part of the frame <b>420</b>, which is coupled to the shaft <b>410</b> via coupler <b>411</b>, which may be an e-clip. Thus, when the follower rides up the stepped detents, the frame <b>420</b> pushes up on the coupler <b>411</b>, which causes the shaft <b>410</b> to translate upward. Riding down on the stepped detents allows the shaft <b>410</b>, which is forced downward by the spring <b>417</b> acting on the rasp <b>460</b>, to translate downward.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The upward and downward translation of the shaft <b>410</b> causes the rasp <b>460</b>, which is coupled to an end of the shaft <b>410</b>, to also translate upward and downward. As explained below, the upward and downward translation of the rasp <b>460</b> causes a distance, for example distance âA,â to change. Distance A may be a distance between a location <b>443</b> on surface <b>442</b> of the grind ring <b>440</b> and a location <b>463</b> on surface <b>462</b> of the rasp <b>460</b>. A small distance A may correspond to the mill <b>100</b> producing finely ground material while a large distance A may correspond to a large or coarsely ground material.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Distance A may change as the rasp <b>460</b> translates longitudinally because it may have a shape, such as a conical shape, that causes the grinding surface <b>462</b> of the rasp <b>460</b> to move away from the grinding surface <b>442</b> of the grind ring <b>440</b> as the rasp <b>460</b> translates downward.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">An at least partially conical shaped rasp <b>460</b> facilitates an increasing distance A as the rasp <b>460</b> translates along the longitudinal axis. This occurs because the diameter of a location on the grind ring <b>440</b>, such as the discharge location <b>443</b>, is fixed, while the diameter of the rasp <b>460</b> located near the discharge location <b>443</b> decreases as the rasp <b>460</b> translates downwards. For example, <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows that location <b>463</b> of the rasp surface <b>460</b> is closest to the discharge location <b>443</b> of the grind ring <b>440</b>, but when the rasp <b>460</b> translates longitudinally downward, location <b>464</b> may be closest to the discharge location <b>443</b>. At location <b>464</b> of the rasp surface <b>462</b>, the rasp <b>460</b> has a smaller diameter than it does at location <b>463</b>. Thus, when location <b>463</b> is closest to the discharge location <b>443</b>, the mill <b>100</b> will grind material more coarsely than when location <b>463</b> is closest to the discharge location <b>443</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Finally, the arrangement of the accent ring <b>130</b> and adjuster <b>340</b> between the body <b>120</b> and the turn knob assembly <b>110</b> allows a user to quickly and easily adjust the grind coarseness. A user simply slides their dominant hand from the handle <b>220</b> to the accent ring <b>130</b>, rotates the accent ring <b>130</b> to adjust the grind, and then slides their hand back to the handle and resumes grinding.</p>
