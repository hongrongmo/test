      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the manufacture of ethanol from corn and more particularly to the conservation of fuel and reduction of costs during the ethanol manufacturing process and during the harvesting and shelling of the corn.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ethanol is blended with gasoline for use as a fuel in vehicles with internal combustion engines. A blend containing 10% ethanol as an additive produces a cleaner burning gasoline. A blend containing 85% ethanol is used as a substitute for gasoline.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Ethanol can be manufactured from a number of domestically grown vegetative materials including corn, sugar cane and sugar beets. The manufacture of ethanol from domestically grown crops reduces the reliance on imported petroleum as a source for fuel for internal combustion engines. Corn is the largest domestically grown crop from which ethanol is manufactured.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Corn in a farm field is conventionally harvested by a combine, a self-propelled piece of equipment which picks the ears of corn from the corn stalks, separates the corn kernels from the corn cobs (shelling) and from the husks on the ears of corn, and returns the cobs and husks to the farm field. The shelled corn is temporarily stored in the combine and then transferred to a vehicle that transports the shelled corn to a storage facility. The cobs and husks that have been returned to the farm field, together with the stalks and leaves left on the field, are collectively known as stover, a material which beneficially helps to build soil and prevent erosion when left in the field.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Combines came into widespread use for harvesting corn in the latter half of the twentieth century. Prior to that, corn was hand picked, or it was picked by a mechanical corn picker that was mounted on or towed by a tractor and that was capable of picking, e.g., one to two rows in a single pass. After the ear corn was picked, it typically was stored on the farm and then shelled by shelling equipment typically mounted on a truck which traveled to the farm and shelled the ear corn on site. The combine replaced both the mechanical picker and the traveling sheller.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Ethanol is made from shelled corn. A multi-stage process is employed to produce ethanol from shelled corn, and some of these stages require heat supplied by the combustion of fuel, typically natural gas. Natural gas is also consumed (a) during the production of nitrogen fertilizer applied to the farm field where the corn is grown and (b) to a lesser extent, during the production of pesticides used on the corn.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Petroleum-based fuels power the vehicles used in the growing and harvesting of corn and in the transporting of corn between the farm fields and the ethanol manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A drawback to conventional processes for producing ethanol from corn resides in the consumption of large quantities of energy during the ethanol manufacturing process and during the growing, harvesting and transporting of the corn. As noted above, this energy is consumed in large part by the combustion of natural gas and of petroleum-based vehicle fuel. When ethanol from corn is produced at a processing plant dedicated exclusively to the production of ethanol, the ratio of (a) the energy available from the ethanol to (b) the energy equivalent of the total fossil fuel input is 1.77. (Total fossil fuel input comprises both natural gas and petroleum-based vehicle fuel.)</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The amount of energy consumed during (i) the conversion of corn to ethanol, at the ethanol manufacturing facility, is about twice the energy consumed in (ii) corn production, which includes the manufacture of fertilizer and pesticides with natural gas, as well as the operation of the farming equipment with petroleum-based fuel. Items (i) and (ii) above together constitute at least 90% of the total energy consumed. The remainder (less than 10%) is consumed in transporting the shelled corn to the ethanol manufacturing facility and in the post-production distribution of the ethanol by truck, rail and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Attempts have been made to conserve the natural gas consumed during the ethanol manufacturing process by replacing the natural gas with a renewable fuel. In one such instance, the fuel was cattle manure from a massive cattle feeding lot next to which the ethanol manufacturing facility was located to eliminate the cost of transporting the manure which could otherwise be a prohibitive expense. There are, however, only a limited number of locations where this type of operation can be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A residual product of the ethanol manufacturing process is a mash known as “stillage” which is dried and sold as animal feed. The dried stillage is also called “dried distiller's grain and solubles” or DDGS.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">There have been proposals to use DDGS, or stover, or a combination of the two, as fuel to produce process heat for the ethanol manufacturing process. In some proposals, the material is used to fuel a cogeneration plant that produces (a) electricity to power equipment employed at the ethanol manufacturing facility and (b) steam for use as the heating medium in stages of the ethanol manufacturing process that require heat. A cogeneration plant is a substantial capital expense.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">With respect to the use of stover as a fuel, there are some drawbacks. The stover has to be gathered from the field and baled for more efficient handling and transportation and then transported to the ethanol manufacturing facility, all of which entails expense and consumes fuel. Moreover, when stover is removed from the field, this deprives the field of the benefits arising when stover is left in the field (soil building and erosion prevention).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As noted above, corn intended for subsequent processing into ethanol is conventionally harvested with a combine that both picks and shells the corn. Seed corn and sweet corn are harvested by another type of self-propelled equipment known as an ear corn harvester which picks the corn but does not shell it. In the case of seed corn, the ear corn, after harvesting, is stored and dried and then shelled by a piece of equipment separate and discrete from the earn corn harvester. This protects the corn kernels that are to be used as seed, from damage that can occur when shelling is performed by a combine. Damaged corn kernels are unsuitable for use as seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In rural corn-growing areas, during the first half of the twentieth century and earlier, corn cobs were used as kindling for coal-burning, home heating furnaces and hot water heaters. In some rural areas, during the depression in the 1930's and during the war years in the 1940's, ear corn was used as a substitute for coal in home heating furnaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Stanfield U.S. Pat. No. 4,139,952 discloses a procedure in which ears of seed corn are dried by heat generated at an incinerator and then shelled to produce (a) kernels of seed corn and (b) corn cobs that are employed as fuel for the incinerator.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">It is possible to produce ethanol from cellulose contained in stover. However, it is currently much more difficult to produce ethanol from stover than from shelled corn, and substantially more expensive. At the present time production of ethanol from stover is not economically attractive.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In the present invention, corn cobs are used as fuel in the ethanol manufacturing process. In the farm field, the combine is replaced by an ear corn harvester. Quantities of ear corn harvested by a plurality of ear corn harvesters are transported to a central shelling station located at or next to, or otherwise associated with, the ethanol manufacturing facility. At the central shelling station, the ear corn is shelled to separate the corn kernels from the corn cobs, the shelled corn is conveyed to the first stage of the ethanol manufacturing process, and the corn cobs are combusted to produce heat for the process</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Compared to conventional practice, energy is conserved in the harvesting of the corn, in the shelling of the corn and in the combustion of fuel to provide heat for the ethanol manufacturing process. Operating costs are reduced at the farm, at the central shelling station and at the ethanol manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Other features and advantages are inherent in the invention claimed and disclosed or will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, much of which is a projection, in conjunction with the accompanying flow diagram.</p>

The cobs from shelling station <b>10</b> may be directly conveyed to combustion chamber <b>20</b>, or they may be held at storage sites adjacent shelling station <b>10</b> or adjacent combustion chamber <b>20</b> or at other storage sites at facility <b>11</b>, for subsequent conveyance to and/or introduction into combustion chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">At first processing stage <b>12</b>, the shelled corn is ground into a fine powder called meal, and the meal is then conducted to a liquefaction stage <b>13</b> where water and an initial enzyme (alpha amylase) are added and mixed with the meal. The resulting mixture is then passed through cookers where heat is applied to liquefy the starch in the meal. The cookers comprise an initial stage at <b>13</b>, where the mixture is cooked at a relatively high temperature (e.g., 100°-150° C.) to reduce bacteria levels in the mixture, followed by a holding stage <b>14</b> where the mixture is maintained at a lower temperature (e.g. 95° C.), with additional heat, if required.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">From holding stage <b>14</b>, the cooked mixture is conducted to a sugar formation stage <b>15</b> where additional (secondary) enzyme is added (e.g., glucoamylase), to convert the starch in the mixture to fermentable sugars (e.g., dextrose). The resulting mixture of sugar and residual material is then conducted to a fermentation stage <b>16</b> where yeast is added to ferment the sugars into ethanol. During fermentation, large quantities of carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) are emitted, and this additional reaction product can be captured, compressed and sold commercially.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Fermentation may be continuous wherein the sugar-containing mixture flows through a series of fermenting sub-stages until the sugars are fully fermented; or fermentation may be conducted as a batch process in which the sugar-containing mixture is held in one fermenting stage for an extended period of time (e.g., 48 hours) until fermentation is complete.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The fermented mixture or mash product at fermentation stage <b>16</b> comprises 10% alcohol plus residual, non-fermentable solids from the corn and from the yeast cells. The mash from fermentation stage <b>16</b> is then directed to a distillation stage <b>17</b> where heat is applied to distill the ethanol from the mash. Typically, the mash is pumped through a continuous flow, multi-stage, distillation system where the ethanol is removed from the solids and separated from the water in the mash to produce 96% strength ethanol which is conducted to a dehydration stage <b>18</b> where the remaining water is removed to give 200 proof, anhydrous (no water) ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The residual mash from distillation stage <b>17</b> is called stillage which may be conducted to a dryer <b>22</b> where heat is applied to remove water and produce a dried product called distillers dried grain and solubles (DDGS) which has value as an animal feed. Undried stillage may also be employed as an animal feed.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The anhydrous ethanol from dehydration stage <b>18</b> is conducted to a denaturing stage <b>19</b> where 2-5% gasoline is added to make the ethanol unfit for human consumption. The resulting product is composed of 95-98% ethanol which is then transported to a blending facility <b>21</b>, typically at a location remote from ethanol manufacturing facility <b>11</b>. At blending facility <b>21</b>, the ethanol is mixed with additional gasoline in appropriate proportions that enable the ethanol to be used either as an additive (e.g., a blend with 10% ethanol) or as a fuel (e.g., 85% ethanol).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The heat for liquefaction and holding stages <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, for distillation stage <b>17</b> and for dryer <b>22</b> is provided by combusting corn cobs from shelling station <b>10</b>. Combustion typically occurs at combustion chamber <b>20</b>, but combustion may also be performed at an auxiliary combustion chamber, e.g., a combustion chamber associated with dryer <b>22</b>. The heating medium for a given heating location may be steam or heated air. The largest part of the total heat requirements for the process is that employed at distillation stage <b>17</b>. Preferably, combustion chamber <b>20</b> is located adjacent distillation stage <b>17</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The ash produced by the combustion of the corn cobs contains minerals which have some value as fertilizer and can be given away for spreading on a farm field <b>23</b> within an economically transportable distance from manufacturing facility <b>11</b>. Otherwise, the ash is transported to a nearby land fill <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Depending upon the quantity of corn cobs produced at the central shelling station, the corn cobs used as fuel replace some or all of the natural gas conventionally used as fuel for the ethanol manufacturing process. Because the corn cobs are a byproduct of the shelling operation conducted at central shelling station <b>10</b>, they constitute fuel obtained free of charge. In contrast, natural gas is relatively expensive, so that the replacement of natural gas by corn cobs produces substantial cost savings.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Moreover, corn cobs are a renewable fuel source obtained by replanting the corn field from which the cobs were harvested (or an equivalent field); natural gas is not renewable. In addition, the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by the combustion of corn cobs is offset by the carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere during the growing of the corn; there is no such offset for the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by the combustion of natural gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Central shelling station <b>10</b> shells ear corn from a multitude of corn fields where the ear corn was previously conventionally shelled by combines that can be replaced by ear corn harvesters when a central shelling station is employed. The combination of ear corn harvesters and a central shelling station provides several advantages compared to combines.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">A typical ear corn harvester can pick six or seven rows of corn in one pass; some models can pick ten rows. (The picking operation is similar to that performed by a combine.) The ears of corn are husked, the husks (and any tramp stover elements) are returned to the field, and the ear corn is conveyed, in one model, to a tiltable dump hopper at the rear of the ear corn harvester. The dump hopper is equipped with a hydraulic lift which is operated to tilt the dump hopper about a high tilt axis to unload the hopper quickly into a truck or semi-trailer having relatively high sides. The quick-unload feature minimizes the time spent by the harvester on activities other than harvesting (i.e., “down time”).</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In another model, the ear corn is conveyed into a dump cart that runs alongside the ear corn harvester. The dump cart is pulled by a tractor and has the same kind of dump hopper with hydraulic lift described in the preceding paragraph, to facilitate quick unloading.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">An ear corn harvester can make a harvesting pass through a corn field at a faster speed than a combine because the speed at which a combine can pick corn is restrained by the rate at which the combine can shell the ear corn the combine has picked. An ear corn harvester has no such restraint and can harvest at cruising speeds, e.g., in the range 18-21 miles per hour. Comparing an ear corn harvester and a combine, each of which can pick the same number of corn rows in a single pass, the ear corn harvester, due to its faster picking speed, will pick a given acreage in a shorter time period than a combine picking the same acreage. Expressed another way, an ear corn harvester can pick a given acreage in the same amount of time as a combine that can pick more rows of corn in a single pass.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The discussion in the following part of this paragraph assumes a situation in which ear corn harvesters and combines each pick the same number of corn rows in a single pass. Given the acreage of corn required to satisfy the annual demand of an ethanol manufacturing facility, that acreage can be harvested during a given harvest season with fewer ear corn harvesters than the number of combines required to harvest the same acreage. As a result, there is less total capital expense when ear corn harvesters are employed, even assuming that an ear corn harvester and a combine cost the same. (Actually, a combine costs more.) There is also less total operational expense, even assuming that the operational expense for a single ear corn harvester is the same as that for a single combine; and there is less total labor expense. Moreover, there is also less total fuel consumed in operating the smaller number of ear corn harvesters, even assuming that a single one of each of the two types of equipment consumes the same amount of fuel during a given period of operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In actuality, an ear corn harvester consumes less fuel than a combine harvesting the same number of corn rows in a single pass. This is because, unlike the combine, the ear corn harvester does not consume the fuel required for operating shelling equipment and does not consume the fuel required for transporting the weight of the shelling equipment up and down rows in the corn field. (It is assumed that the weight of the other equipment on the ear corn harvester and combine (e.g. corn picking equipment and corn storage and unloading structure) weigh substantially the same; any substantial difference in the weight of this other equipment could result in a difference in the amount of fuel consumed.) Although the ear corn harvester operates at a faster speed than the combine when picking corn, the combine runs for a longer period of time to pick the same acreage, so that there is probably no substantial difference in the amount of fuel consumed due to picking corn at different speeds. Some of the energy saving attributable to the absence of a shelling function on an ear corn harvester is offset downstream in shelling ear corn at the central shelling station. However, the shelling equipment at the central shelling station is stationary, and unlike a combine, no energy is expended transporting that shelling equipment up and down corn rows.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As noted above, there is a situation where the number of ear corn harvesters employed is the same as the number of combines. In this situation, the combine is large enough to pick more rows in a single pass than the speedier ear corn harvester; but the ear corn harvester still has a cost advantage over the combine. More particularly, each large combine costs more than an ear corn harvester, and the number of pieces of equipment required to harvest the acreage in question is substantial. Accordingly, there will be a substantial saving in total capital expense when employing ear corn harvesters in lieu of large combines; and there should be less operational expense and less fuel consumed when one employs the ear corn harvesters. Labor expense will be the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Ear corn harvesters of the types described above are available from the following source: Oxbo International Corporation, 7525 Byron Road, Byron, N.Y., 1422-0100. Brochures describing the ear corn harvesters can be obtained from that company's website: www.oxbocorp.com; and the disclosures therein are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The use of a single, central shelling station, instead of shelling with a multitude of combines at each of a multitude of individual corn fields, conserves energy in a number of ways. Each of the multitude of combines employed to shell corn in conventional procedures has its own internal combustion engine which runs on a petroleum-based liquid fuel. A central shelling station would employ the efficiencies of scale to shell the same amount of corn with less fuel, assuming the shelling equipment at the central shelling station was powered by an internal combustion engine. However, the central shelling station would most likely be powered by an electric motor driven by electricity from power lines. The electricity obtained from power lines in the corn-growing Midwest is typically generated at a power plant fueled by coal or nuclear fuel. Natural gas or petroleum-based liquid fuels are generally not employed and are thus conserved when a central shelling station is employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Moreover, even if the central shelling station were powered by an internal combustion engine, the combination of ear corn harvester and central shelling station would still consume less fuel than the use of a combine to both pick and shell corn. More particularly, and as noted above, when shelling with a combine, fuel is consumed not only to operate the shelling equipment on the combine, but also to move the weight attributable to the shelling equipment up and down the corn rows, and this occurs in each of the multitude of corn fields supplying corn to the ethanol manufacturing plant. In contrast, with a central shelling station, the shelling equipment is stationary, and the fuel consumed in moving the shelling equipment in a combine up and down corn rows is conserved. (This is in addition to the fuel that would be conserved at a central shelling station due to efficiencies of scale).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The capital investment in the shelling equipment at a central shelling station will be substantially less than the cumulative capital investment attributable to the shelling equipment in a multitude of combines shelling the same quantity of corn. This is because the shelling equipment in a combine must be large enough to shell, during the relatively short period of time in a harvest season, all of the corn picked by the combine in that season (a mere few weeks). In contrast, the shelling equipment at the central shelling station need only be large enough to shell the same quantity of corn over a year-long period. The central shelling station is, of course, scaled up to handle the quantity of corn previously shelled by a multitude of combines. However, even if one assumes conservatively that the shelling equipment in the combines will be operated for a period of two months, the shelling equipment at a central shelling station operated all year long need only have one-sixth the cumulative shelling capacity of the multitude of combines replaced by the central shelling station. Moreover, as previously noted, the central shelling station conserves the petroleum-based fuel consumed by the combines to move the weight of the shelling equipment thereon up and down rows in the cornfields. Conservation of fuel in this manner can be quite substantial because the weight of the shelling equipment moved up and down corn rows by the combines has six times the shelling capacity of the stationary shelling equipment at the central shelling station.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Of course, all of the above-noted reductions in the consumption of petroleum-based fuel also reduce costs. Moreover, as previously noted, the central shelling station will most likely be powered by electricity. This presents an opportunity for reducing operating expenses by maximizing the operation of the shelling equipment during late night and early morning hours when electricity rates are lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Factors which offset some of the cost savings and fuel conservation described above are the cost of transporting to the central shelling station that part of the ear corn attributable to the weight and/or volume of the corn cobs, and the fuel consumed in doing so. These are incremental items of transportation cost and fuel consumption. The cost of transporting that part of the ear corn attributable to the corn kernels, and the fuel consumed in doing so, were already part of the transportation cost and fuel consumption when shelled corn from combines was transported to the ethanol manufacturing facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Another factor partially offsetting the cost savings described above arises when a farmer raises both corn and soy beans and needs a combine to harvest the soy beans. A farmer who has replaced the combine with an ear corn harvester would need to contract out the combining of soy beans.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">Because of the efficiencies of scale and other factors discussed above, the cost of shelling ear corn at a central shelling station should be substantially less than the cost of employing a multitude of combines to perform the shelling at each of a multitude of corn fields. The savings obtained by eliminating the cost of shelling with a combine at the corn field goes initially to the farmer. The lesser cost of shelling at the central shelling station is borne by the ethanol processor, at least initially. However, the cost of shelling at a central station can be distributed proportionally among the farmers, when computing the price to be paid to the farmers for ear corn, and because the cost of shelling at the central shelling station is less than the cumulative cost of shelling at a multitude of farm fields, the farmers would still come out ahead.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the central shelling station is located either at the site of the ethanol manufacturing facility or adjacent thereto. In each such instance, the central shelling station is deemed to be physically associated with the ethanol manufacturing facility. The central shelling station (CSS) can be physically removed from the ethanol manufacturing facility (EMF) whereby shelled corn and corn cobs have to be transported by truck or rail from the CSS to the EMF, but the two locations can be otherwise associated in accordance with a broader sense of the present invention, so long as a transportation expense criterion described below is met.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">There are two stages of transportation when the central shelling station is not physically associated with the ethanol manufacturing facility: (1) transportation of ear corn to the central shelling station; and (2) transportation of shelled corn and corn cobs from the central shelling station to the ethanol manufacturing facility. Part of the cost of the first transportation stage is attributable to the cost of transporting the unseparated corn cobs in the ear corn, and part of the cost of the second transportation stage is attributable to the cost of transporting the corn cobs from which the shelled corn has been separated. When (a) the combined costs from transportation stages (1) and (2), attributable to transporting the corn cobs, is less than (b) the cost savings obtained by replacing natural gas with corn cobs as the fuel for producing process heat at the ethanol manufacturing facility, the central shelling station is deemed to be associated with the ethanol manufacturing facility in accordance with the broader sense of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">Further with respect to a physically associated central shelling station, in many instances an ethanol manufacturing facility is located in a rural area where it is surrounded by farms (a) that can supply a physically associated central shelling station with ear corn and (b) that are sufficiently close so that the expense of transporting ear corn to the physically associated central shelling station becomes an insignificant factor.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">Preferably, the central shelling station is operated to provide shelled corn to the ethanol manufacturing facility on a just-in-time basis in accordance with the requirements of that facility. This minimizes the need for shelled corn storage space which is typically in the form of reinforced concrete silos, or the like. It also minimizes the need for corn cob storage space, the character of which need be only rudimentary, e.g., three sides of containment walls with one open side for access by material handling equipment, such as a front end loader, and an overhanging roof to protect the cobs from rain or snow.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">To the extent that storage space is required, it will be for ear corn, and the storage requirements for ear corn are not as elaborate (or expensive) as the storage requirements for shelled corn. On the other hand, the footprint and volume of the storage space for a given quantity of ear corn is substantially greater than the foot print and volume of the storage requirements for the shelled corn derived from that quantity of ear corn. However, one does not need a large inventory of ear corn to operate the central shelling station on a just-in-time basis. One need only have (1) a sufficient supply of ear corn in storage to allow operation of the central shelling station at a rate dictated by the demands of the ethanol manufacturing facility together with (2) regular, periodic deliveries of ear corn to replenish the inventory of ear corn depleted by the operation of the central shelling station.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">Ideally, ear corn is delivered to the central shelling station on a just-in-time basis; this would minimize the need for ear corn storage space there. In such a situation, the bulk of the ear corn required by the central shelling station over a year's time would be stored at farms or at an intermediate storage location which performs a function for ear corn akin to that performed by a grain elevator for shelled corn.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">There are benefits to storing corn as ear corn rather than as shelled corn. As noted above, the storage facility for ear corn is less elaborate than the storage facility for shelled corn which must be fully enclosed and protected from the elements. In contrast, ear corn stored on the farm (or at an intermediate storage facility) is stored in a corn crib (or equivalent storage facility) having a floor, a roof and side walls with openings to allow ambient air to circulate through the stored ear corn. Ear corn dries naturally when stored in a corn crib or the like. Depending upon the initial moisture content, drying can be substantial during the first 30 to 60 days of storage in a corn crib or the like. In contrast, shelled corn does not sufficiently dry naturally in its storage facility; instead, shelled corn must be artificially dried with a dryer that burns fuel to provide the drying heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0060">More particularly, with respect to shelled corn and ear corn each harvested from a corn field at the same moisture content, and each stored in its respective storage facility for the same period of time, the ear corn will dry naturally while stored in a corn crib or the like; but shelled corn must be artificially dried to attain the same reduced moisture content as that attained by the ear corn during storage (e.g., 18% moisture or less).</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0061">Shelled corn is dried by a dryer that typically burns natural gas so that the drying process consumes an energy source that is expensive and non-renewable. If ear corn were to be shelled at the central shelling station after being dried artificially at a dryer that burns corn cobs from the sheller (as is done with seed corn in Stansfield U.S. Pat. No. 4,139,952, discussed above in the “Background” section), such a procedure would deprive the ethanol manufacturing process of an inexpensive, renewable fuel, and the corn cobs would have to be replaced there with natural gas. Thus, storing ear corn in a corn crib or the like to reduce the moisture content of the ear corn, before shelling at a central shelling station, conserves energy and reduces expense. As used herein, the term “corn crib or the like” refers to a storage facility for ear corn that allows air to circulate through the ear corn to dry the ear corn naturally. At one time, there was a rat problem associated with the storage of ear corn, but contemporary expedients for dealing with that problem have it under control.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">As noted above, ideally, ear corn is delivered to the central shelling station on a just-in-time basis. In a less-preferred embodiment, a year's supply of ear corn is delivered to the central shelling station over a relatively short period of time, substantially less than a year. If the central shelling station is sized to shell ear corn over a twelve month period, then there must be sufficient storage space to accommodate the ear corn surplus until it can be shelled.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">An alternative solution to the aforementioned scenario would be to increase the size of the central shelling station so that it could shell a year's supply of ear corn in substantially less than a year. This would reduce the storage space requirements for ear corn, but it would increase the storage space requirements for shelled corn and corn cobs. This alternative would also increase the capital expense for the shelling equipment at the central shelling station; but it would not eliminate all of the savings in operating expenses or all of the reduction in energy consumption obtained by employing the combination of ear corn harvesters and central shelling station, all of which is discussed in detail above. For example the stationary central shelling station still conserves the fuel consumed by combines moving the weight of their shelling equipment up and down corn rows, no matter what the size of the central shelling station.</p>
