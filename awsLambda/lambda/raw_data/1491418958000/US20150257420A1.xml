    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Pudding compositions have been known for hundreds of years. The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter, flour, cereal, eggs, and/or suet, resulting in a solid mass. These puddings are baked, steamed or boiled.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Depending on its ingredients, such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Boiled or steamed pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy during the 18th and 19th centuries. Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Within the pudding arts, one important subset are the dessert pudding compositions, such as chocolate pudding. There are two main types: (1) a boiled then chilled, texturally a custard set with starch, version commonly eaten in the U.S., Canada, Sweden, and East and South East Asia; and (2) a steamed/baked, texturally similar to cake, version that is popular in the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The former, custard-like puddings often use starch as a thickener. Early versions of the dish using both egg and flour can be found in the 1918 edition of Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking School Cook Book and in the 1903 edition of Mary Harris Frazer's Kentucky Receipt Book.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Modern puddings are usually made with milk and sugar, flavored with agents (e.g., chocolate and vanilla) and thickened with a starch such as flour or cornstarch. Occasionally, eggs are still used when making chocolate pudding. Usually it is cooked together on the stovetop, but other heating methods exist including microwaving, steaming, baking (sometimes in a bain-marie) or freezing (using gelatin as a thickener). Pudding is commonly purchased ready-made in stores.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Despite the long history and widespread acclaim of pudding compositions, the art has not prepared a cooked Buckwheat pudding. Cream of buckwheat has been prepared. And artisans have explored incorporating raw buckwheat into a variety of food compositions. But, the culinary arts have never prepared a smooth, texturally homogeneous cooked Buckwheat pudding.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Furthermore, the culinary arts have never prepared a vegan, gluten-free, and texturally homogeneous, cooked Buckwheat pudding. Buckwheat offers many advantages over other forms of starch and flour. Buckwheat provides numerous nutritional and flavor advantages. Additionally, the present day cuisine has demonstrated an increasing need for allergen free, vegan food products.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Disclosed herein are buckwheat pudding compositions and methods of making the same. The disclosed pudding compositions provide both health and flavor benefits beyond the existing state of the art.</p>
