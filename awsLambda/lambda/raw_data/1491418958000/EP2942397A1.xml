      <b>Field of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of bioprocess technology, in particular, of bioprocesses using co-cultures of yeast and propionibacterium (<i>i.e., Propionibacterium sp.).</i></p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>Background of the invention</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Waste streams with a high organic chemical oxygen demand (COD) are an ecological burden that has to be dealt with accordingly. These waste streams can be by-products of different industries such as dairy, fruit and vegetable or sugar processing industries. An example is whey that is produced by the dairy industry as a by-product resulting from cheese making. This process results in high volumes of whey (sweet or sour) that have a high COD but on the other hand cannot be easily/economically utilised otherwise, due to the low relatively low content of useful dry content, e.g. milk protein and lactose.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Depending on the process of cheese manufacture the COD value of leftover whey can range from 35,000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L to 100,000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L. The main contributor of the high organic load is lactose, which can represent up to 90% of the COD value. In the case of sour whey the presence of lactic acid even increases this problem. Lactose also represents about 75% of the whey dry matter and as such can be exploited by processes utilizing microorganisms. Several solutions of whey utilisation have been studied, such as bioethanol and biogas production, extraction of lactose or proteins, production of organic acids or biomass, but there is still a need of an economical way of whey utilisation.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">
      <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="WO2011140649A"><text>WO 2011/140649</text></patcit> describes the utilization of whey by a mixed culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast for the production of edible biomass. The process can successfully decrease the COD load of whey, but the final product has little commercial value.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Whey can be used for the cultivation of bacteria from the genus <i>Propionibacterium sp.,</i> belonging to the order of Actinomycetales (<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="b"><text>Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (1st Edition, 1986</text></nplcit><i>))</i>. <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> are known producers of valuable products such as organic acids (propionic and acetic acid), vitamin B12 and bifidogenic compounds. While <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> can be successfully cultivated on whey they cannot lower the COD load satisfactorily as they produce organic acids which accumulate in the fermented (spent) whey and contribute significantly toward the final COD load. In the following, the terms <i>"Propionibacterium sp."</i> and "propionibacterium" are used interchangably.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Co-cultures of <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> and other bacteria are known to be able to decrease the COD load of the spent medium (Miyano et al., 2000), but such processes have the disadvantage of not being food grade and as such being exempt from being used inside food processing plants.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The metabolites produced by <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> are known to inhibit the growth of other microorganisms, especially fungi, and their use in food-spoilage prevention is well known. <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="US5260061A"><text>US 5,260,061</text></patcit> describes the application of <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> metabolites for food applications to inhibit the growth of yeast. <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="WO2008030089A"><text>WO 2008/030089</text></patcit> describes co-cultivation of <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> with yeast for the purpose of obtaining good flavour/aroma characteristics in the cheese making process. In this case, <i>Propionibacterium sp.</i> was used to control and finally inhibit the growth of yeast in the mixed culture as the yeast cell applied was not tolerant to growth-inhibiting substances from <i>Propionibacterium sp..</i></p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In view of the above stated prior art, it is an object of the invention to provide novel bioprocesses for producing valuable biotechnological products from sweet or sour whey where the final spent fermentation media exhibit a relatively low COD. Another object of the invention is to provide fungal cells useful in processes of the invention.</p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">
      <b>Summary of the invention.</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention meets the objectives stated above by providing novel fungal cells, preferably yeast cells, which are capable of growing in co-cultivation with propionibacterium. Such fungal cells or cells may be characterized/defined by their ability to grow on stationary-phase supernatant (spent medium) resulted after propionibacterium cultivation. The present invention also relates to biotechnological processes using such fungal cells which can grow in the presence of said medium in co-culture with propionibacterium.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Hence, a first aspect of the present invention relates to fungal cell capable of growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Such a fungal cell can reproducibly be obtained by mutagenesis/selection procedures described in this patent application. Fungal cells, in particular yeast cells, having the capability of growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a <i>propionibacterium</i> cultivation are useful for the reduction of the COD load of waste materials from fermentation processes according to the invention. Such fungal cells (in particular such yeast cells) were heretofore not available to the person skilled in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Fungal cells of the invention can easily be identified and distinguished from other fungal cells by procedures disclosed herein below. In particular, a well-defined cultivation medium and well defined cultivation conditions of propionibacterium therein are disclosed for testing the capability of a fungal cell of "growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation", according to the invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Hence, in a preferred embodiment, the stationary-phase supernatant, (to be used for testing whether the fungal cell is one according to the invention) is obtained from a stationary culture of <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</i> cultivated under anaerobic conditions at 35Â°C and pH 6.5 in a medium consisting of 60 g/L sweet whey powder, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 40 mg/L calcium D-pantothenate. Preferably, the sweet whey powder has food-grade quality, and preferably it contains at least 63%wt. lactose, at least 10%wt. protein and at most 5%wt. water.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The capability of growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation, the cultivation of fungal (yeast) culture can be defined in terms of the maximum growth rate achieved by the fungal cell when growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation. Hence, in another preferred embodiment, said capability of growing of said fungal cell in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation is defined as the capability of said fungal cell of growing on said stationary-phase supernatant at a maximum growth rate (Âµ<sub>max</sub>) of at least 0.02 h<sup>-1</sup>. Methods of determining the growth rate of a microorganism in culture are well known in the art.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The stationary culture state of a propionibacterium culture may be indicated by a constant concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid in the culture medium over time when the culture is not exposed to aeration. In another embodiment, the stationary state of the propionibacterium culture is indicated by a constant cell density of propionibacterium (in g(DW)/L) over time.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the ability of the fungal cell to grow in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation is tested in the test method described in Example 2, herein below.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The preferred fungal cell is a yeast cell.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In one embodiment, the yeast cell is the yeast cell deposited on 14.1.2014 at Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) under accession number DSM 28271.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A second aspect of the invention relates to a process for producing a biotechnological product, said process comprising co-cultivation of propionibacterium and a fungal cell in a cultivation medium. The fungal cell is preferably capable of growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The fungal cell is preferably a yeast cell, such as a fungal cell according to the invention, as described hereinabove and below.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The biotechnological product is preferably one which is produced by propionibacterium.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">A preferred biotechnological product is vitamin B 12.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment, the process includes a first phase with no aeration followed by a second phase in which aeration occurs. Preferably, both the phases are at least 24 hours, or 48 hours, or 72 hours long.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In a preferred embodiment, at least 90% of the growth of the propionibacterium [in % gram dry weight] occurs during said first phase without aeration.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In another preferred embodiment, at least 90% of the growth of the fungal cell [in % gram dry weight] occurs during said second phase in which aeration occurs.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In another preferred embodiment, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the cultivation medium is reduced to a level of equal to or less than 25%, preferably equal to or less than 10%, or equal to or less than 1%, of the initial COD of the cultivation medium.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In another preferred embodiment, the cultivation medium is (or comprises) whey. The cultivation medium is or comprises, e.g., sweet whey, or sour whey.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Preferably, in processes of the invention, said fungal cell is added at or after the point in time when said propionibacterium has reached at least 90% of its maximum cell density [g(DW)/L] in the culture. In other embodiments of the process of the invention, the fungal cell is added when or after the propionibacterium has reached its stationary growth phase.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The invention further relates to a method of making a propionibacterium-tolerant fungal strain, such as a propionibacterium-tolerant yeast strain. The method comprises: <ol><li>1. Obtaining a starting fungal strain.</li><li>2. Exposing the starting fungal strain to a mutagenic agent and/or to a mutagenic condition.</li><li>3. Cultivating the exposed fungal strain of step 2 in the presence of first concentrations of acetic acid and/or (preferably "and") propionic acid.</li><li>4. Optionally exposing said cultivated fungal strain of step 3 to a mutagenic agent and/or to a mutagenic condition and cultivating said optionally exposed fungal strain in the presence second concentrations of acetic acid and/or (preferably "and") propionic acid, wherein said second concentrations are preferably higher than said first concentrations, respectively.</li><li>5. Exposing the cultivated fungal strain of step 3 or 4 to a mutagenic agent and/or to a mutagenic condition.</li><li>6. Cultivating the exposed fungal strain of step 6 in a medium comprising stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation.</li><li>7. Optionally repeating step 7 with increasing concentrations of the stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation.</li><li>8. Thereby obtaining a fungal cell capable of growing in a stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation.</li></ol></p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A preferred mutagenic agent in accordance with the invention is ethyl methanesulfonate. Any other mutagenic agent, i.e. chemical or physical can however be used which increases the frequency of mutation occurrence. Known mutagenic agents which can be used in the above method include: Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide; deaminating agents, for example nitrous acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); alkylating agents such as ethylnitrosourea or methyl methanesulfonate; guanine; nitrosamines; nitrosoguanidine; mustard gas; vinyl chloride; aromatic amines; amides; 2-acetylaminofluorene; alkaloid from plants; such as those from Vinca species; bromine; compounds that contain bromine in their chemical structure; sodium azide; benzene. Suitable mutagenic conditions or physical mutagens are, e.g., UV irradiation, exposure to X-ray, and/or exposure to radioactivity.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The skilled person will appreciate that steps 2 to 4 above can be omitted, e.g., if the starting strain in step 1 is already sufficiently tolerant to acetic acid and/or propionic acid, or otherwise able to grow in a medium comprising stationary-phase supernatant of a propionibacterium cultivation. In this case the starting strain from step 1 is directly exposed to the mutagenic agent and/or condition in step 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A further aspect of the present invention relates to a fungal strain obtained by the above method.</p>

    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The expression "supernatant", or "culture supernatant", in the context of the present invention, means the liquid obtained when filtrating or centrifuging a fermentation broth, thus removing cells and other insoluble material. The supernatant contains any nutrients and other components of the culture medium not (yet) consumed by the microorganism or degradation products, and any products produced by the microorganism during fermentation.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">"Culture medium" shall be understood as being a nutrient-containing medium in which a microorganism can grow. Liquid culture media are preferred.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">"Broth" or "fermentation broth" shall be understood as referring to a culture medium in which a microorganism grows, or has grown. A broth may comprise non-used nutrients and/or products produced by the microorganism.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A "stationary-phase supernatant" or "spent medium", in accordance with the present invention shall be understood as being a supernatant from a stationary-phase fermentation broth.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The stationary phase shall be understood the phase of the cultivation in which the microorganism has substantially ceased to grow, e.g., the microorganism has reached its maximum cell density during the cultivation. The stationary phase of a cultivation can also be detected by monitoring the concentration of fermentation products. In one embodiment the stationary phase of a propionibacterium cultivation is defined as the phase starting from the point in time at which the concentration of acetic acid and/or propionic acid have reached its maximum value, or alternatively have reached 90% of its maximum value.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">"Whey" is a by-product in the dairy industry, which separates from milk after curdling, when rennet or an acidic substance is added or formed <i>in situ.</i> "Sweet whey" is manufactured during the making of rennet types of hard cheese like cheddar or Swiss cheese. "Acid whey", or "sour whey" is a by-product produced during the making of acid types of dairy products such as cottage cheese or strained yogurt.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The "chemical oxygen demand" or "COD" shall be understood as being the chemical oxygen demand as determined by ISO 6060:1989 standard method. It is understood that a sample may have to be diluted with water, if the COD to be determined is above the allowed maximum COD of 700 mg/L, according to this method. The COD is then calculated from the determined COD by multiplication with the dilution factor.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The present invention provides fungal cells, tolerant to co-cultivation with propionibacterium. This invention also provides a process of co-cultivating propionibacterium and a fungal cell, which cell is tolerant to inhibitory compounds produced by propionibacterium.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The invention provides fungal cells, which are capable of growing in the presence of propionibacterium and their inhibitory metabolites. These cells are obtained by procedures of selection of naturally occurring random mutants of generally available fungal cells on growth substrates in which propionibacterium has been previously cultivated. Preferably, selection of such tolerant fungal cells is carried out in at least two steps. In the first step random mutants of fungal cells are selected that can tolerate higher concentrations of organic acids, for example acetic acid and propionic acid. In the second step, random mutants of these acid-tolerant cells are subjected to additional round of selection on used growth medium in which propionibacterium has been previously cultivated and reached stationary phase of growth. Preferably the fungal cells, provided by this invention are yeast cells.</p>

      <i>The fermentation medium</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The fermentation medium can be any suitable fermentation medium in which both propionibacterium and fungal cells can grow. For example the fermentation medium may comprise molasses or whey. The fermentation medium may be composed of waste streams from different industries (such as whey) to which specific additives (such as minerals, vitamins, nitrogen and additional carbon sources, precursors etc.) may be added to increase the growth rate or the formation of desired products. The medium can contain different carbon sources such as glucose, lactose, fructose, lactic acid and nitrogen sources such as ammonium sulphate, amino acids, peptides and proteins that are suitable for propionibacterium. The pH value of the fermentation medium may be adjusted at the beginning of the process or can be maintained during the fermentation process to allow good growth of propionibacterium and/or product formation.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The medium is normally treated by a process to inactivate a sufficient proportion of microorganisms that would be initially present in the fermentation medium, before the inoculation with propionibacterium. These processes can be sterilization/pasteurization, e.g., autoclaving, filtration, irradiation and/or chemical treatments.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The cultivation vessel or fermenter should be prepared by a method that enables the removal of a sufficient proportion of microorganisms initially present and then filled with the fermentation medium. The cultivation vessel to be used in processes of the invention can be very simple, as long as it can maintain a desired temperature, and can maintain adequate stirring to prevent large pH or nutrient gradients. It can ideally withhold slight overpressure.</p>
    <heading id="h-00007-en">
      <i>Inoculation with Propionibacterium</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The inoculum with propionibacterium can consist of one or several stages depending on the final seed culture volume and the process used. The inoculum may be prepared in a medium that supports the growth of propionibacterium. The inoculum is cultivated at the preferred temperature for the desired time after which it can be used to inoculate the fermentation medium. The inoculation volumes for subsequent stages of the inoculum or the fermentation stage can range from 1 to 20 %.</p>
    <heading id="h-00008-en">
      <i>Fermentation without aeration</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The fermentation broth is first maintained without aeration at the desired temperature for optimal growth or product formation. The temperature can be in the range of 25Â°C to 40Â°C, preferably at 35Â°C. If sugars are present in the fermentation medium the pH value should be maintained at the desired level, which can range from 5.5 to 8.0, preferably at 6.5. The pH can be maintained by several different acids/bases such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HCl, NaOH, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, etc. The bioprocess can be carried out without aeration or can be maintained under CO<sub>2</sub> and/or N<sub>2</sub> sparging and/or overpressure. Cultivation under CO<sub>2</sub> overpressure is favoured.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Stirring of the fermentation medium should be sufficient to prevent large pH gradients and can be performed but not limited by Rushton turbines, marine propellers or an internal and/or external recirculation pump.</p>

      <i>Switch to aerobic conditions</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">After the nutrients consumable by propionibacterium are exhausted the culture can be switched to aerobic conditions. The air can be introduced into the cultivation vessel and should be sufficient for the growth of yeast described below. The aeration rate also influences the rate that yeast metabolises organic acids produced by propionibacterium.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Additional supplements may be introduced at this time that either influence the properties of the broth (i.e. antifoam), influence the formation of products produced by propionibacterium (i.e. 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole) or influence the growth or product formation of yeast (nitrogen sources, precursors etc.).</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">After the culture has been switched to aerobic conditions the pH should again be maintained at the desired level. The pH value can range from 5.5 to 8, preferably at 6.5 to enable good growth of yeast.</p>
    <heading id="h-00010-en">
      <i>Inoculation of the propionibacterium-tolerant yeast cell</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The inoculum of the tolerant yeast cell can consist of one or several stages depending on the final volume of the seed culture. The yeast inoculum is prepared in a medium that supports the growth of yeast. The inoculum is cultivated at the preferred temperature for the desired time. The yeast inoculum can then be used to inoculate the fermentation medium with cultivated propionibacterium after it has been switched to aerobic conditions. The inoculation volumes for subsequent stages of the inoculum or the final stage can range but are not limited to 1 to 20 %. Preferably the yeast inoculum represents 5% of the final volume.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">
      <i>Continuation of the fermentation by the resulting co-culture of microorganisms</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The fermentation broth is maintained at the desired temperature and the pH value is constantly maintained at the desired level by the addition of the appropriate acid or base. Stirring and aeration should be maintained at required levels to ensure complete utilization of organic acids. The amount of aeration and/or mixing influences the metabolism of organic acids by yeast.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Additional supplements can also be introduced at this time that either influence the properties of the broth (i.e. antifoam), influence the formation of products produced by propionibacterium or influence the growth or product formation of yeast. The COD value of the supernatant of the fermentation broth and yield of a valuable product, produced by either propionibacterium or yeast cells are monitored to achieve desired properties of the broth. Using such co-cultivation procedure the COD value of the supernatant of the broth can be decreased to less than 20000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L, preferably to less than 15000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L, more preferably to less than 10000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L and even more preferably to less than 5000 mg O<sub>2</sub>/L. If the selected high-value product is vitamin B12, the yield of vitamin B12 can be more than 5 mg/L, preferably more than 10 mg/L, more preferably more than 20 mg/L and even more preferably more than 100 mg/L.</p>

      <i>Downstream processing of the fermentation broth</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">After the organic acids are consumed and COD of the supernatant reaches a satisfactory level, the bioprocess is stopped. Mixed propionibacterium/yeast biomass together with insoluble components of the broth can be separated from the supernatant by centrifugation, filtration or any other suitable method. The supernatant has low COD and presents a small burden if disposed to the water treatment plant or, in an ideal case, the COD is low enough that it can be disposed directly into the environment. If the biomass is enriched with valuable substances, such as vitamins and proteins, particularly vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, these substances can be used as an additive to animal feed. Alternatively, the biomass can be used as a starting material for isolation of valuable substances, such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> in any form (e.g. cyanocobalamin or methylcobalamin). Depending on the grade of purity, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> can be used as an additive for animal feed or as a pharmaceutical or dietary supplement for human consumption.</p>

      <i>Example 1 - Preparation of propionibacterium-tolerant yeast cells</i>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The yeast <i>Candida utilis</i> NRRL Y-7586 was cultivated in YEPD medium consisting of yeast extract (20 g/L), peptone (20 g/L) and dextrose (10 g/L) at 35Â°C for 72 hours, washed twice with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) and exposed to an adequate dose of an mutagenic agent (ethyl methanesulfonate) to obtain a 99.9% kill rate. Any other suitable fungal cell or yeast cell can be used. The surviving cells were cultivated in a medium containing yeast extract (10 g/L) and acetic and propionic acid at the minimal inhibitory concentration. After three days of cultivation at 35Â°C an aliquot from this broth was transferred to YEPD medium, left to grow for 72 hours and subjected to another round of mutagenesis. The surviving cells are then cultivated in a medium containing yeast extract (10 g/L) and an increased concentration of acetic and propionic acid (relative to the previous round). This procedure was iteratively repeated until the yeast was able to tolerate high concentrations of acetic and propionic acids (i.e. yeast able to grow and consume acetic and propionic acid in concentrations of 15 g/L). In this way the strain <i>C</i>. <i>utilis</i> ABLMCU1 was obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">With the resulting <i>C</i>. <i>utilis</i> strain (ABLMCU1), which was tolerant to high concentrations of acetic and propionic acids, a similar mutagenesis/selection scheme was used, this time using diluted stationary-phase supernatant from fermentation of propionibacterium as the inhibitory agent. In more detail, <i>C</i>. <i>utilis</i> cells, previously selected to be tolerant to organic acids, were grown in YEPD medium, subjected to ethyl methanesulfonate and subsequently cultivated on a medium which was a mixture of the stationary-phase supernatant obtained from fermentation of <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</i> strain ABLM1700 in whey (whey, 5 g/L yeast extract, 20 mg/L CoCl<sub>2</sub>, <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</i> cultivated for 96 hours at 35Â°C, supernatant hereinafter referred to as medium "As") and the medium used for the development of yeast cells tolerant to organic acids (i.e. acetic acid (15 g/L), propionic acid (15 g/L) and yeast extract (10 g/L) (herein referred to as medium "Bs"). These media were mixed in a ratio of As:Bs = 3:7, which was above the level where ABLMCU1 yeast cells were able to grow. After 72 hours an aliquot of the resulting <i>C</i>. <i>utilis</i> culture was transferred to YEPD, grown and again exposed to ethyl methanesulfonate and subsequently transferred to the mixture of the media As and Bs at a higher ratio of As:Bs, namely 4:6. This procedure was repeated until yeast colonies were obtained, which were tolerant to undiluted stationary-phase supernatant of a fermentation of propionibacterium (100% As). The resulting yeast strain was deposited on 14 January 2014 at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and is available under accession number DSM 28271.</p>
    <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The procedure described above resulted in a propionibacterium-tolerant <i>C</i>. <i>utilits</i> strain. It should be noted, however, that a similar procedure was used successfully to produce other propionibacterium-tolerant strains, i.e., starting from a different yeast strain. For example, <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> Y-17597 strain was treated in a similar procedure and resulted in propionibacterium-tolerant fungal strains according to the invention. The procedure was hence shown to be reproducible and applicable to other yeast strains.</p>
