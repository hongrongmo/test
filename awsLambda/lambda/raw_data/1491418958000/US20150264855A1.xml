      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to garden tools. More specifically, the present invention provides a garden tool adapted for use in removing weeds and weed roots. The garden tool comprises an elongated shaft having a handle at a first end thereof and a tool head at a second end thereof, wherein the handle is disposed at an angle relative to a vertical plane. The tool head comprises a ledge on which pressure can be applied to drive the tool head into the ground, and one or more arcuate tines extending from the ledge that are adapted to penetrate the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Lawns and gardens must be carefully maintained in order to eliminate weeds and to inhibit the growth of weeds. Weeds can be difficult to remove by hand because many weeds have roots that extend deep into the soil. As a result, people are typically unable to fully remove the weed and its roots by hand. The user may remove only part of the weed, allowing the roots to remain in place. This is problematic as the weed is not fully removed and may continue to sprout or develop.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventional garden tools may be used to try to more easily remove weeds and their roots from the ground. However, such garden tools can be difficult to use and are not well suited to removing weeds with deep roots. People may have difficulty applying sufficient force to the garden tool to penetrate the surface of the ground in order to position the garden tool underneath the weed. Further, garden tools do not include a tool head having the correct shape that allows the tool head to extend underneath the weed. Thus, a garden tool that allows a person to more easily remove weeds and their roots is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Devices have been disclosed in the prior art that relate to garden tools. These include devices that have been patented and published in patent application publications. These devices generally relate to garden tool and weed removal tools. U.S. Pat.

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Reference is made herein to the attached drawings. Like reference numerals are used throughout the drawings to depict like or similar elements of the garden tool. For the purposes of presenting a brief and clear description of the present invention, the preferred embodiment will be discussed as used for facilitating the removal of weeds and the roots thereof. The figures are intended for representative purposes only and should not be considered to be limiting in any respect.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a perspective view of the garden tool of the present invention. The garden tool <b>11</b> comprises an elongated shaft <b>12</b> having a first end <b>13</b> and a second end <b>14</b>. The shaft <b>12</b> is preferably cylindrical in shape but may include alternate configurations, such as a square cross section. Further, the shaft <b>12</b> is preferably substantially linear in configuration. The first end <b>13</b> includes a handle <b>15</b> thereon for a user to grasp in order to manipulate and operate the garden tool <b>11</b>. The handle <b>15</b> preferably includes a substantially triangular shape with a central opening. In this way, the user can grasp the upper end of the handle <b>15</b> and can wrap his or her fingers there around. The handle <b>15</b> can be integral with the elongated shaft <b>12</b> or can be permanently fastened thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The second end <b>14</b> of the elongated shaft <b>12</b> includes a tool head thereon comprising a ledge <b>16</b> having one or more tines <b>17</b> extending therefrom. The ledge <b>16</b> is an elongated member that is substantially perpendicular to the elongated shaft <b>12</b>. The ledge <b>16</b> has a substantially rectangular configuration in the illustrated embodiment. The ledge <b>16</b> preferably includes a curved or rounded upper surface <b>18</b> as best illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> so that the ledge <b>16</b> does not have any sharp or pointed corners that may cause injury to the user in the event that his or her foot slips off of said ledge <b>16</b>. Similarly, the outer ends of the ledge <b>16</b> may be rounded or squared depending upon the embodiment. The elongated shaft <b>12</b> is centrally positioned on said ledge <b>16</b>. In operation, the user can apply pressure to the ledge <b>16</b> in order to drive the tines <b>17</b> into the ground. Thus, the user can step on the ledge <b>16</b> with his or her foot and can press downward thereon. The tines <b>17</b> are preferably of sufficient durability and strength as to be able to penetrate the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In the illustrated embodiment, the tool head is depicted as having a pair of tines <b>17</b>, however, in alternate embodiments the tool head may include a single tine or a plurality of tines. The tines <b>17</b> are arcuate and include a slight curvature to allow the tines <b>17</b> to extend underneath a weed to be removed. The curvature is slight so that the tines <b>17</b> can be easily driven into the ground, and if the tines <b>17</b> were curved to a greater extent, the tines <b>17</b> would be difficult to drive into the ground. The tines <b>17</b> are substantially identical in structure and are preferably parallel to one another. Further, the tines <b>17</b> are arranged in a row along the underside of the ledge <b>16</b> and are separated from one another by a space. In embodiments of the garden tool <b>11</b> having multiple tines <b>17</b>, the tines <b>17</b> are spaced at a fixed interval. The tines <b>17</b> preferably have a circular cross section, but may include a square cross section in alternate embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, there are shown side and front views of the garden tool of the present invention, respectively. The tines <b>17</b> of the garden tool <b>11</b> are preferably arcuate in configuration and include a pointed end <b>19</b>. The pointed end <b>19</b> facilitates insertion of the tines <b>17</b> into the ground. Further, when the tines <b>17</b> are inserted into the ground, the slight curvature allows the tines <b>17</b> to extend underneath a weed desired to be removed, allowing the user to obtain greater leverage on the weed and its roots. However, in alternate embodiments, the tines <b>17</b> may be substantially linear in configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a view of the garden tool of the present invention in use. In operation, a user can hold the handle <b>15</b> of the garden tool <b>11</b> and can position the tines <b>17</b> for insertion into the ground adjacent to a weed <b>31</b>. The user can step on the ledge <b>16</b> and can press his or her foot downward thereon in order to drive the tines into the ground. As the tines <b>17</b> enter the ground, the tines <b>17</b> extend underneath the weed <b>31</b> and towards the roots <b>32</b> thereof. The tines <b>17</b> allow the elongated shaft <b>12</b> to maintain an upright orientation. The user can then tilt the elongated shaft <b>12</b> into a downward angle in order to cause the tines <b>17</b> to pull upward on the roots <b>32</b> and the weed <b>31</b>. In this way, the user can more easily remove weeds <b>31</b> and the roots <b>32</b> thereof from the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">It is therefore submitted that the instant invention has been shown and described in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made within the scope of the invention and that obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p>
