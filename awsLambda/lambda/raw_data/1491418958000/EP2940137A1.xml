    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">High blood pressure is a major factor for the development of, for example, coronary artery disease, cerebral apoplexy (stroke), chronic renal disease, and the like. Accordingly, the prevention of high blood pressure is important in view of social and public health. High blood pressure (hypertension) is a multifactorial disorder, meaning the development thereof may be induced by a number of factors, and these factors inducing high blood pressure are collectively known as risk factors. Risk factors for high blood pressure can be broadly classified into environmental factors and genetic factors, and it is thought that the interactions among these factors play an important role.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Among the risk factors, examples of the environmental factors include aging, obesity, stress, and excessive intake of salt. On the other hand, as the genetic factors, a variety of hypertension-susceptibility genes are known. Here, the term "hypertension-susceptibility gene" refers to a gene which increases the risk of developing hypertension. In other words, people who have (a) hypertension-susceptibility gene(s) are more likely to develop hypertension than those who do not have (a) hypertension-susceptibility gene(s). With respect to multifactorial disorders such as hypertension, it is thought that many of the susceptibility genes are alleles of polymorphisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP).</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As the hypertension-susceptibility genes containing genetic polymorphisms, various genes have been reported to date including those encoding angiotensinogen, α-adducin, G protein β3 subunit, β2-adrenoceptor, glycoprotein Ia (GPIa), chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), apolipoprotein C (ApoC-III), G-protein β3 subunit (GPβ3), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), glycoprotein Ib α (GPIbα), C-type natriuretic hormone (CNP), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1) and SCNN1A (for example, refer to Patent Documents 1 to 4). Moreover, in recent years, the CYP17 gene (rs6162) polymorphism, the EXOSC3 gene (rs7158) polymorphism, the ACCN1 gene (rs28933) polymorphism, the KCNMB4 gene (rs710652) polymorphism, the KCNIP2 gene (rs755381) polymorphism, the ATP2A3 gene (rs887387) polymorphism, the RAC2 gene (rs929023) polymorphism, the CD3EAP gene (rs967591) polymorphism, the CALCR gene (rs1042138) polymorphism, the ATP10D gene (rs1058793) polymorphism, the GNA14 gene (rs1801258) polymorphism, the PTHR1 gene (rs1869872) polymorphism, the ATP2B1 gene (rs2070759) polymorphism, the HLA-DMB gene (rs2071556) polymorphism, the SLC13A1 gene (rs2140516) polymorphism, the SLC2A11 gene (rs2236620) polymorphism, the GNAI2 gene (rs2236943) polymorphism, the CACNA2D2 gene (rs2236957) polymorphism, the PRKWNK1 gene (rs2255390) polymorphism, the SLC22A7 gene (rs2270860) polymorphism, the KCNN1 gene (rs2278993) polymorphism, the SLC21A6 gene (rs2291075) polymorphism, the CACNA1E gene (rs2293990) polymorphism, the SLC26A8 gene (rs2295852) polymorphism, the ERCC1 gene (rs2298881) polymorphism, the DLGAP2 gene (rs2301963) polymorphism, the COL4A1 gene (rs2305080) polymorphism, the GUCA1C gene (rs2715709) polymorphism, the ATP10C gene (rs3736186) polymorphism, the HCN4 gene (rs3743496) polymorphism, the PTPRT gene (rs3746539) polymorphism, the FGF2 gene (rs3747676) polymorphism, the CHGA gene (rs3759717) polymorphism, the PPP1R1B gene (rs3764352) polymorphism, the ADORA1 gene (rs3766554) polymorphism, the RGS19IP1 gene (rs3815715) polymorphism and the RGS20 gene (rs3816772) polymorphism have been reported as hopeful candidates as hypertension-susceptibility gene polymorphisms (for example, refer to Patent Document 5).</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An object of the treatment for high blood pressure is to lower the blood pressure in order to prevent the development of coronary artery disease or the like caused by high blood pressure.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The treatment methods can be broadly classified into the reduction of risk factors for hypertension through the improvements of lifestyle habits such as eating habits and the administration of antihypertensive drugs. The risk of developing hypertension for each patient is usually first assessed, followed by determination of the target blood pressure and treatment method based on the assessed results and the patients' actual blood pressure. For example, firstly, based on the patients' (systolic blood pressure)/(diastolic blood pressure), patients are classified as having mild hypertension (from 140 to 159 mmHg)/(from 90 to 99 mmHg), moderate hypertension (from 160 to 179 mmHg)/(from 100 to 109 mmHg) and severe hypertension (≥ 180 mmHg)/(≥ 110 mmHg), and then the risk for each patient is assessed with taking risk factors other than blood pressure into account. For instance, patients having mild hypertension with no other risk factors are classified into a low risk group, patients having mild hypertension and several moderate risk factors are classified into an intermediate risk group, and patients having mild hypertension but also having high risk factors such as diabetes are classified into a high risk group. In those cases where patients are in a low risk group or intermediate risk group, they are usually made to first alter their lifestyle habits for a certain period of time, and then put on medication if their blood pressure did not fall satisfactorily. However, the patients in a high risk group are made to alter their lifestyle habits for a certain period of time, while being put on medication at the same time. In other words, even among the patients with comparable blood pressure, treatment methods are not necessarily the same, and an adequate treatment method is appropriately selected depending on the risk factors of each patient. For this reason, it is extremely important to properly evaluate the risk of developing hypertension.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008"> The majority of risk factors do not necessarily pull the triggers for the development of hypertension on their own. Especially in those cases where the hypertension-susceptibility genes classified as the genetic factors are concerned, it has been thought that hypertension develops as a result of the interactions among several hypertension-susceptibility genes that are present. Accordingly, when evaluating the risk of developing hypertension, patients with a large number of hypertension-susceptibility genes are more likely to be classified into a high risk group. Therefore, it is thought that the risk of developing hypertension can be evaluated more properly by examining the presence and absence of as many hypertension-susceptibility genes as possible. However, numerous hypertension-susceptibility genes have already been reported, and it is not preferable to examine all these genes from the viewpoints of both swift evaluation and economic efficiency. In addition, because the correlation between the presence/absence of hypertension-susceptibility genes and the actual development of hypertension differs among various hypertension-susceptibility genes, when a risk assessment is made based on a hypertension-susceptibility gene with which the above-mentioned correlation is relatively low, a highly reliable evaluation cannot be obtained. <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="JP2004222503A"><text>2004-222503</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="JP2004113094A"><text>2004-113094</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 3] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="JP2004033051A"><text>2004-33051</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 4] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00005" dnum="JP2004024125A"><text>2004-24125</text></patcit></li><li>[Patent Document 5] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00006" dnum="JP2007143504A"><text>2007-143504</text></patcit></li></ul></p>
    <heading id="h-00003-en">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
    <heading id="h-00004-en">PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">That is, in order to properly evaluate the risk of developing hypertension, it is preferable to use a useful hypertension-susceptibility gene that is highly correlated with the development of hypertension as a genetic marker. Further, it is more preferable to combine several useful hypertension-susceptibility genes and use them as genetic markers, as long as the number of these genes is within a range so that they can be actually examined clinically. However, regarding the hypertension-susceptibility genes that have been reported to date, although the correlation between their presence/absence and the development of hypertension has been observed, the level of correlation may not be very high, and very few combinations of hypertension-susceptibility genes which may further enhance the reliability of risk assessment have been found.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a genetic marker including a SNP whose presence/absence is highly correlated with the development of hypertension and thus can be used for assessing the risk of developing hypertension, a polynucleotide for assessing the risk of developing hypertension which can be used as a primer or probe for detecting the SNP, a method for assessing the risk of developing hypertension using the SNP, a microarray for assessing the risk of developing hypertension which is used for genotyping of the SNP, a kit for assessing the risk of developing hypertension which is used for genotyping of the SNP, and the like.</p>
    <heading id="h-00005-en">MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS</heading>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present inventors have conducted an intensive study in order to solve the above problems as follows and completed the present invention as a result. That is, based on the genomic DNA collected from 8924 subjects, a case-control correlation analysis was conducted examining the differences between SNP frequencies within the case (high blood pressure) group and those within the control (normal blood pressure) group. As a result of the analysis, it was discovered that the SNPs of ATP2B1 and CYP11B2 genes, especially the SNPs of ATP2B1 gene (i.e., rs11105378, rs2681472, rs1401982 and rs11105364) and the SNP of CYP11B2 gene (i.e., rs1799998) were highly useful as genetic markers for hypertension, and that the risk of developing hypertension may be assessed more accurately by combining 2 or more SNPs selected from the group consisting of the above-mentioned SNPs and the SNP of an AGT gene (i.e., rs699) rather than by using individual SNPs alone.</p>

There are no particular limitations on the specific definition for the term "hypertension (high blood pressure)". For example, the term may conform to the<nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="b"><text> Guidelines for the Treatment of Hypertension 2004 (JSH 2004) set out by the Japanese Society of Hypertension</text></nplcit>, and refers to a state where (systolic blood pressure)/(diastolic blood pressure) is equal to or higher than 140 mmHg/90 mmHg. Among the subjects without taking any antihypertensive agent, in addition to those subjects having the systolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 140 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 90 mmHg, those subjects having the systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg but with the diastolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 90 mmHg, and those subjects having the diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg but with the systolic blood pressure equal to or higher than 140 mmHg may also be classified as having a high blood pressure. In addition, hypertension is broadly classified into essential hypertension and secondary hypertension, and 90% or more of patients of hypertension are classified as having essential hypertension. It is preferable that the present invention be used for the patients with essential hypertension.</p>

That is, in the present invention, when a certain individual is classified into a high risk group, this means that it is expected that the individual has a high risk of developing hypertension. On the other hand, when a certain individual is classified into a low risk group, this means that it is expected that the individual has a low risk of developing hypertension.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In the present invention, the SNPs are preferably those SNPs that are registered at public databases and that can be specified from their reference numbers. Examples of such SNPs include the SNPs specified by the rs numbers which are the reference numbers for the SNP database (dbSNP BUILD 124) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the SNPs specified by the IMS-JST numbers which are the reference numbers for the JSNP (registered trademark) database (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_ja.html), which is a database for the SNPs found among Japanese people and is maintained by the Institute of Medical Science in the University of Tokyo.</p>

    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">ATP2B1 is an enzyme whose expression level is significantly increased among those in the normal blood pressure group and the high blood pressure group, and the ATP2B 1 gene is a known hypertension-susceptibility gene. With respect to the human ATP2B1 gene (NCBI Accession Number: NC_000012), for example, although it has been reported that the correlation between a SNP (rs2070759) which is present in the promoter region and that the risk of developing hypertension show significant differences among the respective polymorphisms (for example, refer to Patent Document 5), but the results have not been significant enough to be used for diagnosing the risks. On the other hand, it has been reported that, with respect to 44 patients of essential hypertension (case group) and 40 normotensive subjects having normal blood pressure (control group), all 22 exons of the ATP2B1 gene were subjected to Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and Heteroduplex (HTX) analysis, and as a result, no significant differences were observed between the case group and the control group even though the sensitivity was 100% (for example, refer to <nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>G. R. Monteith et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 230, No. 2, 1997, pp. 344-346</text></nplcit>). In other words, although the ATP2B 1 gene was a known hypertension-susceptibility gene, the expression level of ATP2B1 gene has been thought to be important for the development of hypertension. The differences in the risk of developing hypertension due to the genetic polymorphisms such as the SNPs other than the promoter region or the like are found only for the first time by the present inventors.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Here, the SNP (rs11105378) is a T/C polymorphism, and as is apparent from the results described later in Example 3, frequency of the C allele is significantly higher than that of the T allele in the high blood pressure group when compared with the normal blood pressure group. Therefore, the SNP (rs11105378) is useful as a genetic marker for hypertension.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In addition, the SNP (rs2681472) is a G/A polymorphism, and as is apparent from the results described later in Example 9, frequency of the A allele is significantly higher than that of the G allele in the high blood pressure group when compared with the normal blood pressure group.

The SNP (rs1799998) is a C/T polymorphism, and as is apparent from the results described later in Example 28, frequency of the T allele is significantly higher than that of the C allele in the high blood pressure group when compared with the normal blood pressure group. Therefore, the SNP (rs1799998) is useful as a genetic marker for hypertension. It should be noted that there has been no report showing any particular relationship between the CYP 11 B2 gene and high blood pressure, and the finding of the CYP11B2 gene being a hypertension-susceptibility gene is made only for the first time by the present inventors.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040"> The method for assessing the risk of developing hypertension according to the seventh aspect of the present invention is a method for assessing the risk of developing hypertension by using a genetic marker for hypertension according to the first or fifth aspect of the present invention (hereinafter, frequently referred to as "genetic marker for hypertension according to the present invention"). More specifically, the seventh aspect of the present invention is characterized by including a step (a) of genotyping at least one SNP selected from the group consisting of the SNP (rs11105378), the SNP (rs2681472), the SNP (rs1401982), the SNP (rs11105364) and the SNP (rs1799998) which are present in the nucleic acid molecules collected from a human individual; and a step (b) of assessing the risk for the human individual to develop hypertension based on the genotyping result obtained in the step (a). Because the tendency to develop hypertension statistically differs significantly among the genotypes with respect to the SNP (rs11105378), the SNP (rs2681472), the SNP (rs1401982), the SNP (rs11105364) and the SNP (rs1799998), it is possible to assess the risk for developing hypertension from the identified genotype of the SNPs.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">First, as the step (a), at least one SNP selected from the group consisting of the SNP (rs11105378), the SNP (rs2681472), the SNP (rs1401982), the SNP (rs11105364) and the SNP (rs1799998) which are present in the nucleic acid molecules collected from a human individual is genotyped.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the present invention, the expression "genotyping of SNP" refers to a procedure in which the base sequence of nucleic acids is analyzed, (an) SNP(s) is/are then detected, and finally (a) polymorphism(s) is/are identified. For example, the procedure detects the SNP (rs11105378) within nucleic acid molecules which is the subject of risk assessment, and identifies which type of polymorphism it is (namely, a TT polymorphism, a TC polymorphism or a CC polymorphism).</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">There are no particular limitations on the nucleic acids provided for the genotyping of SNPs as long as they are collected from a human individual, and they may be nucleic acids contained in biological samples (specimens) such as blood and body fluids, nucleic acids extracted from these biological samples or the like, or nucleic acids obtained as a result of amplification by using the above-mentioned nucleic acids as templates. In addition, the nucleic acids may be cDNA synthesized from RNA that is contained in biological samples by using a reverse transcriptase.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">There are no particular limitations on the method used for SNP genotyping as long as the method is typically used for detecting SNPs. Examples of the methods include the Invader (registered trademark of Third Wave Technologies, Inc.) assay, the Taqman (registered trademark of Applied Biosystems Inc.) assay, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, microarray methods, sequence methods, and detection methods using sequence amplification methods such as polymerase chain reactions (PCR). It is particularly desirable that the above method be a process for detecting SNPs by using a primer or a probe which specifically hybridizes with each polymorphism, such as the Taqman assay, PCR methods and microarray methods. For example, in a PCR method, when using a polynucleotide that is completely complementary only with the wild type allele as a wild type primer and using a polynucleotide that is completely complementary only with the mutant allele as a mutant primer, genotypes of SNPs can be identified by carrying out PCR using the nucleic acids containing SNPs as a template, as well as the respective primers, and examining whether or not PCR products are obtained. Similarly, when using a polynucleotide that is completely complementary only with the wild type allele as a wild type probe and using a polynucleotide that is completely complementary only with the mutant allele as a mutant probe, genotypes of SNPs can be identified by using a microarray onto which the nucleic acids containing SNPs are fixed and examining whether or not hybridization occurs when using each of the probes. These methods in which a probe or primer specific to each SNP is used differ from the sequence methods and the like in that SNPs are directly identified. Accordingly, these methods are even more reliable. Additionally, they are also simple and easy since the time required for SNP genotyping is short.</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Note that detection of the PCR products which are obtained when PCR is carried out using primers specific to each SNP may be conducted through any method that is typically used when detecting/quantifying PCR products. For example, the PCR products may be detected by electrophoresis, real-time PCR using a fluorescent intercalator such as SYBR Green, or single molecule fluorescence analysis.</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">There are no particular limitations on the polynucleotide for assessing the risk of developing hypertension which can be used as a primer or probe for detecting a SNP as long as the polynucleotide may hybridize to a partial region of a gene containing the SNP or to a complementary strand thereof. In addition, the sequence length, Tm, and the like with respect to the polynucleotide for assessing the risk of developing hypertension can be determined appropriately by taking genotyping methods, reaction conditions, or the like into consideration. However, the sequence length of the polynucleotide for assessing the risk of developing hypertension is preferably within a range from 10 to 60 bases and more preferably within a range from 15 to 50 bases.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Designing of such polynucleotides for assessing the risk of developing hypertension can be performed by any method known in this field of technology. For example, such polynucleotides can be easily designed by using known genomic sequence data and primer-designing tools used universally. Examples of the primer-designing tools include the Primer3 which can be used on the World Wide Web. In addition, known genomic sequence data can be usually acquired through the international sequence databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).</p>
