      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Calcium plays a vital role in cell function and survival. For example, calcium is a key element in the transduction of signals into and within cells. Cellular responses to growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones and a variety of other signal molecules are initiated through calcium-dependent processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Virtually all cell types depend in some manner upon the generation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals to regulate cell function, or to trigger specific responses. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals control a wide array of cellular functions ranging from short-term responses such as contraction and secretion to longer-term regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Usually, these signals involve some combination of release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the plasma membrane. In one example, cell activation begins with an agonist binding to a surface membrane receptor, which is coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) through a G-protein mechanism. PLC activation leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), which in turn activates the IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor causing release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER. The fall in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> then signals to activate plasma membrane store-operated calcium (SOC) channels.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Store-operated calcium (SOC) influx is a process in cellular physiology that controls such diverse functions such as, but not limited to, refilling of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (Putney et al. <i>Cell, </i>75, 199-201, 1993), activation of enzymatic activity (Fagan et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>275:26530-26537, 2000), gene transcription (Lewis, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol. </i>19:497-521, 2001), cell proliferation (Nunez et al., <i>J. Physiol. </i>571.1, 57-73, 2006), and release of cytokines (Winslow et al., <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol. </i>15:299-307, 2003). In some nonexcitable cells, e.g., blood cells, immune cells, hematopoietic cells, T lymphocytes and mast cells, SOC influx occurs through calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, a type of SOC channel.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The calcium influx mechanism has been referred to as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins are an essential component of SOC channel function, serving as the sensors for detecting the depletion of calcium from intracellular stores and for activating SOC channels.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0082">Cellular calcium homeostasis is a result of the summation of regulatory systems involved in the control of intracellular calcium levels and movements. Cellular calcium homeostasis is achieved, at least in part, by calcium binding and by movement of calcium into and out of the cell across the plasma membrane and within the cell by movement of calcium across membranes of intracellular organelles including, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum, sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and endocytic organelles including endosomes and lysosomes.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0083">Movement of calcium across cellular membranes is carried out by specialized proteins. For example, calcium from the extracellular space can enter the cell through various calcium channels and a sodium/calcium exchanger and is actively extruded from the cell by calcium pumps and sodium/calcium exchangers. Calcium can also be released from internal stores through inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors and can be taken up by these organelles by means of calcium pumps.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0084">Calcium can enter cells by any of several general classes of channels, including but not limited to, voltage-operated calcium (VOC) channels, store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, and sodium/calcium exchangers operating in reverse mode. VOC channels are activated by membrane depolarization and are found in excitable cells like nerve and muscle and are for the most part not found in nonexcitable cells. Under some conditions, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can enter cells via Na<sup>+</sup>âCa<sup>2+ </sup>exchangers operating in reverse mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0085">Endocytosis provides another process by which cells can take up calcium from the extracellular medium through endosomes. In addition, some cells, e.g., exocrine cells, can release calcium via exocytosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0086">Cytosolic calcium concentration is tightly regulated with resting levels usually estimated at approximately 0.1 Î¼M in mammalian cells, whereas the extracellular calcium concentration is typically about 2 mM. This tight regulation facilitates transduction of signals into and within cells through transient calcium flux across the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles. There is a multiplicity of intracellular calcium transport and buffer systems in cells that serve to shape intracellular calcium signals and maintain the low resting cytoplasmic calcium concentration. In cells at rest, the principal components involved in maintaining basal calcium levels are calcium pumps and leak pathways in both the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Disturbance of resting cytosolic calcium levels can affect transmission of calcium-dependent signals and give rise to defects in a number of cellular processes. For example, cell proliferation involves a prolonged calcium signaling sequence. Other cellular processes that involve calcium signaling include, but are not limited to, secretion, transcription factor signaling, and fertilization.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0087">Cell-surface receptors that activate phospholipase C (PLC) create cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from intra- and extra-cellular sources. An initial transient rise of [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>i </sub>(intracellular calcium concentration) results from the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is triggered by the PLC product, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), opening IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors in the ER (Streb et al. <i>Nature, </i>306, 67-69, 1983). A subsequent phase of sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry across the plasma membrane then ensues, through specialized store operated calcium (SOC) channels (in the case of immune cells the SOC channels are calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels) in the plasma membrane. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is the process in which the emptying of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores itself activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane to help refill the stores (Putney, <i>Cell Calcium, </i>7, 1-12, 1986; Parekh et al., <i>Physiol. Rev. </i>757-810; 2005). SOCE does more than simply provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> for refilling stores, but can itself generate sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that control such essential functions as gene expression, cell metabolism and exocytosis (Parekh and Putney, <i>Physiol. Rev. </i>85, 757-810 (2005).</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0088">In lymphocytes and mast cells, activation of antigen or Fc receptors, respectively causes the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores, which in turn leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CRAC channels in the plasma membrane. The subsequent rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> activates calcineurin, a phosphatase that regulates the transcription factor NFAT. In resting cells, NFAT is phosphorylated and resides in the cytoplasm, but when dephosphorylated by calcineurin, NFAT translocates to the nucleus and activates different genetic programmes depending on stimulation conditions and cell type. In response to infections and during transplant rejection, NFAT partners with the transcription factor AP-1 (Fos-Jun) in the nucleus of âeffectorâ T cells, thereby transactivating cytokine genes, genes that regulate T cell proliferation and other genes that orchestrate an active immune response (Rao et al., <i>Annu Rev Immunol., </i>1997; 15:707-47). In contrast, in T cells recognizing self antigens, NFAT is activated in the absence of AP-1, and activates a transcriptional programme known as âanergyâ that suppresses autoimmune responses (Macian et al., Transcriptional mechanisms underlying lymphocyte tolerance. Cell. 2002 Jun. 14; 109(6):719-31). In a subclass of T cells known as regulatory T cells which suppress autoimmunity mediated by self-reactive effector T cells, NFAT partners with the transcription factor FOXP3 to activate genes responsible for suppressor function (Wu et al., <i>Cell, </i>2006 July 28; 126(2):375-87; Rudensky A Y, Gavin M, Zheng Y. <i>Cell. </i>2006 July 28; 126(2):253-256).</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0089">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) carries out a variety processes. The ER has a role as both a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink and an agonist-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> store and, protein folding/processing takes place within its lumen. In the latter case, numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chaperone proteins ensure that newly synthesized proteins are folded correctly and sent off to their appropriate destination. The ER is also involved in vesicle trafficking, release of stress signals, regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and apoptosis. Many of these processes require intraluminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and protein misfolding, ER stress responses, and apoptosis can all be induced by depleting the ER of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for prolonged periods of time. Because it contains a finite amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it is clear that ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content must fall after release of that Ca<sup>2+</sup> during stimulation. However, to preserve the functional integrity of the ER, it is vital that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> content does not fall too low or is maintained at least at a low level. Replenishment of the ER with Ca<sup>2+</sup> is therefore a central process to all eukaryotic cells. Because a fall in ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content activates store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the plasma membrane, a major function of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway is believed to be maintenance of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels that are necessary for proper protein synthesis and folding. However, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels have other important roles.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0090">The understanding of store operated calcium entry was provided by electrophysiological studies which established that the process of emptying the stores activated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in mast cells called Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current or I<sub>CRAC</sub>. I<sub>CRAC </sub>is non-voltage activated, inwardly rectifying, and remarkably selective for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It is found in several cell types mainly of hemopoietic origin. I<sub>CRAC </sub>is not the only store-operated current, and it is now apparent that store-operated influx encompasses a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels, with different properties in different cell types. I<sub>CRAC </sub>was the first store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current to be described and remains a popular model for studying store-operated influx.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0091">Store-operated calcium channels can be activated by any procedure that empties ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; it does not seem to matter how the stores are emptied, the net effect is activation of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Physiologically, store emptying is evoked by an increase in the levels of IP<sub>3 </sub>or other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-releasing signals followed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the stores. But there are several other methods for emptying stores. These methods include the following:</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0000">1) elevation of IP<sub>3 </sub>in the cytosol (following receptor stimulation or, dialyzing the cytosol with IP<sub>3 </sub>itself or related congeners like the nonmetabolizable analog Ins(2,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>); <br /> 2) application of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (e.g., ionomycin) to permeabilize the ER membrane; <br /> 3) dialyzing the cytoplasm with high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators (e.g., EGTA or BAPTA), which chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> that leaks from the stores and hence prevent store refilling; <br /> 4) exposure to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors like thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and di-tert-butylhydroquinone; <br /> 5) sensitizing the IP<sub>3 </sub>receptors to resting levels of InsP<sub>3 </sub>with agents like thimerosal; and <br /> 6) loading membrane-permeable metal Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators like N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene diamine (TPEN) directly into the stores. </p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0092">Through mass action, TPEN lowers free intraluminal Ca2+ concentration without changing total store Ca<sup>2+</sup> such that the store depletion-dependent signal is generated.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0093">These methods of emptying stores are not devoid of potential problems. The key feature of store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is that it is the fall in Ca<sup>2+</sup> content within the stores and not the subsequent rise in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that activates the channels. However, ionomycin and SERCA pump blockers generally cause a rise in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration as a consequence of store depletion, and such a rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup> could open Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated cation channels permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. One way to avoid such problems is to use agents under conditions where cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been strongly buffered with high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator such as EGTA or BAPTA.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Store-Operated Calcium Entry</heading>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0094">Reduced calcium concentration in intracellular calcium stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum resulting from release of calcium there from provides a signal for influx of calcium from the extracellular medium into the cell. This influx of calcium, which produces a sustained âplateauâ elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration, generally does not rely on voltage-gated plasma membrane channels and does not involve activation of calcium channels by calcium. This calcium influx mechanism is referred to as capacitative calcium entry (CCE), calcium release-activated, store-operated or depletion-operated calcium entry. Store-operated calcium entry can be recorded as an ionic current with distinctive properties. This current is referred to as Isoc (store-operated current) or I<sub>CRAC </sub>(calcium release-activated current).</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0095">Electrophysiological analysis of store-operated or calcium release-activated currents reveal distinct biophysical properties (see, e.g., Parekh and Penner (1997) <i>Physiol. Rev. </i>77:901-930) of these currents. For example, the current can be activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (e.g., by non-physiological activators such as thapsigargin, CPA, ionomycin and BAPTA, and physiological activators such as IP<sub>3</sub>) and can be selective for divalent cations, such as calcium, over monovalent ions in physiological solutions or conditions, can be influenced by changes in cytosolic calcium levels, and can show altered selectivity and conductivity in the presence of low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations. The current may also be blocked or enhanced by 2-APB (depending on concentration) and blocked by SKF96365 and Gd<sup>3+</sup> and generally can be described as a calcium current that is not strictly voltage-gated.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0096">Patch-clamp studies in mast cells and Jurkat leukaemic T cells have established the CRAC entry mechanism as an ion channel with distinctive biophysical characteristics, including a high selectivity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> paired with an exceedingly low conductance. Furthermore, the CRAC channel was shown to fulfill the rigorous criteria for being store-operated, which is the activation solely by the reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ER rather than by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> or other messengers generated by PLC (Prakriya et al., In <i>Molecular and Cellular Insights into Ion Channel Biology </i>(ed. Robert Maue) 121-140 (Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 2004)).</p>

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0097">Store-operated calcium entry is regulated by the level of calcium within an intracellular calcium store. Intracellular calcium stores can be characterized by sensitivity to agents, which can be physiological or pharmacological, which activate release of calcium from the stores or inhibit uptake of calcium into the stores. Different cells have been studied in characterization of intracellular calcium stores, and stores have been characterized as sensitive to various agents, including, but not limited to, IP<sub>3 </sub>and compounds that effect the IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor, thapsigargin, ionomycin and/or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (see, e.g., Berridge (1993) <i>Nature </i>361:315-325; Churchill and Louis (1999) <i>Am. J. Physiol. </i>276:C426-C434; Dargie et al. (1990) <i>Cell Regul. </i>1:279-290; Gerasimenko et al. (1996) <i>Cell </i>84:473-480; Gromoda et al. (1995) <i>FEBS Lett. </i>360:303-306; Guse et al. (1999) <i>Nature </i>398:70-73).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0098">Accumulation of calcium within endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR; a specialized version of the endoplasmic reticulum in striated muscle) storage organelles is achieved through sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCAs), commonly referred to as calcium pumps. During signaling (i.e., when endoplasmic reticulum channels are activated to provide for calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm), endoplasmic reticulum calcium is replenished by the SERCA pump with cytoplasmic calcium that has entered the cell from the extracellular medium (Yu and Hinkle (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>275:23648-23653; Hofer et al. (1998) <i>EMBO J. </i>17:1986-1995).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0099">Calcium release channels associated with IP<sub>3 </sub>and ryanodine receptors provide for controlled release of calcium from endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm resulting in transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor-mediated calcium release is triggered by IP<sub>3 </sub>formed by the break down of plasma membrane phosphoinositides through the action of phospholipase C, which is activated by binding of an agonist to a plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptor or tyrosine kinase. Ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium release is triggered by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is referred to as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). The activity of ryanodine receptors (which have affinity for ryanodine and caffeine) may also be regulated by cyclic ADP-ribose.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0100">Thus, the calcium levels in the stores, and in the cytoplasm, fluctuate. For example, ER free calcium concentration can decrease from a range of about 60-400 Î¼M to about 1-50 Î¼M when HeLa cells are treated with histamine, an agonist of PLC-linked histamine receptors (Miyawaki et al. (1997) <i>Nature </i>388:882-887). Store-operated calcium entry is activated as the free calcium concentration of the intracellular stores is reduced. Depletion of store calcium, as well as a concomitant increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, can thus regulate store-operated calcium entry into cells.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Cytoplasmic Calcium Buffering</heading>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0101">Agonist activation of signaling processes in cells can involve dramatic increases in the calcium permeability of the endoplasmic reticulum, for example, through opening of IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor channels, and the plasma membrane through store-operated calcium entry. These increases in calcium permeability are associated with an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration that can be separated into two components: a âspikeâ of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum during activation of the IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor and a plateau phase which is a sustained elevation of calcium levels resulting from entry of calcium into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium. Upon stimulation, the resting intracellular free calcium concentration of about 100 nM can rise globally to greater than 1 Î¼M and higher in microdomains of the cell. The cell modulates these calcium signals with endogenous calcium buffers, including physiological buffering by organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Mitochondrial uptake of calcium through a uniporter in the inner membrane is driven by the large negative mitochondrial membrane potential, and the accumulated calcium is released slowly through sodium-dependent and -independent exchangers, and, under some circumstances, the permeability transition pore (PTP). Thus, mitochondria can act as calcium buffers by taking up calcium during periods of cellular activation and can slowly release it later. Uptake of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum is regulated by the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Uptake of calcium into the Golgi is mediated by a P-type calcium transport ATPase (PMR1/ATP2C1). Additionally, there is evidence that a significant amount of the calcium released upon IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor activation is extruded from the cell through the action of the plasma membrane calcium ATPase. For example, plasma membrane calcium ATPases provide the dominant mechanism for calcium clearance in human T cells and Jurkat cells, although sodium/calcium exchange also contributes to calcium clearance in human T cells. Within calcium-storing organelles, calcium ions can be bound to specialized calcium-buffering proteins, such as, for example, calsequestrins, calreticulins and calnexins. Additionally, there are calcium-buffering proteins in the cytosol that modulate calcium spikes and assist in redistribution of calcium ions. Thus, proteins and other molecules that participate in any of these and other mechanisms through which cytosolic calcium levels can be reduced are proteins that are involved in, participate in and/or provide for cytoplasmic calcium buffering. Thus, cytoplasmic calcium buffering helps regulate cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during periods of sustained calcium influx through SOC channels or bursts of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Large increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels or store refilling deactivate SOCE.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Downstream Calcium Entry-Mediated Events</heading>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0102">In addition to intracellular changes in calcium stores, store-operated calcium entry affects a multitude of events that are consequent to or in addition to the store-operated changes. For example Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx results in the activation of a large number of calmodulin-dependent enzymes including the serine phosphatase calcineurin. Activation of calcineurin by an increase in intracellular calcium results in acute secretory processes such as mast cell degranulation. Activated mast cells release preformed granules containing histamine, heparin, TNFÎ± and enzymes such as Î²-hexosaminidase. Some cellular events, such as B and T cell proliferation, require sustained calcineurin signaling, which requires a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. A number of transcription factors are regulated by calcineurin, including NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), MEF2 and NFÎºB. NFAT transcription factors play important roles in many cell types, including immune cells. In immune cells NFAT mediates transcription of a large number of molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors. Transcriptional elements for NFAT have been found within the promoters of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and gamma-interferon (Î³-IFN).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0103">The activity of NFAT proteins is regulated by their phosphorylation level, which in turn is regulated by both calcineurin and NFAT kinases. Activation of calcineurin by an increase in intracellular calcium levels results in dephosphorylation of NFAT and entry into the nucleus. Rephosphorylation of NFAT masks the nuclear localization sequence of NFAT and prevents its entry into the nucleus. Because of its strong dependence on calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for localization and activity, NFAT is a sensitive indicator of intracellular free calcium levels.</p>

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0104">Clinical studies demonstrate that the CRAC channel is absolutely required for the activation of genes underlying the T cell response to antigen. Sustained calcium entry is needed for lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune response. Calcium entry into lymphocytes occurs primarily through the CRAC channels. Increased calcium leads to NFAT activation and expression of cytokines required for immune response Inhibiting the store operated calcium entry is an efficient way to prevent T cell activation.</p>

T cells, fibroblasts, and in some cases B cells, from patients with T cell immunodeficiency or SCID having a principal defect in T cell activation show a strong defect in store-operated calcium entry (Feske et al.

SCID patients lack adaptive immune response, but without any impairment or toxicity in major organs. The SCID patient phenotype indicates that inhibition of CRAC channels is an effective strategy for immunosuppression.</p>

      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0107">The activation of neutrophils (PMN) by inflammatory mediators is partly achieved by increasing cytosolic calcium concentration. Store-operated calcium influx in particular is thought to play an important role in PMN activation. It has been shown that trauma increases PMN store-operated calcium influx (Hauser et al. (2000) <i>J. Trauma Injury Infection and Critical Care </i>48 (4):592-598) and that prolonged elevations of cytosolic calcium concentration due to enhanced store-operated calcium influx may alter stimulus-response coupling to chemotaxins and contribute to PMN dysfunction after injury. Modulation of PMN cytosolic calcium concentration through store-operated calcium channels might therefore be useful in regulating PMN-mediated inflammation and spare cardiovascular function after injury, shock or sepsis (Hauser et al. (2001) <i>J. Leukocyte Biology </i>69 (1):63-68).</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0108">Calcium plays a critical role in lymphocyte activation. Activation of lymphocytes, e.g., by antigen stimulation, results in rapid increases in intracellular free calcium concentration and activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NF-ÎºB, JNK1, MEF2 and CREB. NFAT is a key transcriptional regulator of the IL-2 (and other cytokine) genes (see, e.g. Lewis (2001) <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol </i>19:497-521). A sustained elevation of intracellular calcium level is required to keep NFAT in a transcriptionally active state, and is dependent on store-operated calcium entry. Reduction or blocking of store-operated calcium entry in lymphocytes blocks calcium-dependent lymphocyte activation. Thus, modulation of intracellular calcium, and particularly store-operated calcium entry (e.g., reduction in, elimination of store-operated calcium entry), in lymphocytes can be a method for treating immune and immune-related disorders, including, for example, chronic immune diseases/disorders, acute immune diseases/disorders, autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases/disorders, diseases/disorders involving inflammation, organ transplant graft rejections and graft-versus-host disease and altered (e.g., hyperactive) immune responses.

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0115">The turnover of mesangial cells in normal adult kidney is very low with a renewal rate of less than 1%. A prominent feature of glomerular/kidney diseases is mesangial hyperplasia due to elevated proliferation rate or reduced cell loss of mesangial cells. When mesangial cell proliferation is induced without cell loss, for example due to mitogenic stimulation, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis can result. Data have indicated that regulators of mesangial cell growth, particularly growth factors, may act by regulating store-operated calcium channels (Ma et al. (2001) <i>J Am. Soc. Of Nephrology, </i>12:(1) 47-53). Modulators of store-operated calcium influx may aid in the treatment of glomerular diseases by inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation.</p>

SOCE can contribute directly to the elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), as in T lymphocytes where CRAC channels generate the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals needed to drive gene expression underlying T cell activation by antigen. Sustained calcium entry is needed for lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune response. Calcium entry into lymphocytes occurs primarily through the CRAC channels. Increased calcium levels lead to NFAT activation and expression of cytokines required for immune response.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0117">The CRAC channel has a distinctive biophysical fingerprint, quantifiable store-dependence, and essential function in T cells. Studies have shown that CRAC channels are formed from two component proteins, which interact to form CRAC channels. The CRAC channel is assembled by two functional components, STIM1 and Orai1. STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) was identified as the mammalian ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (Liou, J. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>15, 1235-1241 (2005); Roos, J. et al. <i>J.

      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0119">Expression of both STIM1 and Orai1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293 cells) reconstitute functional CRAC channels. Expression of Orai1 alone strongly reduces store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in HEK293 cells and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (I<sub>CRAC</sub>) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. However, expressed along with the store-sensing STIM1 protein, Orai1 causes a massive increase in SOCE, enhancing the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by up to 103-fold. This Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is entirely store dependent since the same co-expression causes no measurable store-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. The entry is completely blocked by the store operated channel blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. STIM proteins are mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> store-sensing and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane coupling with no intrinsic channel properties. Orai1 contributes the plasma membrane channel component responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.

It is unlikely that STIM1 is the store-operated channel itself. It has no channel-like sequence, and overexpression of the protein only modestly enhances Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. STIM1 is located both on the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes like the ER (Manji et al., <i>Biochim Biophys Acta. </i>2000 August 31; 1481(1):147-55. 2000). The protein sequence suggests that it spans the membrane once, with its NH<sub>2 </sub>terminus oriented toward the lumen of the ER or the extracellular space. The NH<sub>2 </sub>terminus contains an EF-hand domain, and functions as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in the ER. The protein also contains protein-protein interaction domains, notably coiled-coiled domains in the cytoplasm and a sterile motif (SAM) in the ER (or extracellular space), both near the predicted transmembrane domain. STIM1 can oligomerize and thus the protein in the ER and plasma membrane could interact bridging the two (Roos, J. et al. <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>169, 435-445 (2005)).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0122">Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and confocal microscopy reveal that STIM1 is distributed throughout the ER when Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are full, but redistributes into discrete puncta near the plasma membrane on store depletion. Although the redistribution of STIM1 into junctional ER regions is slow (Liou, J. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>15, 1235-1241 (2005); Zhang, S. L. et al. <i>Nature </i>437, 902-905 (2005), it does precede the opening of CRAC channels by several seconds (Wu et al., <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>174, 803-813 (2006)) and is therefore rapid enough to be an essential step in the activation of CRAC channels.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0123">It has been suggested that store depletion causes the insertion of STIM1 into the plasma membrane where it may control store operated calcium entry through the CRAC channels (Zhang, S. L. et al. <i>Nature </i>437, 902-905 (2005); Spassova, M. A. et al. <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA </i>103, 4040-4045 (2006)).</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0124">The critical evidence for STIM1 as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for SOCE is that mutation of predicted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues of the EF hand structural motif, expected to reduce its affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hence mimic the store-depleted state, causes STIM1 to redistribute spontaneously into puncta and trigger constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCs even when stores are full (Spassova, M. A. et al. <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA </i>103, 4040-4045 (2006); Liou, J. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>15, 1235-1241 (2005)).</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">Orai Proteins</heading>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0125">Orai1 (also known as CRACM1) is a widely expressed, 33 kDa plasma membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains and a lack of significant sequence homology to other ion channels (Vig, M. et al. <i>Science </i>312, 1220-1223 (2006); Zhang, S.

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0127">Other mammalian Orai homologues exist, e.g. Orai2 and Orai3, however their function is not clearly defined. Orai2 and Orai3 can exhibit SOC channel activity when overexpressed with STIM1 in HEK cells (Mercer, J. C. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 281, 24979-24990 (2006)).</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0128">Evidence that Orai1 contributes to the CRAC channel pore was obtained by Orai1 mutagenesis studies. Selectivity of the CRAC channel for Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions was shown by mutations at either Glu 106 or Glu 190, which weaken the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in order block permeation of monovalent cations (similar to mechanisms described for voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) (Yeromin, A. V. et al. <i>Nature </i>443, 226-229 (2006); Vig, M. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>16, 2073-2079 (2006); Prakriya, M. et al. <i>Nature </i>443, 230-233 (2006)).</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0130">Currents observed through overexpression of Orai1 closely resemble I<sub>CRAC</sub>, and the fact that Orai1 can form multimers (Yeromin, A. V. et al. <i>Nature </i>443, 226-229 (2006); Vig, M. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>16, 2073-2079 (2006); Prakriya, M. et al. <i>Nature </i>443, 230-233 (2006)), makes it likely that the native CRAC channel is either a multimer of Orai1 alone or in combination with the closely related subunits Orai2 and/or Orai3.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="2">Functional Store Operated Calcium Channels</heading>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0131">The characterization of SOC channels has been largely obtained by one type of SOC channel, the CRAC channel. CRAC channel activity is triggered by the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER lumen, which is coupled to the opening of CRAC channels in the plasma membrane through the actions of STIM1 and Orai1. Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is sensed by STIM1, causing it to accumulate in junctional ER adjacent to the plasma membrane. In a TIRF-based Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging study to map the locations of open CRAC channels, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>elevations were seen to co-localize with STIM1 puncta, showing directly that CRAC channels open only in extreme proximity to these sites (Luik, et al., <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>174, 815-825 (2006)).</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0132">In cells co-expressing both STIM1 and Orai1, store depletion causes Orai1 itself to move from a dispersed distribution to accumulate in the plasma membrane directly opposite STIM1, enabling STIM1 to activate the channel (Luik, et al., <i>J. Cell Biol. </i>174, 815-825 (2006); Xu, P. et al. <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>350, 969-976 (2006)). Thus, CRAC channels are formed by apposed clusters of STIM1 in the ER and Orai1 in the plasma membrane. The junctional gap between the ER and plasma membrane where Orai1/STIM 1 clusters from (about 10-25 nm) may be small enough to permit protein-protein interactions between STIM 1 and Orai1. This is supported by the fact that overexpressed STIM1 and Orai1 can be co-immunoprecipitated (Yeromin, A. V. et al. <i>Nature </i>443, 226-229 (2006); Vig, M. et al. <i>Curr. Biol. </i>16, 2073-2079 (2006)).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0133">Thus, STIM1 and Orai1 interact either directly or as members of a multiprotein complex. Support for this was observed when the expression of the cytosolic portion of STIM1 by itself was sufficient to activate CRAC channels in one study (Huang, G. N. et al. <i>Nature Cell Biol. </i>8, 1003-1010 (2006)), and the effects of deleting the ERM/coiled-coil and other C-terminal domains suggest roles in STIM1 clustering and SOC channel activation (Baba, Y. et al. <i>Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA </i>103, 16704-16709 (2006)). On the luminal side of STIM1, the isolated EF-SAM region forms dimers and higher-order multimers on removal of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vitro, indicating that STIM1 oligomerization may be an early step in store operated calcium activation (Stathopulos, et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>281, 35855-35862 (2006)).</p>

      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0257">Deuterium (D or <sup>2</sup>H) is a stable, non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen and has an atomic weight of 2.0144. Hydrogen naturally occurs as a mixture of the isotopes <sup>1</sup>H (hydrogen or protium), D (<sup>2</sup>H or deuterium), and T (<sup>3</sup>H or tritium). The natural abundance of deuterium is 0.015%. Generally, in chemical compounds with an H atom, the H atom actually represents a mixture of H and D, with about 0.015% being D. In some embodiments, deuterium-enriched compounds described herein are achieved by either exchanging protons with deuterium or via starting materials and/or intermediates enriched with deuterium.</p>

The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Separation of stereoisomers may be performed by chromatography or by the forming diastereomeric and separation by recrystallization, or chromatography, or any combination thereof.

As well, active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity are included in the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0263">In some embodiments, compounds described herein may be prepared as prodrugs. A âprodrugâ refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the âprodrugâ) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0264">To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. In some embodiments, by virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is determined, prodrugs of the compound are designed. (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) <i>Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach</i>, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), <i>Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters</i>, Vol. 4, p. 1985; Rooseboom et al., <i>Pharmacological Reviews, </i>56:53-102, 2004; Miller et al., <i>J.

In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0266">Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., <i>Am. J. Physiol., </i>269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., <i>Gastroenterol, </i>106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., <i>Biomed. Chrom., </i>6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, <i>Int. J.

      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0280">Use of Protecting Groups</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0281">In the reactions described, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, in order to avoid their unwanted participation in reactions. Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0282">Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, reducing conditions (such as, for example, hydrogenolysis), and/or oxidative conditions. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0283">Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0284">Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd<sup>0</sup>-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.</p>

      <p id="p-00379-en" num="0432">In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. When such salts are added to water, the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing âeffervescence.â Examples of effervescent salts include, e.g., the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.</p>
      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0433">In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound described herein, are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,343,789, 5,340,591, 5,456,923, 5,700,485, 5,723,269, and U.S. patent publication no. 2004/0013734. In still other embodiments, the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,151,273, 5,281,420, and 6,083,518.</p>
      <p id="p-00381-en" num="0434">The pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein, which include compounds described herein, can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V). Controlled release refers to the release of the compounds described herein from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations.</p>
      <p id="p-00382-en" num="0435">In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.</p>
      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0436">The term âdelayed releaseâ as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. Coatings may be made from:</p>
      <p id="p-00384-en" num="0437">Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility in biological fluids) can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine;</p>
      <p id="p-00385-en" num="0438">Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl cellulose; reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) dissolves in pH&gt;6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP pseudolatex with particles &lt;1 Î¼m. Other components in Aquateric can include pluronics, Tweens, and acetylated monoglycerides. Other suitable cellulose derivatives include: cellulose acetate trimellitate (Eastman); methylcellulose (Pharmacoat, Methocel); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate (HPMCS); and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (e.g., AQOAT (Shin Etsu)). The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, HPMCP such as, HP-50, HP-55, HP-55S, HP-55F grades are suitable. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, suitable grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate include, but are not limited to, AS-LG (LF), which dissolves at pH 5, AS-MG (MF), which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions;</p>
      <p id="p-00386-en" num="0439">Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH&gt;5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.</p>
      <p id="p-00387-en" num="0440">In some embodiments, the coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate.

In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.</p>
      <p id="p-00388-en" num="0441">Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba wax or PEG) may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.</p>
      <p id="p-00389-en" num="0442">In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V) described herein, are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form.

The formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0445">Liquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration can be aqueous suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups.

      <p id="p-00395-en" num="0448">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563.</p>
      <p id="p-00396-en" num="0449">There is overlap between the above-listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00397-en" num="0450">Potential excipients for intranasal formulations include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452. Formulations solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents. See, for example, Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.</p>
      <p id="p-00398-en" num="0451">For administration by inhalation, the compounds described herein may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount.

In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the compound is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration, e.g., slow absorption, degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, virtually any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and the carrier is compatible with the compounds described herein, and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as âcarbomersâ (CarbopolÂ®, which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to, disintegrants, diluents, binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like.

In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional components such as, but not limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00402-en" num="0455">Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of the compounds described herein. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00403-en" num="0456">Formulations suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0457">For intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer.

Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
      <p id="p-00406-en" num="0459">In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran.</p>
      <p id="p-00407-en" num="0460">In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and are formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00408-en" num="0461">The compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted.</p>
      <p id="p-00409-en" num="0462">Generally, an agent, such as a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V), is administered in an amount effective for amelioration of, or prevention of the development of symptoms of, the disease or disorder (i.e., a therapeutically effective amount). Thus, a therapeutically effective amount can be an amount that is capable of at least partially preventing or reversing a disease or disorder. The dose required to obtain an effective amount may vary depending on the agent, formulation, disease or disorder, and individual to whom the agent is administered.</p>
      <p id="p-00410-en" num="0463">Determination of effective amounts may also involve in vitro assays in which varying doses of agent are administered to cells in culture and the concentration of agent effective for ameliorating some or all symptoms is determined in order to calculate the concentration required in vivo. Effective amounts may also be based in in vivo animal studies.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0464">An agent can be administered prior to, concurrently with and subsequent to the appearance of symptoms of a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, an agent is administered to a subject with a family history of the disease or disorder, or who has a phenotype that may indicate a predisposition to a disease or disorder, or who has a genotype which predisposes the subject to the disease or disorder.</p>
      <p id="p-00412-en" num="0465">The particular delivery system used can depend on a number of factors, including, for example, the intended target and the route of administration, e.g., local or systemic. Targets for delivery can be specific cells which are causing or contributing to a disease or disorder, including, for example, cells that have altered intracellular calcium or calcium dysregulation or dyshomeostasis, and cells that do not have altered intracellular calcium but that may have some alteration, defect or deficiency that can be, at least in part, compensated, counteracted, reversed or alleviated or eliminated by altering intracellular calcium of the cell. Particular cells include, for example, immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, white blood cells), fibroblasts (or cells derived from a fibroblast), epidermal, dermal or skin cells (e.g., a keratinocytes), blood cells, kidney or renal cells (e.g., mesangial cells), muscle cells (e.g., a smooth muscle cell such as an airway (tracheal or bronchial) smooth muscle cell) and exocrine or secretory (e.g., salivary, including parotid acinar and submandibular gland) cells. For example, a target cell can be resident or infiltrating cells in the lungs or airways that contribute to an asthmatic illness or disease, resident or infiltrating cells in the nervous system contributing to a neurological, neurodegenerative or demyelinating disease or disorder, resident or infiltrating cells involved in rejection of a kidney graft, grafted cells that when activated lead to graft-versus-host disease, resident or infiltrating cells involved in rejection of a kidney graft, resident or infiltrating cells, activation of which contributes to inflammation, e.g., in arthritis, resident or infiltrating cells in the kidney or renal system (e.g., mesangial cells) involved in neuropathy and glomerulonephritis and resident or infiltrating cells in exocrine glands (e.g., salivary and lacrimal glands) involved in autoimmune disorders (e.g., Sjogren's disease). Administration of an agent can be directed to one or more cell types or subsets of a cell type by methods recognized in the field. For example, an agent can be coupled to an antibody, ligand to a cell surface receptor or a toxin, or can be contained in a particle that is selectively internalized into cells, e.g., liposomes or a virus in which the viral receptor binds specifically to a certain cell type, or a viral particle lacking the viral nucleic acid, or can be administered locally.</p>
      <heading id="h-00028-en" level="2">Examples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens</heading>
      <p id="p-00413-en" num="0466">The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the modulation of intracellular calcium, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from modulation of intracellular calcium. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00414-en" num="0467">The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00415-en" num="0468">In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a âprophylactically effective amount or dose.â In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00416-en" num="0469">In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00417-en" num="0470">In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a âdrug holidayâ). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from about 10% to about 100%, including, by way of example only, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%.</p>
      <p id="p-00418-en" num="0471">Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00419-en" num="0472">The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be determined in a manner recognized in the field according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of about 0.02-about 5000 mg per day, in some embodiments, about 1-about 1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.</p>
      <p id="p-00420-en" num="0473">The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative.</p>
      <p id="p-00421-en" num="0474">The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the daily dosages are from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, conveniently administered in a single dose or in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to about 500 mg active ingredient. In one embodiment, the unit dosage is about 1 mg, about 5 mg, about, 10 mg, about 20 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 200 mg, about 250 mg, about 400 mg, or about 500 mg. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.</p>
      <p id="p-00422-en" num="0475">Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD<sub>50 </sub>(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED<sub>50 </sub>(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD<sub>50 </sub>and ED<sub>50</sub>. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED<sub>50 </sub>with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.</p>
      <heading id="h-00029-en" level="2">Combination Treatments</heading>
      <p id="p-00423-en" num="0476">The compounds of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V), and compositions thereof, may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols recognized in the field, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the clinician.</p>
      <p id="p-00424-en" num="0477">In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein, such as a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V), is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit.</p>
      <p id="p-00425-en" num="0478">The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00426-en" num="0479">Therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00427-en" num="0480">For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00428-en" num="0481">In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V) described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned.</p>
      <p id="p-00429-en" num="0482">It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00430-en" num="0483">The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00431-en" num="0484">In addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00432-en" num="0485">The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over about 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound is preferably administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from 1 day to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, preferably about 1 month to about 5 years.</p>

      <p id="p-00456-en" num="0508">Several techniques may be used to evaluate store operated calcium entry and calcium signaling in cells. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, patch clamp electrophysiology (measurement of calcium ions or other ions across cell membranes, such as plasma membranes), capacitance measurements (allows exocytosis to be followed at the level of single cells), calcium imaging using fluorescent dyes allows patterns of calcium movement within the cytoplasm to be tracked, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables protein-protein interactions to be evaluated, and molecular biology methods allow for the manipulation of the levels of expression of proteins of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00457-en" num="0509">A wide variety of assay methods may be used to examine the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V). Such assays include in vitro cell based assays as well as in vivo animal models. Any assays that detect, monitor or measure an effect on intracellular calcium, including calcium entry-mediated events can be used. Such assays include, but are not limited to, assays monitoring, measuring and/or detecting intracellular calcium levels, modulation of calcium levels, and movement of calcium into, out of or within cells and intracellular organelles.

      <heading id="h-00035-en" level="2">Cells and Cell Models</heading>
      <p id="p-00458-en" num="0510">For in vitro testing of the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V), a wide variety of cell types for such assays are available. In a particular embodiment, the cell is one in which store-operated calcium entry occurs or that can be manipulated such that store-operated calcium entry occurs in the cell. In particular embodiments, the cell contains one or more proteins involved in modulating intracellular calcium (and, in particular, is involved in, participates in and/or provides for store-operated calcium entry, movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular organelle or calcium store, modulation of calcium levels in an intracellular organelle or calcium store (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) and/or calcium buffering), such as those provided herein. In particular embodiments, the protein(s) include STIM proteins (including STIM1, STIM2, DSTIM and CSTIM protein) and/or Orai proteins (Orai1, Orai2, Orai3). The cell may endogenously express the protein(s) or recombinantly express the protein(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00459-en" num="0511">Cells for use in the methods may be of any species. In one embodiment, the cells can be eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the cells can be yeast, insect (e.g., <i>Drosophila </i>or <i>Anopheles</i>), or mammalian cells. Mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, rodent (e.g., mouse, rat and hamster), primate, monkey, dog, bovine, rabbit and human cells. A variety of cell types can be used in the methods, including, for example, neuronal, nervous system, brain, immune system cells, e.g., T lymphocytes and B cells, primary cells, blood and hematopoietic cells, stromal cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and a variety of tumor and cancer cells. Particular cells include <i>Drosophila </i>Schneider 2 or S2 cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, Jurkat cells, epithelial cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, rhabdoid cells, retinoblastoma cells, neuroepithelioma cells, neuroblastoma cells, osteosarcoma cells, fibroblasts, bone marrow stroma cells, erythroleukemia cells and lymphoblast cells. Other cell lines include HEK 293 and 293T, CHO (including CHO-K1), LTK-, N2A, H6, and HGB. Many such cells and cell lines are available through cell depositories such as, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). Primary cells can be obtained by isolation from tissue sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00460-en" num="0512">Cells from a known cell line can be used, such as neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C or SK-N-SH cells, human SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, SMS-KCNR cells, human LAN-5 neuroblastoma cells, human GI-CA-N neuroblastoma cells, human GOTO neuroblastoma cells, mouse Neuro 2a (N2A) neuroblastoma cells and/or human IMR 32 neuroblastoma cells, chronic myeloid leukemia cells (e.g., human K562 cells), promyelocytic leukemia cells (e.g., HL60 cells) and histiocytic lymphoma cells (e.g., U937 cells), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (e.g., CA46 cells), B-cells (e.g., NALM6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (e.g., MOLT4 cells), T cells (e.g. Jurkat cells) and early T-ALL (e.g., DU528) cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00461-en" num="0513">In one embodiment, the choice of a cell for use in an in vitro assay to test the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds described herein involves several considerations, including, for example, a particular protein that is being used in the method and a particular aspect or activity of intracellular calcium modulation that is being monitored or assessed in the method.</p>
      <p id="p-00462-en" num="0514">In one embodiment, the modulation of intracellular calcium by a compound described herein is examined by monitoring or assessing the effect on store-operated calcium entry. Cells typically used in such methods exhibit store-operated calcium entry either naturally or through manipulation of the cells. Cells that endogenously exhibit store-operated calcium entry include some excitable cells and most non-excitable cells and can be identified using methods described herein and/or recognized in the field.</p>
      <p id="p-00463-en" num="0515">In one embodiment, it may be desirable to utilize a cell that contains components of signaling and messenger systems that can effect release of calcium from intracellular stores. For example, cells containing components of receptor-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activation systems can be used for physiological activation (via generation of IP<sub>3</sub>) of store depletion to facilitate monitoring of store-operated calcium entry. Receptor-mediated PLC activation occurs through distinct coupling mechanisms: PLC-Î² activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and PLC-Î³ activation by tyrosine kinase receptors and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, cells containing a receptor-mediated PLC-activation system can be monitored or assessed for store-operated calcium entry upon agonist activation of one or more receptors known to participate in the system. (see e.g. Bouron (2000) FEBS Lett 470:269-272; Millar et al. (1995) <i>J. Exp. Biol. </i>198:1843-1850; Yagodin et al. (1998) <i>Cell Calcium </i>23:219-228; Yagodin et al. (1999) <i>Cell Calcium </i>25:429-438; and Patterson et al. (2002) <i>Cell </i>111:1-20).</p>
      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0516">An assessment of intracellular calcium after treatment with a compound described herein can be made under a variety of conditions. Conditions can be selected to evaluate the effect of test agent on a specific aspect of intracellular calcium. For example, reagents and conditions are used, for specifically evaluating store-operated calcium entry, resting cytosolic calcium levels, calcium buffering, and calcium levels of and calcium uptake by or release from intracellular organelles. Resting cytosolic calcium levels, intracellular organelle calcium levels and cation movement may be assessed using any of the methods described herein or recognized in the field. Such methods of assessing modulation in intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to, calcium-sensitive indicator-based measurements, such as fluo-3, mag-fura 2 and ER-targeted aequorin, labeled calcium (such as <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup>)-based measurements, and electrophysiological measurements. Particular aspects of ion flux that may be assessed include, but are not limited to, a reduction (including elimination) in the amount of ion flux, altered biophysical properties of the ion current, and altered sensitivities of the flux to activators or inhibitors of calcium flux processes, such as, for example, store-operated calcium entry. Reagents and conditions for use in specifically evaluating receptor-mediated calcium movement and second messenger-operated calcium movement are also available.</p>
      <heading id="h-00036-en" level="2">Evaluation of Store-Operated Calcium Entry</heading>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0517">In one aspect, compounds described herein are added to cells under conditions that permit store-operated calcium entry to occur in order to assess the effects of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V) on store-operated calcium entry. Such conditions are described herein and are recognized in the field.</p>
      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0518">For example, in one method cells may be treated to reduce the calcium levels of intracellular calcium stores and then analyzed for evidence of ion (e.g., calcium) influx in response thereto in the presence of a compound described herein. Techniques for reducing calcium levels of intracellular stores and for analyzing cells for evidence of ion (e.g., calcium) influx are recognized in the field and described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00467-en" num="0519">In other methods, electrophysiological analysis of currents across a cell-detached plasma membrane patch or an outside-out membrane vesicle may be used to detect or monitor store-operated channel currents (e.g., I<sub>SOC</sub>, I<sub>CRAC</sub>) in the presence of a compound described herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00037-en" level="2">Evaluation of Calcium Entry-Mediated Events</heading>
      <p id="p-00468-en" num="0520">A number of molecules involved in calcium-regulated pathways are known. Evaluation of molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events can be used to monitor intracellular calcium, and can be used, for example in screening assays described herein to monitor the effects of the compounds presented herein. Examples of assays include but are not limited to assays which detect, or determine the presence, levels, alteration of levels, production, modification (such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation), translocation, degradation and activity of molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events (see for example, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>276:48118-26). The assays described herein can be used with cells that have been treated with or contacted with a compound presented herein, or that express an altered amount of a test molecule (such as a protein involved in calcium regulation, including a STIM protein, Orai protein), or with control cells. The assays can also be conducted in cells that have been stimulated with a physiological or non-physiological activator, or in unstimulated cells. The following are representative assays for molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events and are meant to be exemplary only. Other assays for these molecules and assays for other molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events can also be employed in any of the screening and/or modulation methods described herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00038-en" level="2">Î²-Hexosaminidase Release</heading>
      <p id="p-00469-en" num="0521">In mast cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx results in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators such as heparin, histamine and enzymes such as Î²-hexosaminidase. Detecting and/or measuring release of such molecules can thus be used to monitor intracellular calcium. For example, media from mast cells can be collected. A suitable substrate for Î²-hexosaminidase (e.g. p-nitrophenyl-acetyl-glucosamide) can then be added and the absorbance of the resulting mixture assessed to measure the relative amount of Î²-hexosaminidase activity in the samples (Funaba et al. (2003) <i>Cell Biol. International </i>27:879-85).</p>
      <heading id="h-00039-en" level="2">Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent CaN Phosphatase Activity</heading>
      <p id="p-00470-en" num="0522">The phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) dephosphorylates various proteins, affecting their activity and localization. CaN activity can be assessed by incubating purified CaN and a CaN substrate, for example a radiolabeled peptide corresponding to a sequence in the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase, either with or without a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V) (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>276:48118-26). The level of radiolabeled peptide and/or the amount of free inorganic phosphate released can be measured to assess CaN dephosphorylation activity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00040-en" level="2">NFAT Transcriptional Activity</heading>
      <p id="p-00471-en" num="0523">The NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) transcription factor regulates a number of genes in response to intracellular calcium levels. For example, NFAT proteins regulate the transcription of cytokine genes involved in the immune response. Promoters from NFAT-regulated genes, and/or regulatory regions and elements from these genes, can be used to monitor NFAT regulated expression and thereby monitor intracellular calcium. Reporter gene fusions can be constructed with NFAT regulated promoters or NFAT-regulated elements operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase, Î²-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein (GFP) or any other known reporter in the art (see for example, Published U.S. Application no. 2002-0034728). The amount of reporter protein or activity is a measure of NFAT activity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00041-en" level="2">NFAT Phosphorylation</heading>
      <p id="p-00472-en" num="0524">NFAT activation is regulated primarily through its phosphorylation, which in turn regulates its subcellular localization. In unstimulated cells, NFAT is a hyperphosphorylated cytosolic protein. An elevation in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, induced by a variety of mechanisms, increases the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates multiple serine residues within the regulatory region of the NFAT molecule. NFAT is rephosphorylated in response to decreases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels or CaN inhibition.</p>
      <p id="p-00473-en" num="0525">The phosphorylation state of NFAT can be monitored for example, by expressing a detectably tagged NFAT protein in cells, such as a His6 tagged-NFAT. Tagged NFAT can be purified from cells using Ni<sup>2+</sup> chromatography and subjected to gel electrophoresis and staining or western blotting. More highly phosphorylated forms of NFAT can be distinguished by their slower migration. The state of phosphorylated NFAT can be used as a measure of NFAT activation (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>276:48118-26).</p>
      <heading id="h-00042-en" level="2">NFAT Nuclear Localization</heading>
      <p id="p-00474-en" num="0526">NFAT localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus is regulated by the phosphorylation state of NFAT. Phosphorylation of NFAT prevents nuclear localization by masking the nuclear localization sequence. NFAT nuclear localization can be monitored, for example, by expressing fluorescently tagged NFAT, for example, GFP-NFAT, in cells. Confocal microscopy can be used to monitor nuclear localization of the tagged NFAT (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>276:48118-26).</p>
      <heading id="h-00043-en" level="2">Cytokine Secretion</heading>
      <p id="p-00475-en" num="0527">Cytokine secretion, such as IL-2 secretion, can be monitored using protein detection assays. For example, supernatant can be collected from immune cells. An ELISA assay or other suitable format with IL-2 antibodies can be used to detect and/or measure the amount of IL-2 secreted as compared to control cells. Secretion of other cytokines, for example, TNF-Î±, can also be detected in similar assays.</p>
      <heading id="h-00044-en" level="2">Cytokine Expression</heading>
      <p id="p-00476-en" num="0528">Expression of cytokines, such as, but not limited to IL-2, can be assessed either directly or indirectly in cells. For example, in indirect methods, an IL-2 promoter can be operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase or Î²-galactosidase, and the reporter construct introduced into cells. Reporter gene expression can be monitored and compared to gene expression in control cells (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>276:48118-26). Alternatively, expression of endogenous or recombinant IL-2 mRNA or protein can be assessed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00045-en" level="2">T Cell Proliferation</heading>
      <p id="p-00477-en" num="0529">Cytokines such as IL-2 are necessary for T-cell proliferation in response to mitogen or alloantigen stimulation, and thus T-cell proliferation is altered by changes in cytokine expression or secretion. T cells can be induced, such as with concanavalin A or alloreactive lymphocytes and T cell proliferation measured, for example, by subjecting cells to a pulse of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and measuring <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) <i>J. Biol. Chem </i>276:48118-26).</p>
      <p id="p-00478-en" num="0530">In some embodiments, the modulation (e g inhibition or reduction) of SOCE by compounds presented herein are determined by evaluation of any of the following criteria:</p>
      <p id="p-00479-en" num="0000">a. there is direct inhibition of increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i </sub>as measured by a calcium indicator; <br /> b. there is a direct inhibition of I<sub>SOC </sub>or I<sub>CRAC </sub>as measured by patch clamp; <br /> c. there is inhibition of downstream signaling functions such as calcineurin activity, NFAT subcellular localization, NFAT phosphorylation, and/or cytokine, e.g., IL-2, production; or <br /> d. there are modifications in activation-induced cell proliferation, differentiation and/or apoptotic signaling pathways. </p>
      <heading id="h-00046-en" level="2">Animal Models</heading>
      <p id="p-00480-en" num="0531">Animal models that can be used in embodiments of the methods further include animals, such as, but not limited to non-human animals, which have, in at least some of their cells, an alteration or defect in, or aberrant functioning of, a cellular process which relies on or is regulated by intracellular calcium. Cellular processes that rely on or are regulated by intracellular calcium include, for example, cellular activation, gene expression, cellular trafficking, and apoptosis. Diseases/disorders that involve defects that may be at least partially compensated for by modulation of intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to: autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjogren's syndrome (cytokines associated with lymphocyte invasion of salivary epithelial cells can reduce calcium mobilization in parotid cells; also, T-cell activation, including activation of transcription factors, cytokine gene expression and cell proliferation, depends on sustained elevation of intracellular calcium level provided by store-operated calcium influx), asthma (store-operated calcium entry may play an important role in mediating bronchial chonstriction and bronchial smooth muscle cell proliferation), glomerulonephritis and glomerular inflammation (changes in intracellular calcium, such as by store-operated calcium entry, signal monocyte adhesion in a co-culture model of glomerular inflammation).</p>
      <p id="p-00481-en" num="0532">Types of animal models include, but are not limited to, non-human animals, such as non-human invertebrates and vertebrates and non-human mammals, rodents (e.g., mice, rat and hamster), cows, chickens, pigs, goats, dogs, sheep, insects, <i>Drosophila</i>, nematodes, worms, <i>C. elegans</i>, monkeys, gorillas, and other primates.</p>
      <p id="p-00482-en" num="0533">Animal models include transgenic and non-transgenic animals. One example of such an animal model that can be used in particular embodiments of the methods is a rodent model of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a characteristic of asthma. This model can be generated, for example, by sensitization through immunization with ovalbumin followed by exposure to aerosolized ovalbumin and challenge by cholinergic stimulation (e.g., via administration of methacholine or acetylcholine) (see, e.g., Xu et al. (2002) <i>J. Appl. Physiol. </i>93:1833-1840; Humbles et at (2002) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>99:1479-1484). Airway hyperresponsiveness (which can be evaluated using methods, such as for e.g., using barometric plethysmography to record respiratory pressure curves and through measurement of pulmonary parameters such as pulmonary conductance and pulmonary compliance) can be assessed and compared in animals treated and not treated with a compound presented herein. A further example of an animal model that can be used in particular embodiments of the methods is a rodent model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, which can be generated, for example, by administration of anti-Thy1.1 antibody (see, e.g., Jefferson and Johnson (1999) <i>J. Nephrol. </i>12:297-307). Any number of parameters indicative of glomerulonephritis or renal dysfunction (e.g., mesangial cell proliferation, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, glomerulosclerosis index and other parameters) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with test agent. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an inbred mouse strain that spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes that shares many immunogenetic features with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, is another example of an animal model that can be used in a particular embodiment of the methods. These mice also manifest many characteristics of autoimmune exocrinopathy (such as Sjorgen's syndrome) including declining exocrine tissue secretory function (see, e.g., Humphreys-Beher and Peck (1999) <i>Arch. Oral Biol. </i>44 Suppl 1:S21-25 and Brayer et al. (2000) <i>J Rheumatol. </i>27:1896-1904). Characteristics relevant to Sjorgen's syndrome (e.g., lymphocytic infiltrates in exocrine glands (e.g., salivary and lacrimal glands), presence of dendritic cells and macrophages in submandibular glands, integrity of the lacrimal gland by measurement of basal and stimulated tear secretion, saliva flow rates and amylase activity) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with a compound described herein. An animal (e.g., rodent) model of autoimmune disease can also be used in particular embodiments of the methods. Such animals include rat models available through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Autoimmune Rat Model Repository and Development Center (Bethesda, Md.; accessible at www.ors.od.nih.gov/dirs/vrp/ratcenter). One rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related chronic/inflammatory autoimmune diseases is the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model (see, e.g., Griffiths and Remmers (2001) <i>Immunol. Rev. </i>184:172-183). Characteristic phenotypes of autoimmune disease (e.g. altered levels of immune reactivity to self-antigens, chronic inflammation of autoantigen-expressing target organs, and activation and participation of invading mononuclear cells and tissue fibroblasts in organ damage) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with a compound presented herein. An animal (e.g., rodent) model of neuropathic or inflammatory pain can also be used in a particular embodiment of the methods. For example, one rat model of neuropathic pain involves development of tactile allodynia (exaggerated response to otherwise innocuous stimuli) after ligation of lumbar spinal nerves (see, e.g., Chaplan et al. (1994) <i>J. Neurosci. Methods </i>53:55-63 and Luo et al. (2001) <i>J. Neurosci. </i>21:1868-1875). Tactile allodynia, one characteristic feature of neuropathic pain, can be evaluated (e.g., by evaluating paw withdrawal threshold in response to application of pressure) and compared in animals treated and not treated with a compound described herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00574-en" num="0622">The day prior to performing the assay, Jurkat E6-1 cells are seeded at a density of 2 million cells/mL in complete medium in a T-175 flask. Cells are grown at 37Â° C./6% CO<sub>2 </sub>overnight. On the following day, 1.5 Î¼M Fluo-4-AM dye (Invitrogen) in complete medium is added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Cells are harvested, washed twice in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS buffer and plated in 35 Î¼L Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS buffer in a 384 well plate. 10 Î¼L of a test compound prepared in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS solution at 4.5Ã of the desired concentration is added to a well and incubated for 5 minutes at RT. 10 Î¼L of thapsigargin prepared in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free HBSS solution at 5.5Ã of the desired concentration (5.5 uM) is added to each well and incubated for an additional 25 minutes. The initial baseline fluorescence signal is measured with a FLIPR<sup>384 </sup>(Molecular Devices) plate reader. 5 Î¼L of 12Ã calcium in HBSS (12 mM) is added and changes in cellular fluorescence are measured with the FLIPR<sup>384 </sup>plate reader. In each well, the change in the fluorescent signal as a function of time due to calcium entry into the cell is determined by calculating the difference between the fluorescent signal measured 7 seconds after calcium addition and the initial baseline fluorescence signal at time zero (t=0). This parameter is designated Upslope. The IC<sub>50 </sub>value is calculated as the concentration at which 50% of the Upslope is inhibited.</p>

      <p id="p-00576-en" num="0624">Formulation: Test article stock solutions are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored frozen. Test article concentrations are prepared fresh daily by diluting stock solutions into an appropriate external recording buffer. If necessary, test article formulations are sonicated (Model 2510, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, Conn.), at ambient room temperature to facilitate dissolution. In certain instances, the test solutions contain up to 0.1% DMSO and the presence of 0.1% DMSO does not affect channel current.</p>

Test articles are weighed and prepared as 30 mM or 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. The DMSO stock is diluted in external recording buffer to prepare a 10 Î¼M test solution (final DMSO 0.03% or 0.1%). The 10 Î¼M test solution is diluted in external recording buffer to prepare 1 Î¼M and 0.1 Î¼M test solutions.

Cells are cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11960) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco 10082), 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium, 1 mM Na pyruvate (Gibco 11360), 100 Î¼g/mL streptomycin sulfate (Gibco 10378), 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Gibco 10131-035) and 50 Î¼g/ml zeocin (Invitrogen 45-0430). Cells should be maintained at â¦80% confluence. The day before testing, cells in culture dishes are washed once with calcium/magnesium-free D-PBS, treated with trypsin/EDTA and re-suspended in the culture media and counted. Cells are then diluted in culture medium with 1% fetal bovine serum and plated at low density (5-10K) onto poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes and placed in a tissue culture incubator set at 37Â° C. in a humidified 95% air, 6% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.</p>

      <p id="p-00583-en" num="0631">Glass coverslips containing cells are transferred to a recording chamber (Warner Instruments) with continuous perfusion of external recording buffer. During recordings of I<sub>CRAC</sub>, all treatments are delivered by gravity-fed bath perfusion from disposable syringe reservoirs via disposable polyethylene tubing feeding into a Teflon manifold. The flow rate is set between 1.2-1.5 ml/min assuring complete solution exchange in Ë1 min. All experiments are performed at ambient temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00584-en" num="0632">Test Article Treatment Groups</p>
      <p id="p-00585-en" num="0633">For experiments where the test article is applied for 10 minutes the treatment paradigm is summarized in Table 1. Control recording buffer is perfused for five (5) minutes while I<sub>CRAC </sub>develops and a stable baseline is established; each cell is used as its own control. Each test article is applied to naÃ¯ve cells (nâ§2, where n=the number cells/concentration; at 1 concentration/cell) for a duration of ten (10) minutes (Table 1). The test article is washed off for ten (10) minutes to look for reversibility of the effect. External recording saline with no calcium is perfused for two (2) minutes to determine the background current in the absence of I<sub>CRAC </sub>Control saline containing calcium is reapplied for three (3) minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00586-en" num="0634">For experiments where the test article is applied for 30 minutes prior to recording of I<sub>CRAC</sub>, the treatment paradigm is summarized in Table 2. Prior to the start of each experiment, cells are incubated with compound for 30 minutes at room temperature, and compound remains present throughout I<sub>CRAC </sub>recordings. Control cells are exposed to vehicle only. After break-in and establishment of the whole-cell patch clamp configuration, recording bufferÂ±compound is perfused for ten (10) minutes. At the end of the 10 min period the amplitude of I<sub>CRAC </sub>is measured. The effects of compounds are determined by comparing the I<sub>CRAC </sub>signal in cells pretreated with compound to the signal in cells pretreated with vehicle.</p>

      <p id="p-00591-en" num="0637">Standard whole cell patch clamp procedures are used. The compositions of the extracellular and intracellular solutions are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Cells are visualized on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX71) and voltage clamped using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and PClamp software (Axon Instruments). Briefly, borosilicate patch pipettes filled with intracellular solution (Appendix 1) are positioned onto the cell membrane. Once a GÎ© seal is formed, suction is applied until the patch ruptures and the whole cell configuration is established. The quality of the configuration will be evaluated with the âmembrane testâ in Clampex to determine cell capacitance (Cm), input resistance (Rm), access resistance (Ra), and holding current at â50 mV (Ih). Data are stored on the CalciMedica computer network (and backed-up nightly) for off-line analysis.</p>

      <p id="p-00598-en" num="0641">Data analysis is performed using Clampfit software. I<sub>CRAC </sub>is measured at â100 mV and the current measured after 5 min is used as the baseline control. For 10-minute application studies, the current measured after 10 min application of the test article is normalized to the baseline current and expressed as % control. For 40-min application studies, the current measured at the end of 10 minutes of I<sub>CRAC </sub>recording time is used as the comparator. The current measured in â0 calciumâ buffer is used to subtract background leak current. Data points for each test article concentration (nâ§2) are fitted to a sigmoid function (SigmaPlot) to determine the IC<sub>50 </sub>and Hill slope.</p>

The animals are sacrificed 12 hours after the final bid dose and 24 hours after the final daily dose and the colon is removed and weighed. During the experiment, body weight, fecal occult blood and stool consistency are monitored daily. Furthermore, when the abdominal cavity is opened before removal of the colon, adhesions between the colon and other organs are noted as is the presence of colonic ulceration after removal and weighing of each colon (a macroscopic damage score is recorded according to established score criteria). The colon-to-body weight ratio is calculated according to the formula: Colon (g)/BWÃ100. The âNetâ increase in ratio of Vehicle-control+DNBS group relative to Vehicle-control group is used as a base for comparison with individual treated groups and expressed as âDec. (%)â (percent decrease). A 30% or more (â§30%) reduction in colon-to-body weight ratio, relative to the vehicle treated control group, is considered significant.</p>

      <p id="p-00630-en" num="0672">Procedure. Specific pathogen free Lewis and Brown Norway rats 10 weeks of age are purchased from Charles River and housed under clean conventional conditions. The animals are handled and allowed to acclimatize for a period of two weeks. Skin donors: female Brown Norway rats, 10 weeks of age. Skin recipients: female Lewis rats, 10 weeks of age.</p>
      <p id="p-00631-en" num="0673">The donor Brown Norway rats are killed to serve as donors of 5 to 8 skin transplants. Directly after killing the Brown Norway rats, the abdominal skin of the rats is shaved and skin transplants of 20 mm in diameter in size are taken. After removal of connective tissue, these grafts are transplanted onto Lewis rats. This is performed by shaving the upper dorsal skin of the Lewis rat under isoflurane anesthesia, removing a piece of skin of 15 mm in diameter by punching and replacement with a skin transplant derived from the Brown Norway rat.</p>
      <p id="p-00632-en" num="0674">During the study each graft is fixated by 4-6 stitches using Safil 6/0 violet (B Braun, Aesculap) and covered by Paraffin Gauze Dressing BP (3Ã3 cm, Smith &amp; Nephew), a piece of gauze and surgical tape. This adaptation minimizes the chance of loosing a transplant for reasons different from rejection.</p>
      <p id="p-00633-en" num="0675">In all cases, transplants are protected with a bandage; these are removed after six days to enable daily inspection of the transplant.</p>

All subjects will have active disease while on a 5-ASA containing medication and are either on stable doses of corticosteroids and/or azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, or who have previously been on these medications but could not tolerate them. Flare is defined as a Mayo score of 6 to 10 with moderate to severe disease activity on endoscopy (Mayo endoscopic subscore of at least 2) within 2 weeks of receiving study drug administration. Doses of permitted concomitant medications (corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), and 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA) containing compounds) should remain constant during the course of the study. Subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or a compound of Formulas (I), (II), (III), (IV) or (V) intravenously on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43. All subjects will be seen in the clinic at regular intervals up to Day 85 for safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and/or pharmacodynamic assessments. All subjects will be contacted 70 days after the last dose of study drug. Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, immunogenicity assessments, chest x-ray, electrocardiograms, and the incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse events. The primary clinical assessment of activity will be determined by the change in Mayo score at Day 57 compared with Screening. Secondary endpoints include determination of remission rate by the mayo score at Day 57, evaluation of mucosal healing and change from baseline in the IBDQ score.</p>
