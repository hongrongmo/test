        <u>BACKGROUND ART</u>
      </b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Biodiesel, a new prospect of grease industry, is a long-chain fatty acid ester-based substance produced by biological greases as raw materials through transesterification or esterification, and it is a novel, nonpolluting, renewable energy. The biodiesel is superior to the petroleum diesel in the flash point, combustion efficacy, sulphur content, oxygen content, aromatic hydrocarbon content, and oxygen consumption for combustion, and other indexes thereof are considerable to that of petroleum diesel. Suspended particles, CO, sulfides and hydrocarbons in the exhaust from combustion are significantly reduced, and thus environmental friendliness is possessed. The study and use of the biodiesel have been widely concerned.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Recently, the biodiesel is produced mainly by the chemical method, which produces a corresponding fatty acid methyl ester or ethyl ester by transesterification using animal and vegetable greases and some low-carbon alcohols (methanol or ethanol) under the actions of alkaline or acidic catalysts. The preparation of biodiesel by the chemical method has the following inevitable drawbacks: (1) the contents of free fatty acids and water in greases as raw materials are strictly required; (2) the saponified matters to be generated easily in the alkaline method increases the viscosity of the reaction system and the difficulty in separation of glycerin, and in the acidic method, the temperature of reaction is higher, and the device is to be easily corroded; (3) in the chemical method, the amount of methanol as used exceeds drastically the molar ratio of the reaction, and the recovery of excessive methanol enhances the energy consumption in the process; (4) a large amount of waste liquids containing waste acids or waste alkalis are generated during the production, which severely pollutes the environment.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Synthesis of biodiesel by bio-enzymatic method has the advantages of mild reaction conditions, low energy consumptions for operation, no pollutant discharge, wide applicability to the greases as raw materials, and the like, and accords with the developing direction of green chemistry, and thus it has increasingly drawn people's attention. However, during catalysis of greases by lipase to prepare biodiesel, when the greases as raw materials have water contents of greater than 0.5% or free fatty acid contents of greater than 3%, the water contained in the greases as raw materials and the water produced from the reaction of free fatty acids with acyl receptor, methanol or ethanol, will influence the esterification, resulting in the final acid value of the product greater than 5 mg KOH/g oil. Nevertheless, the acid value of biodiesel product is currently required to be less than 0.5 mg KOH/g oil in the standard of biodiesel in America, European Union, and China. In order to allow the biodiesel product to meet the requirement of the quality of biodiesel in China and the world for the acid value, a complicated process of alkali neutralization is subsequently needed. This subsequent process of reducing the acid value with alkali neutralization will both influence the yield and quality of product, and result in problems such as environmental pollution and the like.</p>

        <u>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u>

    </heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The object of the present invention is to provide a method for improving the yield of enzymatic preparation of biodiesel from greases and the quality of the product (reducing the acid value of the final product of biodiesel).</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In order to achieve the object of the present invention, in the method for improving the yield of enzymatic preparation of biodiesel from greases in the present invention, during enzymatic reaction of short-chain alcohols with greases to prepare biodiesel, online dehydration steps are introduced, which lead the volatile gases in the enzyme reactor to enter into the low-temperature absorption tank, and the dehydrated gases flow back into the enzyme reactor. The formation of gas-circulation can constantly bring the moisture inside the enzyme reactor out, thereby improving the conversion rate of the reaction.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In the above method, the temperature of reaction is 40 °C to 45 °C in the enzyme reactor.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In the above method, the low-temperature absorption tank is a short-chain alcohol absorption tank at 0 °C to 25 °C.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In the above method, the enzyme reactor is a one stage enzyme reactor or a multiple stage enzyme reactor.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In the above method, the enzyme used in the enzymatic reaction of short-chain alcohols with greases to prepare biodiesel is a lipase derived from <i>Candida antarctica, Thermomyces lanuginosus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus oryzae, Rhizomucormiehei, Rhizopus Oryzae,</i> or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In the above method, the short-chain alcohol is one or more of methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the above method, the greases are biological greases. The biological greases are one or more of vegetable greases, animal greases or microbial greases. The vegetable greases are one or more of palm oil, soya bean oil, rape-seed oil, curcas oil, jatropha curcasl oil, corn oil, castor oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, rice bran oil, shinyleaf yellowhorn oil, or the like; the animal greases are one or more of fish oil, beef tallow, lard, mutton tallow or the like; and the microbial greases are yeast grease, microalgae grease, or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In the above method, the greases are waste edible oils or tailings from the refining of greases. The waste edible oils are hogwash oil, gutter oil or the like. The tailings from the refining of grease are acidified oil or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention introduces firstly the online dehydration technique during the enzymatic preparation of biodiesel from greases to remove online the water in the greases as raw materials or the water produced by esterification, so as to improve conversion rate of the reaction and quality of the product. The online dehydration process may be performed during the preparation of biodiesel by one-step enzymatic reaction (<figref>Fig. 1</figref>), and may also be performed during partial enzymatic reactions of multi-step reactions (<figref>Fig. 2</figref>). Particularly, during the reaction, volatile gases in an enzyme reactor are drawn out from the top of the reactor into a low-temperature absorption tank containing short-chain alcohols. The moisture inside the reactor will be brought out by the volatile gases, and the moisture which is brought out is to be absorbed by low-temperature short-chain alcohols. The dehydrated gases are then pumped into the enzyme reactor via the bottom of the enzyme reactor by an air pump, and a gas-circulation is thus formed so that the moisture in the reaction system can be brought out and absorbed constantly. Such an online dehydration process is achieved primarily utilizing the good water absorption property of short-chain alcohols at low temperatures (0 °C - 20 °C). After online dehydration, the water content in the final reaction system can be controlled to be below 500 ppm, and the acid value of the biodiesel product is lower than 0.5 mg KOH/g oil. This online dehydration process using short-chain alcohols simplifies significantly the operation process, and has good economic and environmental benefits.</p>
