      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for temperature determination and, in particular, to systems and methods for determining a patient's core temperature.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Temperature is an important vital sign in patient evaluation. Physicians commonly use a variety of methods for determining patient temperature including, for example, obtaining temperature measurements with a thermometer. While thermometers utilizing mercury have been in existence for many years, modern thermometers typically employ one or more electronic sensors configured to measure patient temperature. Such sensors may take one or more measurements over a relatively short period of time. Based on these measurements, the thermometer may generate an estimated internal and/or core temperature of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Existing non-contact thermometers typically employ a sensing element configured to measure the temperature of, for example, the patient's forehead, temple, and/or other external body surfaces without contacting these surfaces, and to estimate the patient's core temperature based on such measurements. Such non-contact thermometers are described in co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/450,446, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. While the accuracy of measurements taken with existing non-contact thermometers is highly dependent upon the distance and alignment of the device relative to the external body surface, such thermometers are typically not configured to assist the user in properly orienting the device prior to measurement. Thus, measurements taken with such devices are prone to significant error, and existing non-contact thermometers are not highly reliable as a means of patient evaluation.</p>

      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Whenever possible, like item numbers will be used throughout this disclosure to identify like components of the temperature system <b>100</b>. Additionally, as will be described herein, the described implementations of the present technology in the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> are merely examples. The disclosed technology may be applicable to any other medical device that may use one or more sensors to calculate, estimate, look-up, measure, sense, monitor, and/or otherwise âdetermineâ a temperature of a patient <b>14</b>. Such a temperature may include a temperature of a measurement site of the patient <b>14</b>, and such temperatures may comprise surface or skin temperatures of the patient <b>14</b> at the measurement site.

Alternatively, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>10</b> may be substantially rectangular, substantially square, and/or any other known shape. In example embodiments, the thickness (i.e., the distance between the first side and the second side) and/or the length of the device <b>10</b> may be minimized so as to improve the ergonomics of the device <b>10</b>. Although not expressly labeled in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the device <b>10</b> may include a one-piece or multi-piece housing and/or other like components, and corners and/or edges of the device <b>10</b> may be sufficiently rounded and/or otherwise configured so as not to cause injury to the patient <b>14</b> or the user upon contact therewith. Further, the housing and/or other components of the device <b>10</b> may be made from any material and/or combinations of materials commonly used in medical and/or examination devices. Such materials may include, for example, plastics, polymers, composites, stainless steel, alloys, and/or any other like materials. Such materials may be suitable for repeated use and/or repeated sanitation. Accordingly, in an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> and/or its components may be substantially waterproof. One or more waterproof seals may be included and/or otherwise utilized with components of the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> to facilitate such repeated sanitation and/or use.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In an example embodiment, the first sensor <b>12</b> may comprise a proximity sensor and/or other like device configured to determine a distance between the sensor <b>12</b> and one or more objects disposed in the vicinity of the sensor <b>12</b> without contacting the object. Such a sensor <b>12</b> may also be configured to determine the length, width, height, angular orientation, and/or other dimension or orientation of such objects relative to the sensor <b>12</b>. Such dimensions may include, for example, a height H of an ear of the patient <b>14</b>, the height and/or width of a nose of the patient <b>14</b>, the distance between the eyes of the patient <b>14</b>, an inner-canthal distance, and/or any other like dimension. Such dimensions may also include, for example, a distance between various locations <b>36</b> on the portion <b>34</b> of the patient's face or on an additional measurement site. Such dimensions may be used to determine, for example, the age, gender, ethnicity, and/or other characteristics of the patient <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In example embodiments, the first sensor <b>12</b> may be configured to determine whether and/or when the first sensor <b>12</b> (and, consequently, the temperature measurement device <b>10</b>) is within a desired distance range of the object. Such a distance range may correspond to, for example, a field of view of the first sensor <b>12</b>, and as noted above, an example distance range may be characterized by the distance D illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Such proximity sensors may include, for example, an inductive sensor, a magnetic sensor, an infrared sensor, a capacitive photoelectric sensor, a sonic distance sensor, and/or any other like proximity sensor known in the art. In such embodiments, the first sensor <b>12</b> may emit an electromagnetic field or beam of electromagnetic (such as infrared) radiation. Such a field or beam may impinge upon the object and at least a portion of the field of beam may return to the first sensor <b>12</b>. In such embodiments, the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine a change in the field or return beam, and may determine the distance D between the first sensor <b>12</b> and the object based on the determined change. In such embodiments, the first sensor <b>12</b> may comprise a plurality of components including, for example, an emitter, a receiver, and/or other like sensing devices. Such an example first sensor <b>12</b> is further illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As shown in at least <figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, in an example embodiment the first sensor <b>12</b> may be disposed such that at least one of an emitter, receiver, and/or other component of the first sensor <b>12</b> is disposed substantially coplanar with the first side <b>38</b>. In such embodiments, the first side <b>38</b> may be substantially coplanar with the plane A, and at least a portion of the first sensor <b>12</b> may also be substantially coplanar with the plane A. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the distance range may extend from the plane A to the plane B. As noted above, the plane B may be substantially defined by the portion <b>34</b> of the face of the patient <b>14</b>, and the portion <b>34</b> of the face may comprise an inner-canthal region, a sinus region, a temple region, a cheek region, and/or other region of the face. As shown in at least <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, portion <b>34</b> of the face defining the inner-canthal region may comprise a region of the face including the tear ducts. For example, such a region of the face may extend from approximately the nose of the patient <b>14</b> to at least a portion of each eye (such as a corner of each eye), and may include at least a portion of the sinus region and/or upper cheek. The locations <b>36</b> on the portion <b>34</b> may comprise particular points, areas, and/or other identifiable locations within the specified region. In further example embodiments, however, the plane B may be substantially defined by any of the alternative measurement sites described herein. In example embodiments, the distance range described herein with respect to the first sensor <b>12</b> may be less than approximately 24 inches. For example, the distance range characterized by the distance D may be between approximately 0.01 inches and approximately 24 inches, or alternatively between approximately 6 inches and approximately 14 inches. It is understood that the first sensor may be tuned, focused, and/or otherwise configured to employ a distance range that is not overly intrusive to the patient <b>14</b> while the device <b>10</b> is being used to determine a temperature of the patient <b>14</b>. Further, minimizing the distance range may result in an increase in the accuracy of the patient temperature determined by the device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The imaging device <b>16</b> may comprise, for example, one or more digital cameras, infrared sensors, and/or other like devices configured to assist in generating an image of the patient <b>14</b>. For example, the imaging device <b>16</b> may comprise a digital camera operably connected to the controller <b>30</b> and/or the display <b>20</b>, and the imaging device <b>16</b> may be configured to capture an image of the measurement site and/or other portions of the patient <b>14</b>. Alternatively or in addition, the imaging device <b>16</b> may be configured to collect thermal, infrared, and/or other radiation emitted by the patient <b>14</b>, and to assist in forming a thermal image of the patient <b>14</b> using and/or based on the collected radiation. In such example embodiments, the imaging device <b>16</b> may be configured to send information and/or signals to the controller <b>30</b> and/or the display <b>20</b>, and the display <b>20</b> may display an image of the patient <b>14</b> using and/or based on such signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In example embodiments, the controller <b>30</b> may include components such as an image processor and/or image processing software configured to receive information and/or signals from the imaging device <b>16</b>. The image processor may be configured to assist in forming the image of the patient <b>14</b> based on such inputs. For example, in embodiments in which the imaging device <b>16</b> comprises a digital camera, the image processor may receive information and/or signals from the imaging device <b>16</b>, and may assist in forming a visual image of the patient <b>14</b> based on such inputs. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, such a visual image <b>42</b> may be illustrated on the display <b>20</b> of the temperature measurement device <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Alternatively, in embodiments in which the imaging device <b>16</b> is configured to collect thermal, infrared, and/or other radiation emitted by the patient, the image processor may receive information and/or signals from the imaging device <b>16</b> indicative of such collected radiation. In such embodiments, the image processor may assist in forming a thermal image (not shown) of the patient <b>14</b> based on such inputs. Similar to the visual image <b>42</b> described above, the thermal image may be illustrated on the display <b>20</b>, and such a thermal image may comprise a two or three-dimensional image, temperature gradient, and/or temperature profile of the patient <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In example embodiments, the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> may be configured to determine one or more physical attributes of the patient <b>14</b>, and the controller <b>30</b> may be configured to automatically select an operating mode of the device <b>10</b> based on the determined attribute. For example, the imaging device <b>16</b>, the first sensor <b>12</b>, and/or one or more of the images described herein may be used by the image processor and/or other components of the controller <b>30</b> to determine a distance between a first location <b>36</b><i>a </i>on the portion <b>34</b> of the face of the patient <b>14</b> and a second location <b>36</b><i>b </i>on the portion <b>34</b>, a distance between at least one of the first and second locations <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and a third location <b>36</b><i>c </i>on the face of the patient <b>14</b>, a length, width, height, and/or other dimension related to an ear (such as the height H shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), nose, eye, cheek, chin, and/or other body part of the patient <b>14</b>, and/or other like attributes. One or more such attributes may be used to determine, for example, the age, gender, ethnicity, and/or other characteristics of the patient <b>14</b>, and the controller <b>30</b> may automatically select one or more temperature algorithms, lookup tables, neural networks, and/or other like temperature determination components or protocols for use based on such a determination.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">For example, upon initial screening of the patient <b>14</b>, the imaging device <b>16</b> may assist in generating a digital image <b>42</b> of the patient <b>14</b>. Additionally, the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine one or more distances associated with the patient <b>14</b>, such as a distance from the center of the pupil of the left eye of the patient <b>14</b> to the center of the pupil of the right eye of the patient <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the distance from the corner of the left eye to the corner of the right eye may be determined. In still further embodiments, the height H (e.g., top to bottom) of the patient's ear may be determined. The imaging device <b>16</b> and/or the first sensor <b>12</b> may send corresponding information and/or signals to the image processor and/or other components of the controller <b>30</b>, and such components may determine an age range of the patient <b>14</b> based on such inputs. For instance, based on one or more such inputs, the components may determine whether the patient <b>14</b> is an infant, an adolescent youth, or an adult. Upon making such a determination, the controller <b>30</b> may select a corresponding operating mode of the device <b>10</b> based on the determination. In such embodiments, selecting such an operating mode may comprise selecting a set of temperature determination algorithms for use in core temperature determinations associated with the patient <b>14</b>. It is also understood that the controller <b>30</b> may select such an operating mode based at least partially on the determined distance and/or other attributes of the patient <b>14</b> without making further determinations as to, for example, the age, gender, ethnicity, and/or other characteristics of the patient <b>14</b>. Additionally, one or more of the determined attributes and/or characteristics may be illustrated on the display <b>20</b> separately and/or as part of the image <b>42</b>. Further, as will be described in more detail below, the controller <b>30</b> may select an output type (e.g., providing a temperature based on an axillary reference for pediatric patients, etc.) based at least in part on the determined distance and/or any of the above characteristics of the patient <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The sensors <b>18</b> may comprise any devices configured to sense one or more vital signs or physical characteristics of a patient such as, for example, temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation (hereinafter âSpO<sub>2</sub>â), heart rate, and the like. In an example embodiment, at least one of the sensors <b>18</b> may comprise a temperature sensor, such as a thermopile, thermocouple, and/or thermistor, configured to determine a temperature associated with the patient <b>14</b>. For example, each of the sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to determine a temperature of respective locations <b>36</b> on the portion <b>34</b> of the face of the patient <b>14</b>. Alternatively, each of the sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to determine a temperature of other respective measurement sites of the patient <b>14</b>. It is understood that in some example embodiments, determining a temperature of the patient <b>14</b> with the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> may include contacting one or more patient measurement sites with the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> and/or with at least a portion of one or more of the sensors <b>18</b>. Alternatively, in other example embodiments, a temperature of the patient <b>14</b>, such as a core temperature of the patient <b>14</b>, may be determined without contacting the measurement site and/or other portions of the patient <b>14</b> with the device <b>10</b> or with the sensors <b>18</b> associated therewith. For the duration of the disclosure, such noncontact temperature determination methods will be described in greater detail unless otherwise specified.</p>

In still further embodiments, one or more of the sensors <b>18</b> may comprise an array of pixels and/or other like sensing elements configured to determine a temperature of the various measurement sites described herein. Such sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to convert thermal energy into electrical energy, and may comprise two or more thermocouples connected in series or in parallel. Such components may be configured to generate an output voltage proportional to a local temperature difference and/or temperature gradient. In an example embodiment in which one or more of the sensors <b>18</b> comprises at least one thermopile, the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> may comprise, for example, an infrared thermometer. In such embodiments, the sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to receive and/or emit radiation, such as thermal and/or infrared radiation. For example, the sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to sense, detect, collect, and/or otherwise receive radiation emitted by the measurement site, such as, by respective locations <b>36</b> on the portion <b>34</b> of the face of the patient <b>14</b>. In such embodiments, the sensors <b>18</b> may be configured to collect the radiation, and to send a signal to the controller <b>30</b> indicative of the collected radiation. For example, a first sensor <b>18</b><i>a </i>may be configured to collect radiation from a first location <b>36</b><i>a</i>, and a second sensor <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be configured to collect radiation from a second location <b>36</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the first sensor <b>18</b><i>a </i>may be configured to determine a temperature of the first location <b>18</b><i>a </i>while the second sensor <b>18</b><i>b </i>may be configured to determine a temperature of the second location <b>36</b><i>b</i>. The controller <b>30</b> may utilize the information received from the sensors <b>18</b> for any number of known functions. For example, the controller <b>30</b> may be configured to determine a core temperature of the patient <b>14</b> based on such information and/or on one or more additional inputs.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As shown in at least <figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, one or more of the sensors <b>18</b> may be embedded substantially within and/or formed integrally with the device <b>10</b>, and at least a portion of at least one of the sensors <b>18</b> may be disposed substantially coplanar with the first side <b>38</b> and/or with the plane A. Additionally, each of the sensors <b>18</b> may have a respective field of view <b>19</b><i>a </i>. . . <b>19</b><i>n </i>(collectively referred to as âfields of view <b>19</b>â) that is characterized by a respective angle Î<sub>a </sub>. . .

For example, such fields of view <b>19</b> may be substantially conical, substantially cylindrical, and/or any other three-dimensional shape, and may extend from each respective sensor <b>18</b><i>a </i>. . . <b>18</b><i>n </i>to the measurement site. Such fields of view <b>19</b> may be characterized by any desirable angles Î commonly associated with the sensors <b>18</b>. For example, such fields of view <b>19</b> may be characterized by angles Î less than approximately 20 degrees, and in some embodiments, by angles Î between approximately 5 degrees and approximately 15 degrees. In such embodiments, the fields of view <b>19</b> may define the range and/or area of sensitivity for the corresponding sensors <b>18</b>.

For example, the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> may be employed in any of a number of examination facilities to determine one or more temperatures associated with a patient <b>14</b> such as, for example, an estimated core temperature of the patient <b>14</b>. Such an estimated core temperature may be utilized by the health care professional to assist in treating the patient <b>14</b>, and may have a variety of uses that are well known in the medical field.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In example embodiments, the temperature measurement devices <b>10</b> disclosed herein may be configured to determine patient temperature and/or other physical characteristics of the patient <b>14</b> using one or more contact-based and/or noncontact-based methods of patient evaluation. For ease of description, a noncontact-based method of temperature determination will be described with respect to the flowchart <b>200</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In an example method of determining a temperature of a patient <b>14</b>, the controller <b>30</b> and/or the first sensor <b>12</b> of the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> may, at step: <b>202</b> determine whether the device <b>10</b> is located within the distance range described above with respect to the portion <b>34</b> of the face of the patient <b>14</b>. As shown in at least <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, such a distance range may be characterized by the distance D extending from the plane B substantially defined by the portion <b>34</b> of the face, or any of the other measurement sites described herein, to the plane A substantially defined by the temperature measurement device <b>10</b>. Such a determination may comprise a proximity determination. In particular, the distance range characterized by the distance D may correspond to and/or may be substantially equivalent to the length of the fields of view <b>19</b> associated with the sensors <b>18</b>. Accordingly, determining at step: <b>202</b> that the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> is located within such a distance range may comprise determining that the portion <b>34</b> of the face and/or locations <b>36</b> on the portion <b>34</b> of the face are disposed within a field of view <b>19</b><i>a </i>. . . <b>19</b><i>n </i>of at least one of the sensors <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In example embodiments, determining that the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> is located within such a distance range at step: <b>202</b> may include the first sensor <b>12</b> emitting a beam and/or a field of infrared radiation, at least a portion of which impinges on the portion <b>34</b> of the face. The first sensor <b>12</b> may also collect at least a portion of such emitted radiation, and may determine the distance D between, for example, the first sensor <b>12</b> and the plane B based on the collected radiation. The first sensor <b>12</b> may also provide one or more signals to the controller <b>30</b> indicative of the collected radiation and/or of the corresponding distance D. Alternatively and/or in addition, at step: <b>202</b> any other metric or process may be used by the controller <b>30</b> to determine whether the device <b>10</b> is within an acceptable sensing range and/or field of view of the sensors <b>18</b>. For example, instead of determining the distance D between the first sensor <b>12</b> and the plane B at step: <b>202</b>, the imaging device <b>16</b> may be utilized to capture one or more images of the face of the patient. The imaging device <b>16</b> may send one or more signals to the controller <b>30</b> containing information indicative of the image, and the controller <b>30</b> and/or the image processors associated therewith may determine whether the device <b>10</b> is within a field of view of the sensors <b>18</b> based on such information. For instance, if the image processors are able to identify one or more portions of the face, such as one or more of the locations <b>36</b>, the controller <b>30</b> may determine that the device <b>10</b> has been properly positioned relative to the patient <b>14</b> to determine surface temperatures of the locations <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">At step: <b>204</b>, the controller <b>30</b> and/or the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine whether the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> is disposed within one or more alignment ranges relative to the plane B, and such alignment ranges may include one or more of the preferred angular alignment ranges F, G described above. For example, the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine whether the device <b>10</b> is disposed between a minimum angle Î±<sub>b </sub>and a maximum angle Î±<sub>c </sub>defined by the plane B and a line normal to the plane A. Such angles Î±<sub>a</sub>, Î±<sub>c </sub>are described above with respect to the top view shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Additionally, the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine whether the device <b>10</b> is disposed between a minimum angle Î¼<sub>b </sub>and a maximum angle Î¼<sub>c </sub>defined by the plane B and a line normal to the plane A. Such angles Î¼<sub>a</sub>, Î¼<sub>c </sub>are described above with respect to the side view shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. Further, as noted above, such angles Î±, Î¼ may further define the fields of view <b>19</b> of the sensors <b>18</b>, and the plane B may be substantially defined by any of the measurement sites described herein. Thus, determining that the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> is within one or more of the alignment ranges F, G at step: <b>204</b> may comprise a further confirmation that at least one of the first location <b>36</b><i>a </i>is disposed within the field of view <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the sensor <b>18</b><i>a</i>, and that the second location <b>36</b><i>b </i>is disposed within the field of view <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the sensor <b>18</b><i>b</i>.

      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">At step: <b>210</b>, the first sensor <b>12</b> and/or the controller <b>30</b> may determine one or more physical attributes of the patient <b>14</b>. For example, at step: <b>210</b> the first sensor <b>12</b> may determine at least one of a distance between the first location <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the second location <b>36</b><i>b</i>, a distance between at least one of the first and second locations <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>and a third location <b>36</b><i>c </i>on the face of the patient <b>14</b>, and one or more dimensions of the ear of the patient <b>14</b>, such as a height H of the ear. The first sensor <b>12</b> may provide one or more signals to the controller <b>30</b> indicative of one or more such distances and/or dimensions, and the controller <b>30</b> may determine one or more of the physical attributes of the patient <b>14</b> described above based on such signals. Additionally, the imaging device <b>16</b> may assist in generating the image <b>42</b> described above, and the controller <b>30</b> and/or the image processor thereof may utilize the image <b>42</b> to determine the physical attributes at step: <b>210</b>. It is understood that such physical attributes may be indicative of, for example, the age, gender, ethnicity, and/or other characteristics of the patient <b>14</b>. Further, the controller <b>30</b> may automatically select one or more operating modes of the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> based on the physical attribute determined at step: <b>210</b>. Selecting such an operating mode may include, for example, selecting one or more algorithms, neural networks, lookup tables, and/or other like components or protocols for use in determining a temperature of the patient <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">For example, if the controller <b>30</b> determines, at step: <b>210</b>, that the patient <b>14</b> is an adult, the controller <b>30</b> may, in response to the determination, automatically utilize one or more temperature determination algorithms tailored toward treatment and/or diagnosis of adult patients. Alternatively, if the controller <b>30</b> determines that the patient <b>14</b> is a pediatric patient, the controller <b>30</b> may, in response to the determination, automatically utilize one or more temperature determination algorithms tailored toward treatment and/or diagnosis of pediatric patients. A similar âtailoredâ algorithm and/or process may be employed by the temperature measurement device <b>10</b> in response to the determination of patient gender and/or ethnicity. Accordingly, one or more temperatures of the patient <b>14</b>, such as a core temperature of the patient <b>14</b>, may be determined based on the operating mode selected by the controller <b>30</b>. Further, in such embodiments the controller <b>30</b> may automatically select an output type based on the one or more physical attributes determined at step: <b>210</b>. For example, upon determining that the patient <b>14</b> is a pediatric patient, the controller <b>30</b> may, in response, select one or more algorithms, neural networks, look-up tables, and/or other like protocols having an output comprising a temperature corresponding to an axillary temperature output. It is understood that the controller <b>30</b> may select such an output type (i.e., an axillary temperature) since axillary temperatures are standard when treating and/or monitoring pediatric patients.

In an example embodiment, the first location <b>36</b><i>a </i>may comprise a point or an area on the left inner-canthal region of the patient <b>14</b>, and the second location was <b>36</b><i>b </i>may comprise a point or an area on the right inner-canthal region of the patient <b>14</b>. In example embodiments, the portion <b>34</b> of the face used to obtain the first and second temperatures described herein may comprise a different measurement site than that used to determine at least one of the distance range and the angular alignment ranges F, G described above with respect to steps: <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>. For example, while the forehead of the patient <b>14</b> may be used for the distance range determination at step: <b>202</b>, locations <b>36</b> on the inner-canthal region and/or other like portions <b>34</b> of the face may be used for the temperature determinations at step: <b>212</b>. Additionally, in embodiments in which at least one of the sensors <b>18</b> comprises an infrared sensor, the sensors <b>18</b> may collect radiation emitted by the respective locations <b>36</b>, and may determine corresponding first and second temperatures based on such collected radiation.

In some embodiments, the third temperature may also be determined based at least partially on, for example, one or more of the physical attributes determined at step: <b>210</b>. For example, at step: <b>214</b> at least one of the first and second temperatures may be utilized as inputs to one or more of the algorithms, neural networks, lookup tables, and/or other components selected based on the one or more physical attributes determined at step: <b>210</b>.
