      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This disclosure generally relates to devices and methods for filtering a growth medium used to culture microorganisms, and more particularly, to devices and methods for filter sterilizing gelatinous substance based growth mediums including agar, agarose and other polysaccharide derived growth mediums under elevated temperature conditions to be used in the preparation of agar plates and the like without the need for autoclave processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Agar plates are traditionally prepared by subjecting the agar to autoclave sterilization or gamma sterilization processes. Both of these processes, however, can be time consuming and may damage nutrients in the agar.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For instance, the autoclave sterilization process typically includes preparation of the growth medium, autoclave heating time, sterilization, cooling and pouring of the agar plates. This process can therefore take about two to four hours depending on the sterilization requirements and the specific type of agar medium used in the process. Furthermore, when additives, such as, for example, bovine serum, antibiotics and vitamins are used, the instability of such additives can require even further processing steps after the autoclave sterilization process. In addition, the degree of uniformity of any additives in the prepared agar plates may be less than desired. The autoclave sterilization process may also cause nutritional loss in the agar growth medium and hence a reduction in the ability of the agar plate to grow certain microorganisms.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The gamma sterilization process generally takes days to prepare the agar plates and is very costly on a per item basis should only a small number of agar plates be required. As such, the gamma sterilization process is typically used with pre-poured agar when relatively large amounts of the same type of agar medium are used, as may be the case in certain hospital settings. Like the autoclave sterilization process, the gamma sterilization process can cause nutritional loss in the agar growth medium. In addition, when additives, such as, for example, bovine serum, antibiotics and vitamins are used, the instability of such additives can require even further processing steps after the gamma sterilization process, thus leading to even longer preparation time.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Embodiments described herein provide gelatinous substance based growth medium filtration devices and methods which are particularly well adapted for sterilizing gelatinous substance based growth mediums for use in culturing microorganisms without the need for autoclave sterilization or gamma sterilization processes. According to some embodiments, the devices and methods provide particularly efficient means of processing agar, agarose, and other polysaccharide derived growth mediums for preparing agar plates and the like. In addition, the resultant sterilized growth medium is well adapted with respect to uniformity and nutritional content to culture microorganisms in a particularly effective manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to one embodiment, a gelatinous substance based growth medium filtration device may be summarized as including an upstream filter unit configured to support an upstream membrane filter having a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a first threshold size; a downstream filter unit configured to support a downstream membrane filter having a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a second threshold size that is less than the first threshold size; a housing configured to receive the upstream filter unit and the downstream filter unit and support the upstream filter unit upstream of the downstream filter unit, and the housing including an internal cavity to receive the growth medium upstream of both of the upstream filter unit and the downstream filter unit; a pressurizing device coupled to the housing to selectively pressurize the internal cavity during a filtration operation to assist in forcing the growth medium through the upstream filter unit and the downstream filter unit sequentially; and a heat source coupled to the housing to maintain the growth medium at an elevated temperature within the internal cavity during at least a portion of the filtration operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The upstream filter unit and the downstream filter unit may each include a filter cartridge coupled to a membrane filter support, and wherein the filter units may be removably coupled to the housing to facilitate replacement of the upstream membrane filter and downstream membrane filter. The growth medium filtration device may further include seals positioned between the housing and each of the upstream and the downstream filter units to substantially prevent the growth medium from bypassing the upstream and the downstream membrane filters during the filtration operation. The upstream and the downstream filter units may be configured to position the upstream membrane filter offset from the downstream membrane filter and create a space between the upstream membrane filter and the downstream membrane filter to temporarily receive partially filtered growth medium during the filtration operation. The upstream and the downstream filter units may be configured to position the upstream membrane filter offset from the downstream membrane filter by at least one centimeter but less than or equal to ten centimeters. The housing may include a storage cavity positioned downstream of the filter units to receive the filtered growth medium after the growth medium passes through the filter units. The growth medium filtration device may further include a second heat source coupled to the housing to selectively maintain the filtered growth medium within the storage cavity at an elevated temperature. The growth medium filtration device may further include a relief valve coupled to the storage cavity to selectively relieve pressure within the storage cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The first threshold size of the upstream membrane filter may be about 0.45 Î¼mÂ±0.03 Î¼m and the second threshold size of the downstream membrane filter may be about 0.22 Î¼mÂ±0.03 Î¼m. A ratio of the first threshold size of the upstream membrane filter to the second threshold size of the downstream membrane filter may be between 1.5 and 3.0. The first threshold size of the upstream membrane filter may be about twice the second threshold size of the downstream membrane filter. The heat source may be configured to maintain the temperature of the growth medium within the internal cavity at an elevated temperature at or above a gelling point of the growth medium or at or above a melting point of the growth medium. For example, in some embodiments, the heat source may be configured to maintain the temperature of the growth medium within the internal cavity at an elevated temperature at or above 45Â° C. during the filtration operation. The housing may include an upper housing assembly and a lower housing assembly removably coupled together. The upstream and the downstream filter units may be removably coupled between the upper housing assembly and the lower housing assembly. The growth medium filtration device may further include a discharge valve positioned at a lower end of the housing to selectively discharge filtered growth medium from the filtration device. The housing may include a funnel structure to direct the growth medium toward the upstream and the downstream filter units during operation. The growth medium filtration device may further include a stand coupled to the housing to position the housing above a support surface, the stand configured to provide a space beneath the housing sufficient to receive a Petri dish.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A method of filtering a growth medium may be summarized as including maintaining the growth medium at an elevated temperature within an internal cavity of a filtration device upstream of both of an upstream filter unit and a downstream filter unit, the upstream filter unit configured to support a upstream membrane filter having a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a first threshold size and the downstream filter unit configured to support a downstream membrane filter having a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a second threshold size that is smaller than the first threshold size; and pressurizing the internal cavity to assist in forcing the growth medium to pass sequentially through the upstream filter unit and the downstream filter unit to sterilize the growth medium for use in culturing microorganisms.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The growth medium may include maintaining an agar growth medium at an elevated temperature at or above a gelling point of the growth medium or at or above a melting point of the growth medium. For example, in some embodiments, the heat source may be configured to maintain the temperature of the growth medium within the internal cavity at an elevated temperature at or above 45Â° C. as the agar growth medium is forced to pass sequentially through the upstream and the downstream filter units. The agar growth medium may be a commercially available agar growth medium having a melting temperature at or above about 85Â° C. or may be an agar, agarose or other agar based growth medium having a relatively lower melting temperature in the range, for example, of about 45Â° C. to 85Â° C. The method may further include sealing an interface of each of the upstream and the downstream filter units to substantially prevent the growth medium from bypassing the upstream and the downstream membrane filters when pressurizing the internal cavity. The method may further include sealing the growth medium within the filtration device prior to pressurizing the internal cavity. The method may further include storing filtered growth medium in a storage cavity positioned downstream of both of the upstream and the downstream filter units. The method may further include maintaining the filtered growth medium at an elevated temperature within the storage cavity prior to discharging the filtered growth medium from the filtration device. The method may further include relieving pressure contained within the storage cavity. The method may further include coupling an upper housing assembly and a lower housing assembly of the filtration device together with the upstream and the downstream filter units received therebetween. The method may further include intermittingly discharging filtered growth medium from the filtration device into a series of Petri dishes. The method may further include filtering a source of an initial growth medium to extract a portion thereof which has a relatively lower gelling point and lower molecular weight characteristic and introducing the portion of the initial growth medium which has the relatively lower gelling point and lower molecular weight characteristic into the internal cavity of the filtration device as the growth medium to be filtered.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">A method of preparing agar media powder may be summarized as including dissolving a dehydrated source of a nutrient agar with distilled water to form an agar nutrient solution; heating the agar nutrient solution to maintain the agar nutrient solution at an elevated temperature; filtering the heated agar nutrient solution to filter out relatively higher gelling point and higher molecular weight agar media particles; causing a refined source of agar media particles to separate from the filtered agar nutrient solution; collecting the refined source of agar media particles; and dehydrating the refined source of agar media particles to form an agar nutrient powder characterized by a relatively lower gelling point and lower molecular weight when the agar nutrient powder is combined with distilled water to form a gelatinous mass. Heating the agar nutrient solution may include heating the agar nutrient solution to between about 45Â° C. and 65Â° C. Filtering the heated agar nutrient solution may include passing the heated agar nutrient solution through at least one membrane filter which has a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a first threshold size. Causing the refined source of agar media particles to separate from the filtered agar nutrient solution may include an ethanol precipitation process or polyethylene glycol precipitation process. Dehydrating the refined source of agar media particles to form the agar nutrient powder may include vacuum heating the refined source of agar media particles at a temperature between about 60Â° C. and 80Â° C. The method may further include storing the agar nutrient powder for subsequent use.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In some embodiments, a ratio of the threshold size of the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> to the threshold size of the downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> is between 1.5 and 3.0. In some particularly advantageous embodiments, the threshold size of the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> is about twice the threshold size of the downstream membrane filter <b>80</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the threshold size of the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> is about 0.45 Î¼mÂ±0.03 Î¼m and the threshold size of the downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> is about 0.22 Î¼mÂ±0.03 Î¼m. In this configuration, the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may interoperate in a particular efficient manner to sterilize many types of commercially available agar growth mediums, such as, for example, various agar media available from Becton, Dickinson and Company d/b/a BD headquatered in Franklin Lakes, N.J., and Acumedia, a subsidiary of the Neogen Corporation headquartered in Lansing, Mich. Additionally, the growth medium may be a commercially available agar growth medium having a melting temperature at or above about 85Â° C. or may be an agar, agarose or other growth medium having a relatively lower melting temperature in the range, for example, of about 45Â° C. to 85Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">According to some embodiments, in the event the differential in threshold size between the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> and downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> is selected to exceed about 0.35 Î¼m, one or more intermediate membrane filters (not shown) having intermediate threshold sizes may be positioned between the other membrane filters <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> to provide a series of membrane filters of sequentially decreasing threshold sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A method of assembling the filtration device <b>10</b> will now be described according to the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>. First, the stand <b>40</b> may be positioned on a support surface. Then, the main body portion <b>54</b> and heat source <b>62</b> of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b> may be positioned on the stand <b>40</b> to sit at a height above the support surface. The annular seal <b>86</b>, which may be, for example, an o-ring, may be positioned within a mouth of the main body portion <b>54</b> of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b> to provide a sealing interface for the downstream filter unit <b>26</b>. The downstream filter unit <b>26</b> may then be positioned within the mouth of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b>. The upstream filter unit <b>28</b> is in turn positioned on top of the downstream filter unit <b>26</b> with an annular seal <b>90</b> received therebetween to maintain a fluid tight seal between the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Next, the main body portion <b>42</b> and heat source <b>50</b> of the upper housing assembly <b>14</b> may be positioned over the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> with another annular seal <b>94</b> placed between the upstream filter unit <b>28</b> and the main body portion <b>42</b> of the upper housing assembly <b>14</b> to complete the sealing interface between the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and the housing assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The housing assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may then be clamped or otherwise fastened together with the clamping or fastening device <b>66</b> to compress the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and seals <b>86</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> to form a fluid tight passage extending through the interface between the housing assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The lid <b>72</b> may be secured to the upper end of the upper housing assembly <b>14</b> via the other clamping or fastening device <b>76</b> and secured to the pressurized air source <b>18</b> via an appropriate conduit (not shown) and fitting <b>22</b>. The lower end of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b> may be fitted with the outlet <b>32</b> and discharge valve <b>34</b> for selectively discharging sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² from the filtration device <b>10</b>. Additionally, the lower housing assembly <b>16</b> may be fitted with the pressure release fitting <b>36</b> and relief valve (not shown) for selectively relieving pressure from the internal cavity <b>56</b> of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b> during or after a filtration operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Although the illustrated embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> is shown as including two filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, it is appreciated that in other embodiments, the filtration device <b>10</b> may include three, four or more filter units each having a membrane filter of a different porosity stacked together or otherwise presented in a sequential manner. In one embodiment, for example, a filtration device may be provided with three filter units wherein each filter unit has a membrane filter having a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than threshold size which is at least ten percent different from a threshold size of each other membrane filter, and in some embodiments, at least fifty percent different. For instance, in one embodiment, three sequential membrane filters may be provided having threshold sizes of about 0.8 Î¼m, about 0.45 Î¼m, and about 0.22 Î¼m, respectively. In some embodiments, the difference between the threshold size of any two sequential filters is greater than about 0.20 Î¼m but less than about 0.35 Î¼m. In some embodiments, the most upstream positioned membrane filter may have a threshold size between about 0.45 Î¼m and about 1.20 Î¼m and the most downstream positioned membrane filter may have a threshold size between about 0.10 Î¼m and about 0.25 Î¼m. When the differential in threshold size between the most upstream positioned membrane filter and the most downstream positioned membrane filter exceeds about 0.35 Î¼m, at least one intermediary membrane filter of an intermediate threshold size is beneficial to maintain an efficient filtration mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Furthermore, although the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> is shown as including two separately coupleable housing assemblies <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, it is appreciated that in other embodiments, three or more housing assemblies may be coupled together in a similar fashion with one or more filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> positioned therebetween to form a three-stage, four-stage or other multi-stage filtration device for various growth mediums, including, for example, agar growth mediums.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A method of filtering a growth medium will now be described, according to one embodiment. The method may begin by preparing a growth medium in the form of an agar growth medium <b>24</b>, for example. The preparation procedure may include stirring dehydrated agar culture media with distilled water and heating the mixture to 45Â° C. or above or until it boils to form a heated, flowable agar growth medium <b>24</b>. The growth medium may be a commercially available agar growth medium having a melting temperature at or above about 85Â° C. or may be an agar, agarose or other growth medium having a relatively lower melting temperature in the range, for example, of about 45Â° C. to 85Â° C. The method may continue by depositing the agar growth medium <b>24</b> in an internal cavity <b>44</b> of an upper housing assembly <b>14</b> of a filtration device <b>10</b>. The growth medium <b>24</b> may be deposited in the internal cavity <b>44</b> through an open end of the upper housing assembly <b>14</b> in which a lid <b>72</b> has been removed or through any other input mechanism or device (e.g., feed screw, mechanical gate, etc.) that may be selectively sealed once the agar growth medium <b>24</b> has been deposited. Prior to depositing the agar growth medium <b>24</b>, a heat source <b>50</b> may be activated to begin an optional pre-heating process. The method may continue by heating the agar growth medium <b>24</b> within the internal cavity <b>44</b> of the filtration device <b>10</b> to maintain the growth medium above a gelling temperature or melting temperature thereof. For example, in some embodiments the method may continue by heating the agar growth medium <b>24</b> within the internal cavity <b>44</b> of the filtration device <b>10</b> to 45Â° C. or more and/or maintaining the agar growth medium <b>24</b> at or above 45Â° C. as the agar growth medium <b>24</b> is subsequently filtered. In other embodiments, the agar growth medium <b>24</b> may be heated to and/or maintained at or above 85Â° C. as the agar growth medium <b>24</b> is subsequently filtered. In still other embodiments, the agar growth medium <b>24</b> may be heated to and/or maintained between about 85Â° C. and about 100Â° C., and in still other embodiments, may be heated to and/or maintained between about 90Â° C. and about 100Â° C. as the agar growth medium <b>24</b> is subsequently filtered. The desired temperature of the agar growth medium <b>24</b> for the filtration process may depend on several factors including, for example, the type of agar used and the presence or absence of certain additives. In some embodiments, the method may also include preparing the agar growth medium <b>24</b> with alcohol or another solvent to extract low molecular weight agar to affect the temperature at which the agar growth medium may be heated and/or maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">According to some embodiments, a commercially available growth media or other initial source of growth media may be mechanically filtered to isolate low gelling point and low molecular weight particles to form a refined source of growth media having a low gelling point and low molecular weight characteristic which is particularly well adapted to be filter sterilized by the devices described herein under relatively low temperature conditions. For example, <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows a process flow diagram for a method <b>102</b> of preparing a refined source of growth media powder, according to one example embodiment, which is particularly well adapted to be filter sterilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The method <b>102</b> begins at <b>104</b> where a dehydrated source of growth media powder, such as, for example, an agar nutrient powder, is dissolved with distilled water to form a growth media solution. At <b>106</b>, the growth media solution is heated to maintain the growth media solution at an elevated temperature to maintain the growth media solution in a flowable form. As an example, in some embodiments, heating the growth media solution at <b>106</b> may include heating an agar nutrient solution to between about 45Â° C. and 65Â° C. to maintain the agar nutrient solution in a liquid, flowable form for subsequent processing. Heating of the growth media solution at <b>106</b> may occur simultaneously with the dissolving of the dehydrated source of growth media powder at <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Next, at <b>108</b>, the heated growth media solution may be passed through one or more filter devices to filter out relatively higher gelling point and higher molecular weight growth media particles. For instance, in some embodiments, a heated agar nutrient solution may be passed through a series of membrane filter elements having pore sizes in the range of between about 0.10 Î¼m and 0.65 Î¼m to extract or filter out relatively higher gelling point and higher molecular weight growth media particles. In one particularly advantageous embodiment, a heated agar nutrient solution may be passed through two sequential membrane filter elements having pore sizes of about 0.45 Î¼m and about 0.20 Î¼m, respectively. According to some embodiments, the filtration devices <b>10</b> described herein may be utilized to filter the growth media solution at <b>108</b> to filter out relatively higher gelling point and higher molecular weight growth media particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">At <b>110</b>, the method <b>102</b> continues with causing a refined source of growth media particles, such as, for example, agar media particles, to separate from the filtered growth media solution. For example, in some embodiments, causing the refined source of growth media particles to separate from the filtered growth media solution at <b>110</b> may include an ethanol precipitation process or polyethylene glycol precipitation process. More particularly, a 95% ethanol or a polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution may be added to the filtered growth media solution for an extended period of time (e.g., 24 hours) to form a precipitate of solid growth media particles from the solution. The solid growth media particles may then be collected at <b>112</b> by passing the solution through a filter element to isolate the solidified agar media particles or by other separation techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">At <b>114</b>, a refined source of growth media particles can then be dehydrated to form a refined growth media powder which may be stored or packaged for subsequent use at <b>116</b>. Dehydrating the refined source of growth media particles at <b>112</b> may include, for example, vacuum heating a refined source of agar media particles at a temperature between about 60Â° C. and 80Â° C. Storing the refined growth media powder at <b>116</b> may include storing a refined agar nutrient powder in a container or package for subsequent use or transport.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The resulting growth media powder of the method <b>102</b> described above is advantageously characterized by a relatively lower gelling point and lower molecular weight when combined with distilled water in a gelatinous form. In this manner, the growth media powder may be combined with distilled water and maintained at an elevated temperature that is relatively lower when compared to unrefined growth media powders when filter sterilizing the resulting growth medium according to the filter sterilizing methods described herein. In some embodiments, for example, the gelling temperature may be reduced by ten degrees, twenty degrees or more. This is particularly advantageous in enabling filter sterilization under relatively low temperature conditions which may facilitate increased processing speeds as well as substantially prevent degradation that might otherwise occur due to exposure to higher temperature conditions. In addition, according to some embodiments, the resulting growth media powder of the method <b>102</b> may enable sufficient sterilization to occur when filter sterilizing the refined growth media with a growth medium filtration device having only a single membrane filter.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Irrespective of the gelling point characteristics of the growth medium, the growth medium <b>24</b> is raised to and/or maintained at a temperature sufficient to establish the growth medium <b>24</b> in a flowable form so that it may pass with relative ease through a series of membrane filters <b>80</b>, <b>82</b>. In some embodiments, an agar growth medium <b>24</b> may be filtered at a rate of about 75 ml/min. Accordingly, a sample of about 300 ml of sterilized agar medium <b>24</b>â² may be prepared in about four minutes. This is significantly faster than other conventional methods of preparing sterilized agar, such as, for example, by autoclave sterilization or gamma sterilization.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Next, a pressurized air source <b>18</b> may be controlled to pressurize the internal cavity <b>44</b> and force the agar growth medium <b>24</b> to pass sequentially through an upstream filter unit <b>28</b> supporting an upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> which has a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a threshold size selected from a range of about 0.35 Î¼m to about 1.20 Î¼m and then through a downstream filter unit <b>26</b> supporting a downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> which has a porosity to filter particles of a size greater than a threshold size selected from a range of about 0.10 Î¼m to about 0.40 Î¼m but less than the threshold size of the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b>. In this manner, relatively larger impurities are filtered in a first stage of filtration via the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> and relatively smaller impurities are filtered in a second stage of filtration via the downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> to provide a sterilized agar growth medium <b>24</b>â² to meet generally accepted levels of purity. For example, in some embodiments, the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² is essentially free of any impurities over 0.22 Î¼m upon completion of the sterilization process.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">According to some embodiments, in the event the differential in threshold size between the upstream membrane filter <b>82</b> and downstream membrane filter <b>80</b> exceeds about 0.35 Î¼m, one or more intermediate membrane filters (not shown) having intermediate threshold sizes may be positioned between the other membrane filters <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> to provide a series of membrane filters of sequentially decreasing threshold sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">After sterilization, the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² may be stored in the internal cavity <b>56</b> of a lower housing assembly <b>16</b> positioned downstream of the filter units <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, or discharged from the filtration device <b>10</b> through an outlet <b>32</b> by actuating a discharge valve <b>34</b>. Pressure built up inside the housing <b>12</b> during operation may be relieved via a pressure relief valve coupled to the internal cavity <b>56</b> of the lower housing assembly <b>16</b>. The pressure may be relieved after the filtering process but prior to discharging the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² from the filtration device <b>10</b> such that the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² may be stored in an unpressurized state.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">According to some embodiments, the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² may then be intermittingly discharged from the filtration device <b>10</b> into a series of Petri dishes. Appropriate control systems and sequencing mechanisms may be provided to intermittingly discharge the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² into the Petri dishes in an automated manner. Alternatively, the sterilized growth medium <b>24</b>â² may be discharged into the Petri dishes to form agar plates by manually actuating the discharge valve <b>34</b>. Once prepared, the agar plates can be used for culturing microorganisms in a conventional manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Although embodiments of the methods described above include a dual stage filtration process sufficient to sterilize many commercially available agar and other gelatinous substance based growth mediums, it is appreciated that in some embodiments, a multistage filtration process which includes passing an agar growth medium or other similar growth medium through three, four or more membrane filters may be provided. In other embodiments, it is appreciated that a single stage filtration process which includes passing a refined agar growth medium or other similar growth medium through only one membrane filter may be provided. In addition, although the method described above includes passing growth medium <b>24</b> from an upper housing assembly <b>14</b> to a lower housing assembly <b>16</b>, it is appreciated that in other embodiments, the method may include passing the growth medium through one or more intermediate housings positioned between the upper housing assembly <b>14</b> and the lower housing assembly <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Moreover, the various embodiments described above can be combined to provide further embodiments. These and other changes can be made to the embodiments in light of the above-detailed description.
