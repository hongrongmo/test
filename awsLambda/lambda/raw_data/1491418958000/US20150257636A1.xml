Specifically, the present invention relates to a dental instrument having a video camera for viewing a user's or patient's mouth when utilizing the dental instrument. More specifically, the dental instrument provides video output to a wireless device, such as a smart phone, tablet computer or other like computer. Methods of using the same are further provided.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Individuals have used dental instruments for centuries to care for teeth. Specifically, individuals primarily use toothbrushes and dental floss for brushing plaque from teeth and removing food debris from between teeth that otherwise may cause tooth decay and cavities. Indeed, humans have used some form of tooth care since the dawn of recorded history in the form of twigs or tooth picks. Bristly toothbrushes have been traced back to the Tang dynasty in early Chinese history.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dentists are health practitioners that specialize in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases and conditions of the oral cavity. Specifically, dentists primarily take care of patients' teeth using a variety of instruments, including, for example, brushes, scalers, curettes, drills and other like instruments for cleaning and repairing teeth. In use, these instruments are typically placed inside the oral cavity of a patient and manipulated for their purpose to clean, restore and/or repair teeth and tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, it is often difficult for a user of a dental instrument, whether an individual in his or her own mouth, or a dentist in a patient's mouth, to both utilize the particular instrument within the oral cavity and see what he or she is doing with the instrument. Specifically, it is often difficult to open one's mouth wide enough for an individual or dental practitioner to place the instrument or instruments therein and to see. In many cases, work done on teeth or tissue within an oral cavity must be viewed at awkward angles depending on where the work is being performed, and it is often difficult to allow sufficient light to shine within the oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One solution involves utilizing directed light and/or mirrors to direct the light and allow a user to view teeth or tissue that may otherwise be difficult to view. Specifically, a dental mirror or mouth mirror is a relatively small mirror surface attached to an instrument, typically at an angle so that both light can be directed into an oral cavity and an individual or dental practitioner may see therein. Moreover, focused light sources, such as via strategically placed lamps or the like may be utilized to shine light into an oral cavity for more easily viewing teeth and tissue therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Other solutions may include dental props or retractors that may help to widen the oral cavity and prevent certain oral cavity features from blocking views, such as tongues, lips, cheeks or the like. These props or retractors may be utilized alone or together with light sources and mouth mirrors to gain better views within oral cavities.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another solution involves utilizing cameras to see within oral cavities and aid an individual or a dental practitioner. An intraoral wand camera, for example, may be utilized to view within an oral cavity. Cameras have the advantage of providing clearer images, and may be magnified to show important features within an oral cavity. Thus, the intraoral cameras may be utilized not only to aid a dental practitioner in viewing the internal oral cavity, but to also show another individual, such as the patient, features the dental practitioner wishes to show the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">However, typical intraoral cameras are often separate from instruments that may be utilized to clean and/or treat teeth and tissue within an oral cavity. Thus, a user must manipulate both the camera and the instrument. It is often difficult for a user to align the camera as needed to view the region of the oral cavity that is being worked on by the instrument.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In some cases, cameras may be utilized in conjunction with instruments. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,823 mounts a camera to an instrument at the location of the instrument's tool to help a dental practitioner view the region of the oral cavity worked on by the instrument. However, this involves the placement of a relatively bulky camera lens and housing precisely at the position on the instrument that must be slender and able to fit within tight locations within the oral cavity. Thus, the usage of the camera is limited, and the usage of the tool attached thereto is also limited.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Moreover, placement of the camera at the location of the tool does not provide an effective perspective for an individual or a dental practitioner to both utilize and view the oral cavity with the camera at the same time. Specifically, when utilizing the tool, the camera is necessarily placed in close proximity to the region of the oral cavity worked on by the tool. Indeed, the perspective is much too close to be able to adequately view the work being performed by the tool. In practice, one must utilize the tool without the benefit of the view from the camera, and then lift the tool away from the region worked on to view the results thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A need, therefore, exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that allows easy viewing of an oral cavity. Specifically, a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that provides an individual a view of his or her oral cavity and/or for use by dental practitioners.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Moreover, a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that may be utilized in conjunction with a tool on the dental instrument. More specifically, a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that may be utilized at the same time as the dental tool to provide effective perspective by the user thereof at the time of using the tool.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In addition, a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that may be combined with a light source for illumination of an oral cavity when viewed via the camera apparatus and the tool on the dental instrument. A need further exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that allows simultaneous use of each of the light source, the camera and the tool.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Further, a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that may be further utilized with known techniques for viewing within oral cavities, such as via utilizing external light sources and/or mirrored surfaces for directing light and/or directing views in hard to see regions of the oral cavity. Still further a need exists for a dental instrument camera apparatus that may allow a user, such as an individual or a dental practitioner, to view video wirelessly on a viewing device, such as a computer, tablet, smart phone, or other like viewing device.</p>

The housing may be sealed and made of a material resistant to a moist environment, such as a metal or plastic, as apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In use, a user, such as a dental practitioner, may insert a dental instrument insert <b>14</b> into the dental instrument aperture <b>44</b>, which may securely hold the dental instrument therein, such as via clamping means, frictional resistance means or the like. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the camera lens <b>34</b> is positioned on an end of the housing <b>30</b> and directed toward the tip of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b>, providing a relatively wide viewing cone <b>52</b> for seeing the patient's oral cavity and the dental tool used within the patient's oral cavity. Specifically, the lens <b>34</b> may be adjacent the shaft of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b> and may provide a line-of-sight <b>50</b> for the camera that is roughly parallel with the shaft of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b>. Thus, the dental instrument insert <b>14</b> and, specifically, the working tip of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b>, may be easily viewable by the user of the dental tool <b>12</b> and/or the patient via the camera <b>32</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the lens <b>34</b> may be aimed directly at the working tip of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b> for specific and precise viewing of the working tip of the dental instrument insert <b>14</b>. One or more light sources (not shown), such as LEDs or the like, may further be used to illuminate the dental instrument insert <b>14</b> and/or the patient's oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In a preferred embodiment, a dental mirror may be utilized to allow the camera <b>32</b> to record video and/or still photographs of an area that is ninety degrees, or any other angle, to the line-of-sight <b>50</b> of the camera <b>32</b>, such as within a patient's oral cavity. Moreover, an illumination source emanating from the dental tool <b>12</b> may further be reflected off the dental mirror to aid in illuminating a patient's oral cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the dental tool <b>12</b> may include at least two dental instruments <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, that may work together to allow a user thereof to more effectively utilize the dental tool <b>12</b> to clean and/or repair a patient's oral cavity. For example, and as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the dental tool <b>12</b> may comprise the first dental instrument <b>60</b>, which may be utilized to clean and/or repair teeth and/or tissue within a patient's oral cavity. Moreover, the dental tool <b>12</b> may further comprise the second dental instrument <b>62</b>, such as a dental mirror, for allowing the user to see better the use of the dental instrument <b>12</b> within the patient's oral cavity. Of course, any dental instruments may be utilized together, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, and the present invention should not be limited as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The camera <b>32</b> may thus be utilized to record and/or view within a patient's oral cavity where it may otherwise be difficult for the user and/or a patient to see. The dental tool <b>12</b> may use the dental instrument insert <b>14</b> thereon for working on teeth and/or tissue and the camera <b>32</b> may provide real-time video as the insert <b>14</b> is being used, streaming the video to the display device <b>18</b> or another display device that may accept the video stream wirelessly sent from the dental tool <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the dental tool <b>12</b> may record video therein and/or process the video for streaming to a storage device, such as a smart phone or computer memory. Although the present invention shows a single display device <b>18</b>, any number of display devices may be wirelessly connected to the dental tool <b>12</b> and may receive the video therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an attachment <b>100</b> that may be utilized on a dental tool <b>12</b> as disclosed herein, and may be utilized as a swappable attachment that may be attached to and/or removed from the dental tool <b>12</b>. Specifically, the attachment <b>100</b> may comprise a base <b>102</b> that may align with a mating receptacle on the dental tool <b>12</b> so that the base <b>102</b> may be inserted into the mating receptacle. A slot <b>104</b> may be disposed in the base <b>102</b> for aligning with a flange or nub in the receptacle to ensure that the attachment <b>100</b> is aligned properly. The base may further have a collar <b>106</b> at an end of the base <b>102</b> to prevent the base <b>102</b> from being inserted too far into the mating receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">A stem <b>108</b> may extend from the base, and may have an angle <b>110</b> where the stem may be bent roughly about 45 degrees thereby forming a first stem section <b>111</b>, and may further have a second bend <b>112</b> where the stem may be bent roughly 90 degrees thereby forming a second stem section <b>113</b>. At a terminal end of the stem <b>108</b> may be a mirror <b>114</b> that may be angled at roughly 45 degrees relative to the base <b>106</b>, based on the various bends in the stem <b>108</b>, to allow the camera having a view roughly parallel with the base <b>106</b>, to view inside a person's mouth when the attachment <b>100</b> is used on the dental tool <b>12</b>. Extending from the step <b>108</b> may be a dental instrument <b>116</b>, which may be, for example, a double-sided pick for engaging with a person's mouth, teeth, gums, or other like features. The double-sided pick may be utilized to engage a person's mouth in one direction by using one of the picks <b>118</b> and the double-sided pick may be utilized to engage a person's mouth in another direction by using the other pick <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the attachment <b>100</b> in an end-view, showing the base <b>102</b>, slot <b>104</b> and collar <b>106</b>, and further showing the double-sided pick dental instrument <b>116</b> that may be utilized to engage a person's mouth, and the mirror <b>114</b> that may be utilized to allow the camera view inside the person's mouth when utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In another embodiment of the present invention, an attachment <b>150</b> has a base <b>152</b> with a slot <b>154</b> and collar <b>156</b> for engaging a mating receptacle on the dental tool <b>12</b>. Further, the attachment may have a stem <b>158</b> extending from the base <b>152</b> having a mirror <b>164</b> thereon, as described above. A double-sided dental instrument <b>166</b> may be utilized, such as a double-sided scalar to engage a user's mouth.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Because the slot <b>154</b> is disposed on an opposite side of the base <b>152</b>, as compared to base <b>102</b>, described above, the mirror <b>164</b> and the dental instrument <b>166</b> may be disposed in an opposite direction than the dental instrument <b>116</b> and mirror <b>114</b>, describe above, which may allow the dental instrument <b>166</b> to be utilized in a different manner than the dental instrument <b>116</b>, described above. <figref>FIG. 8</figref> shows the attachment <b>150</b> as it would be positioned when attached to the dental tool <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, a perspective view of a dental instrument <b>200</b> is illustrated. The dental instrument <b>200</b> may comprise a body <b>202</b> and a dental instrument insert <b>204</b> extending from an end of the body <b>202</b> for use on a patient's oral cavity.
