      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to mutant cells for the production of proteins, such as cellulases, and for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. In particular, mutant cells and methods for the production of proteins, such as cellulases, are provided.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant and renewable raw material for biofuel production. However, the initial conversion of insoluble lignocellulosic biomass into cell-permeable and readily fermentable sugars presents a significant technical challenge and major bottleneck in the biofuel production process. Improved means to overcome this bottleneck are therefore needed to unlock the full potential of lignocellulosic biomass as a versatile energy source.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The natural degradation of biomass is achieved by fungal microorganisms through their secretion of lignocellolytic enzymes. For example, the filamentous fungus and laboratory model organism <i>Neurospora crassa </i>(<i>N. crassa</i>) is often found in the wild growing upon recently burnt plant matter, where it secretes cellulases and thereby initiates the depolymerization of plant cell walls. Based on their natural role in lignocellulose degradation, filamentous fungi and their lignocellolytic enzymes have great potential as catalysts of biomass degradation in biotechnological production processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, whereas cellulase secretion in filamentous fungi is effectively induced by insoluble plant cell wall components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, or xylan, soluble inducers are much less effective. For example, cellobiose, the main soluble end product of cellulases, induces cellulases in several species of filamentous fungi, including <i>Hypocrea jecorina </i>(<i>Trichoderma reesei; T. reesei</i>) and <i>Aspergillus </i>species (<i>A. niger, A. nidulans, A. oryzae</i>) but at much lower levels than cellulose itself. However, one problem with insoluble inducers is that cellulase can adhere to insoluble inducers, resulting in reduced yields of secreted enzyme activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The processing of insoluble biomass matter is a heterogeneous process and access to biomass surfaces is limiting for fungal cells. In rich fungal cultures therefore, a large population of cells will be free-floating and not secreting high levels of active cellulase enzymes, due to their lack of contact with inducing plant surfaces. To optimize the production of proteins, including cellulase enzymes, in such cell suspensions and thereby facilitate biomass degradation, cellular systems are needed that secrete high levels of active proteins after induction with soluble small molecules, such as cellodextrin.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Provided herein are mutant cells for increasing secretion of proteins and for the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass. Also provided are methods for increasing secretion of proteins and for degrading lignocellulosic biomass using the mutant cells described herein. Moreover, the present disclosure is based, at least in part on the surprising discovery that mutating Î²-glucosidase genes and/or the catabolite repressor gene, cre-1, in filamentous fungi, such as <i>Neurospora crassa</i>, results in an increase in the secretion of proteins when induced by cellulosic biomass, such as cellobiose. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the activity of Î²-glucosidase genes and the cre-1 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of proteins (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>

The secreted proteins may find use in degrading lignocellulosic biomass. As disclosed herein, mutant cells of the present disclosure contain inactivating mutations in at least one gene, such as a Î²-glucosidase gene, a cre-1 gene, a Î²-mannosidase gene, or a phospholipase or phospholipase-like gene. As disclosed herein, recombinant cells of the present disclosure exhibit reduced expression of at least one gene, such as a Î²-glucosidase gene, a cre-1 gene, a Î²-mannosidase gene, or a phospholipase or phospholipase-like gene, compared to the expression of the at least one gene in a corresponding non-recombinant cell.</p>

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Cellulosic biomass is mass obtained from living matter, such as plants, algae, fungi, bacteria, and bacterial biofilms that contains polysaccharides and polysaccharide components. Cellulose is the predominant polysaccharide in cellulosic biomass. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose (a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan), and includes glucose units linked together in Î²-1,4-glycosidic linkages. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Cellulosic biomass may be raw biomass, pre-treated biomass, or processed biomass. Cellulosic biomass may also include one or more saccharides.</p>

      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. For example, the determination of percent sequence identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Non-limiting examples of such mathematical algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) CABIOS 4:11 17; the local homology algorithm of Smith et al. (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482; the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 453; the search-for-similarity-method of Pearson and Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:2444 2448; the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 872264, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873 5877.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis., USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins et al. (1988) Gene 73:237 244 (1988); Higgins et al. (1989) CABIOS 5:151 153; Corpet et al. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16:10881 90; Huang et al. (1992) CABIOS 8:155 65; and Pearson et al. (1994) Meth. Mol. Biol. 24:307 331. The ALIGN program is based on the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) supra. A PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used with the ALIGN program when comparing amino acid sequences. The BLAST programs of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403 are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) supra. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTN program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of the present disclosure. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTX program, score=50, wordlength=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein or polypeptide of the present disclosure. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. See Altschul et al. (1997) supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, or PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTN for nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Alignment may also be performed manually by inspection.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">As used herein, sequence identity or identity in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins, it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical and often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity), do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have sequence similarity or similarity. Means for making this adjustment are well-known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>

Cultures were then induced with 2% sucrose, 2% cellobiose, 1% sucrose/1% cellobiose, or 1% sucrose/1% AvicelÂ®. Cultures continued to grow under constant light at 200 rpm for 5 days with supernatant collected at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 day. The collected supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 Î¼m PES filter to remove biomass before being stored at â20Â° C. until all samples were collected. To visualize the secreted proteins, 15 Î¼l of unconcentrated supernatant was run on a Criterion 10% Tris-HCL polyacrylamide gel and stained with Thermo Scientific GelCode Blue Stain Reagent.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0157">Endo-1,4-Î²-Glucanase activity was measured using Azo-CM-Cellulose (Megazyme) according to the manufacturers suggested method. Briefly, 100 Î¼l Azo-CM-Cellulose substrate solution pre-heated to 37Â° C. was mixed with 96.5 Î¼l culture supernatant and 3.5 Î¼l 3M sodium acetate pH5.0 in a deep-well 96-well plate. Following mixing, the plate was incubated for 10 minutes at 37Â° C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml Precipitant Solution and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 g. 50 Î¼l sample was transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well assay plate in triplicate and the absorbance was read in a Beckman Coulter Paradigm plate reader at an optical density of 590 nm. The data is presented as a percentage of the wild type activity on AvicelÂ® after 4 days.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0158">Exoglucanase (Cellobiohydrolase I) activity was measured using a 4-Methylumbelliferyl Î²-D-cellobioside (MuLac) assay. This assay mainly measures the activity of CBH-1 and activity is expressed as the change in fluorescence over time resulting in the slope of a best-fit line as an indication of enzyme activity. Prior to performing this assay, any excess sugars in the culture supernatant were removed by passing the supernatant over a 5,000 Dalton concentrator (sartorius stedim Vivaspin 500). Retained proteins were washed twice with 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5 and diluted to 2 Î¼g/Î¼l to assure that the assay remained in the linear range. The assay was performed in a total volume of 100 Î¼l containing 10 Î¼g total protein and had a final concentration of 1.0 mM MuLac and 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5. The assay was performed in a Beckman Coulter Paradigm plate reader set at 40Â° C. with excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/465 nm with readings every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. The slope of the best-fit line represents the MuLac activity for an individual culture supernatant. The MuLac activity is normalized to the initial dilution required to obtain a 2 Î¼g/Î¼l concentration in order to represent the undiluted activity. The activity of recombinant cellobiohydrolase-1 was used as a standard and data is presented as a percentage of the wild type activity on AvicelÂ® after 4 days.</p>

      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0161">In order to study early time points of cellulase induction in <i>N. crassa</i>, cultures were first grown for 16-hours on sucrose to produce a significant amount of biomass and subsequently transferred to a fresh culture containing an alternate carbon source. An initial time course on the WT strain demonstrated that a four-hour induction period provides a maximal difference in gene expression on sucrose versus AvicelÂ® for the cellobiohydrolase I gene cbh-1 and the endoglucanase 2 gene gh5-1 (<figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0162">Three Î²-glucosidases (NCU08755, NCU04952, and NCU00130) have been shown to be significantly increased at the transcriptional level during growth of WT <i>N. crassa </i>on AvicelÂ® or <i>Miscanthus </i>(Tian et al, 2009). Additionally, NCU04952 was identified as a secreted protein by mass spectrometry (Tian et al, 2009). To determine whether these three Î²-glucosidases play a role in the induction of cellulases on cellobiose, three strains containing deletions of single Î²-glucosidases were screened by qRT-PCR for cellobiose-mediated induction of cellulases. However, no single Î²-glucosidase deletion mutant showed a significant effect. To overcome the problem of redundancy of Î²-glucosidase activities and the possibility of strong catabolite repression at minimal glucose concentrations, a triple Î²-glucosidase deletion strain was constructed.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0163">On AvicelÂ®, the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion strain showed a similar induction phenotype as the WT strain for the three cellulases examined (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). However, on 2% cellobiose, while the WT strain only shows a 20-fold induction for cbh-1, and no change for cbh-2 or eg-2 compared to their relative expression on sucrose, the triple Î²-glucosidase mutant shows a very different picture: cbh-1 has a 6,500-fold increase in relative expression over expression on sucrose; cbh-2 has a 2,100-fold increase in relative expression and eg-2 has a 2,200-fold increase in relative expression (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0164">Induction of Cellulase Transcription in Triple Î²-Glucosidase and Cre-1 Gene Deletion</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0165">By crossing the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion with the Îcre-1 strain a mutant was generated that transcriptionally responds to cellobiose in the same way as the WT strain responds to AvicelÂ®. Induction of this mutant with either cellobiose or AvicelÂ® shows similar transcriptional induction of cbh-1, cbh-2 and eg-2 as the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion on cellobiose or AvicelÂ® and as the WT strain on AvicelÂ® (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). These results demonstrate that cre-1 acts as a general cellulolytic regulon and that cre-1 deletion causes the permanent de-repression of <i>N. crassa </i>cellulases.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0166">Cre-1 deletion is known to moderately increase the transcription and secretion of cellulases on AvicelÂ®. Similarly, Cre-1 is known to allow for approximately 7-fold increases in the basal level of transcription for cbh-1 and eg-2 on sucrose compared to WT expression on sucrose (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). When induced with cellobiose, Îcre-1 shows a 600-fold increase in transcription of cbh-1 and an 80-fold increase in eg-2 above their expression on sucrose in the same strain (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). While this increase in expression is significant relative to expression on sucrose, it is dwarfed by the 11,000-fold increase in cbh-1 and the 8000-fold increase in eg-2 seen when Îcre-1 is induced with AvicelÂ® (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0167">In order to show that the transcriptional response to cellobiose is specific and not due to a general starvation effect, a no carbon control experiment was performed. After an initial 16-hour pre-growth phase on sucrose a gentle wash was conducted with minimal media to remove any remaining sucrose and finally the biomass was transferred to a culture containing minimal media without any added carbon source. Because these cultures were processed in the same way as the cultures with added sucrose, cellobiose or AvicelÂ®, the transcriptional data obtained through RT-PCR will show the general affect of starvation on cellulase transcription.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0168">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows that while the WT strain, Îcre-1, and the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion show a slight induction due to starvation (three to thirty-fold increases), the triple 0-glucosidase/cre-1 deletion has a larger increase in transcription of cbh-1 and eg-2 under these conditions. Relative to triple Î²-glucosidase/cre-1 deletion growth on sucrose, its response to starvation is a 340 and 200-fold induction of cbh-1 and eg-2 respectively. These effects are minor compared to the 10,000 to 20,000-fold induction of cbh-1 and eg-2 observed on AvicelÂ® or cellobiose. These results therefore demonstrate that the transcriptional response of these <i>N. crassa </i>cellulases on AvicelÂ® and cellobiose is specific and not a general response to starvation.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0169">During cellulose hydrolysis in nature cellobiose and glucose do not accumulate to levels high enough to cause significant glucose repression. This phenomenon can be reproduced in vitro by varying the experimental concentrations of cellobiose. <figref>FIGS. 6A-6C</figref> shows that while induction of cellulases in the wild type strain is significantly reduced relative to the deletion strains, the WT cellulase expression is concentration dependent, with the lower 1 mM cellobiose concentration acting as a better inducer than the higher 10 mM concentration. By removing the activity of the major Î²-glucosidases, a 25-fold increase over wild type induction is achieved at either cellobiose concentration. Moreover, after deleting the catabolite repressor CRE-1, increasing cellobiose concentrations no longer limit enzyme induction (<figref>FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0170">Deletion of Î²-Glucosidase Genes Shows Increased Cellulolytic Enzyme Production when Induced with Cellobiose</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0171">The triple Î²-glucosidase deletion shows a very similar result to the wild type culture when induced with sucrose or AvicelÂ®. On sucrose, there is very little secreted protein (180 Î¼g/ml) after 2 days (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7F</figref>), and those that are secreted have no activity towards MuLac (<figref>FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>). When induced with AvicelÂ®, by day 4 we can see a significant concentration of proteins in the supernatant (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7F</figref>). This culture supernatant has an Azo-CM-Cellulose and MuLac activity similar to that for the wild type cultures at the same time point (5.5 Î¼g CBHI equivalent) (<figref>FIGS. 8A-8B</figref> and <b>9</b>). While this deletion is similar to wild type for the sucrose and AvicelÂ® cultures, it responds very differently to cellobiose. At two days on cellobiose, we can see MuLac activity equivalent to 1.4 Î¼g recombinant CBHI and by 4 days, this value has significantly increased to 4.84 Î¼g recombinant CBHI equivalent (<figref>FIG. 8B</figref>), and the Azo-CM-Cellulose activity is similar to the wild type when grown on AvicelÂ® (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>). This specific enzyme activity indicates that in addition to inducing transcription, cellobiose can directly stimulate the secretion of active cellulases when we minimize the affect of carbon catabolite repression.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0172">Deletion of Cre-1 Increased Cellulolytic Enzyme Production</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0173">To investigate the role of CRE-1 for <i>N. crassa </i>growth on cellulolytic media the relative growth rates of Îcre-1 and wild type (WT) strains were compared on different carbon sources. When grown on 2% AvicelÂ® medium as a sole carbon source, the Îcre-1 strain consumed AvicelÂ® faster than WT (e.g. 3-4 days vs. 5-6 days), secreted 30% more extracellular protein and showed 50% higher endoglucanase activity (<figref>FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>). An aggregate Avicelase assay (which measures combined Î²-glucosidase, endo- and exo-cellulase activity) showed 20% higher glucose concentrations in the Îcre-1 strain as compared to WT (<figref>FIG. 10B</figref>). However, less cellobiose was detected, suggesting increased secretion of Î²-glucosidase (which converts cellobiose into glucose; <figref>FIG. 10B</figref>) in the Îcre-1 strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0174">Compared to the WT strain, Îcre-1 generally appears to produce more secreted proteins. This is evident not only in the cellobiose and AvicelÂ® induced cultures, but also at 48 hours on sucrose (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7F</figref> and <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D) where the secreted protein concentration is approximately twice that seen for WT (481 Î¼g/ml vs. 270 Î¼g/ml). While the Îcre-1 secretes more protein on sucrose, these proteins do not exhibit any activity towards MuLac (<figref>FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>). While the most obvious band at 70 kDa, runs at the same molecular weight as CBH-1/2, the lack of activity implies that this is either an inactive form of CBH-1/2 or a different non-cellulolytic protein. Similar to what was seen in the transcriptional studies, Îcre-1 shows a slight increase in cellulase secretion on cellobiose (653 Î¼g/ml) (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7F</figref>), which results in a modest increase in activity towards MuLac (0.8 ug) (<figref>FIG. 8B</figref>). In addition, when induced with AvicelÂ®, the MuLac activity at 4 days is less than the activity of wild type (2.8 ug CBHI equivalent) (<figref>FIG. 8B</figref>). However, this effect might be due to starvation as the overall protein-banding pattern is generally lighter at 4 days as compared to 3 days (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0175">Deletion of Î²-Glucosidase Genes and Cre-1 Shows Increased Cellulolytic Enzyme Production when Induced with Cellobiose</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0176">The triple Î²-glucosidase/Îcre-1 deletion strain is similar to the cre-1 deletion strain in that it seems to constitutively secrete more enzymes than the wildtype and the pattern visible on a protein gel under sucrose or AvicelÂ® induction look very similar for these two strains (<figref>FIGS. 11A-11D</figref>). The major difference between the Îcre-1 and triple Î²-glucosidase/Îcre-1 deletion strains is the affect of cellobiose on the activity of the secreted proteins (<figref>FIGS. 8A-8B</figref>). By four days on cellobiose, this mutant is capable of producing more than 11 Î¼g CBHI equivalent, which is even more than is produced on AvicelÂ® at this same timepoint (<figref>FIG. 8B</figref>). In addition, the Azo-CMC activity assay indicates that this strain produces a similar amount of endo-1,4-Î²-glucanase activity in either an AvicelÂ® or cellobiose inducing culture (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>).</p>

The nanoESI emitter tip was positioned approximately 3 mm from the sampling cone aperture. The nanoESI source parameters were as follows: nanoESI voltage 2.4 kV, nebulizing gas (nitrogen) pressure 0.15 mbar, sample cone voltage 35 V, extraction cone and ion guide voltages 4 V, and source block temperature 80Â° C. No cone gas was used. The collision cell contained argon gas at a pressure of 8Ã10<sup>â3 </sup>mbar. The Tof analyzer was operated in âVâ mode. Under these conditions, a mass resolving power (53) of 1.0Ã10<sup>4 </sup>(measured at m/z=771) was routinely achieved, which was sufficient to resolve the isotopic distributions of the singly and multiply charged precursor and fragment ions measured in this study. Thus, an ion's mass and charge were determined independently, i.e., the ion charge was determined from the reciprocal of the spacing between adjacent isotope peaks in the m/z spectrum. External mass calibration was performed immediately prior to analysis using a solution of sodium formate. Survey scans were acquired in the positive ion mode over the range m/z=400-1500 using a 0.45 s scan integration and a 0.05 s interscan delay. In the data-dependent mode, up to five precursor ions exceeding an intensity threshold of 20 counts/second (cps) were selected from each survey scan for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Real-time deisotoping and charge state recognition were used to select 2+, 3+, and 4+ charge state precursor ions for MS/MS. Collision energies for collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) were automatically selected based on the mass and charge state of a given precursor ion. MS/MS spectra were acquired over the range m/z=100-2000 using a 0.20 s scan integration and a 0.05 s interscan delay. Ions were fragmented to achieve a minimum total ion current (TIC) of 30,000 cps in the cumulative MS/MS spectrum for a maximum of 2 s. To avoid the occurrence of redundant MS/MS measurements, real-time dynamic exclusion was used to preclude re-selection of previously analyzed precursor ions over an exclusion width of Â±0.2 m/z unit for a period of 300 s.</p>

Processed data were searched against the <i>Neurospora crassa </i>protein database (Broad Institute, Cambridge, Mass.). The following criteria were used for the database search: precursor ion mass tolerance 100 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance 0.15 Da, digest reagent trypsin, allowing for up to three missed cleavages, and methionine oxidation as a variable modification. The identification of at least three consecutive fragment ions from the same series, i.e., b or y-type fragment ions (54), was required for assignment of a peptide to an MS/MS spectrum. MS/MS spectra were inspected to verify the presence of fragment ions that identify the peptides.

      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0219">Induction of Cellulase Transcripts in Cellodextrin-Induced Cultures of <i>N. crassa </i>Lacking Three Î²-Glucosidase Genes</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0220">Lignocellulolytic genes were not induced, nor was cellulolytic enzyme activity detected when wild-type <i>N. crassa </i>(WT) was grown on sucrose, cellobiose, cellotriose, or cellotetraose as the sole carbon source (<figref>FIG. 17A</figref>). It was believed that when <i>N. crassa </i>is grown on cellodextrins, glucose produced by action of Î²-glucosidase enzymes may mask its inducing capacity (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). While the genome of <i>N. crassa </i>has at least 7 genes encoding predicted Î²-glucosidase enzymes, only three (NCU00130, NCU04952 and NCU08755) show a significant increase in transcription during growth on AvicelÂ® or <i>Miscanthus </i>(20). All three of these Î²-glucosidases showed significant homology to both predicted and experimentally verified Î²-glucosidase enzymes in other filamentous fungi. Based on expression data, we believed that GH1-1 (NCU00130), GH3-3 (NCU08755), and GH3-4 (NCU04952) would be the most relevant enzymes in converting cellobiose to glucose when <i>N. crassa </i>is grown on either AvicelÂ® or cellodextrins as sole carbon sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0221">To determine whether cellobiose induces cellulase gene expression in <i>N. crassa</i>, we tested whether the expression of three major cellulase genes (cbh-1, NCU07340; gh6-2, NCU09680 and gh5-1, NCU00762) were induced in strains carrying deletions in the Î²-glucosidase genes gh1-1, gh3-3 or gh3-4 via a transfer experiment. To eliminate the possibility of redundancy between the Î²-glucosidase enzymes, double and triple mutant strains carrying different combinations of Î²-glucosidase gene deletion sets were also constructed and tested. Following a 4 hr induction with 0.2% cellobiose, the individual Î²-glucosidase deletion strains (Îgh1-1, Îgh3-3 or Îgh3-4) did not show a significant induction of cbh-1, gh6-2, or gh5-1 expression; whereas a Îgh1-1Îgh3-3 double mutant showed some cellulase gene induction. However, a strain carrying deletions for all three Î²-glucosidase genes (Îgh1-1, Îgh3-3 and Îgh3-4; Î3Î²G) showed similar relative expression levels of cbh-1, gh5-1 and gh6-2 when shifted to 0.2% cellobiose as did a WT culture shifted to AvicelÂ® (<figref>FIG. 18A</figref>). In addition, the Î3Î²G strain showed similar relative expression levels of cbh-1, gh5-1 and gh6-2 when shifted to cellobiose, cellotriose, or cellotetraose (<figref>FIG. 17B</figref>). The transcriptional response in the Î3Î²G mutant was specific for cellobiose and was not due to starvation as the expression of cbh-1 and gh5-1 in WT and the Î3Î²G strain when transferred to media lacking any carbon source showed only a small increase in transcription levels (less than 50-fold induction). These values are negligible when compared to the 20,000-fold (minimum) induction of cbh-1 and gh5-1 by AvicelÂ® in WT <i>N. crassa </i>and in the Î3Î²G strain shifted to cellobiose.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0222">The most widely used soluble inducers of cellulases in the industrial species <i>T. reesei </i>are sophorose and lactose (25). We therefore examined whether exposure to sophorose or lactose induced cellulase gene expression in <i>N. crassa </i>using both the WT and the Î3Î²G deletion strain. As observed for other filamentous fungal species (15), transfer of either WT or the Î3Î²G mutant to media containing sophorose, lactose or D-(+)-galactose (a degradation product of lactose), did not significantly induce cellulase gene expression (<figref>FIGS. 19A-19B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0223">Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) acts in filamentous fungi to repress cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression in the presence of preferred carbon sources, such as glucose or sucrose, even when lignocellulose is present (4). The C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor CreA/CRE1/CRE-1 (26) plays a key role in CCR as strains lacking CreA/CRE1/CRE-1 in <i>Aspergillus </i>sp., <i>T. reesei </i>and <i>N. crassa</i>, respectively, produce increased amounts of both cellulases and hemicellulases when grown on cellulose or hemicellulose (21, 27, 28). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from an <i>N. crassa </i>cre-1 deletion strain (ÎNCU08807) showed that the basal expression of cbh-1 and gh5-1 increased about ten-fold relative to a WT strain. When shifted from sucrose to 0.2% cellobiose for 4 hrs, the Îcre-1 strain showed increased induction of cbh-1, gh5-1 and gh6-2 (3,000, 500, and 85-fold, respectively). However, the level of induction in the Îcre-1 mutant was significantly lower than induction levels obtained for WT exposed to AvicelÂ® or the Î3Î²G mutant exposed to cellobiose. Notably, a Î3Î²G strain that also carried the Îcre-1 deletion (Î3Î²GÎcre) exhibited stronger induction of cbh-1, gh5-1 and gh6-2 than either the WT strain shifted to AvicelÂ® or the Î3Î²G strain shifted to cellobiose (<figref>FIG. 18A</figref>). These data indicate that the induction of cellulase gene expression in the Î3Î²G mutant when exposed to cellobiose is comparable to induction by cellulose and is not a consequence of relief from CCR.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0224">Recapitulation of Wild-Type <i>N. crassa </i>Cellulolytic Response in the Triple Î²-Glucosidase Mutant on Cellobiose</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0225">High throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to assess whether the full genomic response in the Î3Î²G strains to cellobiose was similar to or different from a WT strain exposed to AvicelÂ®. The full genomic pattern of gene expression changes showed that the response of the Î3Î²G mutant to cellobiose closely matched that of WT induced by AvicelÂ®, but was significantly different from the response of WT to cellobiose or when subjected to starvation. To identify which genes were significantly and specifically induced in WT <i>N. crassa </i>in response to AvicelÂ®, a pairwise analysis was performed between expression profiles of WT transferred to AvicelÂ® versus WT transferred to no added carbon source. These analyses identified 321 genes (including the three deleted Î²-glucosidase genes) that were significantly and specifically induced in WT cultures in response to AvicelÂ® (cellulose regulon). This gene set included 16 predicted cellulase and 12 predicted hemicellulase genes. Additional genes in the cellulose regulon included 41 genes encoding proteins predicted to be active on carbohydrates by CAZy (29) and 111 genes encoding secreted proteins (signalP) (30). Of the 321 genes in the cellulose regulon, 156 encode proteins that are characterized as unclassified proteins (MIPS FunCat database) (31). Of specific interest, the orthologue for xlnR/xyr1 (NCU06971), which plays a major role in the regulation of cellulases in <i>Aspergilli </i>(32) and <i>T. reesei </i>(33), falls into the cellulose regulon. However, although NCU06971 was previously identified as a xlnR/xyr1 homolog in <i>N. crassa </i>(34), its role in plant cell wall degradation is unknown.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0226">Hierarchical clustering of genes within the cellulose regulon from expression data of WT transferred to media containing no carbon source, cellobiose or AvicelÂ® and the Î3Î²G strain transferred to media containing cellobiose or AvicelÂ® resulted in the identification of four distinct expression clusters (<figref>FIG. 20A</figref>). The largest cluster (cluster 2) contained 210 genes that showed high expression in the WT strain on AvicelÂ®, as well as in the Î3Î²G strain on either cellobiose or under AvicelÂ®-induced conditions. This group of 210 genes contained all 16 predicted cellulases (NCU00762, gh5-1; NCU00836, gh61-7; NCU01050, gh61-4; NCU02240, gh61-1; NCU02344, gh61-12; NCU02916, gh61-3; NCU03328, gh61-6; NCU04854, gh7-2; NCU05057, gh7-1; NCU05121, gh45-1; NCU07190, gh6-3; NCU07340, cbh-1; NCU07760, gh61-2; NCU07898, gh61-13; NCU08760, gh61-5; NCU09680, gh6-2) as well as 3 genes identified to be accessory proteins for cellulose degradation (NCU00206, cdh-1; NCU07143, lac-2; NCU09764, CBM1 containing protein) (20, 35). This cluster also contained 9 hemicellulase genes (NCU02343, gh51-1; NCU02855, gh11-1; NCU04997, gh10-3; NCU05924, gh10-1; NCU05955, gh74-1; NCU07225, gh11-2; NCU07326, gh43-6; NCU08189, gh10-2; NCU09775, gh54-1). Of the 182 proteins remaining in this cluster, 29 are predicted to be active on carbohydrates by CAZy (29) and 76 are predicted to be secreted by signalP, with 25 genes falling into both categories. The remaining 102 genes were grouped into their predicted functional category (31) resulting in 10 genes expected to be involved in C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism; 8 genes involved in protein folding, modification, or transport; and 62 genes encoding unclassified proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0227">A small cluster of 36 genes (cluster 1) showed high expression levels in either the WT or Î3Î²G deletion strain when exposed to AvicelÂ® (<figref>FIG. 20A</figref>), but had lower expression levels in the Î3Î²G deletion strain on cellobiose. This group contained a predicted Î²-xylosidase gene (NCU09652, gh43-5) and several other genes encoding proteins active on hemicellulose (NCU00710, acetyl xylan esterase; NCU01900, xylosidase/arabinosidase; NCU00891, xylitol dehydrogenase; and NCU08384, xylose reductase). These results suggest that these genes were induced by the 0.5-1.0% hemicellulose found in AvicelÂ® (20) and are not part of the regulon induced by cellobiose.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0228">When comparing the induction of the Î3Î²G strain on cellobiose versus WT on AvicelÂ®, a striking pattern appears (<figref>FIG. 20B</figref>). Genes induced in the WT by AvicelÂ® are very close to the value seen in the Î3Î²G mutant. For example, the FPKM for cbh-1 in the WT on AvicelÂ® is 126,816Â±53,016, while the FPKM in Î3Î²G on cellobiose is 130,865. This pattern extends even to the lesser-induced cellulases like NCU07760 (gh61-2), which has a FPKM of 239Â±62 for WT on AvicelÂ® and 538 for Î3Î²G mutant on cellobiose. In contrast, some hemicellulase genes in the Î3Î²G mutant were induced in response to cellobiose, but had lower expression levels than in AvicelÂ®-induced WT or Î3Î²G cultures. For example, while NCU05924 (endoxylanase, gh10-1) has 20,023Â±9,888 FPKMs in WT induced with AvicelÂ®, an expression level of 10,000 FPKMs was observed in the Î3Î²G mutant induced with cellobiose. These results indicate that while all of the cellulase genes are in the same regulon, the hemicellulase genes are divided into those that are coordinately regulated with cellulases and those that require additional signals for full induction.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0229">Transcription of Plant Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes in the Î3Î²G Mutant Correlates with Cellulase Secretion and Activity</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0230">To determine whether the transcriptional response of the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre strains in response to cellobiose corresponded to an increase in functional protein, we assessed secreted proteins and cellulase activity of the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre strains in response to induction with either cellobiose or AvicelÂ® (SI Materials and Methods), as compared to WT cultures. As expected, supernatants from all sucrose-grown cultures (Î3Î²G, Î3Î²GÎcre and WT) were unable to produce glucose or cellobiose from crystalline cellulose in an AvicelÂ® hydrolysis assay (Materials and Methods), while supernatants from all three AvicelÂ®-induced cultures (Î3Î²G, Î3Î²GÎcre and WT) were able to degrade crystalline cellulose to cellobiose and glucose (<figref>FIG. 18C</figref>). When grown on cellobiose, the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre strains displayed a secreted protein pattern similar to WT AvicelÂ®-grown cultures (<figref>FIG. 18B</figref>) (20). Importantly, supernatants from both the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre deletion strains induced by cellobiose hydrolyzed crystalline cellulose, while supernatants from WT cellobiose grown cultures did not. The Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre strains, which lack three Î²-glucosidases, produced mostly cellobiose. These data are consistent with the role of the three Î²-glucosidase enzymes in providing the bulk of the glucose-generating activity in WT cultures (37).</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0231">Industrial filamentous fungi are grown in submerged cultures for high-level production of a variety of products (38). We therefore examined the induction of cellulases in the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre deletion strains in a controlled bioreactor process (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7D</figref>). After 24 hours growth on sucrose, WT, Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre produce a similar amount of biomass (Ë3.5 g/L) (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>). After induction with 0.2% cellobiose, WT did not secrete a significant amount of protein (0.05 mg/mL; <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>). In contrast, the Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre cultures produced 0.12 mg/mL and 0.24 mg/mL protein, respectively, in the supernatant (<figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>). In addition, the cellobiose-induced Î3Î²G and Î3Î²GÎcre cultures showed a significant increase in endoglucanase activity over this same period of induction (<figref>FIG. 7F</figref>). Examining the aggregate Avicelase activity from the 24-hour time point indicated that the Î3Î²GÎcre strain produced 60% more glucose equivalents (0.424 mg/mL) as compared to the Î3Î²G strain (0.296 mg/mL) (<figref>FIG. 7E</figref>). However, when the total concentration of protein was normalized, the Î3Î²GÎcre strain had less specific activity than either the WT or Î3Î²G culture supernatants (<figref>FIGS. 21A-21B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0232">Proteomic Analysis of Secreted Proteins</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0233">In order to compare the identity of proteins secreted by WT <i>N. crassa </i>grown on AvicelÂ® versus the Î3Î²G strains when induced with cellobiose, we analyzed the secretome using a shotgun proteomics approach (Table 1). There were 39 proteins identified in the WT AvicelÂ®-grown culture supernatant. In cellobiose-grown cultures, 38 proteins were identified in the Î3Î²G broth and 24 were identified in the Î3Î²GÎcre broth (<figref>FIGS. 22A-22B</figref>). Using quantitative mass spectrometry it was concluded that 76% of the WT <i>N. crassa </i>secretome on AvicelÂ® is composed of 6 individual proteins (35). All of these proteins were identified in the WT, Î3Î²G, and Î3Î²GÎcre culture broths (except for the deleted Î²-glucosidase, gh3-4) (Table 1). In addition to the cellulases, we identified a number of lower abundance accessory proteins which make up a total of 6.5% of the secretome (35): a cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH-1), a type 2 lactonase (LAC-2), and two hypothetical proteins: NCU09764, a CBM1-containing protein of unknown function and NCU05137, a gene which when deleted leads to an increase in cellulase activity (20). These data indicate that, similar to the transcriptional response of the Î3Î²G mutant to cellobiose, the identity of proteins secreted and the amount of protein secreted in the Î3Î²G strain on cellobiose mimicked the WT <i>N. crassa </i>response to AvicelÂ®.</p>

      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0238">Exoglucanase (Cellobiohydrolase I) activity was measured using a 4-Methylumbelliferyl Î²-D-cellobioside (MuLac) assay. This assay mainly measures the activity of CBH-1 and activity is expressed as the change in fluorescence over time resulting in the slope of a best-fit line as an indication of enzyme activity. The assay was performed in a total volume of 100 Î¼l containing 20 Î¼l total culture supernatant and had a final concentration of 1.0 mM MuLac and 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5. The assay was performed in a Beckman Coulter Paradigm plate reader set at 40Â° C. with excitation/emission wavelengths of 360/465 nm with readings every 30 seconds for 10 minutes. The slope of the best-fit line represents the MuLac activity for an individual culture supernatant.</p>

      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0239">Given that both NCU00890 and NCU06650 deletions have both been characterized as hypersecretors, we wanted to examine if combining these deletions with the triple Î²-glucosidase and cre-1 deletion strain would increase cellulase secretion. The NCU00890 geneencodes a Î²-mannosidase. The NCU06650 gene encodes an characterized polypeptide having closest homology to a phospholipase.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0240">As shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, when either the NCU00890 or the NCU06650 deletion is combined with the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion strain, we see a modest increase in cellobiohydrolase I activity after 24 hours induction by cellobiose. Moreover, by also including the cre-1 deletion the sextuple mutant (containing the triple Î²-glucosidase deletion and both the NCU00890 and the NCU06650 deletion) had even higher cellobiohydrolase I activity after 24 hours induction by cellobiose.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0241">Homologues of the Î²-mannosidase gene NCU00890 were identified in <i>Trichoderma reesei</i>. The <i>T. reesei </i>homologues are found on Scaffold 10, 258215-260779, protein ID 62166; and on Scaffold 4, 877954-880802, protein ID 57857.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0242">Additionally, a homologue of the gene NCU06650 was identified in <i>T. reesei</i>. The homologue was found on Scaffold 22, 490155-490769, protein ID 67579.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0243">The <i>T. reesei </i>homologues were identified by performing a BLASTp search of either NCU00890 or NCU06650 using the DOE Joint Genome Institute <i>T. reesei </i>database.</p>
