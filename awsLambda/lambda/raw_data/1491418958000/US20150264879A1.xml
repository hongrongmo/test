      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Sesame, or <i>Sesamum indicum</i>, is a tropical annual cultivated worldwide for its oil and its nut flavored seeds. The sesame plant grows to a height of about 52-249 cm, and at its leaf axils are found capsules, which contain the sesame seed. Upon maturity in nature, the capsules holding the sesame seeds begin to dry down, the capsules normally split open, and the seeds fall out. Commercially, the harvester tries to recover as much seed as possible from mature capsules. From ancient times through the present, the opening of the capsule has been the major factor in attempting to successfully collect the seed. Harvesting methods, weather, and plant characteristics all contribute to the amount of seed recovered.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The majority of the world's sesame is harvested manually. With manual non-mechanized methods, it is desirable for the sesame seed to fall readily from the plant. Manual harvesting is labor intensive. Efforts to mechanize or partially mechanize harvesting met with limited success.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A breakthrough was accomplished when non-dehiscent (ND) sesame was developed and patented by Derald Ray Langham. ND sesame was found to possess the proper characteristics, which would enable mechanical harvesting without the seed loss disadvantages reported with prior varieties.</p>

By virtue of having IND, there is less seed loss when left in the field past prime harvest time in adverse weather conditions, for example, rain, fog, dew, and wind. S37 is suitable for mechanical harvesting.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The Improved Non-Dehiscent (IND) class of sesame, developed by Derald Ray Langham, is ND, but IND sesame also exhibits better adhesion between false membranes and improved placenta attachment. IND sesame holds more seed than prior sesame types, as measured four weeks after a crop is ready for harvest (could have been combined). IND characteristics offer advantages for certain growing applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Compared to ND sesame, IND sesame has more seed in the capsules when measured between 4 and 9 weeks after the ideal harvest time.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Without wishing to be bound by one particular theory, it is believed that this increased amount of seed in the capsules may be due to the S37 variety having the ability to better withstand adverse environmental conditions such as inclement or harsh weather. Examples of adverse weather conditions to which S37 has been subjected in this regard are rain, fog, dew, and wind. S37 variety has been tested and meets the criteria of IND.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">U.S. Pat. No. 8,080,707 is herein incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. This application discloses Improved Non-Dehiscent Sesame. S37 is an example of a variety which resulted from breeding methods described therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">S37 exhibits improved shatter resistance, acceptable tolerance to common fungal diseases, and a maturity that allows a wide geographical range. Further, S37 exhibits higher yield in geographical locations desirable for sesame planting, and exhibits desirable seed size and seed color. S37 is suitable for planting in areas that have approximately a 21Â° C. ground temperature when planted in the spring and night temperatures above 5Â° C. for normal termination. An exemplary desirable geographical area for S37 is from South Texas at the Rio Grande to Central Kansas and from elevations in Texas below 1000 meters eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Other exemplary areas are areas of the United States or of the world, which areas have similar climatic conditions, daylength patterns (similar latitudes) and elevations.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In describing the present invention, it is helpful to be aware of some terminology. Sesame plants have been studied for their response to seasonal and climatic changes and the environment in, which they live during the different phases and stages of growth and development. This type of study, called âphenologyâ has been documented by the inventor in Langham, D. R. 2007. âPhenology of sesame,â In: J. Janick and A. Whipkey (ed.), Issues in New Crops and New Uses, ASHS Press, Alexandria, Va.</p>

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">There are several concepts and terms that are used in this document that should be defined. The Environmental Protection Agency has allowed harvest aids to be used to desiccate sesame within 2 weeks of application after physiological maturity. If no harvest aids are used, in the initial drydown stage in Table the capsules begin to dry and open. This stage ends when 10% of the plants have one or more dry capsules. The late drydown stage ends when the plants are dry enough so that upon harvest, the seed has a moisture content of 6% or less. At this point some of the capsules have been dry for 5 weeks in the example used in Table I, but in other environments for other varieties, the drying can stretch to 7 weeks. The âideal harvest timeâ is at the end of the late drying stage. At this point, a combine (also sometimes referred to as a combine harvester, a machine that combines the tasks of harvesting, threshing, and cleaning grain crops) can be used to cut and thresh the plants and separate the seed from the undesired plant material. However, at times, weather may prevent harvest at the ideal time. The plants may have to remain in the field for as much as an additional four weeks, and in some cases even longer. Thus, time t<sub>0 </sub>corresponds to the ideal harvest time and time t<sub>1 </sub>which corresponds to the time the grower actually harvests the sesame, is a time later than time t<sub>0</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">The pedigree method of plant breeding was used to develop S37. Sesame is generally self-pollinated. Crossing is done using standard techniques as delineated in Yermanos, D. M. 1980. âSesame. Hybridization of crop plants,â <i>Am Soc. Agronomy</i>-<i>Crop Sci. of America</i>, pp. 549-563 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,452. Ashri provides an overview of sesame breeding in Ashri, A.

Further, unless otherwise stated, as used herein, the term progeny includes plants derived from plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which sesame plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, plant cells that are intact in plants, or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, flowers, capsules, stems, leaves, seeds, roots, root tips, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0113">Sesame cultivar S37 has been tested experimentally over several years under various growing conditions ranging from South Texas to Southern Oklahoma. Sesame cultivar S37 has shown uniformity and stability within the limits of environmental influence for the characters listed in Table II below, Table II provides the name, definition, and rating scale of each character as well as the method by which the character is measured. Under the rating section, the rating for S37 is presented in bold text. Additionally, the distribution of the character in Sesaco's sesame development program is indicated under the rating section. Sesaco uses slightly different character specifications from âDescriptors for sesameâ, AGP:IBPGR/80/71, IBPGR Secretariat, Rome, (1981) and from the form âSesame (<i>Sesamum indicum</i>)â, U.S. Department of Agriculture Plant Variety Protection Office, Beltsville, Md. The descriptors in those documents were developed in the early 1980s and have not been updated to incorporate new concepts in sesame data collection.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0114">Table II provides characteristics of S37 for forty-five (45) traits. Numerical ratings and values reported in this table were experimentally determined for S37 with prior sesame varieties in side by side replicated trials. Actual numerical values and ratings for a given variety will vary according to the environment, and the values and ratings provided in Table II were obtained in the environment specified in the parenthetical following the S37 rating. If âNTâ is indicated, it indicates that trait was not tested. Table V provides a direct comparison between the new S37 variety and the prior varieties thus demonstrating the relative differences between the varieties in the side by side trials.</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0115">In developing sesame varieties for the United States, there are eight characters that are desirable for successful crops: SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE (Character No. 22), IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING (Character No. 25), COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE (Character No. 34), DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY (Character No. 29), YIELD AT DRYDOWN (Character 10), SEED COLOR (Character No. 32), SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM THE ENTIRE PLANT (Character No. 33), and SEED OIL CONTENT (Character No. 45). The first four characters contribute to YIELD AT DRYDOWN, which is the most important economic factor normally considered by a farmer in the selection of a variety. The last three characters determine the market value of the seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE and IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING determine how well the plants will retain the seed while they are drying down in adverse weather.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE determines whether the plants can finish their cycle and have the optimum seed fill.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY determines how far north and to which elevation the varieties can be grown.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">In improving the characters, the YIELD AT DRYDOWN has to be comparable to or better than current varieties, or provide a beneficial improvement for a particular geographical or market niche.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">In the United States and Europe, the SEED COLOR is important since over 95% of the market requires white or buff seed. There are limited markets for gold and black seed in the Far East. All other colors can only be used in the oil market.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM THE ENTIRE PLANT determines the market for the seed. Lack of Composite kill Tolerance can reduce SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM THE ENTIRE PLANT. In parts of the United States where there is little rain in dry years, the lack of moisture can reduce the SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM THE ENTIRE PLANT.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">SEED OIL CONTENT determines the market for the seed. Lack of Composite kill Tolerance can reduce SEED OIL CONTENT. Low fertility in terms of nitrogen raises SEED OIL CONTENT and high fertility lowers SEED OIL CONTENT.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">There are other characters important in developing commercial sesame varieties explained in Langham, D. R. and T. Wiemers, 2002. âProgress in mechanizing sesame in the US through breedingâ, In: J. Janick and A. Whipkey (ed.), <i>Trends in new crops and new uses</i>, ASHS Press, Alexandria, Va. BRANCHING STYLE (Character No. 1), HEIGHT OF PLANT (Character No. 5) and HEIGHT OF FIRST CAPSULE (Character No. 6) are important in combining. CAPSULE ZONE LENGTH (Character No. 7), NUMBER OF CAPSULE NODES (Character No. 8), AVERAGE INTERNODE LENGTH WITHIN CAPSULE ZONE (Character No. 9), and SEED WEIGHT PER CAPSULE (Character No. 18) are important in creating potential YIELD AT DRYDOWN (Character No. 10). LEAF DIMENSIONS (Characters No. 12, 13, 14, and 15) are important in determining optimum populations.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">NUMBER OF CAPSULES PER LEAF AXIL (Character No. 2), NUMBER OF CARPELS PER CAPSULE (Character No. 16), CAPSULE LENGTH (Character No. 17), CAPSULE WEIGHT PER CAPSULE (Character No. 19), and CAPSULE WEIGHT PER CM OF CAPSULE (Character No. 20) are important in breeding for VISUAL SEED RETENTION (Character No. 21) and IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING (Character No. 25), which lead to testing for SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE (Character No. 22) and determining the CAPSULE SHATTERING TYPE (Character No, 23), NON-DEHISCENT TEST (Character 24) and IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT TEST (Character No. 26).</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">DAYS TO FLOWERING (Character No. 27), DAYS TO FLOWER TERMINATION (Character No. 28), DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY (Character No. 29) and MATURITY CLASS (Character No. 3) are highly correlated and important in determining the phenology and geographical range for the variety.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">DAYS TO DIRECT HARVEST (Character No. 30) is important in that once the plants reach physiological maturity there is no weather event that will increase yield and many weather events that may substantially lower the yield. A shorter drying phase increases yield. Presently, harvest aids have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use on sesame. The harvest aids are applied at physiological maturity leading to early drydown. The days to direct harvest is not as important as in the past. PLANT PHENOTYPE (Character No. 4) is a summary character of characters 1, 2, and 3 that allows an overall visualization of the line.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">TOLERANCE TO DROUGHT (Character No. 11) may reduce yield and seed weight. Even though there was a drought in the growing areas in 2006, there has not been a drought in nurseries planted since 2000 because of irrigation. LODGING TOLERANCE (Character No. 31) is important in years when there are high winds in the growing areas. The tolerance characters (Characters No. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43) are important in reducing the losses from diseases and pests.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">Over the past 37 years, Sesaco has tested 2,990 introductions from all over the world. Commercial samples have been obtained from China, India, Sudan, Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Mozambique, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Egypt, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Thailand, Turkey, Upper Volta, Uganda, Mali. Kenya, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Philippines, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Somalia, Eritrea, Paraguay, Bolivia, and El Salvador. Additional research seed has been received from the commercial countries and from many other countries such as Australia, Iraq, Iran, Japan, Russia, Jordan, Yemen, Syria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Gabon, Greece, Italy, South Korea, Libya, Nepal, Zaire, England and Tanzania. Research seed received from one country may have originated from another unspecified country. All of the commercial and research introductions have CAPSULE SHATTERING TYPE (Character No. 23) of shattering, âSHAâ.</p>

      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0133">As stated earlier, in developing sesame varieties for the United States, there are eight important characters: SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE (Character No. 22), IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING (Character No. 25), COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE (Character No. 34), DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY (Character No. 29), YIELD AT DRYDOWN (Character No. 10), SEED COLOR (Character No. 32), SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM ENTIRE PLANT (Character No. 33), and SEED OIL CONTENT (Character No. 45). These characters will be discussed first comparing S37 to Sesaco varieties (S28, S30, S32, S34, S35, S36, S38, and S39 which are the current varieties used in the United States), followed by other characters that differentiate S37. The data is based on planting the varieties side by side with five replications in Uvalde and two in Lorenzo.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0134">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> provides the SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE (Character No. 22) of various Sesaco sesame varieties using data from 1997 through 2011. SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE represents the amount of seed that is retained by the plant several months after being dry in the field. This standard was developed as a minimum standard in 1997-1998 and has proven to be a good predictor of shatter resistance. All varieties have SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE in the low-seventy to mid-eighty percent level.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0135">S37 has 71.1% SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE, which is above the 65% threshold established in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,452 to qualify S37 as a non-dehiscent variety.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0136">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> provides the IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING (Character No. 25) of the patented varieties (data from Uvalde and Lorenzo nurseries, 2011). When the plants have reached DAYS TO DIRECT HARVEST (Character No. 30), the plants are holding more than the seed represented by the SHAKER SHATTER RESISTANCE percentage. If there is no rain, fog, dew, or wind during the drying phase, the non-dehiscent plants will be retaining almost all of their seed for the combine. However, the predominant weather in the harvest season in the United States includes rain, fog, dew, and wind. The IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING sets a new benchmark for selecting varieties based on a rating done 4 weeks after DAYS TO DIRECT HARVEST (the ideal harvest time).</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0137">S37 exhibited an IMPROVED NON-DEHISCENT VISUAL RATING of 7.29 (data from Uvalde nursery, 2011) and 7.22 (Lorenzo nurseries, 2011) which are above the 7.0 threshold established in U.S. Pat. No. 8,080,707 to qualify S37 as an improved non-dehiscent variety.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0138">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> provides the COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE (Character No. 34) of the patented varieties (data from all nurseries, 2011-2013). COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE is a composite rating of tolerance to three root rots: <i>Fusarium, Phytophthora</i>, and <i>Macrophomina</i>. In most years, <i>Fusarium </i>is the major cause of kill. When sesame is first introduced into a growing area, there are few disease problems, but over time the spores of these fungi accumulate and disease tolerance becomes important. When sesame was first introduced in Uvalde in 1988, the yields were high. As farmers planted on the same fields in subsequent years, the yields decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0139">S37 has a rating of 6.3 for COMPOSITE KILL TOLERANCE (data from Uvalde nursery, 2011) and is comparable to most of the other patented commercial varieties. Any rating above 5.67 indicates that over 90% of the plants produced good seed to the top of the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0140">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> provides the mean DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY (Character No. 29) of the current Sesaco sesame varieties (data from Uvalde nursery, 2011). In the United States, sesame is currently grown from South Texas to Central Kansas. The growing window of a crop is determined by the earliest the crop can be planted in the spring as the ground warms up, and the onset of cold weather in the fall. Current sesame varieties require about 21Â° C. ground temperature to establish an adequate population and night temperatures above 5Â° C. for normal termination. Generally, the ground is warm enough in South Texas in middle March and in Central Kansas in late May, and the night temperatures are warm enough in South Texas until the middle of November and in southern Kansas unto the middle of October. The states to the east from Texa/Oklahoma/Kansas to the Atlantic Ocean are within the South Texas and Kansas extremes. Cold fronts may affect the growth of sesame, and these are more likely in northern growing areas from the middle of September on. Elevation may also affect the growing temperature. For example, moving from east of Lubbock, Tex., at the start of the Caprock toward the west, the elevations begin climbing approaching toward the Rocky Mountains. The higher the elevation, the earner the onset of fall cold temperatures and the later the onset of spring warm temperatures. In all years, if the sesame is planted as early as temperatures allow, lines with DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY of 105 days or less will not be adversely affected by the temperatures, even in years with an early frost. Data gathered over a twenty-three year period indicates that about 96% of the time, sesame with a value of 115 or less DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY will produce a crop. Since most growing areas depend upon having a planting rain before the sesame is planted, the earlier the DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY of the variety, the more flexibility the farmers have with the planting date. Different geographical areas may have different goals due to the normal weather patterns. In South Texas, varieties with DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY of less than 110 days are generally suitable, while planting after 30 June in southern Kansas it is preferred, but not always necessary, to utilize varieties with lower DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY such as 100 days or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0141">The mean DAYS TO PHYSIOLOGICAL MATURITY for S37 is 103, which allows it to be planted in all of the current sesame growing areas. Care should be taken in areas where early freezes may occur to plant S37 in at a time where it will physiologically mature prior to expected freezes.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0142">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> provides the mean YIELD AT DRYDOWN (Character 10) of the patented varieties (testing in the Uvalde and Rio Hondo nurseries in 2013). In releasing a new variety, another important consideration is whether the yields will be comparable or better than the existing varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0143">The yield of S37 is expected to be comparable to that of prior varieties under typical growing conditions and was found to be comparable under less than ideal conditions used for testing as reported in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. The yield data is taken close to DAYS TO DIRECT HARVEST (Character No. 30), which is the ideal time to harvest. However, weather in the fall in the sesame growing areas of the United States can prevent harvest for up to a month subjecting the crop to rain, fog, dew, and wind. Those four factors increase shattering, and wind may bring on lodging. Drought can affect yield. As reported in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the 2013 data from the Uvalde and Rio Hondo areas indicates That S37 with yields of 1,664 kg/ha (Uvalde nursery, 2013) and 1,490 kg/ha (Rio Hondo nursery, 2013) are comparable to current varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0144">The SEED COLOR (Character No. 32) of S37 is buff, hich is suitable for most of the U.S. and world markets.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0145">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> provides the mean SEED WEIGHTâ100 SEEDS FROM THE ENTIRE PLANT (Character No. 33) of the current varieties between 1997 and 2011. A particular seed weight may be a characteristic desired by certain seed processors and end-users and commercial specifications may require a threshold seed weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0146">S37 seed is lighter than the other patented varieties (0.284 grams per hundred seeds), and thus is a bit lower than most commercial specifications in the natural topping market for sesame seed, which (in the United States) often set a threshold value of 0.30 grams per hundred seed weight. However, S37 seed is suitable for the ingredient and foreign markets.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0147">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> provides the SEED OIL CONTENT (Character No. 45) of the current varieties. The commercial oil markets generally contractually require that sesame seed contain an oil content of at least 50-52%. If the oil content is lower than the specified requirement, the contract generally penalizes the seller. While current commercial practice does not include a monetary incentive to the seller if sesame seed has a higher oil content than the contractual requirement, increasing the oil content of sesame seed may provide de facto advantages to the purchaser or user.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0148">S37 exhibited oil contents of 53.2% and 51.9% (data from Uvalde 2010 and 2011) and thus is suitable for use as a source of sesame oil for the commercial oil market.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0149">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> provides the TOLERANCE TO SILVERLEAF VVHITEFLY (Character No. 39). This pest is a problem in areas having high temperatures and other crops that attract whiteflies, such as vegetable crops. Examples of sesame growing areas which may be subject to whitefly issues are the South Texas/Lower Rio Grande Valley region, which typically has many acres of vegetables planted, and Puerto Rico. Having tolerance to the whitefly provides a benefit to a sesame variety.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0150">S37 has demonstrated adequate tolerance to whiteflies. Variety S26 has been used as a comparative standard for whitefly tolerance; S37 (with a rating of 4.0) had lower tolerance than S26 in testing conducted in Puerto Rico. Thus, S37 is not recommended for areas with the Silverleaf whitefly.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0151">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> provides the TOLERANCE TO BACTERIAL BLACK ROT (Character No. 38). Bacterial black rot may occur, though rare, when there are cool, cloudy days, usually at higher elevations. While there may be little sesame acreage subject to these conditions, tolerance may still be important to some growers.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0152">S37, with a rating of 6.3, exhibits less tolerance when these conditions are present than some previously described varieties.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0153">S37 is taller (HEIGHT OF PLANT, character No. 5) and has a longer CAPSULE ZONE LENGTH (Character No. 7) than the current branched varieties. The Variety is not so tall that it interferes with the header reel of the combine. This extra height is correlated with a longer vegetative phase, which is an advantage in drought years.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0154">On Mar. 13, 2014, a deposit of at least 2500 seeds of sesame plant S37 was made by Sesaco Corporation under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, and the deposit was given ATCC Accession No. PTA-121089, This deposit will be maintained in the ATCC depository for a period of 30 years or 5 years after the last request or for the enforceable life of the patent, whichever is longer. Should the seeds from the sesame line S37 deposited with the American Type Culture Collection become non-viable, the deposit will be replaced by Sesaco Corporation upon request.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0155">The foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and characters for purposes of clarity and understanding. However, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the invention as limited only by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
