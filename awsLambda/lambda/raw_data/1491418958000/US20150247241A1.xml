      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a gas barrier film, a method for producing the gas barrier film, and an electronic device including the gas barrier film, and more specifically, to a gas barrier film usually included in an electronic device such as an organic electroluminescent (hereinafter abbreviated as âorganic ELâ) element, a method for producing the gas barrier film, and an electronic device including the gas barrier film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Gas barrier films composed of a laminate of a plurality of layers containing thin films of metal oxides such as aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, and silicon oxide on plastic substrates or films have been widely used in packaging applications for articles which require shielding of various gases such as water vapor and oxygen for preventing deterioration of, for example, foods, industrial products, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In addition to packaging applications, gas barrier films are desired to be further applied to flexible electronic devices such as solar cell elements, organic electroluminescent (EL) elements, and liquid crystal display elements having flexibility, and considerable efforts have been made to achieve them. Unfortunately, these flexible electronic devices require significantly high gas barrier properties similar to those of glass substrates, and a gas barrier film having sufficient barrier properties has not yet been currently achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Known examples of methods for forming such gas barrier films include vapor-phase epitaxial methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (plasma enhanced CVD methods), which oxidizes organosilicon compounds, such as tetraethoxysilane (hereinafter abbreviated as TEOS) in oxygen plasma under reduced pressure to form films on substrates, and physical vapor deposition (vacuum deposition or sputtering), which evaporates metallic silicon to deposit it on a substrate using a semiconductor laser in the presence of oxygen.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Patent literature 1 discloses a method for producing a gas barrier laminated film of 1Ã10<sup>â4 </sup>g/m<sup>2</sup>/day level in a roll-to-roll process using a plasma enhanced CVD apparatus as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> of the document. The gas barrier properties, adhesion, and flexibility of the gas barrier films produced by the method disclosed in Patent literature 1 are insufficient for use in electronic devices including organic EL devices in harsh environments of high temperature and high humidity, such as outdoor use, even though adhesion to substrates and flexibility are improved by the application of a plasma enhanced CVD method, which can increase the concentration carbon atom components near the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Patent literature 2 discloses a method for producing a gas barrier film having a gas barrier layer formed by a coating process, which exhibits superior performance in terms of productivity and cost. In the method disclosed in Patent literature 2, a film of polysilazane as an organic precursor compound produced on a side of the film by coating and drying is irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet light (also referred to as âVUV lightâ) to prepare a gas barrier layer. Patent literature 3 discloses a gas barrier film which has a gas barrier layer on one side and a conductive layer for imparting antistatic function on the opposite side of the film. However, Patent literature 2 and Patent literature 3 do not refer to any combination of the disclosed method thereof with the plasma enhanced CVD method and the effect obtained from the combination.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The aspects of the present invention provide a method of producing a gas barrier film, which has gas barrier properties, high flexibility, and sufficient adhesion required for use in electronic devices even in harsh environments of high temperature and high humidity such as outdoor use; and the gas barrier film.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The inventors, who have conducted intensive studies to solve the above problems, have found that the method for producing a gas barrier film having a gas barrier layer which is formed on a resin substrate with a specific surface resistivity, i.e., a resin substrate having a conductive layer with a specific surface resistivity in a range of 1Ã10<sup>3 </sup>to 1Ã10<sup>10 </sup>Î©/sq, by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition induced by discharge in an applied magnetic field between rollers can provide a gas barrier film which has excellent gas barrier properties, high flexibility, and sufficient adhesion required for use in electronic devices even in harsh environments of high temperature and high humidity such as outdoor use, and achieved the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The mechanism on the advantageous effects achieved by such a configuration of the present invention has not yet been completely elucidated, but is speculated to be as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As described above, a conductive layer, which is composed of metal oxide and resin and has a specific surface resistivity, is formed in advance on the second surface of the resin substrate, and then the gas barrier layer is formed on the first surface by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition induced by discharge in an applied magnetic field between rollers. It is presumed that this process can distribute more carbon atom components near the resin substrate, resulting in improved adhesion between the resin substrate and the gas barrier layer. Such tight adhesion enables the gas barrier film to have significantly high gas barrier properties and flexibility required for use in electronic devices even in harsh environments of high temperature and high humidity.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The mechanism of an improvement in adhesion, flexibility, and gas barrier properties by the configuration defined in the present invention is not clear yet. On adhesion, however, it is presumed that the specific range of conductivity of the resin substrate affects the magnetic field for plasma discharge generated between the rollers such that carbon atom components, which have a polarity relatively close to that of the resin substrate, are distributed predominantly in the resin substrate side of the gas barrier layer, resulting in the improved adhesion. On flexibility and gas barrier properties, it is presumed that the plasma discharge generated between rollers forms such a gas barrier layer that has a continuously changing concentration gradient of carbon atom components, resulting in the advantageous effects described above. Furthermore, presumably the combination effects of the distribution of carbon atom components near the resin substrate contributes to the effects exhibited even in harsh environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Incidentally, a plasma enhanced CVD using planar electrodes (horizontal transport) does not generate such a continuously changing concentration gradient of carbon atom components near the resin substrate. Accordingly, a tradeoff remains among adhesion, flexibility, and gas barrier properties; hence the CVD using planar electrodes described above can provide no solution. The advantageous effect of the invention is achieved if a continuously changing concentration gradient of carbon atom components is generated in a gas barrier layer formed by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition induced by discharge in an applied magnetic field between rollers and with this, the adhesion, flexibility, and gas barrier properties can be maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Furthermore, polysilazane solution can be applied on the gas barrier layer to forma coated film, which is then irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet light (VUV) having a wavelength of 200 nm or less for modification to form a second gas barrier layer. It is presumed that minute defects remaining in the gas barrier layer can be filled with polysilazane gas barrier components from the top such that the gas barrier film can fully exhibit significantly high gas barrier properties required for use in electronic devices even in harsh environments of high temperature and high humidity, and flexibility.</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A method for producing a gas barrier film including a gas barrier layer containing carbon atoms, silicon atoms, and oxygen atoms on a first surface of a resin substrate; and a conductive layer on a second surface of the resin substrate opposite of the surface on which the gas barrier layer is formed, wherein the gas barrier layer is formed on the first surface with an oxygen gas and a material gas containing an organosilicon by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition in a discharge space of an applied magnetic field between rollers, and the conductive layer is formed on the second surface, the conductive layer having a specific surface resistivity ranging from 1Ã10<sup>3 </sup>to 1Ã10<sup>10 </sup>Î©/sq in an environment of 23Â° C. and 50% RH. These characteristics are common to the invention according to Aspects 1 to 7.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a gas barrier film having further improved flexibility and adhesion is achieved by the following conditions: (1) The atomic percentage of carbon in the gas barrier layer continuously varies along a distance from a surface across a thickness within a region from the surface of the gas barrier layer to a distance of 89% of the thickness; (2) The maximum value of the atomic percentage of carbon in the gas barrier layer is less than 20 at % across the thickness within the region from the surface of the gas barrier layer to a distance of 89% of the thickness; (3) The atomic percentage of carbon in the gas barrier layer continuously increases across the thickness within a region from a distance of 90% to 95% of the thickness from the surface of the gas barrier layer (within a region of 5% to 10% of the thickness from the surface adjacent to the resin substrate); and (4) The maximum value of the atomic percentage of carbon in the gas barrier layer is at least 20 at % within the region from a distance of 90% to 95% of the thickness from the surface of the gas barrier layer (within the region from 5% to 10% of the thickness from the surface adjacent to the resin substrate). It is preferred that the conductive layer contains resin and metal oxide which can cause the carbon content to be highly controlled under predetermined conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Preferably, polysilazane solution should be applied on the gas barrier layer into a coated film, which is then dried and irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet light having a wavelength of 200 nm or less for modification into a second gas barrier layer. The microdefects formed on the gas barrier layer during the CVD can be filled with polysilazane gas barrier components from the top, and thus significantly high gas barrier is achieved. Thus, it is preferred to provide an electronic device with a gas barrier film of the present invention. Such an electronic device can have excellent gas barrier properties, high flexibility, and sufficient adhesion even in environments of high temperature and high humidity such as outdoor use.</p>

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">[1] Resin Substrate</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The gas barrier film according to the present invention may be provided with any resin substrate composed of organic material that can support the gas barrier layer with gas barrier properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Examples of the material for the resin substrate of the invention include films of resins, such as methacrylic esters, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN), polycarbonates (PC), polyarylates, polystyrene (PS), aromatic polyamides, polyether-ether-ketones, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polyimides, and polyetherimides; and films composed of two or more layers of the resins listed above. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN), and polycarbonates (PC) are preferred from the viewpoint of cost and availability.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The thickness of the resin substrate is preferably within the range of 5 to 500 Î¼m, or more preferably 25 to 250 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The resin substrate according to the present invention is preferably transparent. A transparent gas barrier film can be produced by disposing a transparent layer on a transparent resin substrate. This can be used as a transparent substrate for electronic devices (e.g., organic EL devices).</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The resin substrate composed of the resins listed above may be an unstretched or stretched film. A stretched film is preferred for high strength and low thermal expansion. Furthermore, phase differences can be adjusted through stretching.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The resin substrate according to the present invention can be produced through any known film production method. For example, an unstretched resin substrate that is substantially amorphous and non-oriented can be produced by melting a material resin in an extruder, extruding the melted resin through a circular or T die, and quenching the resin. Alternatively, an unstretched resin substrate that is substantially amorphous and non-oriented can be produced by melting the material resin in an organic solvent, casting and drying the molten resin on an endless metal or resin support, and separating the dried resin film from the support.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">A stretched substrate can be produced by stretching the unstretched resin substrate through a known process, such as uniaxial stretching, successive biaxial stretching with a tenter, simultaneous biaxial stretching with a tenter, or simultaneous biaxial stretching of tubular film, in the direction of the flow (longitudinal axis (MD)) of the resin substrate and/or a width direction orthogonal to the flow of the resin substrate (lateral axis (TD)). In such a case, an appropriate stretching ratio can be selected in accordance with the constituent resin of the resin substrate. The stretching ratio in the longitudinal and lateral directions (MD and TD) is preferably within the range of 2 to 10 times.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The resin substrate according to the present invention may be subjected to relaxation processing and offline thermal processing for dimensional stability. The relaxation processing is preferably conducted after thermosetting during a stretching step in the film production process and before reeling the polyester film in or downstream of a tenter for lateral stretching of the polyester film. The relaxation process is preferably carried out in a range of 80Â° C. to 200Â° C., more specifically, in the range of 100Â° C. to 180Â° C. Any scheme of offline thermal processing may be employed. Examples of conveying schemes of the film include conveying by a group of rollers, conveying by blowing air against the film and lifting the film (blowing heated air on to one or both sides of the film through multiple slits), conveying through the use of heat radiating from an infrared heater, conveying downward by the weight of the film, and reeling the film at a low position. Lowering the conveying tension applied during thermal processing as much as possible promotes thermal contraction, which provides a resin substrate having high dimensional stability. The processing temperature is preferably within the range of Tg+50Â° C. to Tg+150Â° C., where Tg is the glass-transition temperature of the resin substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">An undercoat layer can be produced by applying an undercoating solution to one or both sides of the resin substrate according to the present invention as an inline process during the film production. The undercoating provided during the film production according to the present invention is referred to as inline undercoating. Any of the following resins can be preferably used for the preparation of an undercoating solution suitable for the present invention: polyester resins, acrylic modified polyester resins, polyurethane resins, acrylic resins, vinyl resins, vinylidene chloride resins, polyethylenimine vinylidene resins, polyethylenimine resins, polyvinyl alcohol resins, modified polyvinyl alcohol resins, or gelatin. A known additive may be added to the undercoating solution. The undercoating solution can be applied through a known wet-coating scheme, such as roller coating, gravure coating, knife coating, dip coating, or spray coating. The preferred quantity of the undercoating solution is approximately 0.01 to 2 g/m<sup>2 </sup>(in a dry state).</p>

Dispersants and other additives that may be added during stirring can be added before, after or simultaneously with the addition of the fine metal oxide particles, according to the demand. Organic solvents can be appropriately added if the resin binder is highly viscous or solid.

During discharge in the magnetic field between a pair of deposition rollers, it is preferred that the poles of the deposition rollers be alternately inverted.

In the present invention, a resin substrate passes through a pair of deposition rollers providing a magnetic field for generating plasma. The generation of plasma through an electric discharge in the space between the deposition rollers through which a resin substrate passes varies the distance between the resin substrate and each deposition roller. This can form a gas barrier layer having an atomic percentage of carbon that has a concentration gradient and a composition which continuously varies in the layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0140">Simultaneous formation is achieved for a portion of the surface of the resin substrate on one of the deposition rollers during the formation of the gas barrier layer and another portion of the surface of the resin substrate on the other deposition roller. This achieves efficient formation of thin films, doubles the deposition rate, and provides films with an identical structure. Thus, the number of extreme values in the carbon distribution curves can at least be doubled, and gas barrier layers that satisfy all of the conditions (1) to (4) can be efficiently produced.</p>

      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0156">Such a deposition gas containing a material gas containing an organosilicon compound including silicon and gaseous oxygen preferably include gaseous oxygen at a percentage not too higher than the theoretical percentage of gaseous oxygen required for complete reaction of the material gas and gaseous oxygen. If the percentage of gaseous oxygen is too high, the gas barrier layer according to the present invention cannot be readily acquired. A barrier film having predetermined properties can be acquired through the use of a deposition gas preferably having not more than a theoretical percentage of oxygen required for complete oxidation of the organosilicon compound in the deposition gas.</p>

      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0159">In such a reaction, 12 moles of oxygen is required for complete oxidation of 1 mole of hexamethyldisiloxane. Thus, the complete oxidation of a deposition gas containing 12 mole or more oxygen for each mole of hexamethyldisiloxane generates a uniform silicon dioxide layer. Thus, the ratio of gas flow rate of the material is adjusted to a ratio below the theoretical ratio for complete reaction so as to maintain an incomplete reaction. That is, the amount of oxygen must be set to less than 12 moles for each mole of hexamethyldisiloxane, which is lower than the stoichiometric ratio of oxygen.</p>

Thus, even if the quantity of the reactive oxygen gas in moles (flow rate) is 12 times of that of hexamethyldisiloxane, which is the material gas, the reaction actually cannot be completed. A complete reaction is presumed to be accomplished only when oxygen is supplied in a quantity that significantly exceeds the stoichiometric ratio. For example, the mole quantity (flow rate) of oxygen may be set to at least approximately 20 times that of hexamethyldisiloxane so as to produce silicon oxide through a complete reaction in CVD. Thus, the mole quantity (flow rate) of oxygen is preferably not more than 12 times, which is the stoichiometric ratio (more preferably not more than 10 times) that of the hexamethyldisiloxane, which is the material gas. With such contents of hexamethyldisiloxane and oxygen, the carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms in the hexamethyldisiloxane that are not completely oxidized are absorbed by the gas barrier layer. Thus, the desired gas barrier layer can be formed, and the acquired gas barrier film has excellent barrier properties and flexibility. If the mole quantity (flow rate) of oxygen is too small relative to the mole quantity (flow rate) of hexamethyldisiloxane in the deposition gas, the unoxidized carbon and hydrogen atoms are excessively absorbed by the gas barrier layer. Thus, the barrier film will have low transparency and cannot be used as flexible substrates for electronic devices, such as organic EL devices and organic thin-film photovoltaic cells, which require transparency.</p>

Although the electrical power may vary, the preferred electrical power is in the range of 0.1 to 10 kW. Electrical power applied within such a range does not generate contaminative particles, and the heat generated during deposition is controllable. Thus, heat distortion, heat degradation, and wrinkles in the resin substrate due to the increase in temperature at the surface of the substrate during deposition do not occur. In addition, damage on deposition rollers can be prevented which is due to the melting of the resin substrate due to heat and the discharge of a large current between the bare deposition rollers.</p>

      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0175">The second gas barrier layer provided on the gas barrier layer deposited through plasma CVD in a magnetic field applied to the discharge space between rollers according to the invention is preferred because minute defects remaining in the gas barrier layer can be covered from above with polysilazane components in the second gas barrier layer to efficiently prevent gas purge and enhance the gas barrier properties and flexibility.</p>

The commercially available polysilazane can be directly used as a polysilazane solution. Examples of a commercially available polysilazane solution include NN120-20, NAX120-20, and NL120-20, which are available from AZ Electronic Materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0182">A second gas barrier layer can be produced by applying the polysilazane solution to form a coating layer onto the first gas barrier layer, which is formed through plasma-enhanced CVD in a magnetic field applied to the discharge space between the rollers, drying the coating layer, and irradiating the coating layer with vacuum ultraviolet beams.</p>

Appropriate organic solvent may be selected from these examples depending on purposes, such as the solubility of the polysilazane and the evaporation rate of the organic solvent.

The polysilazane solution containing the catalyst within the range can prevent an excessive formation of silanol compounds, decrease in film density, and increase in film defect that are caused by a rapid reaction.</p>

The perhydropolysilazane also can be represented by SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, wherein x=0 and y=1. To satisfy x&gt;0, some external oxygen source is required. Examples of the oxygen source are shown as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0193">(i) Oxygen and water contained in the polysilazane solution</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0194">(ii) Oxygen and water in an atmosphere to be incorporated into the coating layer during the drying process</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0195">(iii) Oxygen, water, ozone, and singlet oxygen in an atmosphere to be incorporated into the coating layer during the irradiation process with vacuum ultraviolet beams</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0196">(iv) Oxygen and water to be transferred in the form of an outgas from the substrate into the coating layer by heat generated in the irradiation process with vacuum ultraviolet beams</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0197">(v) Oxygen and water in an oxidizing atmosphere, which is shifted from an unoxidizing atmosphere, to be incorporated into the coating layer during the irradiation process with vacuum ultraviolet beams</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0198">The upper limit of y is 1 because it is presumed that nitridation of Si requires very particular conditions compared to oxidation of Si.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0199">The values of x and y basically lie in a range of 2x+3yâ¦4 in association with atomic bonding of Si, O, and N. After complete oxidation where y=0, the coating layer includes silanol groups, and the value of x may lie in a range of 2&lt;x&lt;2.5.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0200">A plausible reaction mechanism of the perhydropolysilazane which generates silicon oxynitride and silicon oxide during the irradiation process with vacuum ultraviolet beams will now be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0201">(1) Dehydrogenation, and Formation of SiâN Bond Caused Thereby</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0202">It is presumed that SiâH bonds and NâH bonds in the perhydropolysilazane are relatively readily broken by excitation of the vacuum ultraviolet beams, and recombine into SiâN bonds in an inert atmosphere (sometimes dangling bonds of Si are generated). In other words, these SiâH bonds and NâH bonds are linked into cured SiN<sub>y </sub>compositions without oxidation. Main chain links of the polymer are not broken. Breakage of SiâH bonds and NâH bonds are promoted by catalysts and heat. The hydrogen radicals H from these bonds are combined into a hydrogen molecule H<sub>2</sub>, which are released to the exterior of the film.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0203">(2) Formation of SiâOâSi Bond Caused by Hydrolysis and Dehydration Condensation</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0204">The SiâN bonds in the perhydropolysilazane are hydrolyzed by water, and the main chain links of polymers are then broken to form SiâOH bonds. Two SiâOH bonds are dehydrated and condensed to form SiâOâSi bonds, which are cured. Such reactions can also be caused in the air; however, during the irradiation with vacuum ultraviolet beams in an inert atmosphere, the moisture source that can cause these reactions is mainly vapor as outgas from the resin substrate generated by heat of the irradiation. Excess moisture leads to residual SiâOH bonds that are not dehydrated and condensed, and thus the resulting cured film, which has the composition represented by SiO<sub>2.1</sub>âSiO<sub>2.3</sub>, exhibits low gas barrier properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0205">(3) Direct Oxidation by Singlet Oxygen, and Formation of SiâOâSi Bonds</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0206">The irradiation with vacuum ultraviolet beams in an atmosphere containing a predetermined amount of oxygen forms singlet oxygen having significantly high oxidizability. The atoms of H or N in the perhydropolysilazane are replaced with O to form SiâOâSi bonds, which are then cured. It is presumed that breakage of main chain links of the polymers may cause recombination of chemical bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0207">(4) Oxidation Involving Breaking SiâN Bonds by Irradiation or Excitation with Vacuum Ultraviolet Beams</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0208">It is presumed that the SiâN bonds are broken by the energy of the vacuum ultraviolet beams, which is greater than the binding energy between Si and N in the perhydropolysilazane, and are oxidized into SiâOâSi and SiâOâN bonds in the presence of an oxygen source, for example, oxygen, ozone, or water in the environment. It is presumed that breakage of main chain links of the polymers may cause recombination of chemical bonds.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0209">The formation of the silicon oxynitride compositions in the polysilazane layer by the irradiation with the vacuum ultraviolet beams can be conducted under the control of oxidation environment which is an appropriate combination of the oxidation mechanisms (1) to (4) described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0210">In the irradiating process with the vacuum ultraviolet beams according to the present invention, the coating layer including polysilazane should preferably be irradiated with vacuum ultraviolet beams having an irradiance in a range of 30 to 200 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 50 to 160 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Irradiation with vacuum ultraviolet beams having an irradiance of 30 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or greater is preferred because it has no risk to reduce modification efficiency. Irradiation with vacuum ultraviolet beams having an irradiance of 200 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less is preferred because it does not cause ablation of the coating layer and damages on the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0211">The energy of the irradiation with the vacuum ultraviolet beams applied on the coating layer containing polysilazane should preferably be in a range of 200 to 10000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 500 to 5000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. A cumulative energy of 200 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or greater can efficiently conduct the modification. A cumulative energy of 10000 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less does not cause excess modification and can prevent cracking and thermal deformation of the resin substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0212">A source of the vacuum ultraviolet beams should preferably be a rare gas excimer lamp. A rare gas is also referred to as an inert gas because the atoms of Xe, Kr, AR, and Ne do not chemically bond into molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0213">However, excited atoms in the rare gas which are energized by, for example, electric discharge can bond with other atoms into molecules. If the rare gas is xenon, Xe<sub>2</sub>*, which is an excited excimer atom, radiates excimer light beams having a wavelength of 172 nm when transitioning to a ground state. This reaction is represented by the following formulae:</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]<i>e</i>+XeâXe*[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Xe*+2XeâXe<sub>2</sub>*+Xe[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Xe<sub>2</sub>*âXe+Xe+<i>h</i>Î½(172 nm)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0214">An advantage of the excimer lamp lies in its high efficiency: the excimer lamp can emit light beams having the same wavelength substantially without unwanted light beams. Since the excimer lamp does not emit unwanted light beams, the excimer lamp can keep the target article at a low temperature. In addition, the excimer lamp can quickly flash because it takes little time to start and restart.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0215">The excimer light beams are generated by a known method using dielectric barrier discharge. The dielectric barrier discharge is generated by applying a high frequency voltage of several ten kilohertz to a gas space between electrodes. A dielectric substance, such as transparent quartz, is disposed between the electrodes. The dielectric barrier discharge is microscopic discharge like lightning, and is called microdischarge. Streamers of the microdischarge reach the surface of a tubular wall (or dielectric substance) to accumulate electric charge, which distinguishes the microdischarge.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0216">The microdischarge propagates over the entire tubular wall and is repeatedly generated and extinguished. This causes flickering of light which can be visually observed. Furthermore, direct and regional irradiation of the tubular wall with the streamers at significantly high temperature may accelerate deterioration of the tubular wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0217">The excimer light beams can be effectively generated by electrodeless field discharge, as well as dielectric barrier discharge. The electrodeless field discharge, which is caused by capacitive coupling, is also known as RF discharge. Although the lamp, electrodes, and configuration thereof for the electrodeless field discharge are basically the same as those for the dielectric barrier discharge, a radio frequency to be applied to a space between the electrodes has a bandwidth of several megahertz. The electrodeless field discharge, which can provide discharge stable over space and time, can achieve a long-life lamp without flickering.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0218">In the dielectric barrier discharge, the microdischarge is generated only in the space between the electrodes. To cause the microdischarge in the entire discharge space, the outer electrode should cover the entire outer surface and should be composed of a light-transmissive material to transfer the light to the exterior.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0219">Accordingly, a net of fine metal wire is used as an electrode. Such an electrode, which is composed of ultra-thin metal wire to transmit the light beams, is susceptible to damage caused by ozone in the vacuum ultraviolet beams in an oxygen atmosphere. To avoid the damage, the space surrounding the lamp or the interior of the irradiator needs to be purged with an inert gas, for example, nitrogen, and the irradiator needs to be provided with a synthetic silica window through which the irradiation light beams are transmitted. The synthetic silica window is an expensive consumable article and causes optical loss.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0220">In a double-cylinder lamp having an outer diameter of approximately 25 mm, a noticeable difference is provided between the distance from the portion immediately below the lamp axis to an irradiated surface and the distance from the side of the lamp to an irradiated surface. This causes a considerable difference in illuminance between irradiated portions. Two lamps in close contact with each other thus cannot provide a uniform illuminance distribution. The irradiator having a synthetic silica window can provide a uniform distance to an irradiated surface in an oxygen atmosphere, and thus can provide a uniform illuminance distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0221">Electrodeless field discharge requires no net external electrode. Glow discharge can be spread over the entire discharge space only by placing the external electrode on part of the outer surface of the lamp. The external electrode is generally composed of an aluminum block, serves also as a light reflector, and is disposed on the back surface of the lamp. The lamp for the electrodeless field discharge has an outer diameter as large as that for the dielectric barrier discharge, and is thus required to be provided with synthetic silica in order to provide uniform illuminance distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0222">A maximum advantage of a tubular excimer lamp lies in its simple structure, which has a tubular body containing a gas for generating excimer light beams and the gas is sealed by sealing both edges of the silica tube.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0223">The tubular body of the tubular excimer lamp has an outer diameter of approximately 6 to 12 mm. A tubular body having a larger diameter needs higher voltage to start.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0224">Either the dielectric barrier discharge or the electrodeless field discharge can be applied to the tubular excimer lamp. The electrode may have a flat surface in contact with the lamp. The electrode may have any surface profile conforming to the curved surface of the lamp. The electrode having such a profile can tightly fix the lamp. Such close contact of the electrode with the lamp leads to stable discharge. The electrode may have a curved mirror surface composed of aluminum, the mirror surface also serving as a light reflector.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0225">An Xe excimer lamp, which emits ultraviolet beams having a single short wavelength of 172 nm, has high luminescent efficiency. The excimer light beams have a high oxygen absorption coefficient, and thus can generate high concentrations of radical oxygen atoms and ozone from a slight amount of oxygen.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0226">The light beam having a short wavelength of 172 nm has energy that can dissociate the bonds of organic compounds with high efficiency. These radical oxygen, ozone, and high energy of the ultraviolet radiation can modify the polysilazane layer in a short time.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0227">Compared to a low pressure mercury lamp having a wavelength of 185 nm or 254 nm and plasma cleaning, the Xe excimer lamp exhibits high throughput, which can achieve a short processing time, a decrease in an area for installation of facilities, and irradiation to organic materials and plastic substrates that are susceptible to thermal damage.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0228">Excimer lamps exhibit high luminescent efficiency, and thus can emit light beams with low electric power. The excimer lamps do not emit light having a long wavelength, which lead to an increase in temperature, but radiate energy within an ultraviolet-light range, i.e., a short-wavelength range. This prevents an increase in temperature of the surface of the target article. The excimer lamps are suitable for materials for flexible films, such as PET, that are susceptible to thermal effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0229">Ultraviolet irradiation needs to be conducted in the presence of oxygen to cause chemical reactions. In contrast, vacuum ultraviolet irradiation is preferably conducted under a condition of extremely low oxygen concentration, because the efficiency of the ultraviolet irradiation process readily decreases due to absorption by oxygen. Specifically, the oxygen concentration during the vacuum ultraviolet irradiation should preferably be in a range of 10 to 10000 ppm, more preferably 50 to 5000 ppm, and still more preferably 1000 to 4500 ppm.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0230">A dried inert gas is preferably used as a gas for the irradiation atmosphere of the vacuum ultraviolet irradiation. A dried nitrogen gas is particularly preferred in view of costs. The oxygen concentration can be controlled by measuring the flow rates of an oxygen gas and an inert gas that are introduced in the irradiation chamber and altering the flow ratio between them.</p>

Preferred examples of the organic material for the overcoat layer include organic resins, such as organic monomers, organic oligomers, and organic polymers, and organic-inorganic composite resins, such as siloxane having organic groups and monomer, oligomer, and monomer, oligomer, and polymer of silsesquioxane. These organic resins or organic-inorganic composite resins preferably have polymerizable groups or crosslinkable groups. The overcoat layer is preferably formed through a process which involves applying a solution including these organic resins or organic-inorganic composite resins and optional polymerization initiator or crosslinking agent to form a coating layer, and curing the coating layer through a light irradiation treatment or a thermal treatment.</p>

      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0237">The anchor layer can also reduce contamination of the contacting surface due to migration (so-called bleeding out) of unreacted materials, such as oligomers from inside the resin substrate to the surface when the resin substrate is heated. The anchor layer, on which the gas barrier layer is to be provided, should preferably be smooth and have a surface roughness (Ra) in a range of 0.3 to 3 nm, more preferably in a range of 0.5 to 1.5 nm. A surface roughness Ra of not less than 0.3 nm provides an appropriate smooth surface which facilitates appropriate roller transportation and maintains a proper smoothness during formation of the gas barrier layer by plasma enhanced CVD. A surface roughness Ra of not more than 3 nm can prevent formation of minute defects in the gas barrier layer during formation of a gas barrier layer to achieve high-quality gas barrier properties and adhesion.</p>

      <p id="p-00457-en" num="0463">The resulting samples were stored at a high temperature of 60Â° C. and a high humidity of 90% RH, and then the development of corrosion of the metal calcium over time was observed. The observation was performed every hour up to six hours from the start of the storage, every three hours up to 24 hours, every six hours up to 48 hours, and every twelve hours thereafter. The ratio (%) of the corroded metal calcium area to the metal calcium deposition area of 12 mmÃ12 mm was calculated. The observed results were linearly interpolated to determine the time at which the ratio was 1%. The water vapor transmission rate of each gas barrier film was calculated from the relationship among the metal calcium deposition area, the amount of water vapor that corrodes 1% of the metal calcium area, and the time required for the corrosion.</p>

      <p id="p-00459-en" num="0465">The adhesion of each gas barrier layer was evaluated by a cross-cut adhesion test in accordance with JIS K 5600-5.6 (2004 edition).</p>
      <p id="p-00460-en" num="0466">The surface of the gas barrier layer formed on each gas barrier film was incised into 100 squares of 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>with a cutter knife and a 1 mm-calibrated cutter guide in a depth to reach the resin substrate. A cellophane adhesive tape (âCT405AP-18â manufactured by Nichiban Co. Ltd.; 18 mm in width) was applied over the incisions and rubbed with a pencil eraser to be tightly bonded. The tape was then vertically peeled off. The number of squares remaining on the resin substrate among 100 squares was counted. Adhesion was evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
      <p id="p-00461-en" num="0000">GOOD: 4 or less square flakes peeled off in the test. <br /> GOOD-FAIR: 5 to 10 square flakes peeled off in the test. <br /> FAIR: 11 to 15 square flakes peeled off in the test. <br /> FAIR-POOR: 16 to 20 square flakes peeled off in the test. <br /> POOR: 21 to 30 square flakes peeled off in the test. <br /> VERY POOR: 31 or more square flakes peeled off in the test. </p>
      <p id="p-00462-en" num="0467">[Evaluation of Durability]</p>
      <p id="p-00463-en" num="0468">In the first step, each gas barrier film was subjected to accelerated deteriorating test in an environment at a high temperature of 85Â° C. and a high humidity of 85% RH for 3,000 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00464-en" num="0469">In the second step, each gas barrier film was wound around a metal cylinder in such a manner that the surface provided of the gas barrier layer faced outside and then left for one minute to test the flexibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00465-en" num="0470">The gas barrier films, which were subjected to the above process, were measured for water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and evaluated for adhesion in the same manner as above.</p>
      <p id="p-00466-en" num="0471">Although the curvature radius R in a flexibility test corresponds to half the diameter of the rod, the curvature radius R was defined as half the diameter of the wound film when a gas barrier film was wound around several laps. The R was 8 mm in the flexibility test.</p>

      <p id="p-00469-en" num="0473">The results in Table 2 indicate that a gas barrier film having a configuration according to the present invention has superior gas barrier properties (water vapor barrier characteristics) and adhesion compared to Comparative Examples. Such a gas barrier film still had superior gas barrier properties and adhesion after being stored in an environment at a high temperature and a high humidity and then being bended. Furthermore, a gas barrier layer formed on the gas barrier film had no crack and was not peeled off. These facts indicate that the gas barrier film has high durability.</p>
