      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Pursuant to 35 USC Â§119, this application claims the benefit of and priority to German patent application no. 102014205233.5, filed on Mar. 20, 2014, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for the speed control of a harvester.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">With agricultural harvesters, the throughput depends, proportionally, on the individual driving speed of the harvester. In order to use the harvester to capacity in the best way possible and to effectively utilize it, systems are known that automatically set the driving speed in the sense of maintenance of a desired crop throughput and to relieve the operator of the task of speed specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The density of the crops can vary with greater or lesser intensity on a field, which results in corresponding changes of the driving speed. The recording of the density, in particular, if it takes place on board the harvester by means of a throughput sensor (see, for example, DE 1 199 039 B), and the speed adaptation subsequent to a density change, require, however, a certain reaction time, which leads to a situation where the speed can be adapted to a change of the density of the crops on the field with only a temporary deceleration. This is particularly critical if the density suddenly undergoes a great increase, since then an overloading or clogging of the harvester may even result.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the state of the art, solutions have been proposed in which the density of the crops on the field or a value dependent thereon is predictively determined and the driving speed specification is derived therefrom in such a manner that the harvester travels already at a suitable speed upon reaching a certain point of the field, whether by means of a card produced with a prior harvesting operation (DE 44 31 824 C1) or by means of a predictively operating sensor for the recording of the planting density (DE 101 30 665 A1). These solutions, however, have the disadvantage that more or less intense accelerations of the harvester continuously occur which, in any case, make themselves noticeable to the driver as strenuous and uncomfortable after long workdays.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A limitation of the available acceleration of a harvester for the purpose of improving the control of the operator is in fact known, in that the adjustment speed of an actuator defining the driving speed is hydraulically limited (DE 10 2006 037 631 A1), but a use of such a limitation with a predictively speed-controlled harvester would again lead to the problem that the crop throughput does not always agree with the theoretical value. In particular, the case can occur that with a sudden greatly increasing crop density, a sufficiently strong deceleration does not occur, so that the harvester is clogged or overloaded.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The goal that is the basis of the invention is to be found in making available a harvester with a predictively operating speed specification, in which, on the one hand, the accelerations occurring in operation are limited to a comfortable degree, but, on the other hand, are guaranteed so that a desired throughput value is maintained as well as possible without exceeding it.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The invention under consideration is defined by the patent claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A method for the speed control of a harvester that can move forward over a field in a forward direction at a driving speed, and thereby picks up crops, comprises the following steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">predictive determination of the density of a crop planting on the field or a value dependent on the density of the crop planting on the field;</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">advance planning of a speed specification signal for the harvester, in the sense of a continuous maintenance of a desired throughput of the harvester;</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">wherein with the advance planning of the speed specification signal, the accelerations of the harvester resulting from the speed specification signal are limited to a degree that is comfortable for an operator of the harvester;</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">and control of the speed of the harvester, based on the speed specification signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In other words, a planning of the speed takes place, which takes into consideration two boundary conditions: the desired throughput should be maintained at least to the extent that, in particular, an exceeding of a planned quantity of the throughput is avoided, but the amount of the acceleration of the harvester should not rise beyond a stipulated level of comfort. In this way, a gain of comfort for the operator of the harvester is attained, without the other boundary condition of the maintenance of the desired throughput being violated at least to an approximate, specifiable extent. The desired crop throughput can be firmly specified or be selected by an operator, for example, in that he inputs a target value for the throughput, or in the case of a combine harvester, a loss value, which in turn determines the throughput.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Preferably, the advance planning of the speed specification signal comprises a first step, in which the speed signal is planned only on the basis of the density of the crops or a value dependent thereon, and a second step, in which a new planning is carried out, if the amount of the acceleration of the harvester planned in the first step exceeds a stipulated threshold value. In this way, a greater calculation effort is not necessary if the planting density is relatively homogeneous. On the other hand, the original planning is modified in the sense of maintaining the limiting value of the acceleration.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In the advance planning of the speed specification signal, a maximum speed of the harvester can also be taken into consideration. The advance planning of the speed specification signal can comprise a step for the purpose, in which a new planning takes place if the speed of the harvester planned in the first step exceeds a stipulated maximum speed of the harvester.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The advance planning of the speed specification signal can comprise a movement in time of a speed change forward or backward, so as to prevent an exceeding of a threshold value of the acceleration and/or speed. Accordingly, the speed change, if required, takes place earlier than originally planned, so as to reduce an acceleration or deceleration that is to be carried out otherwise. On the basis of the limited speed or deceleration, the end of the speed change maneuver can analogously be pushed back in time. Since this operation lasts longer than was originally planned, speed specification signals following the new planning in time are appropriately moved back in time, so that the aforementioned speed specification signals following the new planning are also used at the spatial points for which they were originally planned.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In the new planning of a speed signal that originally exceeded a maximum acceleration or speed, a maximum acceleration or speed can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">An apparatus for the speed control of a harvester that can move over a field at a driving speed in a forward direction and thereby picks up crops comprises the following:</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">a device for the predictive determination of the density of the crop planting on the field or a value dependent on the density of the crop planting on the field;</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">a planning device for the predictive planning of a speed specification signal for the harvester, in the sense of a continuous maintenance of a desired throughput of the harvester;</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">wherein the planning device can be operated, with a predictive planning of the speed specification signal, so as to limit the accelerations of the harvester resulting from the speed specification signal to an extent that is comfortable for an operator of the harvester;</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">and means for the control of the speed of the harvester, based on the speed specification signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The apparatus in accordance with the invention can be used on self-propelled harvesters pulled by a vehicle or attached thereon, for example, combine harvesters, pulled or self-propelled balers or field choppers.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the case of a harvester pulled by a towing vehicle or attached thereon, such as a baler or a field chopper, the speed of the harvester is controlled in that the travelling speed of the towing vehicle is controlled. To this end, a control of the harvester can communicate, via a bus, with a control of the towing vehicleâsee EP 1 153 538 A2. The predictive determination of the density of the crop planting on the field can take place by means of elements connected with the control of the harvester and/or the control of the towing vehicle. Analogously, the specification of the travelling speed of the towing vehicle can be undertaken by the control of the harvester and/or the control of the towing vehicle. Accordingly, the entire combination can be considered the harvester, in the sense of the patent rights under consideration, with a combination of a towing vehicle and a pulled or an attached harvester.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an agricultural combine harvester <b>10</b>, serving as an example for a harvester, with a carrying structure <b>12</b>, which is provided with wheels <b>14</b> that are engaged with the ground. Although the combine thresher <b>10</b> with wheels is shown, it could also be provided with two or four track rollers. A cutting device <b>16</b> is used for the harvesting of crops and it supplies an inclined conveyor <b>18</b>. The inclined conveyor <b>18</b> contains a conveying device, so as to supply the harvested crops to a guiding drum <b>20</b>. The guiding drum <b>20</b> conducts the crops upward through an inlet transition section <b>22</b> and a rotatable crop processing device <b>24</b>, set up for the threshing and separating. The depicted crop processing device <b>24</b> is located axially in the combine thresher; however, it could also be located in other orientations relative to the longitudinal axis of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. Although the invention under consideration is described with the aid of a crop processing device <b>24</b> with a rotor, it could also be used in a combine thresher <b>10</b> with a conventional threshing drum, arranged transversely, which works together with a threshing concave.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The crop processing device <b>24</b> threshes and separates the harvested crops. The grain and chaff fall through grates to the bottom of the crop processing device <b>24</b> into a cleaning system <b>26</b>. The cleaning system <b>26</b> removes the chaff and conducts the clean grain to an elevator (not shown) for clean grain. The elevator for clean grain deposits the grain in a grain tank <b>28</b>. The clean grain in the grain tank <b>28</b> can be supplied, through an unloading worm conveyor <b>30</b>, to a truck or trailer.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Threshed-out straw, freed from the grain, is supplied by the crop processing device <b>24</b>, through an outlet <b>32</b>, to an ejection drum <b>34</b>. The ejection drum <b>34</b> expels the straw, in turn, at the back of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. It should be noted that the ejection drum <b>34</b> could also supply the crops freed from the grain directly to a field chopper. The operation of the combine thresher <b>10</b> is controlled from an operator's cabin <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The crop processing device <b>24</b> comprises a cylindrical rotor housing <b>36</b> and a rotatable rotor <b>37</b>, which is situated in the rotor housing <b>36</b>. The front part of the rotor <b>37</b> and the rotor housing <b>36</b> define a charging section <b>38</b>. A threshing section <b>39</b>, a separating section <b>40</b>, and an outlet section <b>41</b> are situated downstream from the charging section <b>38</b>. The rotor <b>37</b> is provided in the charging section <b>38</b> with a conical rotor drum, which has the spiral-shaped charging element for engagement in the crops which it obtains from the guiding drum <b>20</b> and from the inlet transition area <b>22</b>. Directly downstream from the charging section <b>38</b>, there is the threshing section <b>39</b>. The rotor <b>37</b> has a cylindrical rotor drum in the threshing section <b>39</b>; it is provided with a number of threshing elements, so as to thresh crops obtained from the charging section <b>38</b>. Downstream from the threshing section <b>39</b>, there is the separating section <b>40</b>, in which the grain still contained in the threshed crops is liberated and falls into the cleaning system <b>26</b> through a bottom grate in the rotor housing <b>36</b>. The separating section <b>40</b> passes over into the outlet section <b>41</b>, in which the crop (straw) liberated from the grain is expelled from the crop processing device <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The front wheels <b>14</b> of the combine thresher <b>10</b> are driven by a hydrostatic gear <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The hydrostatic gear <b>50</b> is driven in a conventional manner by a combustion engine, not shown. The hydrostatic gear <b>50</b>, in turn, drives a switching gear <b>52</b>. Two driving shafts <b>54</b> extend from the switching gear <b>52</b> outward and drive end drives <b>56</b> of the front wheels <b>14</b>. The hydrostatic gear <b>50</b> includes a pump unit and an engine unit. The pump unit and/or the engine unit are equipped with adjustable wobble plates. The adjustable wobble plates control the initial speed of the gear <b>50</b> and its rotating direction. Electromagnetically operated control valves <b>58</b> operate the positions of the wobble plates. The guidable back wheels <b>14</b> can also be driven by wheel motors that are fastened directly on the wheels <b>14</b>. The speed of the wheel motors can be controlled by the throughput control system described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">An electronic control <b>42</b> operates the driving speed v of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. That means that the electronic control <b>42</b> adjusts the forward speed (harvesting speed) of the combine thresher <b>10</b> by adjusting the position of the wobble plates of the hydrostatic gear <b>50</b>, in that the operation of the electromagnetically actuated control valves <b>58</b> is controlled via a conduit <b>62</b>. A manual specification of the driving speed, for example, for the headland or travelling on the road is possible by means of a joystick <b>44</b>, on whose upper end operating elements <b>46</b> are located, which, for example, are used for the specification of the level of the harvest attachment <b>16</b>, which is adjusted by means of an actuator <b>48</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The control <b>42</b> is connected to a contactless operating range finder <b>70</b> via another conduit; the range finder in this embodiment example is used as the apparatus for the predictive, contactless recording of a crop planting <b>96</b> that is ahead of the harvester <b>10</b>, and for the preparation of the data regarding an expected mass throughput in the harvester <b>10</b>, and comprises a sender <b>92</b> and a recipient <b>94</b>, and is affixed on the upper side of the cabin <b>35</b>. During operation, the sender <b>92</b> irradiates electromagnetic waves in the radar frequency range, at an incline and forward onto the crop planting <b>96</b> on the field in front of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. The recipient <b>94</b> receives waves reflected from the crop planting <b>96</b> and perhaps from the ground. An evaluating unit <b>98</b>, which could also be integrated into the control <b>42</b>, evaluates the running times and amplitudes of the waves received from the recipient <b>94</b>. Preferably, the polarization of the waves irradiated by the sender <b>92</b> is vertical and the receiver <b>94</b> receives, separately from one another, horizontally and vertically polarized waves. A suitable frequency is 77 GHz. The range finder <b>90</b> can oscillate back and forth around an axis <b>78</b>, which is approximately vertical or slopes upward and is inclined forward, so as to scan the crop planting <b>96</b> via the section width of the crop attachment <b>16</b>, in a lateral direction, or it can comprise a suitable number of senders <b>92</b> and receivers <b>94</b>, which are situated laterally, next to one another, so as to simultaneously obtain a number of running times and amplitudes via the section width of the crop attachment <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The control <b>42</b> is also connected to a position determining system <b>80</b>, receives the signals from satellites (for example, GPS, Galileo, and/or Glonass), and determines the actual position of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. This position can be used to evaluate, from a card, data regarding an expected mass throughput in the harvester <b>10</b>, whether from a prior harvesting operation and/or from prior travel over an adjacent field strip.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">A speed sensor <b>60</b> supplies the control <b>42</b> with a speed signal regarding the actual driving speed v of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. The speed sensor <b>60</b> can record the rpm of one of the shafts <b>54</b> or be designed as a radar sensor and record the speed of the combine thresher <b>10</b> over the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows the structure of the control <b>42</b> in detail. In addition to the range finder <b>70</b> and the evaluating unit <b>98</b>, it comprises a planning unit <b>64</b>, which predictively plans the speed of the combine thresher <b>10</b>. The planning unit <b>64</b> sets up reference values for the speed (v(t) ref) of the combine thresher <b>10</b>, which are dependent on the time t, via the signals of the evaluating unit <b>98</b>, using a procedure explained below; the values can change over time as a function of the density of the crop planting <b>96</b> on the field. In addition to the individual reference value for the speed (v(t) ref), its first and second time derivations at the outlet of the planning unit <b>64</b> are also available as output signals of the planning unit. It can also make available higher derivations that depend on the transfer function used in a theoretical value calculation unit <b>66</b> and represent the travelling dynamics of the combine thresher <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">These three reference values are supplied to the theoretical value calculation unit <b>66</b>, which, at its outlet <b>68</b>, gives a theoretical value (V(t) theoretical) for the speed. The theoretical calculation unit <b>66</b> is used to convert the reference value into the theoretical value for the speed in such a way that the travelling dynamics (transfer function) of the combine thresher <b>10</b> are taken into consideration, that is, its acceleration and deceleration behavior. To this end, the reference value for the speed (v(t) ref) and its first and second time derivations can be multiplied with different constants and the products can be added. These constants can be firmly specified or are automatically adapted, in whole or in part, to the individual loading state of the combine thresher <b>10</b>, in particular, to the filling level (detected by sensors) in the grain tank <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The reference value for the speed (v(t) ref) is also added to a subtractor <b>72</b>, which deducts from this reference value the actual speed that is recorded with the speed sensor <b>60</b>. This difference is a regulation input value for a regulation switch <b>74</b>, to whose initial value an adder <b>76</b> adds the theoretical value at the outlet <b>68</b> of the theoretical calculation unit <b>66</b>. The result of the adder <b>76</b> is then added, as an adjustment value S, to the control valves <b>58</b> of the travel drive. Accordingly, one obtains a so-called pilot control, in which the adjustment variable v(t) ref will be acted on with a value v(t) theoretical, independent of the conditions of the regulation path; this makes possible a consideration of the required adjustment variable to be expected as a result of the course of the theoretical value.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The mode of action of the planning unit <b>64</b> is explained below, with the aid of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. After the start in step <b>100</b>, reference values for the speed v(t) ref for a certain time period or path before the combine thresher <b>10</b> are initially calculated in a first step <b>102</b>; they are based on the signals of the evaluation unit <b>98</b>. With regard to this, reference is made to the state of the art according to DE 101 30 665 A1, whose disclosure is included by reference in the documents under consideration. Alternatively, or additionally, the reference values for the speed v(t) ref can be determined with the aid of a deposited card, in which expected throughputs are stored in a georeferenced manner, which is read off with the aid of the signals of a position determining system <b>80</b>. In this respect, reference is made to the state of the art according to DE 44 31 824, whose disclosure is included by reference in the documents under consideration. As a result of step <b>102</b>, therefore, one obtains a speed course v(t) ref, in whose maintenance the combine thresher <b>10</b> is acted on with a constant throughput (within the scope of the measurement and regulation accuracy). With small planting densities, the combine thresher <b>10</b> would come at very high speeds, and with sudden changes of the planting density, would greatly accelerate or decelerate, which is not comfortable for the operator.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the following step <b>104</b>, it is inquired whether each of the speeds determined in step <b>102</b> is greater than a limiting speed, which can be firmly specified and, for example, be on the order of magnitude of 10 km/h, or can be specified by the joystick <b>44</b>. If that is the case, step <b>106</b> follows, in which a new planning of the time course of the speeds takes place. With the recalling of step <b>106</b>, accordingly, a situation exists as represented schematically in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The planned speed v ref (t) exceeds, at time A, a prespecified upper limiting value v limit and exceeds it again at a later time B. With the new planning in step <b>106</b>, therefore, the speed v ref is limited to the value v limit after time A (step <b>106</b><i>a </i>in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>), and the maintenance of this speed is prolonged beyond the time B, by the time Ît, to a time Bâ², since the combine thresher <b>10</b> must, in fact, travel more slowly than was originally planned. Accordingly, in a first step <b>106</b><i>b, </i>the time At is calculated and the time Bâ² is determined in a step <b>106</b><i>c. </i>Beyond the time Bâ², then, the curve from step <b>102</b> is again used, but pushed back by the time Ît. Step <b>108</b> follows step <b>106</b> or <b>106</b> [sic; probably <b>106</b><i>c</i>]; this is also the case if the result of step <b>104</b> was negative.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In step <b>108</b>, the speed course, which is the result of step <b>102</b> or <b>106</b>, is used for the calculation of the acceleration a ref, in that the speed is differentiated over time. Step <b>110</b> follows, where the inquiry is made whether the absolute amount of the acceleration a ref is greater than a predetermined maximum value a limit. This maximum value is selected in such a way that the operator of the combine thresher <b>10</b> in his cabin <b>35</b> is not exposed to excessive, uncomfortable accelerations. Such a maximum value can be, for example, 0.315 m/s<sup>2 </sup>or correspond to another, in particular, standardized maximum value. If step <b>110</b> shows that the maximum value a limit is not exceeded, then step <b>112</b> follows, in which the values for v ref and a ref, determined in the preceding steps, are taken over as the initial value and are transferred to the theoretical value calculation unit <b>66</b> and to the subtractor <b>72</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). Step <b>112</b> is again followed by step <b>102</b>, but for speed values that are to be controlled later.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">On the other hand, if the result in step <b>110</b> is that the amount of the acceleration a ref is greater than the maximum value, then step <b>114</b> follows. With the recalling of step <b>114</b>, then, there is an acceleration course as is shown, for example, in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The acceleration a ref can become greater than the maximum value a limit with a suddenly thinning crop planting <b>96</b> at time A and, again, can go below this maximum value at time B (if the combine thresher <b>10</b> has reached its theoretical speed or the planting again thickens). Analogously, the combine thresher <b>10</b> can slow down after a time E, if the planting density increases and, at a time C, the (negative) deceleration falls below the negative maximum value a limit, whereas the deceleration at time D again exceeds the negative maximum a limit. One obtains thereby the speed course shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, in which the speed v ref begins to rise at time F (corresponds to the point before A, at which a ref in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> begins to differ from zero); at time E, it is greatest and attains the value v<b>1</b> and then again declines, so as to once more reach the original value at time G (corresponds to the point after D, at which a ref in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is again zero).</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The procedure in step <b>114</b> is, accordingly, such that the acceleration is set at the sign of the planned acceleration (+<b>1</b> with acceleration; -<b>1</b> with deceleration), multiplied by the maximum acceleration a limit (step <b>114</b><i>a </i>in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>), and the times A and B are placed, forward or backward, at times Aâ² and Bâ², so that the acceleration a ref does not exceed the maximum value, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> and <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. This is analogously valid also for the times C and D, which are placed, forward and backward, on times Câ² and Dâ², see <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. The acceleration is set on the maximum value a limit between the times Aâ² and Bâ² at the minimum value âa limit between Câ² and Dâ². In this regard, reference is made in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> to step <b>114</b><i>b, </i>in which, on the one hand, times t a are determined for the acceleration and deceleration phases in accordance with the maximum values, and, on the other hand, a time t v is determined for the time where there is no acceleration. These times are used in steps <b>114</b><i>c </i>and <b>114</b><i>d </i>to move the times F and G forward or backward to Fâ² and Gâ², as shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Since the accelerations were modified in step <b>114</b> in comparison to the original planning, a new planning of the speed takes place in step <b>116</b>. In this regard, reference is made to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. The beginning of the acceleration process was moved up from F to Fâ² and its end was moved back from G to Gâ². The originally planned curve according to <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is drawn in as a broken line. The time Gâ² is selected in such a way that after the new planning at time Gâ², it was precisely the same path as that covered at time G of the original planning</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The time Gâ² can be calculated by a double time integration of the calculated speed over time. In the case under consideration, the maximum attained speed v<b>2</b> is smaller than the maximum speed v<b>1</b>, originally attained according to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. This means that the speed specification signals that were planned for after time G come to use later in time, since the newly planned process has a longer duration between the times Fâ² and Gâ² (because of the smaller, newly planned accelerations and speeds) than the originally planned process between times F and G. Step <b>112</b> follows step <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">After the new planning, another examination could take place between steps <b>112</b> and <b>102</b> as to whether with the newly planned speed course, an exceeding of the maximum crop throughput is to be expected at all or by a specifiable extent (by the operator or because of the manufacturer). Should that be the case, the new planning would be repeated, wherein the speeds are to be correspondingly reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">It should also be noted that various changes of the procedure in accordance with the invention are conceivable. Thus, the acceleration courses resulting after the new planning are rectangular in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. Instead of this, acceleration courses of <figref>FIG. 9</figref> could also be trapezoidal, that is, the absolute value of the acceleration could rise linearly with time until point Aâ² or Câ² is attained, and could again decline in the same manner at point Bâ² or Dâ². Instead of the linear rise, any other courses would also be conceivable, such as square, logarithmic, or exponential rises.</p>
