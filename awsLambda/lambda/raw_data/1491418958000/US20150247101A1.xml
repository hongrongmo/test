    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a solid fuel manufacturing apparatus configured to remove water or moisture contained in wet combustible waste, e.g., organic wastes such as sewage sludge, food waste, and crop waste, and then break up the combustible waste to produce pellet-shaped solid fuel.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">For instance, organic sludge generated in a sewage treating process for public sewage, industrial sewage, etc. contain combustible or flammable components and are effectively utilizable as fuel by removal of the contained moisture content. Therefore, there has recently been proposed recycling of such organic sludge into solid fuel. Examples of such techniques for producing solid fuels are disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As the technique of making solid fuels from sludge by carbonization, Patent Document 1 discloses a method including obtaining sludge carbide by carbonization of sludge in a carbonizing furnace, cooling the sludge carbide through a water cooling conveyer, pneumatically delivering the cooled sludge by inert gas through a gas-flow conveying pipe, separating and collecting the sludge carbide contained in the conveying gas-flow by a bag filter, and then humidifying the sludge carbide by a humidifier to produce sludge carbide fuel. A technique of producing solid fuel from sewage sludge by the carbonization method as in Patent Document 1 is generally widely used and has been developed day by day for further technological advance. On the other hand, other techniques of producing solid fuel from organic sludge as in Patent Documents 2 and 3, different from the carbonization treatment method, have also been developed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Patent Document 2 discloses a technique of producing odorless solid fuel, in factories or plants in which active sewage sludge are generated on site, in such a manner that active sludge is mixed with coffee waste having a deodorizing function and coagulated organic sludge by stirring to produce an active sludge mixture, and drying the mixture naturally at room temperature. In Patent Document 2, it takes two or three days in summer and about one week in winter to dry the active sludge mixture until a moisture content becomes about 20 to 25%. Even after stirring, drying for 5 minutes at a temperature of 80Â° C. in a high-temperature drying device, and then leaving at room temperature, the drying time needs one day.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In Patent Document 3, moreover, in a pre-treatment process, organic waste such as sewage sludge and food waste is pulverized and kneaded under pressure so that it is heated to 20 to 40Â° C. by frictional heat generated during kneading, thereby making the organic waste easy to ferment aerobic microbe existing in the organic waste. Thereafter, in a fermentation step, in a heat-insulated fermenting vessel, the fermented material is stirred to be broken up or subdivided, while the fermentation is prompted by air supply, thereby decreasing the moisture content of the fermented material. In a next breakup process, in a fermenter, the fermented material is scooped up by blades driven by a belt and dropped down to prompt further breakup and fermentation to ripen, thereby producing solid fuel. In Patent Document 3, a treatment time needed from the start of the pre-treatment process to the completion of producing the solid fuel takes at least 10 days.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">However, the conventional techniques in Patent Documents 1 to 3 would cause the following problems. A sludge carbonizing plant used in Patent Document 1 is generally configured to include a heating source and further various devices for heat resistance of a treatment furnace, heat protection and deodorization for workers, and others, which are required to produce solid fuel from organic waste. Therefore, the plant is likely to be complicated and large in configuration, resulting in high facility costs. This carbonizing plant needs a large amount of energy (fuel) to be supplied to the heating source in order to heat and carbonize the organic waste. This also causes high running costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">On the other hand, in Patent Document 2, the solid fuel is produced by naturally drying the active sludge mixture. It therefore takes long to dehydrate the active sludge mixture. Thus, the productivity of solid fuel is very low. In Patent Document 3, while fermentation of the organic waste utilizes the frictional heat of the organic waste itself occurring during kneading and the supplied air, the fermented material is dropped down to be broken into small pieces, thereby increasing the contact surface area with the air to decrease the moisture content of the fermented material. This provides energy saving and low running cost, but has very low productivity of solid fuel as with Patent Document 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The techniques in Patent Documents 2 and 3 can be effective in converting the active sludge generated in own plants or factories into solid fuel on site. However, besides public sewage sludge systems, facilities such as food manufacturers and supermarkets daily generate a lot of organic waste such as food waste. In the case of treating such organic waste to produce solid fuel, therefore, the techniques in Patent Documents 2 and 3 are insufficient in treatment capacity and thus not practical.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention has been made to solve the above problems and has a purpose to provide a solid fuel manufacturing apparatus capable of producing solid fuel at low cost by removing water or moisture from combustible waste in short time, and a method for manufacturing the solid fuel.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Means of Solving the Problems</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">To achieve the above purpose, one aspect of the invention provides a solid fuel manufacturing apparatus including: mixture producing means configured to produce a mixture by kneading combustible waste containing moisture and a dehydrating agent acting to accelerate removal of the moisture from the combustible waste; mixture containing means configured to be cylindrical and rotatable and contain the mixture in an internal space; intake means configured to introduce outside air into the mixture containing means; exhaust means configured to discharge exhaust air out of the mixture containing means; drive means configured to rotate the mixture containing means; control means configured to control operations of the drive means; and breaking means configured to break up the mixture contained in the mixture containing means, wherein the dehydrating agent is a treatment agent made of an emulsion containing synthetic resin; and the breaking means is placed along an inner peripheral wall of the mixture containing means and configured to scoop the mixture upward in the internal space and allow the mixture to freely fall from above in the internal space by rotation of the mixture containing means.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to this configuration, the moisture contained in the combustible waste is made easy to evaporate by the dehydrating agent. Thus, by only stirring of the mixture and introducing of outside air of a temperature close to an almost room temperature, e.g., 20Â° C., without heating the outside air to a high temperature, the solid fuel can be manufactured as the dried mixture broken up into small pieces by the breaking means. The aforementioned solid fuel manufacturing apparatus of the invention can have simple configuration and simple structure and further manufacture the solid fuel from the mixture after drying (the dried mixture) without needing a heating source to heat the combustible waste. Thus, energy (fuel) to be supplied to the heating source is also unnecessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The aforementioned solid fuel manufacturing apparatus of the invention can provide advantages that both initial cost and running cost are not high as compared with the conventional solid fuel manufacturing apparatus. The present apparatus can also produce the dried mixture from the combustible waste efficiently and in short treatment time. In addition, no foul odors occur during production of the dried mixture and hence no deodorization means is needed. Workability is also good.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">As well as in the public sewage sludge treatment system, particularly, in facilities such as food manufacturers and supermarkets, a lot of combustible waste which is organic waste such as sewage sludge generated during sewage treatment and food waste, is daily generated. The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus of the above configuration of the invention has a high treatment capacity to dry the combustible waste <b>1</b> of several tens to hundreds kg in a treatment time, e.g., a few hours, to produce the dried mixture from the combustible waste and thus can be an apparatus suitable for making the combustible waste into solid fuel in such facilities.</p>

This apparatus <b>10</b> mainly includes a mixture producing device <b>10</b>A (a mixture producing means) and a mixture drying device <b>10</b>B as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In the first embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is designed to have a size allowing installation in an interior space (a compartment) of a cargo container <b>20</b> for transporting the apparatus <b>10</b> to a destination. To be concrete, the apparatus <b>10</b> is configured on the assumption that it will be installed in for example the interior space of a so-called 20 ft sea-cargo container (Inner dimension; Length: 5.900 m, Width: 2.350 m, Height: 2.390 m) according to the ISO standards.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> may be installed not only in the interior space of the cargo container <b>20</b> but also on a floor of a building or plant without using the cargo container <b>20</b>. In this case, the apparatus <b>10</b> does not need to be configured with the dimension suitable for the cargo container <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The mixture producing device <b>10</b>A is a device for producing a mixture <b>3</b> by kneading combustible waste <b>1</b> containing water or moisture (see <figref>FIG. 13</figref>) and a dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> (a dehydrating agent) for accelerating removal or dehydration of moisture from the combustible waste <b>1</b>. The mixture producing device <b>10</b>A includes, on a first frame <b>11</b>, a raw-material charge port <b>12</b> through which the combustible waste <b>1</b> which is a raw material of solid fuel will be charged into the device <b>10</b>A, a liquid inlet <b>13</b> through which the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> mentioned later will be poured, a kneading section <b>14</b> for kneading the combustible waste <b>1</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> by a well known technique, and an extrusion section <b>15</b> for ejecting the mixture <b>3</b> kneaded in the kneading section <b>14</b> to the outside.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> will be explained below referring to <figref>FIGS. 13 to 15</figref>. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is an explanatory view of particles lA constituting the sewage sludge to be treated. <figref>FIG. 14</figref> shows a state where the surface of each particle shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is contacted or exposed to the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b>. <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is an explanatory view of coated particles <b>4</b>A. The dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is made of an emulsion containing synthetic resin. Specifically, the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is an emulsion containing synthetic resin, for example, acrylic resin, urethane resin, and or polyvinyl acetate resin, that is, an emulsion containing various synthetic resins as listed in Table 1 and being appropriately diluted with water.</p>

      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">This dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> has the following properties. When the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is mixed with the mixture <b>3</b> foamed of the particles <b>1</b> A constituting the combustible waste <b>1</b> by the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A so that the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> contacts the surface of each particle <b>1</b>A as shown in <figref>FIGS. 13 to 15</figref>, the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> enters a void <b>1</b>B formed between the particles <b>1</b>A in the combustible waste <b>1</b>, thus uniformly coating the surface of each particle <b>1</b>A. The dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> containing the aforementioned synthetic resins also has a property of relatively increasing the action of accelerating drying of the particles <b>1</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">As shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, furtheimore, a synthetic resin coating <b>2</b>A made of the aforementioned synthetic resins has volatility. Thus, even during storage of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> produced as solid fuel from the dried mixture <b>3</b>, moisture absorption to dried combustible material <b>4</b> can be reduced. This coating <b>2</b>A functions to prevent an increase in moisture content of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> and suppress the dried combustible material <b>4</b> from becoming sticky. In the present embodiment, a moisture content percentage w (weight %) is a ratio of the moisture content (water weight) h (kg) to a total weight W (kg) of a target object for measurement such as the combustible waste <b>1</b>, the mixture <b>3</b>, and the dried combustible material <b>4</b>. This moisture content percentage w is calculated by the following formula (1):</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0068">In a drying step of the mixture <b>3</b> using the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> having the above properties, outside air AR at about 20Â° C. is blown onto the mixture <b>3</b> to dry it in the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B mentioned later, thereby drying the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> stuck to the surface of each particle <b>1</b>A to form the synthetic resin coating <b>2</b>A and also evaporating the moisture contained in the particles <b>1</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0069">Accordingly, the coated particles <b>4</b>A are produced, each consisting of the particle <b>1</b>A with reduced moisture content percentage and the synthetic resin coating <b>2</b>A covering the surface of the particle <b>1</b>A. The mixture <b>3</b> contracts or shrinks during drying and thus it can be divided into small pieces. Thus, dried material <b>4</b> made of the coated particles <b>4</b>A closely adhering to each other through the coatings <b>2</b>A is produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0070">Next, the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B will be explained. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a plan view of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a left side view of the apparatus <b>10</b> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a right side view of the same. The mixture drying device <b>10</b>B includes a rotary drum <b>30</b> (mixture containing means), an intake opening <b>33</b> (air intake means), an exhaust fan <b>41</b> (exhaust means), a heat pump <b>46</b> (heating means), a motor <b>51</b> (drive means), a control board <b>60</b> (control means), blades <b>72</b> (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) (breaking means), and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0071">In the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B, height adjustment bolts <b>22</b> for adjusting the height of the device <b>10</b>B from an installation surface, and carrier hooks <b>23</b> used for lifting up the device <b>10</b>B during transport are provided of a second frame <b>21</b> having a rectangular frame-like outer shape. On this second frame <b>21</b>, there are mounted the motor <b>51</b>, drum lower side supporting parts <b>56</b>, drum upper side supporting parts <b>57</b>, the control board <b>60</b>, and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0072">The rotary drum <b>30</b> is a drum configured to be cylindrical and rotatable and to contain the mixture <b>3</b> in an internal space (a chamber) <b>30</b>S (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>). In the first embodiment, it is a batch rotary drum configured to treat the mixture <b>3</b> just charged into the internal space <b>30</b>S. This rotary drum <b>30</b> is supported by two drive rollers <b>54</b> and four driven rollers <b>55</b>. The drive rollers <b>54</b> are rotatably axis-supported one each by two of the drum lower side supporting parts <b>56</b> arranged in four places.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0073">On an outer periphery of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, roller track parts <b>58</b> are provided in two places. Each roller track part <b>58</b> is a surface with which the corresponding drive roller <b>54</b> is in pressure contact while rotating. This rotational force of the drive rollers <b>54</b> is transmitted to the rotary drum <b>30</b>. The driven rollers <b>55</b> contacting with the roller track parts <b>58</b> are driven to rotate, thereby holding and supporting the rotary drum <b>30</b> during rotation thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0074">To be concrete, two of the four driven rollers <b>55</b> are rotatably axis-supported one each by the remaining two drum lower side supporting parts <b>56</b>. The remaining two driven rollers <b>55</b> are rotatably axis-supported by the two drum upper side supporting parts <b>57</b> provided in a standing form on the second frame <b>21</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. Each supporting part <b>57</b> is configured to adjust the axial height of the corresponding driven roller <b>55</b> in an up-down direction. By positional adjustment of the height of the driven roller <b>55</b> axis-supported by the supporting part <b>57</b>, the pressure applied to the rotary drum <b>30</b> by the drive roller <b>54</b> is adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0075">The motor <b>51</b> is a drive source to rotate the rotary drum <b>30</b> and is configured to rotate a power transmission shaft <b>53</b> coupled to a motor output shaft <b>52</b> to transmit the rotational force to the driven rollers <b>54</b>. The control board <b>60</b> has a function to operate the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b>, for example, actuation ON/OFF of the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A, rotation ON/OFF of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, actuation ON/OFF of the exhaust fan <b>41</b>, and actuation ON/OFF of the heat pump <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0076">This control board <b>60</b> further includes electrical control devices such as a timer function, an inverter for controlling the number of rotations of the motor <b>51</b>, an inverter for controlling the quantity of air to be ventilated by the exhaust fan <b>41</b>, devices for operation controls in each operation of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> such as setting or changing of the number of rotations and the rotational direction of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, and a sequencer for programming</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0077">The drum lower side supporting parts <b>56</b> in four places are each provided with a load sensor <b>59</b>. Each of the four load sensors <b>59</b> detects a load that acts on a predetermined portion of each drum lower side supporting part <b>56</b> (e.g., a rotary shaft of the drive roller <b>54</b> or a bearing thereof, a rotary shaft of the driven roller <b>55</b> or a bearing thereof, etc.), among the loads acting on the entire rotary drum <b>30</b> including the mixture <b>3</b> stored in the internal space <b>30</b>S. The load sensors <b>59</b> are electrically connected to the control board <b>60</b> to output detection signals to the control board <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0078">Accordingly, based on a signal detected by each load sensor <b>59</b>, the control board <b>60</b> allows a worker to recognize where the mixture <b>3</b> exists in the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b>. Specifically, upon receipt of the detection signals from the load sensors <b>59</b> representing that the mixture <b>3</b> is unevenly distributed to one side in the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, causing the gravity center of the entire rotary drum <b>30</b> to shift toward the intake opening <b>33</b> or an exhaust opening <b>45</b>, the control board <b>60</b> reverses the rotation direction of the rotary drum <b>30</b> to return the gravity center of the entire drum <b>30</b> to an original position and controls the rotation of the drum <b>30</b> to prevent the mixture <b>3</b> from staying in the one-sided position.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0079">In the first embodiment, based on the detection signals transmitted from the load sensors <b>59</b> to the control board <b>60</b>, the electrical control devices in the control board <b>60</b> automatically perform operation controls for changing the number of rotations of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, changing the rotational direction of the drum <b>30</b>, and a combined operation of rotation and stop of the drum <b>30</b>, and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0080">The blades <b>72</b> serving as the breaking means of the invention will be explained below. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a view showing an inner state of the rotary drum <b>30</b> of a batch treatment type taken along an arrow B-B in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> to explain attachment positions of the blades <b>72</b>. The blades <b>72</b> function as a member for breaking up the mixture <b>3</b> contained in the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b> and are arranged along an inner peripheral wall <b>31</b> of the rotary drum <b>30</b>. The blades <b>72</b> are configured to scoop or lift the mixture <b>30</b> (or the dried combustible material <b>4</b>) upward in the internal space <b>30</b>S and allow the same to freely fall from above in the internal space <b>30</b>S by automatic movement of the rotary drum <b>30</b>.</p>

Each blade <b>72</b> is attached, at the other plane corresponding to the other side, by screw fastening to the plate-shaped bracket <b>71</b> fixed to the inner peripheral wall <b>31</b> of the rotary drum <b>30</b>.</p>

In the exhaust opening <b>45</b>, the scraper <b>74</b> is placed as shown in <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. The scraper <b>74</b> is a brush-shaped member to sweep the mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b> to remove the mixture <b>3</b> (or the dried combustible material <b>4</b>) stuck thereto.

The bristle tips of the scraper <b>74</b> are in contact with constant points of the mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b>. Accordingly, when the mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b> rotates as the rotary drum <b>30</b> rotates, the scraper <b>74</b> can remove the mixture <b>3</b> (or the dried combustible material <b>4</b>) sticking to over the entire mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b>, from the mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0095">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the heat pump <b>46</b> is placed under the first frame <b>11</b> of the mixture producing device <b>1</b> OA. An air discharge part <b>48</b> of the heat pump <b>46</b> is connected to the door <b>32</b> of the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. If the temperature of the outside air AR is less than 20Â° C., the heat pump <b>46</b> heats or warms the outside air AR introduced from the air intake part <b>47</b> to a temperature in a range of 20Â° C. or more but 30Â° C. or less. The warmed outside air AR is supplied to the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b> through the air discharge part <b>48</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0096">A method for manufacturing solid fuel by use of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> will be explained below. Firstly, in the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A, a predetermined amount (e.g., several tens to a few hundreds kg per batch) of the combustible waste <b>1</b> is charged through the raw-material charge port <b>12</b>, the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is also poured through the liquid inlet <b>13</b>, and the combustible waste <b>1</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> are kneaded in the kneading section <b>14</b> to produce the mixture <b>3</b>. This mixture <b>3</b> is then ejected from the extrusion part <b>15</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0097">In the first embodiment, the combustible waste <b>1</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> are mixed at a weight ratio of 97%:3%. The percentage of moisture content of the mixed combustible waste <b>1</b> and dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is approximately 70 to 80%. The total volume of the mixture <b>3</b> to be charged into the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b> is within a range equal to or less than half of the volume ratio of the entire internal space <b>30</b>S and more preferably the amount of the mixture <b>3</b> to be charged into the internal space <b>30</b>S is within a range equal to or less than one-third of the height corresponding to the inner diameter of the internal space <b>30</b>S.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0098">This is because the rotation of the rotary drum <b>30</b> causes the plurality of blades <b>72</b> to scoop up the mixture <b>3</b> charged in the internal space <b>30</b>S and allow the mixture <b>3</b> to freely fall from above in the internal space <b>30</b>S. Thus, while the mixture <b>3</b> repeats such complicated motions, the mixture <b>3</b> is dried by exposure to the outside AR sucked by the exhaust fan <b>41</b> and thus is further broken up or subdivided. At that time, since the charge amount of the mixture <b>3</b> is within the aforementioned range, the mixture <b>3</b> is actively stirred, enabling increasing the surface area of the mixture <b>3</b> exposed to the outside air AR. This accelerates drying of the mixture <b>3</b>, prompting evaporation of the moisture and contraction of the mixture <b>3</b>, thereby making the mixture <b>3</b> easy to break into small pieces.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0099">A worker charges the mixture <b>3</b> ejected from the extrusion section <b>15</b> into the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b> and then closes the internal space <b>30</b>S with the drum openable door <b>32</b>. Prior to the drying treatment of the mixture <b>3</b>, the worker detects the total weight of the rotary drum <b>30</b> right after charging therein the mixture <b>3</b> by use of the load sensors <b>59</b> to measure in advance the weight of the mixture <b>3</b> before drying (pre-drying weight). Subsequently, the worker operates the control board <b>60</b> to for example rotate the rotary drum <b>30</b> in one way at a circumferential velocity of 140 mm/sec. and activate the exhaust fan <b>41</b> to introduce outside air AR in the internal space <b>30</b>S under conditions such as an air velocity of 3 to 6 m/sec. If the temperature of the outside air AR is less than 20Â° C., the heat pump <b>46</b> is activated to heat the outside air AR to be supplied into the internal space <b>30</b>S up to a temperature in a range of 20Â° C. or higher but 30Â° C. or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0100">The mixture drying device <b>10</b>B in this state is continuously operated for about 5 hours. Meanwhile, while the mixture <b>3</b> charged in the internal space <b>30</b>S is repeatedly scooped up and then dropped down by free fall in the internal space <b>30</b>S by each blade <b>72</b>, the mixture <b>3</b> repeats movement back and forth in the axial direction AX by operation control of the rotary drum <b>30</b> based on the detection signals from the load sensors <b>59</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0101">In the drum openable door <b>32</b> of the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B, the intake opening <b>33</b> is provided in an opposite position to the exhaust opening <b>45</b>. Thus, even when the outside air AR flows in the internal space <b>30</b>S through the intake opening <b>33</b> by the exhaust fan <b>41</b>, exhaust air EG is easily discharged from the internal space <b>30</b>S through the exhaust opening <b>45</b>. This configuration provides high intake and exhaust efficiency. Accordingly, the atmosphere of the internal space <b>30</b>S does not come to a saturated state even when the moisture or water is evaporated from the mixture <b>3</b> during drying. Thus, the evaporation of the moisture/water in the atmosphere of the internal space <b>30</b>S is not interfered in the course of stirring the mixture <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0102">After time-up, the worker measures the percentage of moisture content of the mixture <b>3</b> based on the detection signals of the load sensors <b>59</b>. To be concrete, after time-up of the drying step of the mixture <b>3</b>, the worker detects the total weight of the rotary drum <b>30</b> with the mixture <b>3</b> remaining contained in the internal space <b>30</b>S by use of the load sensors <b>59</b> to measure the weight of the mixture <b>3</b> after drying (post-drying weight). Then, the worker finds a ratio of the post-drying weight (i.e., a percentage of moisture content of the moisture contained in the mixture <b>3</b>) to the pre-drying weight of the mixture <b>3</b> and determines whether or not this moisture content percentage is equal to or less than 20%. If the moisture content percentage exceeds 20%, the worker operates the control board <b>60</b> again to extend the drying time of the mixture <b>3</b> until the moisture content percentage decreases to 20% or less. If the moisture content percentage is 20% or less, the worker stops the drying treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0103">The mixture <b>3</b> charged in the internal space <b>30</b>S is dried to the moisture content percentage of 20% or less by the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B, forming the dried combustible material <b>4</b> having an energy of about 4000 to 5000 kcal/kg. In this way, the moisture contained in the combustible waste <b>1</b> is dried and this waste <b>1</b> is broken up to produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> as pellet-shaped solid fuel smaller than 1 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0104">Herein, the solid fuel manufacturing method using the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment was investigated to check its significance. This check was conducted by a test <b>1</b> using wasted cabbages as a sample of the combustible waste <b>1</b> and a test <b>2</b> using decayed oranges as a sample of the combustible waste <b>1</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0112">In the test <b>1</b>, the moisture content percentage of the cabbage before mixing was 92%. The moisture content percentage of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> produced from the cabbage was 13.5% in 6 hours after the start of drying. The surface temperature of this dried combustible material <b>4</b> was 30.1Â° C. It was further determined that the dried combustible material <b>4</b> was obtained as solid fuel broken down into pellets each having a size nearly corresponding to one rice grain. As a result of analyzing the dried combustible material <b>4</b> in the test <b>1</b>, an amount of heat generation of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> produced from the cabbage was 18800 J/g.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0113">&lt;Results of Test <b>2</b>&gt;</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0114">In the test <b>2</b>, the moisture content percentage was 80.6%. The moisture content percentage of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> produced from the decayed orange was 21.4% in 6 hours after the start of drying. The surface temperature of this dried combustible material <b>4</b> was 26.1Â° C. It was further determined that the dried combustible material <b>4</b> was obtained as solid fuel broken into pellets each having a size of about 0.8 cm<sup>3</sup>. As a result of analyzing the dried combustible material <b>4</b> in the test <b>2</b>, an amount of heat generation of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> produced from the decayed orange was 19800 J/g.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0115">In the tests <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the dried combustible material <b>4</b> with a moisture content percentage of about 20% usable as solid fuel could be produced by a simple manner that a slight amount of the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is mixed into the combustible waste <b>1</b> containing moisture at a moisture content percentage of 80% or more and kneaded, and then the resultant mixture <b>3</b> is stirred for about 6 hours while the outside air AR at about 20Â° C. substantially corresponding to a room temperature is blown. Thus, it was confirmed that the solid fuel manufacturing method using the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> has significance. In addition, in the course of producing the dried combustible material <b>4</b>, the combustible waste <b>1</b> is not exposed to an atmosphere under high temperature close to 100Â° C., differently from that in the conventional solid fuel manufacturing apparatus, and thus does not generate foul odors.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0116">The following explanation is given to operations and advantageous effects of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> and the solid fuel manufacturing method using this apparatus of the first embodiment configured as above.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0117">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> includes the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A to produce the mixture <b>3</b> by kneading the wet combustible waste <b>1</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> acting to accelerate removal of moisture from the combustible waste <b>1</b>, the rotary drum <b>30</b> configured to be cylindrical and rotatable and contain the mixture <b>3</b> in the internal space <b>30</b>S, and the exhaust fan <b>41</b> for introducing outside air AR into the rotary drum <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0118">The apparatus <b>10</b> further includes the exhaust opening <b>45</b> through which the exhaust air EG will be discharged, the motor <b>51</b> to rotate the rotary drum <b>30</b>, the control board <b>60</b> to control motions of the motor <b>51</b>, and the blades <b>72</b> to break up or fragment the mixture <b>3</b> contained in the internal space <b>30</b>S. The dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is a treatment agent made of an emulsion containing synthetic resin. The blades <b>72</b> are arranged along the inner peripheral wall <b>31</b> of the rotary drum <b>30</b> and configured to scoop the mixture <b>3</b> upward in the internal space <b>30</b>S and allow the mixture <b>3</b> to freely fall from above in the internal space <b>30</b>S as the rotary drum <b>30</b> rotates.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0119">In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b>, therefore, the moisture contained in the combustible waste <b>1</b> is allowed to easily evaporate by the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b>. If only the mixture <b>3</b> is stirred and exposed to the outside air AR of about 20Â° C., which is almost close to a room temperature, without heating the air to a high temperature, the dried combustible material <b>4</b> can be broken up into small pieces as solid fuel by the blades <b>72</b> and the rake <b>34</b>. In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b>, in addition to simple configuration and structure, any system for a heating source is unnecessary to heat the combustible waste <b>1</b> in order to produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> as solid fuel from the combustible waste <b>1</b>, and hence any energy (fuel) does not need to be supplied to the heating source.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0120">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is therefore low in both the initial cost and the running cost as compared with the conventional solid fuel manufacturing apparatus. In addition, this apparatus <b>10</b> can produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> from the combustible waste <b>1</b> effectively and in a short treatment time. No foul odors are not generated during production of the dried combustible material <b>4</b> and thus no deodorization means is necessary and also workability is good.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0121">As well as in the public sewage sludge treatment system, particularly, in facilities such as food manufacturers and supermarkets, a lot of combustible waste which is organic waste such as sewage sludge generated during sewage treatment and food waste, is daily generated. To produce the dried mixture from such combustible waste, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> has a high treatment capacity to dry the combustible waste <b>1</b> of several tens to hundreds kg in a treatment time of a few hours, for example. In those facilities, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> can be suitable for making the combustible waste <b>1</b> into solid fuel.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0122">According to the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment, therefore, it can provide superior effects that can remove the moisture contained in sludge which is the combustible waste <b>1</b> and produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> which is solid fuel at low cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0123">In the first embodiment, the blades <b>72</b> attached to the inner peripheral wall <b>31</b> of the rotary drum <b>30</b> are arranged in two or more places under the condition of at least different attachment angles or orientations in the axial direction AX and the circumferential direction CR of the rotary drum <b>30</b>. Further, the load sensors <b>59</b> are arranged in positions to support the rotary drum <b>30</b>. The control board <b>60</b> controls motions of the motor <b>51</b> based on the detection signals from the load sensors <b>59</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0124">In the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, accordingly, the mixture <b>3</b> is uniformly stirred, so that the surface area of the mixture <b>3</b> exposed to the outside air AR introduced in the internal space <b>30</b>S through the intake opening <b>33</b> is more increased, thereby easily accelerating evaporation of the moisture and breakup of the mixture <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0125">In the first embodiment, the rotary drum <b>30</b> is a batch rotary drum and is useful in the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> when a relatively small amount of combustible waste <b>1</b> is to be treated to produce solid fuel. Furthermore, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is compact and thus low in facility cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0126">In the first embodiment, the heat pump <b>46</b> is provided to raise the temperature of the outside air AR to be introduced by the exhaust fan <b>41</b> in a range of 20Â° C. or more but 30Â° C. or less when the temperature of the outside air AR is less than 20Â° C. Accordingly, even if the temperature of the outside air AR is less than 20Â° C. according to seasons or environments, it is possible to prevent generation of foul odors and efficiently evaporate the moisture contained in the mixture <b>3</b> in the atmosphere of the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0127">In the first embodiment, since the scraper <b>47</b> is provided on the exhaust opening <b>45</b>, when the outside air AR introduced by the exhaust fan <b>41</b> is to be blown in the internal space <b>30</b>S of the rotary drum <b>30</b>, it is possible to prevent a flow of the outside air AR from being interfered with the mixture <b>3</b> (or the dried combustible material <b>4</b>) sticking to the entire mesh of the exhaust opening <b>45</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0128">In the first embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is installed in the interior space of the cargo container <b>20</b>. Accordingly, when the cargo container <b>20</b> enclosing the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> in the interior space is simply anchored in an installation place for the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b>, installation of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is completed. This installation work is thus easy.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0129">In the first embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> is used to dry the moisture from the combustible waste <b>1</b>, and break up the combustible waste <b>1</b> to produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> as solid fuel broken into pellets each having a size smaller than 1 cm<sup>3</sup>. Accordingly, the dried combustible material <b>4</b> can be easily combusted. Further, the dried combustible material <b>4</b> can be used for wide purposes in any devices configured to burn solid fuel to generate heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0130">In the first embodiment, the combustible waste <b>1</b> is any one of at least sewage sludge, food waste, animal waste, and vegetable waste. Thus, the combustible waste <b>1</b> from which the moisture is removed but in which a combustible component remains left can be utilized as effective fuel resource.</p>

      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0131">A solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> of a second embodiment will be explained referring to <figref>FIGS. 16 to 18</figref>. <figref>FIG. 16</figref> is a front view showing the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> of the second embodiment. <figref>FIG. 17</figref> is a plan view showing the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>. <figref>FIG. 18</figref> is an explanatory view showing an inner state of a continuous rotary drum <b>130</b> taken along an arrow F-F in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0132">In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment, the mixture forming means of the invention is exemplified as the rotary drum <b>30</b> of a batch treatment type. In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> of the second embodiment, the mixture forming means of the invention is exemplified as the rotary drum <b>130</b> of a continuous treatment type including a carry-in conveyer <b>180</b>. Additionally, the second embodiment differs from the first embodiment mainly in the size of a cargo container for accommodating the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b>, a rotation driving mechanism of the rotary drum <b>130</b>, and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0133">The remaining parts or components are identical to those of the first embodiment. Accordingly, similar or identical parts to those of the first embodiment are given the same reference signs as those of the first embodiment and are explained briefly or not explained repeatedly. The following explanation is made with a focus on differences from the first embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0134">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> mainly consists of the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A and a mixture drying device <b>110</b>B as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In the second embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> is designed to have a size allowing installation in an interior space (a compartment) of a cargo container <b>120</b> for transporting the apparatus <b>110</b> to a destination. To be concrete, the apparatus <b>110</b> is configured on the assumption that it will be installed in for example the interior space of a so-called 40 ft high-cube (a tall type) sea-cargo container (Inside dimension; Length: 12.030 m, Width: 2.350 m, and Height: 2.700 m) according to the ISO standards.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0135">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> may be installed not only in the interior space of the cargo container <b>120</b> but alto on a floor of a building or plant without using the cargo container <b>120</b>. In this case, the apparatus <b>110</b> does not need to be configured with the dimension suitable for the cargo container <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0136">In the second embodiment, the rotary drum <b>130</b> is a rotary drum of a continuous treatment type, configured such that the mixture <b>3</b> to be treated is charged into an internal space <b>130</b>S located on one side (a left side in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>) in the axial direction AX and is treated by passing through the internal space <b>130</b>S in the axial direction AX, and then the treated mixture <b>3</b> (the dried combustible material <b>4</b>) is discharged out through an exit of the internal space <b>130</b>S located on the other side (a right side in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0137">The rotary drum <b>130</b> is supported by four driven rollers <b>55</b> rotatably axis-supported one each by the drum lower side supporting parts <b>56</b> provided in four places on a second frame <b>121</b>. On an outer periphery of the rotary drum <b>130</b>, roller track parts <b>158</b> are provided in two places. The driven rollers <b>55</b> are driven in pairs to rotate while each pair contacts with the corresponding one of the roller track parts <b>158</b>, thereby holding and supporting the rotary drum <b>130</b> during rotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0138">On the outer periphery of this rotary drum <b>130</b>, there is provided a chain engagement part <b>154</b>, like an eternal ring gear, intermittently formed with outer gear teeth engageable with a drive chain <b>153</b>. A motor <b>151</b> is a drive source to rotate the rotary drum <b>130</b>. A sprocket is connected to a motor output shaft <b>152</b>. The drive chain <b>153</b> is wound over this sprocket and the chain engagement part <b>154</b>. Accordingly, rotation of the motor output shaft <b>152</b> causes rotation of the rotary drum <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0139">As another configuration, instead of using the above sprocket and drive chain <b>153</b>, it may be arranged such that a drive gear (an external teeth gear) is provided on the motor output shaft <b>152</b> and a driven gear (an annular external teeth gear) is provided on the outer periphery of the rotary drum <b>130</b> in engagement with the drive gear, so that rotation of the motor <b>151</b> is transmitted to the driven gear through the drive gear to transmit the rotational force of the motor <b>151</b> to the rotary drum <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0140">The control board <b>160</b> is used to control various operations of the motor <b>151</b> such as activation ON/OFF and rotation control by a sequencer. The control board <b>160</b> includes a microcomputer (not shown) having a known configuration such as a CPU, a ROM, and a RAM. The ROM and others store in advance for example a program of setting and changing the number of rotations of the rotary drum <b>130</b>, changing the rotational direction, controlling inching motion of a rotary operation, and rotation and stoppage thereof based on a magnitude of load detected by a load sensor, a program of automatically setting and changing a flow amount of outside air AR to be supplied, and adjusting of air volume of the outside air AR, and other programs.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0141">The control board <b>160</b>, by loading the above programs in the CPU, can execute predetermined operations, for example, rotating of the rotary drum <b>130</b> and blowing of outside air AR under optimal operation conditions corresponding to the state of the mixture <b>3</b> charged in the internal space <b>130</b>S, that is, volume, moisture content percentage, distribution state in the internal space <b>1305</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0142">In the internal space <b>130</b>S of the rotary drum <b>130</b>, a plurality of (four in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>) air pipes <b>142</b> (intake means) are arranged in parallel along the axis direction AX and connected to a drying blower <b>140</b> (intake means). Each air pipe <b>142</b> is provided with a plurality of air blowing nozzles <b>143</b> (intake means) arranged at intervals of a predetermined pitch to supply a required amount of outside air AR from the nozzles <b>143</b> into the internal space <b>130</b>S.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0143">The air blowing nozzles <b>143</b> may be configured, for example, such that adjacent air pipes <b>142</b> are arranged in a staggered pattern, that the nozzle tips are oriented in different directions based on a fixed pattern rule, and that two or more kinds of air blowing nozzles <b>143</b> having different nozzle diameters are used. The exhaust fans <b>141</b> (exhaust means) are provided one each on an entrance side and an exit side of the internal space <b>130</b>S of the rotary drum <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0144">In the second embodiment, the carry-in conveyer <b>180</b> is placed in the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b>. This conveyer <b>180</b> is a belt conveyer configured by a well known technique. Specifically, when the mixture <b>3</b> ejected from the extrusion section <b>15</b> of the mixture producing device <b>10</b>A is supplied onto a mixture tray <b>183</b> placed on the belt, the conveyer <b>180</b> conveys, by rotation of the belt, the tray <b>183</b> on which a predetermined amount of mixture <b>3</b> is put to an uppermost position.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0145">The mixture <b>3</b> of the predetermined amount put on the tray <b>183</b> is charged in a carry-in hopper <b>181</b> located on the entrance side of the internal space <b>130</b>S of the rotary drum <b>130</b> and then is contained in the internal space <b>130</b>S of the rotary drum <b>130</b>. As the rotary drum <b>130</b> rotates, while the mixture <b>3</b> repeats complicated motions by being scooped up in the internal space <b>130</b>S by the plurality of blades <b>72</b> and then made freely fall from above in the internal space <b>130</b>S, the mixture <b>3</b> is moved forward in one way in the axial direction AX in the internal space <b>130</b>S.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0146">During this movement, the mixture <b>3</b> is dried and broken into small pieces, forming the dried combustible material <b>4</b>, and is carried out onto a carry-out hopper <b>182</b> placed on the exit side of the internal space <b>1305</b>. The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> has a high treatment capacity of for example <b>700</b> kg/hour and thus can continuously produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> from the mixture <b>3</b> intermittently charged therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0147">Operations and advantageous effects of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> of the second embodiment will be explained. As with the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the aforementioned first embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> of the second embodiment can also remove the moisture contained in sludge which is the combustible waste <b>1</b> in short time and produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> which is solid fuel at low cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0148">In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b>, furthermore, the rotary drum <b>130</b> is a rotary drum of a continuous treatment type and therefore is suitably used for a relatively large amount of combustible waste <b>1</b> to be treated to produce solid fuel. This apparatus <b>110</b> can produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> from the mixture <b>3</b> with enhanced productivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0149">Other operations and effects of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>110</b> are the same as those of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment excepting the actions resulting from the batch rotary drum <b>30</b> in the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment.

      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0156">The rotary drum <b>230</b> is a cylindrical, rotatable, batch type drum to contain the mixture <b>3</b> in an internal space <b>230</b>S (see <figref>FIG. 30</figref>) and treat the mixture <b>3</b> by an amount charged in the internal space <b>230</b>S. This drum <b>230</b> is designed to be longer in total length and larger in volume than the rotary drum <b>30</b> of the first embodiment. On a third frame <b>222</b>, four drum lower side supporting parts <b>256</b> are fixedly provided. The rotary drum <b>230</b> is supported by four driven rollers <b>255</b> rotatably axis-supported by the drum lower side supporting parts <b>256</b>, and in contact with two roller track parts <b>258</b> formed on the outer periphery of the rotary drum <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0157">On the outer periphery of the rotary drum <b>230</b> positioned between the two roller track parts <b>258</b>, there is a provided driven gear <b>253</b> which is an external ring gear. A drive gear <b>252</b> is attached on the output shaft of the motor <b>251</b> and is engaged with the driven gear <b>253</b> to transmit the rotational force of the motor <b>251</b> to the driven gear <b>253</b>, thereby causing the rotary drum <b>230</b> to rotate.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0158">The exhaust fan <b>241</b> and others are mounted on the second frame <b>221</b>. Between this second frame <b>221</b> and the third frame <b>222</b>, four load sensors <b>259</b> are arranged one each under the drum lower side supporting parts <b>256</b>. The four load sensors <b>259</b> detect the loads acting on predetermined sites (e.g., a rotary shaft of each driven roller <b>255</b> or a bearing thereof) of the corresponding drum lower side supporting parts <b>256</b> among the loads on the entire rotary drum <b>230</b> including the mixture <b>3</b> contained in the internal space <b>230</b>S.</p>

      <heading id="h-00016-en" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0165">A solid fuel manufacturing apparatus of a fourth embodiment will be explained below referring to <figref>FIGS. 23</figref>, <b>31</b> to <b>33</b>. <figref>FIG. 31</figref> is a side view of a mixture producing device <b>310</b>A of a solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>310</b> of the fourth embodiment. <figref>FIG. 32</figref> is a front view and <figref>FIG. 33</figref> is a plan view of the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0166">The solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>310</b> of the fourth embodiment is different in the configuration of the mixture producing device <b>310</b>A from the mixture producing device <b>210</b>A of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>210</b> of the third embodiment, but the mixture drying device of the fourth embodiment is similar in configuration to the mixture drying device <b>210</b>B of the third embodiment. Accordingly, similar or identical parts or components to those in the third embodiment are given the same reference signs as those in the third embodiment and are explained briefly or not explained repeatedly. The following explanation is made with a focus on differences from the third embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0167">In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>310</b>, the mixture producing device <b>310</b>A consists of a single kneading unit <b>311</b>, a single mixture supplying main unit <b>312</b>, and three mixture supplying sub-units <b>313</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 33</figref>. These total five units are contained one each in so-called 20 ft cargo containers <b>20</b> in one-to-one correspondence with the mixture drying devices <b>210</b>B. These five cargo containers <b>20</b> are arranged in parallel lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0168">The mixture supplying main unit <b>312</b> is disposed as a center line, and the kneading unit <b>311</b> is disposed on one side of the main unit <b>312</b> by interposing the mixture supplying sub-unit <b>313</b> therebetween. On the other side of the main unit <b>312</b>, the two sub-units <b>313</b> are arranged side by side.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0169">The kneading unit <b>311</b> includes a kneading section <b>314</b>. In this kneading section <b>314</b>, the combustible waste <b>1</b> is charged in a raw-material charge port <b>315</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> (see <figref>FIG. 14</figref>) is poured in a liquid inlet not shown to be mixed with the combustible waste <b>1</b>. The mixture <b>3</b> prepared by mixing the combustible waste <b>1</b> and the dehydrating liquid <b>2</b> is fed under pressure by a raw material ejection section <b>316</b>. Thus, the mixture <b>3</b> broken into small pieces each having a thickness of about 10 mm in diameter is dropped and supplied from the raw material ejection section <b>316</b> to a raw material hopper <b>317</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0170">In the third embodiment, the raw material hopper <b>317</b> is configured for example to include, not illustrated, a single port having a diameter of about 200 mm on an input side and a plurality of ports formed of small pipes each having a diameter of about 10 mm on an output side. Accordingly, when the mixture <b>3</b> is passing under pressure through the small pipes of the raw material ejection section <b>316</b>, the mixture <b>3</b> is subjected to friction with the inner wall of each small pipe and thus is easily broken up by the frictional heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0171">Each of the main unit <b>312</b> and the sub-units <b>313</b> is provided with a suction chamber <b>322</b> connected, through a first valve <b>324</b> and a second valve <b>325</b>, to a mixture charge pipe <b>331</b> having an ejection port <b>328</b> at a distal end. The ejection port <b>328</b> is placed on a side close to the drum openable door <b>232</b> of the rotary drum <b>230</b> of the mixture drying device <b>210</b>B and just above the mixture charge port <b>235</b> in which the mixture <b>3</b> is to be charged into the internal space <b>230</b>S (see <figref>FIG. 23</figref> and others).</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0172">The mixture feed pipe <b>332</b> connected to the raw material hopper <b>317</b> is connected in parallel to each of four suction chambers <b>322</b> through openable gates <b>327</b>. Each gate <b>327</b> is a valve to block or allow the movement of the broken mixture <b>3</b> in the pipe <b>332</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0173">The main unit <b>312</b> includes a suction pump <b>321</b> to suck air and is electrically connected to the control board <b>260</b> (see <figref>FIG. 19</figref>). The suction pump <b>321</b> is connected in parallel to each of four suction chambers <b>322</b> through an air pipe <b>333</b> connected in series with an air changeover valve <b>323</b> and third valves <b>326</b>. The suction pump <b>321</b> sucks the air from the inside of the air pipe <b>333</b> to discharge the air in a direction indicated by a black arrow in <figref>FIG. 31</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0174">A process of charging the mixture <b>3</b> prepared in the mixture producing devices <b>310</b>A into the internal spaces <b>230</b>S of the rotary drums <b>230</b> of the mixture drying devices <b>210</b>B will be explained below. Firstly, the mixture <b>3</b> broken up into small pieces in the kneading section <b>314</b> is supplied to the raw material hopper <b>317</b>. The mixture <b>3</b> supplied to the hopper <b>317</b> is sucked in a direction indicated by a white arrow in <figref>FIG. 31</figref> by the suction pump <b>321</b> while the first valves <b>324</b> are closed, and then fed into the suction chambers <b>322</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0175">At that time, the gates <b>327</b> of the suction chambers <b>322</b> of the three sub-units <b>313</b>, excepting the main unit <b>312</b>, are opened/closed as needed to charge the mixture <b>3</b> from the sub-unit(s) <b>313</b> into the internal space(s) <b>230</b>S of the rotary drum(s) <b>230</b> of the corresponding mixture drying device(s) <b>210</b>B. Similarly, the third valves <b>326</b> are opened/closed.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0176">Specifically, when the sub-unit(s) <b>313</b> is to be activated to charge the mixture <b>3</b> into the internal space(s) <b>230</b>S of the rotary drum(s) <b>230</b> of the mixture drying device(s) <b>210</b>B, the openable gate(s) <b>327</b> and the third valve(s) <b>326</b> are opened. On the other hand, when the sub-unit(s) <b>313</b> is not to be activated to charge the mixture <b>3</b> into the internal space(s) <b>230</b>S of the rotary drum(s) <b>230</b> of the mixture drying device(s) <b>210</b>B, the gate(s) <b>327</b> and the third valve(s) <b>326</b> are closed.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0177">The mixture <b>3</b> sucked by the suction pump <b>321</b> is fed, under friction with the inner wall of the air pipe <b>333</b>, to the suction chamber <b>322</b> of the main unit <b>312</b> and the suction chambers <b>322</b> of the three sub-units <b>313</b>, and stored in the four suction chambers <b>322</b>. At that time, the mixture <b>3</b> is exposed to the air being sucked by the suction pump <b>321</b> and also to frictional heat caused by contact with the inner wall of the feed pipe <b>332</b> during delivery. Thus, during delivery, the moisture contained in the mixture <b>3</b> is removed by about 10% as compared with the percentage of moisture content of the combustible waste <b>1</b> before charged in the kneading section <b>314</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0178">When the mixture <b>3</b> with the moisture content percentage reduced by about 10% is stored in a predetermined amount in the suction chamber(s) <b>322</b>, the suction pump <b>321</b> is stopped sucking, so that the internal pressure of the air pipe <b>333</b> becomes atmospheric pressure. After the openable gate <b>327</b> is closed, the first valve <b>324</b> is opened and simultaneously the second valve <b>325</b> is opened. Accordingly, the mixture <b>3</b> stored in the suction chamber <b>322</b> is allowed to free-fall from the ejection port <b>328</b> through the charge pipe <b>331</b> into the charge port <b>235</b> of the rotary drum <b>230</b> of the mixture drying device <b>210</b>B, and thus the mixture <b>3</b> is charged into the internal space <b>230</b>S</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0179">In the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>310</b>, charging of the mixture <b>3</b> into the internal space(s) <b>230</b>S of the rotary drum(s) <b>230</b> of the mixture drying device(s) <b>210</b>B and sucking and storing of the mixture <b>3</b> by the suction pump <b>321</b> are alternately, intermittently repeated. Accordingly, when a predetermined amount of the mixture <b>3</b> is charged into the internal space <b>230</b>S of the rotary drum <b>230</b>, the second valve <b>325</b> remains opened but the first valve <b>324</b> is closed. Further, the gate <b>327</b> is opened. A series of the above operations is repeatedly performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0180">As with the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>210</b> of the aforementioned third embodiment, the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>210</b> of the fourth embodiment can also dehydrate the sewage sludge which is the combustible waste <b>1</b> in short time and produce the dried combustible material <b>4</b> as solid fuel at low cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0181">The other operations and effects of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>310</b> are the same as those of the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>210</b> of the third embodiment excepting the shapes, attachment patterns, and attachment positions of the blades <b>72</b> attached to the inner peripheral wall <b>31</b> of the rotary drum <b>30</b> in the solid fuel manufacturing apparatus <b>10</b> of the first embodiment. Their explanations are thus omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0182">The present invention is explained in the first to fourth embodiments but is not limited thereto. The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential characteristics thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0183">(1) In the first to fourth embodiments, for instance, the combustible waste <b>1</b> is sewage sludge. However, the combustible waste is not limited to those in the embodiments and may be any materials as long as they contain moisture and combustible components.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0184">(2) In the first and second embodiments, the blades <b>72</b> shaped and arranged as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 to 9</figref> are exemplified as the breaking means. However, the shape of blades and the placement of blades are not limited to those in the embodiments and may be appropriately changed.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0185">(3) In the first embodiment, furthermore, the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B is inclined toward the drum openable door <b>32</b> with respect to the first frame <b>11</b> by adjusting the height of the adjustment bolts <b>22</b> located on the side close to the door <b>32</b> to be lower than the bolts <b>22</b> located on the side close to the exhaust fan <b>41</b>. The mixture <b>3</b> contained in the internal space <b>30</b>S is collected toward the drum openable door <b>32</b> and also moved toward the exhaust fan <b>41</b> by rotating operation of the rotary drum <b>30</b> and stirring operation of the blades <b>72</b> so that the mixture <b>3</b> is actively moved back and forth in the axial direction AX. However, the mixture drying device <b>10</b>B may be placed in a horizontal posture without adjusting the heights of the adjustment bolts <b>22</b> to be remarkably different in height.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0186">(4) As with the first embodiment, the second embodiment may be arranged to place the load sensors in positions for supporting the mixture containing means. This enables controlling the rotation of the mixture containing means based on detection signals of the load sensors so that the mixture intermittently charged moves for a predetermined time from an entrance to an exit of the internal space of the containing means.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0187">(5) In the fourth embodiment, the mixture producing device <b>310</b>A including one kneading unit <b>311</b> and one mixture supplying main unit <b>312</b> and three mixture supplying sub-units <b>311</b>. However, the number of sub-units, the placement of those kneading unit, mixture supplying main units, and mixture supplying sub-units is not limited and may be appropriately changed.</p>
