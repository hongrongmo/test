      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Applications No. 2014-053453, filed on Mar. 17, 2014, and No. 2014-253789, filed on Dec. 16, 2014, in the Japan Patent Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a method of forming a titanium carbonitride film and a film formation apparatus therefor.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As a material for films constituting electronic devices, titanium nitride is known in the art. A film composed of titanium nitride, that is, a titanium nitride film, is used as an electrode material constituting, for example, a capacitor of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In addition, with increasing miniaturization of electronic devices, there is increasing demand for films having excellent quality for electronic devices. In light of such demand, a titanium carbonitride film is used instead of, for example, the titanium nitride film.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In a method of forming such a titanium carbonitride film, a cycle of sequentially supplying titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) gas, a carbon containing gas, and a nitrogen containing gas to a process chamber that accommodates a wafer is performed a plurality of times.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In the method of forming a titanium carbonitride film, the carbon containing gas and the nitrogen containing gas are sequentially supplied to the process chamber, that is, the carbon containing gas is supplied to the process chamber, followed by supply of the nitrogen containing gas to the process chamber. Thus, it is difficult to achieve an efficient increase in carbon concentration in the titanium carbonitride film within a predetermined number of cycles. Moreover, this method has difficulty in control of the concentration of carbon introduced into the titanium carbonitride film within a predetermined number of cycles.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method and apparatus, which form a titanium carbonitride film having high work function and high controllability of carbon concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of forming a titanium carbonitride film, including: performing a cycle a plurality of times to form a titanium carbonitride film, the cycle including: supplying a raw material gas of titanium into a process chamber in which a process object is accommodated, and simultaneously supplying a first gas containing carbon and hydrogen and a second gas containing nitrogen into the process chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a film formation apparatus including: a process chamber; a gas supply system supplying a raw material gas of titanium, a first gas containing carbon and hydrogen, and a second gas containing nitrogen into the process chamber; and a controller controlling the gas supply system, wherein the controller performs, a plurality of times, a control cycle for controlling the gas supply system to supply the raw material gas into the process chamber and controlling the gas supply system to simultaneously supply the first gas and the second gas into the process chamber.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with referenced to the accompanying drawings. Like components will be denoted by like reference numerals through the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, systems, and components have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the various embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of forming a titanium carbonitride film according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. In addition, <figref>FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref> show views of one example of an object to be processed (hereinafter, referred to as a âprocess objectâ), showing states of the process object to which processes of the method shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are applied. The method MT shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> may be used to form a titanium carbonitride film on, for example, a process object, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A to 2C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, as an example of the process object, a wafer W includes a substrate SB and a dielectric layer DL. The dielectric layer DL is formed on the substrate SB and may be composed of, for example, zirconium oxide. Such film configuration of the wafer W may constitute, for example, part of a DRAM.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In the method MT according to one embodiment, a titanium nitride film TN is formed on the wafer W through cycle CA, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>. Then, a titanium carbonitride film TCN is formed on the titanium nitride film TN through cycle C<b>1</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2C</figref>. Further, in this method MT, the cycle CA is an optional cycle and becomes unnecessary in the case where only the titanium carbonitride film TCN is required. Further, the cycle CA may be performed after the cycle C<b>1</b>, as needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Next, referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the method MT will be described in more detail. In the method MT, the cycle CA includes a process STa and a process STb. In the process STa, a raw material gas of titanium is supplied into a process chamber that accommodates a wafer W. By performing the process STa, molecules constituting the raw material gas are adsorbed onto the wafer W. The raw material gas includes, for example, TiCl<sub>4 </sub>gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Then, in the process STb, a nitrogen containing gas (third gas) is supplied into the process chamber. The third gas may be, for example, NH<sub>3 </sub>gas or triethylamine. In the process STb, the third gas is decomposed to generate nitrogen. Also, in the process STa, chlorine is separated from the molecules adsorbed to the wafer W such that nitrogen is bonded to titanium. To this end, in the process sm, the gas supplied to the process chamber and the wafer W are heated. In the process STb, the gas and the wafer W are heated to a temperature in the range of, for example, 350 degrees C. to 450 degrees C. Alternatively, in the process STb, plasma of the third gas is generated.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In the cycle CA, the titanium nitride film TN may be formed through the process STa and the process sm, whereby the thickness of a stack layer including the titanium carbonitride film TCN formed by the cycle C<b>1</b> described below and the titanium nitride film TN can be increased. The number of times that the cycle CA is performed may be set depending upon a desired film thickness, and may be once or more. When the cycle CA is performed once, the procedure of the method MT proceeds to the cycle C<b>1</b> after performing the cycle CA once. On the other hand, when the cycle CA is performed a plurality of times, it is determined in the process STc whether stop conditions are satisfied. The stop conditions may be satisfied when the cycle CA is performed a predetermined number of times. If the stop conditions are not satisfied, the cycle CA is repeated again from the process STa. On the other hand, if the stop conditions are satisfied, the procedure of the method MT proceeds to the cycle C<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The cycle C<b>1</b> includes a process ST<b>1</b> and a process ST<b>2</b>. The process ST<b>1</b> of the cycle C<b>1</b> is identical to the process STa. By the process ST<b>1</b>, molecules constituting a raw material gas of titanium are adsorbed onto the wafer W.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Then, in the process ST<b>2</b>, a first gas containing carbon and hydrogen, and a second gas containing nitrogen are supplied into the process chamber at the same time. The first gas may be, for example, hydrocarbon gas or triethylamine. More specifically, the first gas may include at least one selected from the group consisting of acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) gas, ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) gas, propylene (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) gas, butadiene (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) gas, triethylamine, and a mixture of two or more of the aforementioned gases. The second gas may be the same gas as the third gas, or may be, for example, NH<sub>3 </sub>gas or triethylamine. In the process ST<b>2</b>, the first gas and the second gas are decomposed to generate carbon and nitrogen. Also, in the process ST<b>1</b>, chlorine is separated from the molecules adsorbed to the wafer W, such that carbon and nitrogen are bonded to titanium. To this end, in the process ST<b>2</b>, the gas supplied into the process chamber and the wafer W are heated. In the process ST<b>2</b>, the gas and the wafer W are heated to a temperature in the range of, for example, 350 degrees C. to 450 degrees C. Alternatively, in the process ST<b>2</b>, plasma of the first gas and the second gas is generated.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The cycle C<b>1</b> including the processes ST<b>1</b>, ST<b>2</b> is performed a plurality of times. Therefore, in the process ST<b>3</b>, it is determined whether stop conditions are satisfied. The stop conditions may be satisfied when the cycle C<b>1</b> is performed a predetermined number of times. If the stop conditions are not satisfied, the cycle C<b>1</b> is repeated again from the process ST<b>1</b>. On the other hand, if the stop conditions are satisfied, the process of the method MT is finished. In this manner, the titanium carbonitride film TCN is formed by repeating the cycle C<b>1</b> a plurality of times.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> will be referred to here. <figref>FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> are diagrams illustrating a phenomenon when the first gas and the second gas are sequentially supplied (see <figref>FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref>) and also a diagram illustrating a phenomenon when the first gas and the second gas are simultaneously supplied (see <figref>FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref>). As shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, when the raw material gas of titanium is supplied, molecules constituting the raw material gas of titanium are adsorbed onto the wafer W. Then, when the first gas is supplied alone, molecules (HyCâCxH) constituting the first gas are bonded to titanium (Ti), as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>. Next, when the second gas is supplied alone, bonds between the molecules constituting the first gas and titanium are severed by the molecules constituting the second gas. Thus, the molecules (NH<sub>2</sub>) constituting the second gas are bonded to titanium, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>. That is, when the first gas and the second gas are sequentially supplied, the concentration of carbon in the titanium carbonitride film is decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">On the other hand, in the process ST<b>1</b> of the cycle C<b>1</b> of the method MT, when the raw material gas of titanium is supplied, molecules constituting the raw material gas of titanium are adsorbed onto the wafer W, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3D</figref>. In addition, in the cycle C<b>1</b> of the method MT, the first gas and the second gas are supplied to the process chamber at the same time in the process ST<b>2</b>. Thus, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3E</figref>, nitrogen (NH<sub>2</sub>) may be bonded to titanium in the film formed by the process ST<b>1</b>, and carbon (HyCâCH) may be bonded thereto while suppressing to be substituted by nitrogen. Accordingly, it is possible to introduce a relatively large number of carbon atoms into the film within a limited number of cycles. Therefore, the cycle C<b>1</b> enables supply of a titanium carbonitride film TCN having a high work function, whereby the titanium carbonitride film can have excellent controllability of carbon concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Further, in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the cycle CA is performed before the cycle C<b>1</b>, as described above. By such cycle CA, the titanium nitride film TN can be formed between the dielectric layer DL and the titanium carbonitride film TCN. As a result, it becomes possible to suppress carbon diffusion from the titanium carbonitride film TCN to the dielectric layer DL.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Next, a method of forming a titanium carbonitride film according to another embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of forming a titanium carbonitride film according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The method MT<b>2</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is different from the method MT in that the cycle C<b>1</b> includes a process ST<b>4</b> between the processes ST<b>1</b> and ST<b>2</b>. In the process ST<b>4</b> of the method MT<b>2</b>, a gas containing carbon and hydrogen is supplied into the process chamber. The gas may be the same as the first gas. In the process ST<b>4</b>, the gas containing carbon and hydrogen and a wafer W are heated to a temperature in the range of, for example, 350 degrees C. to 450 degrees C. Alternatively, in the process ST<b>4</b>, plasma of the gas containing carbon and hydrogen may be generated. According to the method MT<b>2</b>, in the process ST<b>4</b>, carbon is bonded to titanium within the film formed in the process ST<b>1</b>, followed by performing the process ST<b>3</b>. Accordingly, it is possible to further increase the concentration of carbon in the titanium carbonitride film.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Next, some embodiments of a film formation apparatus applicable to the method MT and the method MT<b>2</b> will be described. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic vertical sectional view of a film formation apparatus according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the film formation apparatus shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
