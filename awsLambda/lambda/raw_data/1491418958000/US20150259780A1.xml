      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a production method for a complex-type deposition mask in which a thin-board magnetic metal member supports a resin film that is subjected to laser beam machining to form multiple opening patterns therein at positions corresponding to a thin film pattern, and in particular, relates to a production method for a deposition mask, capable of improving formation position precision of the multiple opening patterns.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A conventional production method for a deposition mask has included: forming a first resist pattern that has multiple through holes on a metal plate; forming multiple opening patterns that penetrate the metal plate by carrying out an etching treatment via the through holes of the first resist pattern; subsequently, removing the first resist pattern; forming, on the metal plate, a second resist pattern that has multiple second through holes each of which exposes a metal marginal part with a predetermined width around each of the multiple opening patterns; carrying out an etching treatment via the second through holes of the second resist pattern so as to form a mask main body around each of the multiple through holes and a peripheral part which is positioned around the mask main body and has a thickness greater than that of the mask main body; and thereafter, removing the second resist pattern (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 2001-237072).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, in such a conventional production method for a deposition mask, since the metal plate is subjected to the wet etching treatment so as to form the multiple opening patterns that penetrate the metal plate, the opening patterns with high precision cannot be formed accurately due to isotropy of the wet etching. In particular, in a case of producing the deposition mask for, for example, an organic electroluminescence display panel with a large area whose length of one side is several tens of centimeters, the opening patterns cannot be formed uniformly in a whole surface of the mask due to the generation of etching unevenness.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Thus, the Applicant suggests a complex-type deposition mask including: a resin film in which an opening pattern having a shape and dimensions that are the same as those of a thin film pattern is formed at a position corresponding to the thin film pattern to be formed in a substrate; and a thin-board magnetic metal member in which a through hole including the opening pattern is formed, the resin film and the magnetic metal member contacting tightly with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The above-described complex-type deposition mask is obtained by carrying out laser beam machining with respect to a thin resin film having a thickness of about 10 Î¼m to about 30 Î¼m so as to form the opening patterns therein, which has an advantage that the opening patterns with high precision can be formed accurately, and even in the case of forming the deposition mask with a large area as described above, the opening patterns can be formed uniformly in the whole surface of the mask.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In this case, since the film is subjected to the laser beam machining so as to form the opening patterns therein, a part of the deposition mask which is subjected to the laser beam machining and a surrounding part thereof may be risen due to an impact of irradiation energy of laser beams L when the opening pattern penetrates the film, whereby positions of these parts may be displaced. Thus, in the case of forming the multiple opening patterns while moving a stage on which the deposition mask is placed and a laser emission optical system step by step relatively at specified intervals, formation positions of the respective opening patterns may be displaced.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Accordingly, in order to solve the above-described problems, the present invention aims to provide a production method for a deposition mask, capable of improving formation position precision of the multiple opening patterns.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In order to attain the object, a production method for a deposition mask of the present invention is a production method for a complex-type deposition mask including: a resin film in which at least one opening pattern having a shape and dimensions that are the same as those of a thin film pattern to be formed in a substrate is formed at a position corresponding to the thin film pattern; and a thin-board magnetic metal member in which at least one through hole sized to include the opening pattern is formed, the magnetic metal member contacting tightly with the resin film. The production method includes the steps of: forming a mask member having a structure in which the magnetic metal member having the through hole and the resin film before forming the opening pattern, contact tightly with each other; forming a mark that has a specified shape and a specified depth by irradiating a part of the film through the through hole of the mask member with laser beams; and forming the opening pattern that penetrates the film by irradiating a predetermined position with laser beams, using the mark as a reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to the present invention, since the mark, serving as a formation target of the opening pattern, is formed to be shallow in depth in the film in advance, the mark can be formed with high positional precision without receiving the impact of the laser beam machining. Furthermore, even when the position of the mark is displaced due to the impact of the laser beam machining, the opening pattern can be formed while an imaging device detects the mark and corrects the positional displacement of the mark, and thus, the formation position precision of the opening pattern can be improved.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a front view illustrating an embodiment of a laser machining apparatus for use in a production method for a deposition mask of the present invention. This laser machining apparatus is configured to form, in a resin film, an opening pattern having a shape and dimensions that are the same as those of a thin film pattern to be formed in a substrate at a position corresponding to the thin film pattern, and the laser machining apparatus is provided with an X-Y stage <b>1</b>, a laser device <b>2</b>, an object lens <b>3</b>, a mask <b>4</b>, an imaging device <b>5</b>, and a illumination device <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">On the X-Y stage <b>1</b>, a mask member <b>7</b> including: a magnetic metal member in which a through hole sized to include the opening pattern is formed; and a resin film that can be permeated by visible light, the resin film contacting tightly with the magnetic metal member, is placed, and the X-Y stage <b>1</b> moves the mask member <b>7</b> step by step in X and Y directions and is provided with a first laser interferometer <b>8</b> for measuring a movement distance in the X and Y directions.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">More specifically, the mask member <b>7</b> positioned and placed on a reference substrate <b>9</b> in which a reference mark serving as a reference for forming the opening pattern is formed in advance, is moved by the X-Y plate <b>1</b> together with the reference substrate <b>9</b> step by step.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Above the X-Y stage <b>1</b>, the laser device <b>2</b> is disposed. This laser device <b>2</b> is configured to irradiate a film with the laser beams L with a wavelength of 400 nm or less, such as KrF 248 nm of excimer lasers or third harmonic generation or fourth harmonic generation of YAG lasers, whose cross section perpendicular to an optical axis is shaped to have a shape and dimensions that are the same as those of the thin film pattern, and whose energy density ranges from 1 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 20 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, so as to ablate the film, thereby forming the opening pattern. Moreover, the laser device <b>2</b> is provided with a beam expander that expands a size of the laser beams to a predetermined size.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">On an optical path of the laser beams L, the object lens <b>3</b> is provided so that the object lens <b>3</b> faces the X-Y stage <b>1</b>. This object lens <b>3</b> concentrates the laser beams L onto the film so as to subject the film to the laser beam machining. The object lens <b>3</b> is provided so that it can be moved vertically along the optical axis, and co-works with an imaging lens <b>10</b> so as to project an image of a through hole of the below-described mask <b>4</b> in reduced size onto the film, and the reference mark of the reference substrate <b>9</b> and a below-described mark serving as a formation target of the opening pattern to be formed on the film, are imaged on a photodetector surface of the below-described imaging device <b>5</b>. Furthermore, a second laser interferometer <b>11</b> is attached to the object lens <b>3</b>, whereby it is possible to measure a positional displacement amount of the object lens <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions based on a machine precision of a driving mechanism for moving the object lens <b>3</b> vertically.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Between the laser device <b>2</b> and the object lens <b>3</b> on the optical path of the laser beams L, the mask <b>4</b> is disposed detachably. This mask <b>4</b> includes: a first mask <b>4</b>A in which a first through hole with a shape similar to that of the opening pattern to be formed in the film is formed; and a second mask <b>4</b>B for forming the mark serving as the formation target of the opening pattern, and in which a second through hole with a shape similar to that of the mark is formed. The first through hole and the second through hole may be formed at positions separated from each other on the same mask <b>4</b>, so that the first through hole and the second through hole may be switched to be used by sliding the mask <b>4</b> on a plane that is parallel with a X-Y plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">On an optical path that is generated by branching the optical path which extends from the object lens <b>3</b> through the imaging lens <b>10</b> toward the mask <b>4</b> by a half mirror <b>12</b>, the imaging device <b>5</b> is provided. This imaging device <b>5</b> is configured to detect the reference mark provided on the reference substrate <b>9</b> and the mark formed on the film, and the imaging device <b>5</b> is a two-dimensional CCD camera. Furthermore, an image forming position of the object lens <b>3</b>, and a light receiving surface of the imaging device <b>5</b> and the mask <b>4</b> are arranged in conjugation.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">On an optical path that is generated by branching the optical path which extends from the object lens <b>3</b> toward the imaging lens <b>10</b> by a half mirror <b>13</b>, the illumination device <b>6</b> is provided. This illumination device <b>6</b> is configured to illuminate the reference mark provided on the reference substrate <b>9</b> and the mark formed on the film, so that the reference mark and the mark can be detected by the imaging device <b>5</b>, and the illumination device <b>6</b> is a white light source such as a halogen lamp.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Next, a method for producing the deposition mask of the present invention by using the laser machining apparatus that is structured as described above will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">First, a process of forming the mask member <b>7</b> with a structure in which the magnetic metal member having the through hole and the resin film before forming the opening pattern, contact tightly with each other, will be described. Herein, the description will be provided in a case in which, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the deposition mask to be produced has a structure in which a magnetic metal member <b>15</b> and a film <b>17</b> contact tightly with each other. The magnetic metal member <b>15</b> has rectangular through holes <b>14</b> arranged in a matrix form and having a shape and dimensions greater than those of the thin film patterns, at the same array pitch as that of the multiple thin film patterns which are to be formed on the substrate, at positions corresponding to the thin film patterns, and the film <b>17</b> has opening patterns <b>16</b> arranged in a matrix form and having a shape and dimensions that are the same as those of the thin film patterns at the same array pitch as that of the thin film patterns, at positions corresponding to the multiple thin film patterns. In the figure, a reference symbol <b>18</b> denotes a mask-side alignment mark.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A to 3C</figref> are explanatory views that illustrate a formation process of the mask member <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">First, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, a magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> of a magnetic metal material with a thickness of about 30 Î¼m to about 50 Î¼m, made of nickel, nickel alloy, Invar, Invar alloy, or the like, is cut off to have an area corresponding to a surface area of the substrate to be subjected to the deposition, and a resin liquid of polyimide, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or the like, is applied to one surface <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> and is dried, thereby forming the film <b>17</b> with a thickness of about 10 Î¼m to about 30 Î¼m that is permeated by visible light.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Thereafter, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, a resist is applied to the other surface <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b>, for example, by spraying, and is dried so as to form a resist film. Subsequently, the resist film is exposed by using a photomask, and then is developed so as to form a resist mask <b>21</b> having multiple openings <b>20</b> with a shape and dimensions that are greater than those of the multiple thin film patterns at positions corresponding to the thin film patterns.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> is subjected to wet etching by using the above-described resist mask <b>21</b>, the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> in parts that correspond to the openings <b>20</b> of the resist mask <b>21</b> is removed so as to form the through holes <b>14</b>, thereby forming the magnetic metal member <b>15</b>. Thereafter, the resist mask <b>21</b> is removed by being dissolved into an organic solvent, for example. Thereby, the mask member <b>7</b> including the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> and the resin film <b>17</b>, contacting tightly with each other, is formed. An etchant for etching the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> can be selected appropriately according to the material used for the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b>, and a known technique can be applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Furthermore, when etching the magnetic metal sheet <b>19</b> so as to form the through holes <b>14</b>, the mask-side alignment mark <b>18</b> for positioning a substrate-side alignment mark, which is provided in advance at a predetermined position outside a formation region of the multiple through holes <b>14</b> on the substrate, may be formed at the same time. In this case, when forming the resist mask <b>21</b>, an opening for the alignment mark may be preferably provided at a position corresponding to the mask-side alignment mark <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Next, a process of forming a mark that has a specified shape and a specified depth by irradiating a part of the film <b>17</b> through the through holes <b>14</b> of the mask member <b>7</b> with the laser beams L will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 4A to 4C</figref> are explanatory views that illustrate a process of forming the mark serving as a formation target of the opening pattern.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">First, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, a surface of the film <b>17</b> of the mask member <b>7</b> is allowed to contact tightly with the other surface <b>9</b><i>b </i>of the reference substrate <b>9</b> that is a transparent substrate and has reference marks <b>22</b> formed on one surface <b>9</b><i>a </i>thereof, so that the mask member <b>7</b> and the reference substrate <b>9</b> are unified. At this time, while monitoring, by a microscope, the mask-side alignment mark <b>18</b> of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> and the substrate-side alignment mark provided on the reference substrate <b>9</b> in advance, positions thereof are determined so that both of the marks may have a specified positional relationship (for example, in a manner such that both of the marks are centered on each other).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Thereafter, the thus unified mask member <b>7</b> and reference substrate <b>9</b> are placed on the X-Y stage <b>1</b> so that the reference substrate <b>9</b> is arranged on the stage side. The illumination device <b>6</b> is turned on, so as to illuminate the image forming position of the object lens <b>3</b> and its vicinity region, and at the same time, the imaging device <b>5</b> is started up and acquires an image at the image forming position of the object lens <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Subsequently, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is moved in the X and Y directions so that the through hole <b>14</b> positioned at, for example, a left upper corner of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, is positioned below the object lens <b>3</b>. Then, while monitoring by the imaging device <b>5</b>, a focus of the object lens <b>3</b> is adjusted by moving the object lens <b>3</b> vertically so that an image of the reference mark <b>22</b> of the reference substrate <b>9</b> can be seen clearly. Thereafter, the image of the reference mark <b>22</b> is processed, and the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is adjusted by fine adjustments so that the reference mark <b>22</b> can be centered on a field of view of the object lens <b>3</b>. At this time, as the mask <b>4</b> of the laser machining apparatus, the second mask <b>4</b>B is attached, and the second through hole is centered on the optical axis of the optical system of the laser machining apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">When the detection of the reference mark <b>22</b> has been completed, the object lens <b>3</b> is raised, and the focus point of the object lens <b>3</b> is positioned on the surface of the film <b>17</b>. At this time, a positional displacement amount of the object lens <b>3</b> in the X and Y directions is measured by the second laser interferometer <b>11</b>. Then, while measuring a movement amount of the stage by a first laser interferometer <b>8</b>, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is adjusted by fine adjustments so as to correct the positional displacement amount of the object lens <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Next, the laser device <b>2</b> is started up and emits the laser beams L so that the second mask <b>4</b>B is irradiated with the laser beams L. The laser beams L passing through the second mask <b>4</b>B are shaped by the second through hole of the second mask <b>4</b>B so that a cross section thereof perpendicular to the optical axis has a shape that is similar to an external shape of the mark serving as the formation target of the opening pattern <b>16</b>, and then, the laser beams L pass through the imaging lens <b>10</b> and the object lens <b>3</b>, and are concentrated onto the film <b>17</b>. Thus, the second through hole is projected in reduced size onto the film <b>17</b> by the imaging lens <b>10</b> and the object lens <b>3</b>, whereby the above-described mark <b>23</b> is formed on a part of the film <b>17</b> that corresponds to the reference mark <b>22</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. In this case, when the opening pattern <b>16</b> is formed by multiple shots (for example, 25 shots) of the laser beams L, the number of shots for forming the mark <b>23</b> is less than that for forming the opening pattern <b>16</b>, such as two shots. Thus, in the film <b>17</b>, a shallow concave part (scratch), serving as the above-described mark <b>23</b>, is formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">When the opening pattern <b>16</b> is formed by one shot of the laser beams L, the mark <b>23</b> may be preferably formed with the laser beams L with irradiation energy lower than that of the laser beams L for forming the opening pattern <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Thereafter, based on a designed value of the array of the multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> to be formed, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is moved by step from a machining start position in the X and Y directions (for example, in a direction opposite to an arrow in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>), and the mark <b>23</b> is formed at a predetermined position in each of the through holes <b>14</b> of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>. Then, when the formation of all of the marks <b>23</b> is completed, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is returned to the machining start position.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Next, a process of laser beam machining of the opening pattern <b>16</b> that penetrates the film <b>17</b> will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are explanatory views that illustrate the process of the laser beam machining of the opening pattern <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">First, the second mask <b>4</b>B of the laser machining apparatus is replaced with the first mask <b>4</b>A, and the first through hole of the first mask <b>4</b>A is centered on the optical axis of the optical system of the laser machining apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Subsequently, the mark <b>23</b> at the machining start position is detected by the imaging device <b>5</b>, and the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is adjusted by fine adjustments so that the mark <b>23</b> is centered on the field of view of the object lens <b>3</b>. After finishing the adjustment, the laser device <b>2</b> is started up and emits, for example, 25 shots of the laser beams L for forming the opening pattern <b>16</b>. The laser beams L are shaped by the first through hole of the first mask <b>4</b>A so that the cross section thereof perpendicular to the optical axis has a shape similar to that of the opening pattern <b>16</b>, and the laser beams L are projected in reduced size onto the film <b>17</b> by the imaging lens <b>10</b> and the object lens <b>3</b>. Thus, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, the initial opening pattern <b>16</b> is formed, penetrating the film <b>17</b>, on the part of the film <b>17</b> that corresponds to the mark <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">When the formation of the initial opening pattern <b>16</b> has been completed, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is moved by step in an opposite direction to an arrow illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref> by the same distance as the array pitch (the designed value) of the opening patterns <b>16</b>, so that the object lens <b>3</b> is positioned above an adjacent mark <b>23</b> adjacent to the mark <b>23</b> at the machining start position. In this case, by the impact of the laser beam machining of the initial opening pattern <b>16</b>, the mask member <b>7</b> may be partially risen, and the position of the mark <b>23</b> may be displaced. Then, in the embodiment of the present invention, before subjecting the second opening pattern <b>16</b> to the laser beam machining, the second mark <b>23</b> formed on the film <b>17</b> is imaged and detected by the imaging device <b>5</b>, and the position of the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is adjusted by fine adjustments so that the mark <b>23</b> is centered on the field of view of the object lens <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">After correcting the displacement of the mark <b>23</b> as described above, the laser device <b>2</b> is started up, and the mark <b>23</b> is irradiated with multiple shots of the laser beams L, to thereby subject the second opening pattern <b>16</b> to the laser beam machining, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Thereafter, while moving the X-Y stage <b>1</b> step by step in the X and Y directions (for example, in the direction opposite to the arrow in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>), the detection of the mark <b>23</b> and the correction of the displacement of the mark <b>23</b> are carried out by the imaging device <b>5</b> each time, and then each of the opening patterns <b>16</b> is subjected to the laser beam machining by being irradiated with the laser beams L. Thus, even in a case in which the mask member <b>7</b> is partially risen due to the impact of the laser beam machining of the opening pattern <b>16</b> and the displacement is caused thereby, the mark <b>23</b> that is the formation target of the opening pattern <b>16</b> can be irradiated with the laser beams L accurately so as to form the opening pattern <b>16</b>, so that the formation position precision of the opening pattern <b>16</b> can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the above description, the case in which the one opening pattern <b>16</b> is formed in each of the through holes <b>14</b> of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> was described, but the embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto, and multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> may be formed in one through hole <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a modified example of a deposition mask produced by the method of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In this deposition mask, a through hole <b>14</b> provided in a magnetic metal member <b>15</b> is sized to include multiple opening patterns <b>16</b>, and the multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> are formed at predetermined positions around a mark <b>23</b> as a center in the through hole <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The above-described deposition mask can be manufactured as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">First, a first mask <b>4</b>A, in which multiple first through holes are provided at predetermined positions around, as a center, a position that is on the optical axis of an optical system of a laser machining apparatus, and a second mask <b>4</b>B, in which a second through hole is provided so as to be centered on the optical axis, are prepared.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Next, similarly to the above, by using the second mask <b>4</b>B, while a X-Y stage <b>1</b> is moved step by step in the X and Y directions by a predetermined distance, the multiple marks <b>23</b> that are shallow in depth are formed in a film <b>17</b> of a mask member <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Subsequently, the second mask <b>4</b>B is replaced with the first mask <b>4</b>A, and the mark <b>23</b> is imaged by the imaging device <b>5</b>, and furthermore, the X-Y stage <b>1</b> is adjusted by fine adjustments so as to correct the displacement of the mark <b>23</b>, to thereby center the mark <b>23</b> on the field of view of an object lens <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Thereafter, by being irradiated with laser beams L, multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> (for example, six opening patterns <b>16</b> that are surrounded by a broken line in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) are formed at the same time at the predetermined positions around the mark <b>23</b> as the center. Then, similarly to the above, while moving the X-Y stage <b>1</b> step by step in the X and Y directions, the detection of the mark <b>23</b> and the correction of the positional displacement of the mark <b>23</b> are carried out by the imaging device <b>5</b> each time, and then, the multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> are subjected to the laser beam machining by being irradiated with the laser beams L.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Also in this case, the multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> are subjected to the machining by using the mark <b>23</b> formed in advance as a reference, and thus, the multiple opening patterns <b>16</b> can be formed with high positional precision.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In the above description, the case in which the deposition mask is composed of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> and the film <b>17</b> was described, but the embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto. The deposition mask may be obtained by connecting: one end face <b>25</b><i>a </i>of a frame <b>25</b> having an opening <b>24</b> sized to include the multiple through holes <b>14</b> and alignment mark through holes <b>26</b> formed simultaneously with the through holes <b>14</b> of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b>; with a peripheral part of the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> on a side opposite to the side on which the film <b>17</b> contacts tightly, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. In this case, it may be preferable that the mask member <b>7</b>, from which a peripheral part of the film <b>17</b> has been removed, is provided under tension on the frame <b>25</b>, and the magnetic metal member <b>15</b> and the frame <b>25</b> are spot-welded, and then, the mark <b>23</b> is formed by the laser beam machining, and the opening patterns <b>16</b> are formed in the through holes <b>14</b>, using the mark <b>23</b> as a reference, followed by forming the mask-side alignment marks <b>18</b> in the alignment mark through holes <b>26</b>. Thus, the positions of the opening patterns <b>16</b> and the mask-side alignment marks <b>18</b> can be prevented from being displaced due to the stretching of the mask member <b>7</b> at the time when the mask member <b>7</b> is provided on the frame <b>25</b> under tension. The mark <b>23</b> and the opening patterns <b>16</b> may be formed in regular order in the X direction or the Y direction, or in a zigzag manner in the X and Y directions, while moving the X-Y stage <b>1</b> step by step.</p>
