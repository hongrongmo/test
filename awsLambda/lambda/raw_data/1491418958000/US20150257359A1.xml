      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates generally to dairy farming and more particularly to arrangements of milking box stalls.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Over time, the size and complexity of dairy milking operations has increased. Accordingly, the need for efficient and scalable systems and methods that support dairy milking operations has also increased. Systems and methods supporting dairy milking operations, however, have proven inadequate in various respects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, disadvantages and problems associated with previous systems supporting dairy milking operations may be reduced or eliminated.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In certain embodiments, a system includes a first milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The system also includes an equipment portion located adjacent to the first milking box stall. The equipment portion houses a robotic attacher. The system also includes a second milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The second milking box stall is located adjacent to the equipment portion. The robotic attacher is configured to service both the first milking box stall and the second milking box stall by extending between the rear legs of a dairy livestock located within either stall in order to attach milking equipment to the dairy livestock.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one embodiment, a system includes a first milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The system also includes a second milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The second milking box stall is spaced apart from the first milking box stall. The first and second milking box stalls face opposite directions. The system also includes an equipment portion located between the first milking box stall and the second milking box stall. The equipment portion houses a robotic attacher. The robotic attacher is configured to pivot, move laterally, and/or move backward and forward between the first milking box stall and the second milking box stall in order to service both stalls.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another embodiment, a system includes a first milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The system also includes a second milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The second milking box stall is located adjacent to the first milking box stall. The first and second milking box stalls face the same direction. The system also includes a third milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The third milking box stall is spaced apart from the first milking box stall. The first and third milking box stalls face opposite directions. The system also includes an equipment portion located between the first and second milking box stalls and the third milking box stall. The equipment portion houses a robotic attacher. The robotic attacher is configured to pivot, move laterally, and/or move backward and forward between the first milking box stall, the second milking box stall, and the third milking box stall in order to service all three stalls.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another embodiment, a system includes a first milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The system also includes a second milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The second milking box stall is space apart from the first milking box stall. The first and second milking box stalls face opposite directions. The system also includes a third milking box stall of a size sufficient to accommodate a dairy livestock. The third milking box stall is located near the first and second milking box stalls. The first and third milking box stalls face perpendicular directions. The system also includes a fourth milking box stall. The fourth milking box stall is located near the first and second milking box stalls, and spaced apart from the third milking box stall. The third and fourth milking box stalls face opposite directions. The system also includes an equipment portion located between the first, second, third, and fourth milking box stalls. The equipment portion houses a robotic attacher. The robotic attacher is configured to pivot, move laterally, and/or move backward and forward between the first milking box stall, the second milking box stall, the third milking box stall, and the fourth milking box stall in order to service all four stalls.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Particular embodiments of the present disclosure may provide one or more technical advantages. For example, in certain embodiments, the system of the present disclosure includes a robotic attacher configured to service multiple milking box stalls. As a result, the cost associated with the milking boxes may be less than that of milking boxes that use a separate milking robot for each milking box. As another example, in certain embodiments, the system of the present disclosure includes a robotic attacher positioned to the rear of a milking box housing a dairy cow being milked rather than to the side of the milking box. The robotic attacher being positioned to the rear of a milking box may allow two milking boxes to be positioned side-by-side such that the robotic attacher may attach milking equipment to dairy cows located in each of the milking boxes. As a result, the cost associated with the milking boxes may be less than that of milking boxes that use a milking robot for each milking box. Moreover, the robotic attacher being positioned to the rear of a milking box may allow for gates to be positioned on each side of the milking box. As a result, a dairy cow may enter or exit the milking box on either side, allowing for increased sorting capabilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may include some, all, or none of the above advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates example configurations of an enclosure <b>100</b> in which one or more milking boxes <b>120</b> are installed, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. Enclosure <b>100</b> may be divided into a number of regions <b>110</b> (e.g., regions <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>), and each region <b>110</b> may include resting stalls, feeding troughs, walking paths, and/or other structure suitable for housing dairy livestock. Although the present disclosure contemplates enclosure <b>100</b> as housing any suitable dairy livestock (e.g., dairy cows, goats, sheep, water buffalo, etc.), the remainder of this description is detailed with respect to dairy cows.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Each milking box <b>120</b> may include a stall portion <b>122</b> configured to house a dairy cow being milked. The stall portion <b>122</b> of each milking box <b>120</b> may be defined by a number of walls <b>124</b>, each of which may each be constructed from any suitable materials arranged in any suitable configuration operable to maintain a dairy cow within stall portion <b>122</b> during milking. In certain embodiments, stall portion <b>122</b> of milking box <b>120</b> may include walls <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>c</i>, and <b>124</b><i>d</i>. For purposes of illustration, wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>may be designated as the front of milking box <b>120</b> such that the head of a dairy cow being milked would be facing wall <b>124</b><i>a</i>. Wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>may be positioned opposite wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>and may be designated as the rear of milking box <b>120</b>. Walls <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>124</b><i>d </i>may each form a side extending between the front and rear of milking box <b>120</b>. Walls <b>124</b><i>a</i>, <b>124</b><i>b</i>, <b>124</b><i>c</i>, and <b>124</b><i>d </i>may be spaced apart a suitable distance to ensure the comfort of the dairy cow within stall portion <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Walls <b>124</b><i>b </i>and/or <b>124</b><i>d </i>may comprise one or more gates <b>126</b>. In certain embodiments, wall <b>124</b><i>b </i>and/or wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>may comprise an entry gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and an exit gate <b>126</b><i>b</i>. A dairy cow may enter milking box <b>120</b> through an opened entry gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and exit milking box <b>120</b> through an opened exit gate <b>126</b><i>b</i>. Closing gates <b>126</b> may maintain the dairy cow within milking box <b>120</b> during milking, while opening one or more gates <b>126</b> may allow the dairy cow to exit milking box <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, gates <b>126</b> may each be coupled to a corresponding actuator such that the gates <b>126</b> may be automatically opened and/or closed. For example, the actuators corresponding to gates <b>126</b> may each be configured to communicate (e.g., via wireless or wireline communication) with a controller <b>200</b>, depicted in detail in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Controller <b>200</b> may include one or more computer systems at one or more locations. Examples of computer systems may include a personal computer, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable device for receiving, processing, storing, and communicating data. In short, controller <b>200</b> may include any suitable combination of software, firmware, and hardware. Controller <b>200</b> may include any appropriate interface <b>210</b> for receiving inputs and providing outputs, logic <b>220</b>, one or more processing modules <b>230</b>, and memory module <b>240</b>. Logic <b>220</b> includes any information, logic, applications, rules, and/or instructions stored and/or executed by controller <b>200</b>. Processing modules <b>230</b> may each include one or more microprocessors, controllers, or any other suitable computing devices or resources and may work, either alone or with other components, to provide a portion or all of the functionality described herein. Controller <b>200</b> may additionally include (or be communicatively coupled to via wireless or wireline communication) one or more memory modules <b>240</b>. Memory modules <b>240</b> may be non-transitory and may each include any memory or database module. Memory modules <b>240</b> may take the form of volatile or non-volatile memory, including, without limitation, magnetic media, optical media, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), removable media, or any other suitable local or remote memory component.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Returning to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, controller <b>200</b> may be operable to determine, using any appropriate logic in conjunction with signals received from other components of milking box <b>120</b> (e.g., presence sensor <b>132</b>, gate sensors <b>134</b>, and/or identification sensor <b>136</b>, each of which is described with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, below), which gates <b>126</b> should be open and/or closed. Controller <b>200</b> may then communicate signals to the actuators coupled to the determined gates <b>126</b>, the signals causing the gates <b>126</b> to open or close. The automated control of gates <b>126</b> using controller <b>200</b> is described further with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, below.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Each milking box <b>120</b> may additionally include an equipment portion <b>128</b> located to the rear of stall portion <b>122</b> (i.e., adjacent to rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>of stall portion <b>122</b>). Equipment portion <b>128</b> may comprise any structure suitable for housing and/or storing a robotic attacher (e.g., robotic attacher <b>150</b>, described below with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), one or more preparation cups, teat cups, receiver jars, separation containers, and/or any other suitable milking equipment. Rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>(which may include a backplane <b>138</b>, as described below with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) may separate stall portion <b>122</b> from equipment portion <b>128</b> such that equipment portion <b>128</b> is substantially inaccessible to a dairy cow located in stall portion <b>122</b>. Accordingly a dairy cow located in stall portion <b>122</b> may be prevented from accidentally damaging the milking equipment by kicking, biting, trampling, or exposing the milking equipment to dirt, fluids, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In certain embodiments, the equipment portion <b>128</b> being located to the rear of stall portion <b>122</b> may allow milking boxes <b>120</b> to be aligned in a single row such that walls <b>124</b><i>b </i>and <b>124</b><i>d </i>of each milking box <b>120</b> may comprise an entry gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and an exit gate <b>126</b><i>b </i>(as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>). As a result, milking boxes <b>120</b> may be used to sort dairy cows into particular regions <b>110</b> by controlling the opening/closing of each gate <b>126</b> (e.g., in response to signals from a controller <b>200</b>, as described above). For example, a dairy cow needing a health check or medical attention my be sorted into an appropriate region <b>110</b> (e.g., a veterinary pen). As another example, a dairy cow determined to be finished milking for the year and needing to be dried off and bread may be sorted out of the milking heard. As yet another example, a dairy cow may be sorted into one of a number of regions <b>110</b> based on the stage of lactation of the dairy cow (as dairy cows in different stages may require different feeds).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In the preceding discussion, each milking box <b>120</b> may include an equipment portion <b>128</b>. In certain other embodiments, however, a single equipment portion <b>128</b> may service multiple milking boxes <b>120</b>. In certain other embodiments, the equipment portion <b>128</b> being located to the rear of stall portion <b>122</b> may allow pairs of milking boxes <b>120</b> to be located side by side such that the milking boxes share a wall <b>124</b> (e.g., wall <b>124</b><i>b </i>may be shared between milking box <b>120</b><i>c </i>and milking box <b>120</b><i>d</i>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>). As a result, a single robotic attacher (e.g., robotic attacher <b>150</b>, described below with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) may be shared by the pair of milking boxes <b>120</b>, which may reduce the cost of installing multiple milking boxes <b>120</b> in the enclosure <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a detailed perspective view of an example milking box <b>120</b>, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. As described above with regard to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, milking box <b>120</b> may comprise a stall portion <b>122</b> (defined by walls <b>124</b> and gates <b>126</b>) and equipment portion <b>128</b> located to the rear of stall portion <b>122</b>. In certain embodiments, stall portion <b>122</b> of milking box <b>120</b> may include a feed bowl <b>130</b>, a presence sensor <b>132</b>, one or more gate sensors <b>134</b>, and an identification sensor <b>136</b>. Additionally, one or more of feed bowl <b>130</b>, presence sensor <b>132</b>, gate sensor(s) <b>134</b>, and identification sensor <b>136</b> may be communicatively coupled to controller <b>200</b> (described above with regard to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In certain embodiments, feed bowl <b>130</b> may dispense feed in order to attract a dairy cow so that the dairy cow will enter milking box <b>120</b> voluntarily. Accordingly, at least one of the entry gates <b>126</b><i>a </i>may remain open when there is no dairy cow present to allow a dairy cow to enter. Once the dairy cow has entered milking box <b>120</b>, presence sensor <b>132</b> may detect the presence of the dairy cow. For example, presence sensor <b>132</b> may detect when the dairy cow has passed through the entrance gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and/or when the dairy cow is generally centered in the stall portion <b>122</b>. Upon detecting the presence of the dairy cow, presence sensor <b>132</b> may send a signal to controller <b>200</b>. In response to the signal, controller <b>200</b> may cause one or more actuators to close gates <b>126</b>. Gate sensor <b>134</b> may determine when gates <b>126</b> have closed. Gate sensor <b>134</b> may communicate a signal to controller <b>200</b> upon determining that gates <b>126</b> have closed. Controller <b>200</b> may initiate a milking procedure in response to the signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In certain embodiments, identification sensor <b>136</b> may determine the identity of the dairy cow. As an example, identification sensor <b>136</b> may comprise an antenna operable to read a radio frequency identification (RFID) from an ear tag, a collar, or other identifier associated with the dairy cow. Once the dairy cow has been identified, the identification sensor <b>136</b> may optionally be turned off to prevent wasting power and/or to minimize the dairy cow's exposure to radio waves.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Identification sensor <b>136</b> may communicate the identity of the dairy cow to controller <b>200</b> to facilitate retrieving information describing the dairy cow (e.g., from memory <b>240</b> or any other suitable location). Information describing the dairy cow may comprise historical data describing the particular dairy cow during a previous time period, such as a previous milking cycle. The previous milking cycle may refer to a milking cycle in which milking equipment was manually attached (e.g., by a user) or a milking cycle in which milking equipment was automatically attached (e.g., by a robotic attacher <b>150</b>, described below). In certain embodiments, milking equipment may be attached manually the first time the dairy cow is milked in order to establish initial information describing the dairy cow, such as where the teats are located. The location of the dairy cow's teats may be described relative to a feature of the dairy cow, such as relative to the rear of the dairy cow, the hind legs, and/or a portion of the dairy cow's udder, such as a mid-line of the udder or relative to one or more of the other teats. A robotic attacher (e.g., robotic attacher <b>150</b>, described below) may use the information describing the location of the teats during subsequent milkings to facilitate automatically attaching the milking equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Examples of historical data include measurements, statistics, health information, and any other information describing the dairy cow during a previous time period. Examples of measurements include the length of the dairy cow (e.g., from head to tail) and the location of the dairy cow's teats during a previous milking cycle. Examples of statistics may include statistics describing when the dairy cow was last milked, the amount of milk produced in previous milking cycles, and so on. Examples of health information may include a designation not to milk the dairy cow due to a health problem or a designation to sort the dairy cow into a veterinary pen. In certain embodiments, a user may set an indicator in the database to indicate that the dairy cow should be sorted into the veterinary pen because the dairy cow is due for a check-up or because the user noticed the dairy cow appears to be ill or injured.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Controller <b>200</b> may use the information retrieved according to the identity of the dairy cow to determine how the particular dairy cow should be handled. If the information indicates the dairy cow should not be milked, controller <b>200</b> may cause an actuator to open one or more of the exit gates <b>126</b><i>b</i>. For example, if controller <b>200</b> determines that the dairy cow should be sorted into a particular region <b>110</b> of enclosure <b>100</b>, such as a veterinary pen, it may cause the exit gate <b>126</b><i>b </i>that accesses the selected region <b>110</b> to open. Alternatively, controller <b>200</b> may cause multiple exit gates <b>126</b><i>b </i>to open if the dairy cow is to be given the option of which region <b>110</b> to occupy upon exiting milking box <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, a prod may be used to encourage the dairy cow to exit. Examples of prods include a noise, a mechanical device, or a mild electric shock.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Upon a determination that the dairy cow should be milked, controller <b>200</b> may continue the milking procedure. In certain embodiments, controller <b>200</b> may cause a dispenser to drop feed into feed bowl <b>130</b>. Additionally, controller <b>200</b> may cause feed bowl <b>130</b> to move toward the dairy cow in order to encourage the dairy cow to move to a pre-determined part of stall portion <b>122</b>. As an example, feed bowl <b>130</b> may be initially positioned in the front of stall portion <b>122</b> when the dairy cow enters. Feed bowl <b>130</b> may then move back toward the dairy cow to encourage the dairy cow to move to the rear of stall portion <b>122</b> (e.g., against backplane <b>138</b>, described below) in order to facilitate attaching the milking equipment to the dairy cow. To ensure feed bowl <b>130</b> does not crowd the dairy cow, the amount of movement of feed bowl <b>130</b> may be customized to the size of the dairy cow. For example, a user may determine an appropriate location for feed bowl <b>130</b> the first time the dairy cow enters milking box <b>120</b>. The location may be stored (e.g., in memory module <b>240</b> of controller <b>200</b>) such that it may be retrieved during subsequent milkings according to the identity of the dairy cow. Alternatively, the feed bowl <b>130</b> may be configured to continue moving toward the rear of the stall portion <b>122</b> until the dairy cow contacts backplane <b>138</b> (described below), which may indicate that the dairy cow is positioned in a location that is suitable for attaching the milking equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In certain embodiments, rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>of stall portion <b>122</b> includes a backplane <b>138</b>. Backplane <b>138</b> may comprise any suitable configuration of materials suitable for locating the rear of the dairy cow in order to facilitate the efficient attachment of the milking equipment. In certain embodiments, the dairy cow may be backed toward backplane <b>138</b> by moving feed bowl <b>130</b> as described above. In certain other embodiments, backplane <b>138</b> may be moved forward toward the dairy cow. In certain other embodiments, a combination of backing the dairy cow toward backplane <b>138</b> and moving backplane <b>138</b> forward toward the dairy cow may be used. It may be determined that the rear of the dairy cow has been located when a portion of backplane <b>138</b>, such as a pipe or bracket, touches the rear of the dairy cow at any suitable location, such as approximately mid-flank (i.e., between the udder and the tail). Backplane <b>138</b> may additionally include a manure gutter for directing manure toward a side of stall portion <b>122</b> (e.g., away from the dairy cow's udder and the milking equipment).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In certain embodiments, stall portion <b>122</b> may additionally include a waste grate <b>140</b> for disposing of waste. Waste grate <b>140</b> may have a rough surface to discourage the dairy cow from standing on it. In addition, waste grate <b>140</b> may be dimensioned such that when the dairy cow's hind legs are positioned on opposite sides of waste grate <b>140</b>, the hind legs are separated to facilitate attachment of the milking equipment to the dairy cow's teats.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In certain embodiments, equipment portion <b>128</b> of milking box <b>120</b> may include a robotic attacher <b>150</b>, one or more preparation cups <b>166</b>, teat cups <b>168</b>, pumps <b>170</b>, receiver jars <b>172</b>, milk separation containers <b>174</b>, and/or any other suitable milking equipment. In certain embodiments, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may be suspended into equipment portion <b>128</b> from a rail <b>160</b>. Rail <b>160</b> may be generally located above the level of the udder of a dairy cow located in stall portion <b>122</b> such that the teats of the dairy cow may be accessible to robotic attacher <b>150</b> when suspended from rail <b>160</b>. For example, rail <b>160</b> may extend across the top of equipment portion <b>128</b> of milking box <b>120</b> and may be oriented substantially parallel to rear wall <b>124</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Robotic attacher <b>150</b> may be communicatively coupled to controller <b>200</b> (e.g., via a network facilitating wireless or wireline communication). Controller <b>200</b> may cause robotic attacher to attach certain milking equipment to the dairy cow's teats. For example, in certain embodiments, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may access a storage area <b>164</b> to retrieve preparation cups <b>166</b> and/or teat cups <b>168</b>. Preparation cups <b>166</b> may be adapted to clean the teats, stimulate the flow of milk, and discard fore milk from the teat (e.g., the first few millimeters of milk that may be dirty). Teat cups <b>168</b> may be adapted to extract milk from the dairy cow. Preparation cups <b>166</b> and/or teat cups <b>168</b> attached to extendable hoses may by hung within storage area <b>164</b> between milkings to protect the cups from manure and flies. When it is time to milk the dairy cow, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may pull preparation cups <b>166</b> from storage area <b>164</b> and attach them to the dairy cow one at a time, two at a time, or four at a time. After the teats have been prepared, preparation cups <b>166</b> may be removed and teat cups <b>168</b> may be attached one at a time, two at a time, or four at a time. Once the cups are attached, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may withdraw to prevent the dairy cow from causing accidental damage to the equipment, and the system may proceed with milking the dairy cow.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">During milking, pump <b>170</b> may pump good milk from teat cup <b>168</b> to receiver jar <b>172</b> to be stored at a cool temperature. Pump <b>170</b> may pump bad milk to milk separation container <b>174</b> to be discarded. Milk may be determined to be bad based on testing the milk and/or based on the particular dairy cow from which the milk has been extracted. For example, information retrieved from a database according to the dairy cow's identifier may indicate that the milk should be discarded because the dairy cow is ill or has recently calved.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In certain embodiments, robotic attacher <b>150</b> comprises a main arm <b>152</b>, a supplemental arm <b>154</b>, a gripping portion <b>156</b>, and a vision system <b>158</b>. In certain embodiments, the movement of main arm <b>152</b>, supplemental arm <b>154</b>, and gripping portion <b>156</b> may be varied in response to signals received from controller <b>200</b> (as described in further detail in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> below). Although the components of robotic attacher <b>150</b> are depicted and primarily described as oriented in a particular manner, the present disclosure contemplates the components having any suitable orientation, according to particular needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In order to obtain access to the dairy cow's teats, main arm <b>152</b>, supplemental arm <b>154</b>, and gripping portion <b>156</b> may work together to facilitate movement in three dimensions, for example, according to an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis. As illustrated, the x-axis extends in the direction of the dairy cow's length (e.g., from head-to-tail), the y-axis extends in the direction of the dairy cow's height, and the z-axis extends in the direction of the dairy cow's width.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Main arm <b>152</b> may comprise a vertical arm movably coupled to rail <b>160</b>. For example, a hydraulic cylinder may movably couple main arm <b>152</b> to rail <b>160</b>. Main arm <b>152</b> may traverse rail <b>160</b> to facilitate movement of robotic attacher <b>150</b> along the z-axis. Accordingly, rail <b>160</b> may comprise a track and rollers adapted to support the weight of robotic attacher <b>150</b> and to facilitate movement of main arm <b>152</b> back-and-forth along rail <b>160</b>. To prevent wires and hoses from interfering with the movement of main arm <b>152</b> along rail <b>160</b>, guides <b>162</b> may be used to loosely hold the wires and hoses in place. For example, guides <b>162</b> may comprise U-shaped brackets that allow the wires and hoses to extend a sufficient amount to accommodate movements of main arm <b>152</b>, but prevent the wires and hoses from dangling in the path of main arm <b>152</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Main arm <b>152</b> attaches to supplemental arm <b>154</b>. Supplemental arm <b>154</b> facilitates movements in any direction. That is, supplemental arm <b>154</b> moves in-and-out along the x-axis, up-and-down along the y-axis, and/or from side-to-side along the z-axis. Accordingly, supplemental arm may extend between the rear legs of the dairy cow located within stall portion <b>122</b> in order to attach milking equipment to the dairy cow. Supplemental arm <b>154</b> may comprise gripping portion <b>156</b>. Gripping portion <b>156</b> may grip a preparation cup <b>166</b> or a teat cup <b>168</b> for attachment to the dairy cow's teat. Gripping portion <b>156</b> may comprise a wrist adapted to perform fine movements, such as pivot and tilt movements, to navigate around the dairy cow's legs and to access the dairy cow's teats. To determine the location of the dairy cow's legs and teats, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may use vision system <b>158</b>. An example embodiment of vision system <b>158</b> is described with respect to <figref>FIG. 4</figref> below.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a detailed perspective view of an example of robotic attacher <b>150</b>, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. Robotic attacher <b>150</b> may include a main arm <b>152</b>, a supplemental arm <b>154</b>, a gripping portion <b>156</b>, and a vision system <b>158</b>. As described with respect to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may be communicatively coupled to controller <b>200</b>. Controller <b>200</b> may cause robotic attacher to retrieve a cup, such as preparation cup <b>166</b> or teat cup <b>168</b>, move the cup toward a teat of a dairy cow within milking box <b>120</b>, and attach the cup to the teat.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In general, the teats of the dairy cow may be relatively less visible when looking at the dairy cow from the rear and relatively more visible when looking at the dairy cow from the side. Vision system <b>158</b> may facilitate locating the teats from a position to the rear of the dairy cow. Vision system <b>158</b> may include multiple cameras, such as a first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>and a second camera <b>158</b><i>b</i>. In certain embodiments, cameras <b>158</b><i>a</i>, <b>158</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to robotic attacher <b>150</b> and may be positioned at any suitable location along main arm <b>152</b> or supplemental arm <b>154</b>. As an example, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to gripping portion <b>156</b> of supplemental arm <b>154</b> at a location proximate to the part of gripping portion <b>156</b> adapted to hold a teat cup, and first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to supplemental arm <b>154</b> at a location between second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>and main arm <b>152</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In operation, controller <b>200</b> may access a first image <b>176</b> generated by first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>(e.g., from memory module <b>240</b>) and use first image <b>176</b> to determine, using any suitable logic <b>220</b>, a reference point <b>178</b> proximate to the udder, which may then be stored (e.g., in memory module <b>240</b>). The reference point <b>178</b> may be defined relative to certain features of the dairy cow, such as the hind legs and/or the udder. Controller <b>200</b> may send a signal to robotic attacher <b>150</b> causing robotic attacher <b>150</b> to position second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>relative to the reference point <b>178</b>. Accordingly, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may have a consistent point of reference from one milking cycle to the next, which may allow the teats to be located efficiently. Controller <b>200</b> may access a second image <b>180</b> generated by second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>(e.g., from memory module <b>240</b>) in order to determine, using any suitable logic <b>220</b>, a location of a teat.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In certain embodiments, first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may comprise a three-dimensional camera adapted to generate a first image <b>176</b> depicting the rear of the dairy cow, including the hind legs and the udder. Using a three-dimensional camera may facilitate generating a relatively complete image of the rear of the dairy cow within approximately a couple of seconds (e.g., one second), which may be faster than the amount of time it would take for a two-dimensional camera to generate a similar image. In certain embodiments, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may comprise a two-dimensional camera adapted to generate a second image <b>180</b> depicting at least a portion of the udder to facilitate locating the teats. Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may facilitate locating the end of each teat with a relatively high degree of accuracy, such as within a few millimeters. The location of the teat may be used to instruct robotic attacher <b>150</b> where to attach the milking equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">First camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may begin generating the first image <b>176</b> in response to a signal from controller <b>200</b> indicating that the dairy cow is positioned proximate to the milking equipment. As an example, the signal may indicate that the rear of the dairy cow has been detected by the backplane <b>138</b> of the milking box <b>120</b>. First camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may begin generating the first image <b>176</b> from a starting point and may update the first image <b>176</b> in real-time as robotic attacher <b>150</b> approaches the dairy cow. The starting point may be determined according to a default position of robotic attacher <b>150</b> (e.g., a position determined relative to milking stall <b>122</b>). Thus, the starting point may be determined without the use of historical data associated with the particular dairy cow being milked. First camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may communicate the first image <b>176</b> to controller <b>200</b>, and controller <b>200</b> may use the image to locate main features of the dairy cow, such as the right hind leg, the left hind leg, the udder, and/or the tail.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Controller <b>200</b> may determine the reference point <b>178</b> based on the location of the main features of the dairy cow. The reference point <b>178</b> may be defined relative to certain features of the dairy cow, such as the hind legs and/or the udder. As an example, the reference point <b>178</b> may be defined between the hind legs and/or below the udder. For example, in certain embodiments, the reference point <b>178</b> may be located proximate to a mid-point of the udder. The mid-point of the udder may refer to a point generally located between the front teats and the rear teats in the x-direction and/or between the left teats and the right teats in the z-direction. In certain embodiments, the mid-point of the udder may be estimated prior to determining the precise location of the teats, for example, according to the general size and location of the udder. The reference point <b>178</b> may be spaced apart from the dairy cow in the y-direction to minimize the likelihood that second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>touches the dairy cow. For example, the reference point <b>178</b> may be located a few inches below the mid-point of the udder.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Controller <b>200</b> may communicate the reference point <b>178</b> and/or information describing the main features of the dairy cow to robotic attacher <b>150</b>. The reference point <b>178</b> may be used to position second camera <b>158</b><i>b</i>. The information describing the main features of the dairy cow may be used to prevent robotic attacher <b>150</b> from colliding with the dairy cow when navigating second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>toward the reference point <b>178</b>. Information describing the main features of the dairy cow may include the position of the hind legs, the space between the hind legs, the position of the udder, the height of the udder, the position of the tail, and/or other information. Once robotic attacher <b>150</b> has positioned second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>relative to the reference point <b>178</b>, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may begin scanning the udder.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In certain embodiments, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may determine where to look for one or more of the teats according to historical data. The historical data may be received from controller <b>200</b> and may describe a previously-determined location of the teats relative to the reference point <b>178</b>. The previously-determined location may be based on the location of the teats during one or more previous milking cycles. As an example, the previously-determined location may comprise the location of the teats during the most recent milking cycle. As another example, the previously-determined location may comprise an average of the locations of the teats during a number of previous milking cycles. As another example, the previously-determined location may comprise the location of the teats during a previous milking cycle in which the udder was likely to be as full of milk as the current milking cycle. For example, if eight hours have elapsed since the dairy cow was last milked, the previously-determined location may be determined from a previous milking cycle in which the dairy cow had not been milked for approximately eight hours. Referring to historical data may minimize the area that second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>must scan in order to locate the teat and may reduce the amount of time required to locate the teat.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may communicate the second image <b>180</b> to controller <b>200</b>, and controller <b>200</b> may access the second image <b>180</b> to locate the teats of the dairy cow. As described above, in certain embodiments, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may comprise a two-dimensional camera, such as a horizontal laser. If the horizontal laser may scan a portion of the udder other than the teats (e.g., a relatively even surface of the udder), the scan communicated to controller <b>200</b> may generally resemble a substantially solid line. If the horizontal laser scans a portion of the udder that includes the teats, the scan communicated to controller <b>200</b> may generally resemble a broken line depicting the teats and the spaces between the teats. As an example, controller <b>200</b> may determine that a teat has been located if the scan comprises a broken line in which a solid portion of the line generally corresponds to the width of a teat and the broken portions of the line generally correspond to the proportions of the space between teats.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In certain embodiments, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may further comprise a nozzle <b>182</b>. Nozzle <b>182</b> may be coupled to gripping portion <b>156</b>. Nozzle <b>182</b> may spray disinfectant on the teats of the dairy cow at the end of a milking cycle, that is, after the dairy cow has been milked and the teat cups have been removed. The disinfectant may be sprayed to prevent mastitis or other inflammation or infection. In certain embodiments, gripping portion may be operable to rotate 180Â° around the x-axis. During milking, second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may be generally oriented on top of gripping portion <b>156</b>, and nozzle <b>182</b> may be generally oriented underneath gripping portion <b>156</b> (i.e., opposite second camera <b>158</b><i>b</i>). Orienting nozzle <b>182</b> underneath gripping portion <b>156</b> during milking may prevent milk or other contaminants from accessing nozzle <b>182</b>. Once the milking has been completed, gripping portion <b>156</b> may rotate such that nozzle <b>182</b> may be generally oriented on top of gripping portion <b>156</b>, and second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may be generally oriented underneath gripping portion <b>156</b>. Orienting nozzle <b>182</b> on top of gripping portion <b>156</b> after milking may facilitate spraying the teats with disinfectant from nozzle <b>182</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example method <b>500</b> for milking a dairy cow using the example milking box <b>120</b> depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, milking box <b>120</b> may be positioned within enclosure <b>100</b>, and at least one of the gates <b>126</b> of stall portion <b>122</b> may be opened to allow the dairy cow to voluntarily enter milking box <b>120</b>. At step <b>502</b>, presence sensor <b>132</b> detects the presence of the dairy cow. Presence sensor <b>132</b> communicates a signal to controller <b>200</b> indicating the presence of the dairy cow has been detected. Controller <b>200</b> sends a signal to an actuator causing gates <b>126</b> to close at step <b>504</b>. Thus, the dairy cow is prevented from exiting the milking box. Gate closed sensor <b>134</b> determines that the gates are closed and communicates a gate-closed signal to controller <b>200</b>. In response to the gate-closed signal, controller <b>200</b> causes the milking procedure to proceed to the next step. For example, controller <b>200</b> sends a signal requesting identification sensor <b>136</b> to provide an identifier associated with the dairy cow.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">At step <b>506</b>, identification sensor <b>136</b> reads an ear tag, collar, or other identifier (e.g., an RFID signal) associated with the dairy cow. Identification sensor <b>136</b> communicates the identifier to controller <b>200</b> to facilitate determining the identity of the cow. At step <b>508</b>, controller <b>200</b> retrieves information associated with the particular dairy cow according to the determined identity of the dairy cow. For example, information may be retrieved from memory <b>240</b>. Controller <b>200</b> determines whether to proceed with milking the dairy cow at step <b>510</b>. The determination may be made according to the information associated with the dairy cow. For example, if the information indicates that the dairy cow is ill or that the dairy cow has already been milked in the current milking cycle, a determination may be made not to proceed with milking the dairy cow. Alternatively, if the information indicates that the dairy cow is healthy and that it is time to milk the dairy cow, a determination may be made to proceed with milking the dairy cow. If the dairy cow is to be milked, the method continues to step <b>512</b>. If the dairy cow is not to be milked, the method skips to step <b>548</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">At step <b>512</b>, controller <b>200</b> causes a dispenser to drop feed into feed bowl <b>130</b> and positions feed bowl <b>130</b>. In certain embodiments, feed bowl <b>130</b> may move toward the rear of the stall to encourage the dairy cow to back-up toward the milking equipment. Controller <b>200</b> determines that the dairy cow is positioned near the milking equipment at step <b>514</b>. For example, a signal received from backplane <b>138</b> of milking box <b>120</b> may be used to determine that the dairy cow is positioned near the milking equipment. The signal may indicate when the rear of the dairy cow touches a portion of backplane <b>138</b>. Upon determining the dairy cow is positioned near the milking equipment (e.g., toward the rear of the stall portion of the milking box), controller <b>200</b> instructs first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>to generate a first image <b>176</b> of the rear of the dairy cow at step <b>516</b>. In certain embodiments, first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may be positioned on robotic attacher <b>150</b>, and first camera <b>158</b><i>a </i>may begin generating the first image <b>176</b> in-flight, that is, as robotic attacher <b>150</b> retrieves a preparation cup <b>166</b> or teat cup <b>168</b> from storage and begins moving the cup toward the udder. At step <b>518</b>, controller <b>200</b> receives the first image <b>176</b>. The first image <b>176</b> includes main features of the dairy cow, such as the hind legs, the udder, and/or the tail. Controller <b>200</b> accesses the first image <b>176</b> to determine a reference point <b>178</b> at step <b>520</b>. As an example, the reference point <b>178</b> may comprise a point between the dairy cow's hind legs, a point below the dairy cow's udder, and/or a point proximate to a mid-point of the udder. The mid-point may refer to a point between a first teat and a second teat (e.g., between a left teat and a right teat and/or between a front teat and a rear teat).</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">At step <b>522</b>, controller <b>200</b> sends a signal causing robotic attacher <b>150</b> to position second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>relative the reference point <b>178</b>. Controller <b>200</b> communicates historical data to second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>at step <b>524</b>. The historical data may comprise data retrieved from a database that indicates a previously-determined location of the teats during a previous milking cycle. The previously-determined location may be described relative to the reference point <b>178</b>. The method proceeds to step <b>526</b> where controller <b>200</b> sends a signal causing second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>to generate a second image <b>180</b>. Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may generate the second image <b>180</b> by scanning a portion of the udder indicated by the historical data. Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may scan the whole teat to facilitate identifying the angle of the teat and the point attachment. At step <b>528</b>, the controller <b>200</b> receives the second image <b>180</b> from the second camera. Controller <b>200</b> accesses the second image <b>180</b> to determine the location of the teats at step <b>530</b>. The teats may be located in any suitable manner, such as one at a time, two at a time, or four at a time.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Upon determining the location of the teats, controller <b>200</b> causes robotic attacher <b>150</b> to attach one or more preparation cups <b>166</b> at step <b>532</b>. Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may continue to scan the teat while the preparation cup is being attached. Continuing to scan the teat may allow for efficient attachment of the preparation cup. In addition, continuing to scan the teat may allow the preparation cup to be attached at a suitable angle, with the mouthpiece centered on the teat, to prevent folding the teat into the preparation cup. Vacuum pressure may be used to hold the preparation cups in place. Preparation cup <b>166</b> facilitates preparing the teat at step <b>534</b>. Preparation may include cleaning the teat, stimulating the flow of milk, and discarding fore milk from the teat. After each of the teats have been prepared, preparation cups <b>166</b> may be removed at step <b>536</b>. For example, the vacuum pressure may be released to remove the preparation cups and the preparation cups may be returned to the storage area.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The method continues to step <b>538</b>, where controller <b>200</b> causes robotic attacher <b>150</b> to attach a teat cup <b>168</b>. For example, teat cup <b>168</b> may be retrieved from storage area <b>164</b> and navigated to the teat. Second camera <b>158</b><i>b </i>may continue to scan the teat while the teat cup <b>168</b> is being attached to ensure proper placement of the teat cups. Vacuum pressure may be used to attach the teat cup <b>168</b>. A sensor may be used to determine the vacuum pressure associated with each teat cup <b>168</b>. If the vacuum level is low, it may indicate that teat cup <b>168</b> has fallen off and needs to be reattached. In certain embodiments, additional teat cups <b>168</b> may be attached by re-performing steps <b>522</b>-<b>530</b> to locate additional teats.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Once teat cups <b>168</b> have been attached to all four teats, robotic attacher <b>150</b> may retract and the method may proceed to step <b>540</b> to extract milk from the dairy cow. As an example, milk may be extracted by applying pulsation to the teat cup. A sensor may monitor the flow of milk. If the flow becomes low, it may be determined whether teat cup <b>168</b> should be removed or reattached. For example, if teat cup <b>168</b> has been attached for at least approximately one-and-a-half minutes and/or the amount of milk extracted is consistent with previous milking cycles, it may be determined that teat cup <b>168</b> should be removed, otherwise, it may be determined that teat cup <b>168</b> should be reattached. When it is determined that teat cup <b>168</b> should be removed, controller <b>200</b> initiates step <b>542</b> to remove teat cups <b>168</b>. For example, controller <b>200</b> may send a signal causing the vacuum pressure to be released to allow teat cups <b>168</b> to drop from the teats. Teat cups <b>168</b> may be returned to storage area <b>164</b> by retracting hoses attached to teat cups <b>168</b> or by any other suitable method. Controller <b>200</b> then sends a signal to robotic attacher <b>150</b> to cause gripping portion <b>156</b> to rotate at step <b>544</b> in order to orient nozzle <b>182</b> toward the teat. The method applies disinfectant to the teat at step <b>546</b> by spraying the disinfectant through nozzle <b>182</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">At step <b>548</b>, controller <b>200</b> determines which gate(s) <b>126</b> to open. Selectively opening gates <b>126</b> may allow the dairy cow to be sorted into a particular region <b>110</b> of enclosure <b>100</b>. The dairy cow may be sorted if its milk tested bad, if it failed to produce a sufficient amount of milk, if information retrieved from a database indicates the dairy cow should be sorted, or for other suitable reasons. Controller <b>200</b> sends a signal causing an actuator to open the selected gate(s) at step <b>550</b>. In certain embodiments, a prod may be used to encourage the dairy cow to exit the milking box. The dairy cow exits the milking box and the method ends.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example method <b>600</b> for installation of milking box <b>120</b>, according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure. The method may begin by positioning walls <b>124</b> in order to define stall portion <b>122</b>. For example, the method positions a front wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>at step <b>602</b>. The method proceeds to step <b>604</b> where a rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>is positioned substantially parallel to front wall <b>124</b><i>a</i>. Rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>may be spaced apart from front wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>a suitable distance to accommodate a dairy cow. At step <b>606</b>, a first side wall <b>124</b><i>b </i>is positioned to extend between front wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>and rear wall <b>124</b><i>c</i>. The first side wall may include one or more gates, such as an entry gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and an exit gate <b>126</b><i>b</i>. The method proceeds to step <b>608</b> to position a second side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>to extend between front wall <b>124</b><i>a </i>and rear wall <b>124</b><i>c</i>. Second side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>may be spaced apart from first side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>in order to accommodate a dairy livestock within stall portion <b>122</b>. Second side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>may or may not include gates <b>126</b>. For example, in certain embodiments, second side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>may comprise a second entry gate <b>126</b><i>a </i>and a second exit gate <b>126</b><i>b</i>. In alternative embodiments, second side wall <b>124</b><i>d </i>may be positioned adjacent a second milking box and may define a boundary between milking box <b>120</b> and the adjacent milking box. In step <b>610</b>, an equipment portion <b>128</b> is positioned to the rear of milking box <b>120</b>, adjacent rear wall <b>124</b><i>c</i>. Rear wall <b>124</b><i>c </i>may comprise a backplane <b>138</b> adapted to physically contact a mid-flank portion of the dairy livestock when the dairy livestock is positioned proximate to equipment portion <b>128</b> of milking box <b>120</b>.</p>

As a result, milking boxes <b>120</b> in multiple milking box stall clusters <b>121</b> may be used to sort dairy cows into particular regions <b>110</b> by controlling the opening/closing of each gate <b>126</b> (e.g., in response to signals from a controller <b>200</b>, as described above). Depending on the configuration of milking box stall clusters <b>121</b>, varying numbers of regions <b>110</b> may be created. <figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> illustrate example configurations of multiple milking box stall clusters <b>121</b> forming two regions <b>110</b>. <figref>FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates an example configuration of multiple milking box stall clusters <b>121</b> forming four regions <b>110</b>.

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Because in some embodiments various milking boxes <b>120</b> may face in different directions, the appropriate gates <b>126</b> to open in order to sort a cow into an appropriate region <b>110</b> will depend upon the orientation of a particular milking box <b>120</b>.

On the other hand, in order to sort a cow in milking box <b>120</b><i>b </i>into region <b>110</b><i>b</i>, exit gate <b>126</b><i>b </i>may open on the cow's left side, because milking box <b>120</b><i>b </i>faces in the opposite direction as milking box <b>120</b><i>a</i>, as does a cow inside each respective milking box.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In certain embodiments, an appropriate milking box <b>120</b> to use in order to sort a cow into an appropriate region <b>110</b> will depend upon the arrangement of milking boxes <b>120</b> and milking box stall clusters <b>121</b>, as well as the location of a particular milking box <b>120</b> within that arrangement. Referring to <figref>FIG. 7C</figref>, for example, milking box <b>120</b><i>g </i>may not be used to sort a cow into region <b>110</b><i>b</i>, as gates <b>126</b> on both sides of milking box <b>120</b><i>g </i>are within region <b>110</b><i>a</i>. However, any of milking boxes <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b</i>, <b>120</b><i>c</i>, or <b>120</b><i>d </i>may be used to sort a cow from region <b>110</b><i>a </i>into region <b>110</b><i>b</i>, as all four milking boxes have access to both regions.</p>
