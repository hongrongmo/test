      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a draw bar of a luggage case, and more particularly to a handle structure for a draw bar of a luggage case.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Luggage cases are mostly provided with a draw bar to be pulled by a user, and the draw bar is usually retractile. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional luggage case <b>10</b> comprises a draw bar <b>11</b>. The draw bar <b>11</b> includes a rod portion <b>12</b> which and a handle <b>13</b> disposed at the end of the rod portion <b>12</b>. On the handle <b>13</b> is provided a press button <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The luggage case needs to be put away when not in use, so the rod portion <b>12</b> of the draw bar <b>11</b> can be pushed into the luggage case <b>10</b> and locked therein, which not only saves storage space, but also prevent rupture of the draw bar <b>11</b> caused by unexpected collision. The draw bar <b>11</b> can also be automatically extended out of the luggage case <b>10</b> by pressing the press button <b>14</b>, so that the user can tow the luggage case.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is to be noted that the draw bar should be pushed back into the luggage case for luggage check in. However, the draw bar would be projected out of the luggage case when the press button is touched by accident, which is likely to cause rupture.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">To solve this problem, some of the luggage cases are provided with a protection cover to cover the press button, so as to prevent the press button from being pressed by accident. However, this also makes the luggage case inconvenient to use, since it has to push the protection cover back and forth between the covered and uncover positions, every time the draw bar needs to be pulled out or pushed into the luggage case.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a handle structure for a draw bar of a luggage case, wherein the possibility that the draw bar will automatically pop out of the luggage case when the press portion is accidentally pressed can be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">To achieve the above objective, a handle structure for a draw bar of a luggage case, the draw bar comprises a rod portion which is capable of sliding in and out of the luggage case, and the handle structure comprises a handle, a handle casing, a push member, and a connecting device. The handle is provided with two control members, each of control members includes a movable member which is pivoted to a stationary member via a pivot point, each of the movable members includes a press portion and a reaction portion which are located at two sides of the pivot point. The handle casing is fixed around a periphery of the handle and defines a press space to hold the press portions of the handle, and the press space is formed with an open end at the handle casing. The push member includes a head portion and a shaft portion, the head portion is disposed in the handle casing and connected to the reaction portions, and the shaft portion extends out of the handle casing. The connecting device has one end fixed to the rod portion of the luggage case, and the shaft portion of the push member is inserted in another end of the connecting device. When the press portion is subjected to a force in a direction, the corresponding reaction portion of the movable member will be moved toward that direction, meanwhile the reaction portion will push the push member to move the shaft portion toward the rod portion of the draw bar of the luggage casing.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The handle structure for the draw bar of the luggage case in accordance with the present invention offers the following advantages: 1. the handle casing protects the handle of the draw bar from unexpectedly popping out of the luggage case. 2. The handle is able to pivot with respect to the luggage case, allowing the user to tow at a comfortable angle. 3. The present invention is provided with two control members, therefore, any user who is left or right handed can easily handle one of the control members with one hand.</p>
