    <summary>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present system relates to a surgical endoscopic microinstrument system and, more particularly, to surgical microinstruments with a camera for minimally-invasive surgical procedures and a method of operation thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Typically, minimally-invasive endoscopic surgical procedures require several openings such as an opening for insertion of a viewing scope to view a region of interest (ROI) and a separate opening for insertion of a surgical tool such as a cutter, etc. Unfortunately, this necessitates additional surgical openings to access the ROI which is undesirable. Additionally, it is difficult for a surgeon to view a desired portion or view of the ROI while manipulating the surgical tool. Accordingly, the present systems and methods overcome deficiencies of the prior art endoscopes.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The system(s), device(s), method(s), arrangements(s), user interface(s), computer program(s), processes, etc. (hereinafter each of which will be referred to as system, unless the context indicates otherwise), described herein address problems in prior art systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In accordance with embodiments of the present system, there is disclosed an endoscopic microinstrument, comprising a substantially rigid proximal body having first and second ends, a channel between the first and second ends; a substantially rigid distal end portion movably coupled to the body and having first and second ends; a tool located at the first end of the substantially rigid distal end portion and comprising first and second anvils; first and second handles coupled to the body, at least one of the handles further coupled to the tool and configured to control actuation of at least one of the first and second anvils; a camera coupled to, and situated to a side of, the substantially rigid distal end portion, the camera configured to obtain images of a region-of-interest; and an end portion controller coupled to the proximal body and configured to rotate the substantially rigid distal end portion relative to the substantially rigid proximal body to angulate and/or rotate the tool and the camera together or separately so that a line of sight of the camera is along a tool axis passing through the tool.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The endoscopic microinstrument may include a flexible portion which couples the substantially rigid distal end portion to the substantially rigid proximal body and is situated between the substantially rigid body and the substantially rigid end portion. Further, the end portion controller may be further configured to rotate the camera relative to the substantially rigid distal end portion. It should be understood that a device that is configure to perform a function is also able to actually perform the function.

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a partially cutaway side view of a portion of an endoscopic microinstrument <b>100</b> operating in accordance with embodiments of the present system. The endoscopic microinstrument <b>100</b> may include one or more of a body <b>102</b>, a support portion <b>105</b>, a flexible portion <b>122</b>, a distal end portion <b>106</b>, a tool <b>108</b>, and a camera <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The body <b>102</b> may define a longitudinal axis La and may include proximal and distal ends <b>103</b> and <b>101</b>, respectively. The body <b>102</b> may include a channel <b>109</b> situated between the proximal and distal ends <b>103</b> and <b>101</b>, respectively, and which extends along the longitudinal axis La of the body <b>102</b>. At least one control cable <b>138</b> may pass through the channel <b>109</b>. Further, in accordance with some embodiments, the endoscope may be and/or include different types of instruments, such as without limitation, a laparoscope, an ultrasonic aspirator, a coagulator, a laser(s), a gripper, a cutter, a dissector, and/or other devices configured to perform desired operations at the ROI. Control of the various tools and/or cameras located at the tip or distal end of the instrument may be via wired or wireless connections to a controller located at the proximal end , where such controls include activation such as turning devices on/off or moving cutters to perform a scissor action, tip movement such as angulation of the tool(s) and camera(s), alone and/or in combination(s), that are located at the endoscopes tip or distal end to sweep in a desired 3D direction, e.g., up, down, right, left, rotation along instrument axis such as rotating a pair or scissors for cutting vertically and horizontally and in any other position therebetween.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The distal end portion <b>106</b> may be coupled to the body <b>102</b> using any suitable method so that it articulates, e.g., about at least a <b>120</b> degree arc (relative to a longitudinal axis La of the body <b>102</b>) as illustrated by arrow <b>115</b> to provide side and/or rear views which are other than a front view provided by the camera when it is directed along the longitudinal axis La. Accordingly, the distal end portion <b>106</b> may be coupled to the body <b>102</b> using a flexible and/or elastic member such as the flexible portion <b>122</b> as will be discussed herein below. The distal end portion <b>106</b> may include a channel <b>107</b> through which the at least one control cable <b>138</b> may pass. The distal channel <b>107</b> communicates with the body channel <b>109</b> of the body <b>102</b>, and may be of different size and/or shape to accommodate and/or go around objects, such as a camera storage bin or well (<b>1676</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 17-18</figref>) for storing the camera <b>110</b>, in the case of a retractable/extendable camera as will be described in connection with the embodiments shown in <figref>FIGS. 12-18</figref>, where similar distal and body channels are provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The distal end portion <b>106</b> may further be coupled to the tool <b>108</b> and the camera <b>110</b> using any suitable method such as screwable mounts, friction fits, slip rings, etc. Additionally the tip may further rotate <b>360</b> degrees circumferentially around the La. The tip may be rotatable on its own, and/or may be rotated by rotating the entire endoscope which is typically located in a channel or lumen inserted in the incision opening and pushed toward the ROI, where various instruments may be inserted, retracted, and otherwise moved, e.g., rotated in this channel as necessary to perform a desired procedures. Such various hybrid instruments include the endoscopic microinstruments according to the present systems that include both at least one tool and at least one camera.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The tool <b>108</b> may include any suitable surgical tool such as a gripper, a cutter (shown), a dissector, an ultrasonic aspirator, a coagulator, a laser(s), etc. In accordance with some embodiments, the tool may include first and second anvils which may be configured for gripping, cutting, dissecting, coagulating, etc., as may be desired. For example, in accordance with some embodiments, the cutter may include first and second cutting anvils <b>124</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, (generally <b>124</b>-x) at least one of which may articulate and/or rotate relative to the other (as illustrated by arrow <b>127</b>) and which may be coupled to a base <b>131</b>. The base <b>131</b> of the tool <b>108</b> may be coupled to the distal end portion <b>106</b> using any suitable method. In yet other embodiments, it is envisioned that at least one of the anvils (e.g., at least one of the first and second anvils <b>124</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>124</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively may be fixedly attached to the base <b>131</b>. Further, it is also envisioned that in accordance with some embodiments, the first and second anvils may be rotatably coupled to each other using a simple- or complex-type hinge assembly (e.g., providing simple or compound tool actions, respectively). Thus, at least one of the first and second anvils may be rotatably coupled to the base via the hinge assembly. Further, at least one of the first and second anvils <b>124</b>-<i>x </i>which is movably coupled to the base <b>131</b> may be further coupled to the at least one control cable <b>138</b> so that the at least one control cable <b>138</b> may transfer an activation force to the anvil coupled thereto as will be described herein below. However, in yet other embodiments, an opening or closing assembly (e.g., for a compound action type tool) may be provided to open and/or close at least one of the first and second anvils <b>124</b>-<i>x. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The flexible portion <b>122</b> may include first and second ends <b>123</b> and <b>125</b>, respectively. The first end <b>123</b> of the flexible portion <b>122</b> may be coupled to the distal end <b>101</b> of the body <b>102</b>. The second end <b>123</b> of the flexible portion <b>122</b> may be coupled to the distal end portion <b>106</b>. The flexible portion <b>122</b> may include at least one channel through which the at least one control cable <b>138</b> may pass. Further, the flexible portion <b>122</b> may include one or more simple or complex hinges (e.g., simple or compound hinges) which may provide for a desired amount of articulation and/or rotation of the second end <b>125</b> relative to the first end <b>123</b> of the flexible portion <b>122</b>. In yet other embodiments, the flexible portion <b>122</b> may be formed integrally with at least one of the body <b>102</b> and the distal end portion <b>106</b>. In yet other embodiments, it is envisioned that the flexible portion <b>122</b> may include an elastic hinge. Further, it is also envisioned that some embodiments may provide a biasing member to bias the flexible portion <b>122</b> in a desired direction and/or orientation relative to the body <b>102</b>. Thus, for example, the biasing members may provide a returning mechanism to the distal end portion <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The support portion <b>105</b> may include a channel <b>109</b> through which the at least one control cable <b>138</b> may pass. The support portion <b>105</b> may be coupled to the body <b>102</b> using any suitable method or methods such as using a screwable mount. However, in yet other embodiments, it is envisioned that the support portion <b>105</b> may be coupled to the body <b>102</b> using any suitable method such as a bayonet-type mount, a friction fit, etc. However, in yet further embodiments, it is envisioned that the support portion <b>105</b> may be formed integrally with the body <b>102</b>. The support portion <b>105</b> may include at least one gripping members such as first and second handles <b>112</b> and <b>116</b>, respectively. The first and second handles <b>112</b> and <b>116</b> may each include an opening suitable for receiving at least one digit (e.g., finger) of a user, if desired, such as openings <b>114</b> and <b>118</b>. At least one of the gripping members <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> may be coupled to a corresponding one of the at least one control cable <b>138</b> so as to transfer a force thereto. This force may then be transferred to open or close at least one of the first and second anvils <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b> which is coupled to the at least one control cable <b>138</b>. Thus, when a user opens or closes the first and second handles <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, the first and second anvils <b>124</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>124</b>-<b>2</b> may be opened or closed, respectively, or vice versa. Thus, a scissor action of the first and second handles <b>112</b> and <b>116</b>, respectively (as shown by arrow <b>137</b>), may be used to open and close the first and second anvils of the tool <b>108</b>. This movement may provide a pinching force and/or a cutting force, depending upon a type of the tool <b>108</b> (e.g., scissors, pinchers, grippers, dissectors, etc.) provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The support portion <b>105</b> may further include an end portion controller <b>120</b> which may be movably (e.g., rotatably, slidably, etc.) mounted to the support portion <b>105</b> (e.g., using any suitable method such as a support pin) so as to control movement of the distal end portion <b>106</b> in 3-dimensions (3D). Accordingly, the end portion controller <b>120</b> may be coupled to the distal end portion <b>106</b> via a link such as at least one end portion control cable <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) or the like which can transmit a force from the end portion controller <b>120</b> to the distal end portion <b>106</b> so as to deflect the distal end portion <b>106</b>. For example, if the end portion controller <b>120</b> is moved along arrow <b>121</b> to be positioned in position A, the distal end portion <b>106</b> may be correspondingly positioned in position Aâ², and if the end portion controller <b>120</b> is positioned in position B, the distal end portion <b>106</b> may be correspondingly positioned in position Bâ².</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A friction and/or locking mechanism may be provided to hold the distal end portion <b>106</b> in a desired position during use. For example, in accordance with some embodiments, the end portion controller <b>120</b> may be depressed slightly (in the position shown by arrow <b>133</b>) to unlock it and may be automatically locked when no longer depressed. Further, friction may be provided by a clutch (e.g., mechanical, electromechanical, etc.) if desired. Moreover, the at least one end portion control cable <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> may include a casing which may be configured to engage the at least one end portion control cable <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> to provide a desired amount of friction, if desired. It is also envisioned that a biasing member may provided to bias the end portion controller <b>120</b> and/or the distal end portion <b>106</b> coupled thereto to a desired position.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In one embodiment, a micro-motor may be provided to provide movement, such as articulation and/or rotation, of the flexible portion <b>120</b>. For example, in addition to rotation, the flexible portion <b>120</b> may also be extended or retracted under the control of the controller <b>120</b> for more precise positioning of the tool <b>108</b> and/or camera <b>110</b>. The motor may be operably coupled, e.g., via wire(s) and/or wireless communication link(s), to the controller <b>120</b> for controlling the motor to provide movement, articulation, and/or rotation of the flexible portion <b>120</b>. Thus, mechanical linkages maybe replaced with electronic wired or wireless linkages as in âfly by wireâ systems using sensors, actuators, motors, servos and the like. For example, the motor may be located at the distal end <b>101</b> of the body <b>102</b>, and may be any type of motor such as a continuous or stepper motor, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The camera <b>110</b> may include any suitable imaging camera such as a video camera, a still camera, etc. which may obtain image information and transmit the image information to a controller of the endoscopic microinstrument <b>100</b> for further processing. The image information may include raw image information, processed image information, and/or metadata (e.g., time stamps, etc.). The camera includes a processor to process received images to form image signals or data and transmit the image signals or data to the system controller. The camera <b>110</b> may communicate with the system controller using any suitable wireless communication method. For example, the camera <b>110</b> may use a WiFi, Bluetoothâ¢ communication methods or the like to transmit and/or receive information from a central controller and/or display for rendering. However, in yet other embodiments, a wired communication method such as using conductive wires and/or an optical fiber communication method may be used. The camera <b>110</b> may have a line-of-sight (LOS) which may extend in the direction of the longitudinal axis (La) of the body <b>102</b>. The camera <b>110</b> may be fixedly or movably coupled to the distal end portion <b>106</b> via at least one camera support <b>132</b>. However, in yet other embodiments, it is envisioned that the camera <b>110</b> may be coupled directly to the distal end portion <b>106</b>. In yet other embodiments, a user interface (UI) may be provided to control orientation of the camera <b>110</b> relative to the distal end portion <b>106</b>.</p>

However, the biasing member <b>153</b> may bias the end portion controller <b>120</b> in a direction shown by up arrow <b>133</b>â² to mesh the pin <b>129</b> into (teeth of) the toothed plate <b>159</b> so as to lock the pin <b>129</b> and thus, lock the end portion controller <b>120</b> in a desired (rotational) position along arrow <b>121</b>. Depressing on the end portion controller <b>120</b> in the direction shown by down arrow <b>133</b> causes the end portion controller <b>120</b> to move down in the same direction and the pin <b>129</b> to disengage from the toothed plate <b>159</b>. Accordingly, the end portion controller <b>120</b> may then be moved (e.g., rotatably along arrow <b>121</b>) to a desired position.

        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> shows a top perspective view of a portion of an endoscopic microinstrument <b>800</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present system. The endoscopic microinstrument <b>800</b> is essentially similar to the endoscopic microinstrument <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and may include a body <b>802</b>, a distal end portion <b>806</b>, a flexible portion <b>822</b>, a tool <b>808</b> (e.g., a surgical instrument or any other instrument that performs a designated function(s)), a camera <b>810</b>, a support portion <b>805</b>, and an end portion controller <b>120</b>, which may be similar to the body <b>102</b>, the distal end portion <b>106</b>, the flexible portion <b>122</b>, the tool <b>108</b> endoscopic microinstrument, the camera <b>110</b>, the support portion <b>105</b>, and the end portion controller <b>120</b> of <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.

      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The camera <b>810</b> and tool <b>808</b> may be rotated together in unison or rotated independently/separately of each other. For example, the rotational movement of the camera <b>810</b> may be controlled by rotational movement of the end portion controller <b>820</b> about a longitudinal axis L<sub>A </sub>of the body <b>802</b>, as shown by arrow <b>876</b>â². The tool <b>808</b> may also be rotated independently of the camera rotation <b>876</b>, such as using rotational couplers near the distal tool <b>808</b> and the proximal end portion controller <b>820</b> that rotate the tool <b>800</b> about the longitudinal axis, L<sub>P </sub><b>871</b>, or L<sub>A </sub><b>877</b>, similar to the rotational couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1391</b> that will be described in connection with the further embodiments below, such as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref> for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">For example, the distal rotational coupler (e.g., shown as reference numeral <b>1390</b> in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>) may rotate in response to rotation of the proximal rotational coupler (e.g., shown as reference numeral <b>1391</b> in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>). Alternatively, the distal and proximal rotational couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1390</b> may each be independently controlled, such as in response to control signals from a UI or a moving joystick(s), for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Returning to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the end portion controller <b>820</b> may be moved about a transverse axis T<sub>A </sub>as illustrated by arrow <b>875</b>, which motion may control movement of the distal end portion <b>806</b> similarly to that described with reference to the endoscopic microinstrument <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and described above. For example, moving the end portion controller <b>820</b> along arrow <b>875</b> moves the distal end portion <b>806</b> by moving the flexible portion <b>822</b>, e.g., to move between positions Aâ² and Bâ² shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in response to moving the end portion controller <b>820</b> along arrow <b>875</b> (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>), similar to arrow <b>121</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, rotation of the end portion controller <b>820</b> about its transverse axis T<sub>A </sub>(as shown by arrow <b>875</b>) may cause the camera <b>810</b> to articulate and/or rotate about its longitudinal axis Lcp as illustrated by arrow <b>871</b> as will be described in connection with <figref>FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Further, the distal tip may rotationally move independently of the shaft and the camera.

Further, a locking mechanism may be provided to lock the camera into a desired position. It should be noted that the one or more control cables or links maybe mechanical (e.g., using cable, linkages, gears, pivots, levers, etc.) or electronic links, such as using wired or wireless communication among transceivers of control devices (e.g., end portion controller <b>820</b>, retraction controller <b>1370</b>, joystick, etc.) and controlled devices (e.g., camera <b>810</b> and or tool <b>808</b>).</p>

The end portion controller <b>820</b> may extend through an opening <b>819</b> in the support portion <b>805</b> and/or the body <b>802</b>. A cover <b>845</b> may be provided to seal the opening <b>819</b>, if desired. A dual motion linkage <b>857</b> may provide for motion of the end portion controller <b>820</b> about the longitudinal axis L<sub>A </sub>of the body <b>802</b> (which corresponds with the longitudinal axis L<sub>A </sub>of the at end portion controller <b>820</b> for the sake of clarity) as illustrate by arrow <b>877</b>, and about the transverse axis T<sub>A </sub>of the end portion controller <b>820</b> as illustrated by arrow <b>875</b>. The motion of the end portion controller <b>820</b> about the longitudinal axis L<sub>A </sub>of the body <b>802</b> may be translated to movement of the end portion <b>806</b> as discussed with respect to the laparoscope <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. However, the motion of the end portion controller <b>820</b> about its transverse axis T<sub>A </sub>(as shown by arrow <b>875</b>) may cause the camera <b>810</b> to articulate and/or rotate about its longitudinal axis Lcp as illustrated by arrow <b>871</b>. This latter motion may be accomplished by transferring a force from the end portion controller <b>820</b> to the camera <b>810</b> via a linkage <b>881</b> (e.g., a cable) which coupled the camera <b>110</b> to the end portion controller <b>820</b>. Further, the camera <b>810</b> may include a rotational support such as a cylinder <b>880</b> which may slidably and rotationally engage an interior portion of the end portion <b>806</b> so as to locate the camera <b>810</b> in a desired rotational position about the camera longitudinal axis Lcp. Control linkages and/or cables may pass through the cylinder <b>880</b>. At least one control cable <b>838</b> (only a portion of which is shown for the sake of clarity) may pass through a channel of the body <b>802</b> and/or end portion <b>806</b> and may be similar to the at least one control cable <b>138</b> and may be operative to control operation of a tool of the endoscopic microinstrument <b>800</b>.</p>

The at least one control cable <b>838</b> may pass through the channel <b>807</b> of the distal end portion <b>806</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In accordance with other embodiments, the camera may be attached to the distal end portion using hook-loop fasteners such as snap ties, Velcroâ¢, and the like. Further, more than one tool may be coupled simultaneously to the distal end portion for providing different functions, such as cutters for cutting, lasers or bipolar electricity for cauterizing, ultrasonic aspiration for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Further, the endoscopic microinstrument <b>800</b> may include a light source and/or light guide (e.g., a light ring <b>891</b> which may be placed in the vicinity of the tool <b>808</b> and/or camera <b>810</b> to provide illumination of a working area) to provide illumination for the camera <b>810</b>. Moreover, a power source such as an internal and/or external power source, e.g., a battery which may be rechargeable, may be provided to operate various portions of the endoscopic microinstrument such as the camera <b>810</b>, the light source, communication links, the coagulator, lasers, etc. The light source may be provided at the proximal end <b>103</b> of the body <b>102</b> where a light guide, e.g., fiber optic cable, may be connected between the proximal light source and distal light ring <b>891</b>, where the light ring <b>891</b> is a termination of the light guide outcoupling the light traveling in the light guide for exit from the light ring <b>891</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In accordance with yet other embodiments, the camera may be stored within a camera well of the distal end portion and may extend out of the camera well (e.g., pop up) for use, and retract within the camera well to minimize size for or during insertion through a minimally-invasive surgical opening and retrieval from the surgical opening as may be desired. This may reduce the diameter of the endoscopic microinstrument of the present system for insertion through the minimally invasive surgical opening and/or channel which may be pre-inserted in the opening to the ROI, which desired instruments including the present endoscopic microinstrument may be inserted and moved in the channel. For example, during minimally invasive brain surgery, no channel is used where the endoscopic microinstrument and a further instrument(s), as necessary, are inserted through an opening made in the skull. By contrast, in other types of surgery, a channel in inserted in an opening or incision, where the channel may extend up to the ROI and where the present endoscopic microinstrument and further instrument, as necessary, are inserted through the channel.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Illustratively, the surgical opening and/or channel may have a diameter of about 12 mm-15 mm, the camera may have a diameter of about 4 mm with a light ring around the camera, and less than 3 mm (such as 2.89 mm) without a light ring. Thus there is at least 8 mm-11 mm left for other instruments, including the hybrid instrument that the camera attaches to in accordance with the present endoscopic microinstruments and systems. If the instrument has its own light ring for illumination, then there is no need for the camera to also have a light ring. Of course, in the embodiment where the camera is retractable inside the instrument (see <figref>FIG. 15</figref>), more space is available in the channel for insertion of other instruments. For example, a retraction assembly such as a scissor jack assembly, a parallel arm jack assembly or non-parallel (e.g., short-long) arm jack assembly, a rotatable assembly, or the like may position the camera to a desired location from storage within a camera storage area.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In a further embodiment, an imaging endoscope having only the camera is inserted in the opening and/or channel/cannula and located at the 12 o'clock position, and below the imaging endoscope, the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument as described, having a combination of both a tool and its own camera, is inserted. In this case, as the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument has its own light ring for providing illumination of the ROI, the camera of the imaging endoscope does not need a light ring, thus further reducing its size, such as from 4 mm to less than 3 mm in diameter, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The imaging endoscope and the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument may be coupleable together, such as through a guide/rail system, where one of the imaging endoscope or the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, e.g., the imaging endoscope, has a guide and the other of the imaging endoscope or hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, e.g., the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, has a complementary rail that fits in the guide of the imaging endoscope and slides along the guide until the flexible part of the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument reaches and extends past the guide at the distal end of the imaging endoscope so that the flexible part allows movement of the combination of both tool and camera of the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, as described, for viewing and performing a desired operation, such as cutting, ablation via heat, radio frequency (RF) or laser, aspiration, ultrasound agitation, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">It should be understand that the locations of guide and rail may be variable where the imaging endoscope having one of the guide and rail slides along the other of the guide and rail located at a side or bottom of the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, instead of being located at a top of the endoscopic microinstrument. Similarly, the locations of the imaging endoscope and the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument may be variable, such as having the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument being above, instead of below, the imaging endoscope. Similarly, in the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument including the combination of tool and camera, the number and locations of the tool(s) and camera(s) may vary, such as having one or more cameras located (or extended from) below or at side(s) of the tool(s), instead of being located, or extended from, above the tool. Thus, the imaging device including a camera, optics, filters, detectors and processors, maybe hanging on the underside of the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument, including having the camera storage at this underside.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The two imaging devices, such as the stand-alone camera-<b>1</b> on the imaging endoscope and camera-2 on the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument that includes a combination tool and camera, maybe be 2D and/or 3D cameras in any combination, such as to provide 2D or 3D birds-eye or panoramic reference images using camera-1 and to provide 2D or 3D working images using camera-2 that are more detailed than the panoramic reference images and/or more directed towards or more focused on the ROI where the tool is to be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The imaging device(s) at the distal end of the imaging endoscope and/or the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument may include optics, detectors, filters such as the Conjugated Multi-Bandpass Filters (CMBFs) for 3D-visualization, CMOS or CCD detectors and processors to process images detected by the detectors and provide video signals to a display(s) or monitor(s) for 2D and/or 3D display of images captured by the imaging device(s) for viewing by a viewer(s). Imaging devices for capturing 3D images include those having CMBFs such as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2011/0115882 and 2014/0085420 to Shahinian et al., which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">During a surgical procedure, the imaging endoscope may be fixed to provide a birds-eye or panoramic reference view, while the camera and tool combination of the hybrid endoscopic microinstrument are moved in a 3-dimensional (3D) direction, e.g., up, down, right left, front, back. Both images from the camera of the imaging endoscope and the camera of the endoscopic microinstrument are displayed on a screen in any desired format, such as a picture-in-picture format (PIP), for example, where the birds-eye or panoramic reference view provided by the camera of the imaging endoscope shows the tool or the combination of the tool and camera of the endoscopic microinstrument.</p>

As shown in <figref>FIGS. 12-13</figref>, the tool <b>1308</b> may include a base <b>1331</b> which may include a rotational coupler <b>1390</b> which may provide for the tool <b>1308</b>, such as the anvils <b>1324</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>1324</b>-<b>2</b> (generally <b>1324</b>-<i>x</i>) to rotate about a longitudinal axis (L<sub>AT</sub>) of the tool <b>1308</b> while the body portion <b>1302</b> may remain rotationally stationary, thus providing for rotation of the tool <b>1308</b> which is independent from the rotation of the optics or visualization system collectively referred to as the camera <b>1310</b>. Similarly, the support portion <b>1305</b> may include a rotational coupler <b>1391</b> which allows the support portion <b>1305</b> to rotate about a longitudinal axis (L<sub>AS</sub>) of the support portion <b>1305</b> while the body portion <b>1302</b> may remain rotationally stationary about its longitudinal axis L<sub>AS</sub>, when the distal and proximal couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1391</b> are in an uncoupled state. In a coupled state, the distal and proximal couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1391</b> are coupled to each other, such as via electronics or mechanical linkage systems including, e.g., signal wires and/or mechanical cables coupled to couplings, actuators, motors, sensors, and/or controllers for wired or wireless communication between the distal and proximal couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1391</b>, such as for synchronous operation of the two couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1391</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">For example, rotation of the proximate coupler <b>1391</b> causes rotation of the distal coupler <b>1390</b>, wither by the same amount or by different amounts, such as using gears and/or actuators controlled by control signals to provide desired fine or course rotation of the distal coupler <b>1390</b> in response to an rotation of the proximal coupler <b>1391</b>, whose rotation granularity may be adjustable, such as by control signals from an input source, e.g., knob, button, user interface to provide fine or course turning of the proximal coupler <b>1390</b> to rotate the tool <b>1308</b>. For fine turning, a high rotation ratio value, e.g., 10 or higher, is provided for a ratio of rotation of the distal coupler <b>1391</b> to the rotation of the proximal coupler <b>1390</b>, where a 100Â° rotation of the proximal coupler <b>1390</b>, rotates the distal coupler <b>1390</b> by 10Â°, for example. For course turning, the ratio value maybe less than 9, for example. For the sake of clarity, L<sub>AT </sub>and L<sub>AS </sub>may correspond with the L<sub>A</sub>. The support portion <b>1305</b> may then be rotationally coupled to the tool <b>1308</b> by at least one rotational link (e.g., a cable, etc.) so that rotation of the support portion <b>1305</b> relative to the body <b>1302</b> may correspondingly rotate the anvils <b>1324</b>-<i>x </i>or tip of the tool relative to the body <b>1302</b>. Rotating the anvils <b>1324</b>-<i>x </i>or tip (e.g., work portion) of the tool <b>1308</b> may be performed to obtain a desired orientation of the tool <b>1308</b> relative to a work area.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Alternatively, instead of the distal rotational coupler <b>1390</b> rotating in response to rotation of the proximal rotational coupler <b>1391</b>, each of the distal and proximal rotational couplers <b>1390</b>, <b>1390</b> may be independently controlled, such as in response to control signals from a UI or a moving joystick, for example, such as one more of the end portion controller(s). Illustratively, a tool joystick-1 may control rotation of the distal coupler <b>1390</b> to rotate the tool <b>1308</b> about the tool longitudinal axis L<sub>AT </sub>and/or move the distal end to any desired position, such as positions Aâ², Bâ² shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, while another tool joystick-2 may control movement of the anvils <b>1324</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1324</b>-<b>2</b>, e.g., to open and close them for scissor cutting or snipping action. It should be noted that one or more physical joysticks may be provided that can be configured by a processor to operate in different modes, under the control of the processor. For example, instead of having two physical joysticks, one physical joystick may be provided that has a first mode to operate as joystick-1, and a second mode to operate as joystick-2 of the above described example.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 19</figref> shows a portion of a system <b>1900</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present system. For example, a portion of the present system may include a processor <b>1910</b> (e.g., a controller) operationally coupled to a memory <b>1920</b>, a rendering device such as a display <b>1930</b>, sensors <b>1940</b>, and a user input device <b>1970</b>. The memory <b>1920</b> may be any type of device for storing application data as well as other data related to the described operation. The application data and other data are received by the processor <b>1910</b> for configuring (e.g., programming) the processor <b>1910</b> to perform operation acts in accordance with the present system. The processor <b>1910</b> so configured becomes a special purpose machine particularly suited for performing in accordance with embodiments of the present system.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The user input <b>1970</b> may include a keyboard, a mouse, a trackball, or other device, such as a touch-sensitive display, which may be stand alone or be a part of a system, such as part of a personal computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone (e.g., a smart phone), a monitor, a smart- or dumb-terminal or other device for communicating with the processor <b>1910</b> via any operable link. The user input device <b>1970</b> may be operable for interacting with the processor <b>1910</b> including enabling interaction within a user interface (UI) as described herein. Clearly the processor <b>1910</b>, the memory <b>1920</b>, display <b>1930</b>, and/or user input device <b>18</b><b>70</b> may all or partly be a portion of a computer system or other device such as a client and/or server.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The methods of the present system are particularly suited to be carried out by a computer software program, such program containing modules corresponding to one or more of the individual steps or acts described and/or envisioned by the present system. Such program may of course be embodied in a non-transitory computer-readable medium, such as an integrated chip, a peripheral device or memory, such as the memory <b>1920</b> or other memory coupled to the processor <b>1910</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The program and/or program portions contained in the memory <b>1920</b> may configure the processor <b>1910</b> to implement the methods, operational acts, and functions disclosed herein. The memories may be distributed, for example between the clients and/or servers, or local, and the processor <b>1910</b>, where additional processors may be provided, may also be distributed or may be singular. The memories may be implemented as electrical, magnetic or optical memory, or any combination of these or other types of storage devices. Moreover, the term âmemoryâ should be construed broadly enough to encompass any information able to be read from or written to an address in an addressable space accessible by the processor <b>1910</b>. With this definition, information accessible through a network is still within the memory, for instance, because the processor <b>1910</b> may retrieve the information from the network for operation in accordance with the present system.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The processor <b>1910</b> is operable for providing control signals and/or performing operations in response to input signals from the user input device <b>1970</b> as well as in response to other devices of a network and executing instructions stored in the memory <b>1920</b>. The processor <b>1910</b> may include one or more of a microprocessor, an application-specific or general-use integrated circuit(s), a logic device, etc. Further, the processor <b>1910</b> may be a dedicated processor for performing in accordance with the present system or may be a general-purpose processor wherein only one of many functions operates for performing in accordance with the present system. The processor <b>1910</b> may operate utilizing a program portion, multiple program segments, or may be a hardware device utilizing a dedicated or multi-purpose integrated circuit. Embodiments of the present system may provide fast imaging methods to acquire images and generate corresponding image information.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In accordance with some embodiments, electronic actuators may be provided to extend, retract, and/or rotate the camera in accordance with inputs from a user interface such as including one or more joysticks which may replace, at least partially, functions of the end portion controller and/or dispense with having the scissor type controls having the handles <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>. Thus, a tool joystick may replace the scissor type controls for controlling 3D movement of a distal tool. Such a tool joystick may be in addition to other joysticks for providing 3D movement controls of other devices such as one or more 2D and/or 3D cameras located at the distal end of an any instrument such as an endoscope, near further devices such as tools configured to provide desired functions, such as grippers, cutters, dissector, ultrasonic aspirators, light sources, communication links, coagulators, lasers, imagers including 2D and/or 3D cameras with optics, CMBF's and processors that provide video signals for rendering 2D and/or 3D images, etc. For example, the endoscopic microinstrument system may include a joystick-1 for controlling camera-1, a joystick-2 for controlling camera-2, a joystick-3 for controlling tool-1, a joystick-4 for controlling tool-2, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The further joysticks or controls may provide movement control (e.g., in any desired 3D direction, such as articulation, rotation, translation in any desired 3D direction, such as right, left, front (extension), back (retraction) directions) to move the distal tool independently of the camera control, if desired. For example, additional joysticks and/or user interfaces (e.g., hard or soft), such knobs, buttons, keys, may be provided to activate further devices, such as further tools and cameras, etc. The controllers (e.g., joysticks) and the controlled devices (e.g., tools, cameras) may be operationally coupled and connected to communicate with each other (e.g., via wired or wireless links) such that the controllers and the controlled devices may be reconfigured, e.g., by a processor, under the control of computer instructions stored in a memory or any non-transitory computer readable medium for effectuating 3D movement of the tools and desired operations of the tools, cameras, and/or controller (e.g., joysticks). Accordingly, a versatile endoscopic microinstrument that includes a combination distal tool(s) and distal camera(s) is provided that can âseeâ an ROI where a distal tool may be manipulated. Different tools or tools with different functions and/or camera(s) can be independently and/or synchronously controlled via one or more controllers, such as joysticks, knobs, buttons, couplers and the like, which may be a combination of hard and soft buttons on a UI, such as a displayed UI displayed on a touch sensitive screen, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Further, having a camera(s) at the distal end of the endoscopic microinstrument near the tool(s) (instead of having the camera at the proximal end) allows for camera movement that tracks movement of the tool and thus have the camera âseeâ what the tool is looking at, including providing a rear view, such as when the tool is also rotated to point to the rear which maybe pointing 180Â° or directly backwards relative a front direction and/or any angle relative the front view between 0 and 160Â°, between 0 and 140Â° and/or between 0 and 120Â°, for example. In addition to such synchronous movements between the camera and tool, the camera or a further camera may be decoupled for independent control to move independently of the tool movement and point to a desired direction different from a direction the tool is pointing to. A decoupled camera-tool combination maybe re-coupled or re-syncronize, such as in response to a synchronization (sync) signal from a controller or processor to re-syncronize the camera and tool together, again, where the camera follows the tool or moves together with the tool and/or the distal tip of the endoscopic microinstrument including the tool, for example.</p>
