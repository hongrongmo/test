      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to computed tomography (CT) imaging. In particular, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a system and an associated method to register 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detectors relative to 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation CT system coordinates using the shadow pattern of the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detector.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging, in its simplest expression, is an X-ray beam traversing an object and a detector relating the overall attenuation per ray. The attenuation is derived from a comparison of the same ray with and without the presence of the object. From this conceptual definition, several steps are required to properly construct an image. For instance, the finite size of the X-ray generator, the nature and shape of the filter blocking the very low energy X-ray from the generator, the details of the geometry and characteristics of the detector, and the capacity of the acquisition system are all elements that affect how the actual reconstruction is performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For a combined 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation and 4<sup>th</sup>-generation CT scanner, the system matrix requires knowledge of the offset of the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation sparse photon-counting detectors relative to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation CT system coordinates. If the offset between the 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation isocenter and the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detectors is not know precisely, the system matrix will be incorrect, which will cause artifacts in the reconstructed image. Moreover, the offset could change over time due to temperature-induced expansion of materials and gantry rotation.</p>

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one embodiment there is provided a method for determining, for a fourth-generation computed tomography (CT) scanner, a positional offset of a center of a ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors with respect to an iso-center of a third-generation X-ray source/detector system, the method comprising: (1) obtaining a plurality of offset images, each offset image being obtained from a scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in a known offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system; (2) performing a current scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in an unknown offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system, to obtain a current image; (3) calculating, for each offset image, a corresponding error value between the offset image and the current image to obtain a plurality of error values; (4) determining a smallest error value of the plurality of error values; and (5) determining the positional offset of the center of the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors to be an offset location corresponding to an offset image, of the plurality of offset images, having the determined smallest error value.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another embodiment the obtaining step comprises obtaining the offset images from a database of offset images, each offset image being generated by an air scan or a scan of a known phantom.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another embodiment, the calculating step comprises calculating, for each offset image, a mean-squared error between pixels in the current image and pixels in the offset image.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In another embodiment, the obtaining step comprises obtaining the plurality of offset images so that the plurality of offset images include images generated when the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors is positioned at various known offset positions around the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system. For example, the known offset positions are arranged in a two-dimensional grid centered at the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In another embodiment there is provided a method for determining, for a fourth-generation computed tomography (CT) scanner, a positional offset of a center of a ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors with respect to an iso-center of a third-generation X-ray source/detector system, the method comprising: (1) obtaining a plurality of offset images, each offset image being obtained from a scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in a known offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system; (2) performing a current scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in an unknown offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system, to obtain a current image; (3) calculating, for each offset image, a corresponding correlation value between the offset image and the current image to obtain a plurality of error values; (4) determining a largest correlation value of the plurality of correlation values; and (5) determining the positional offset of the center of the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors to be an offset location corresponding to an offset image, of the plurality of offset images, having the determined largest correlation value.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another embodiment, there is provided an apparatus for determining, in a fourth-generation computed tomography (CT) scanner, a positional offset of a center of a ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors with respect to an iso-center of a third-generation X-ray source/detector system, the apparatus comprising: a processing circuit configured to execute a program that causes the processing circuit to (1) obtain a plurality of offset images, each offset image being obtained from a scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in a known offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system; (2) perform a current scan executed with the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors positioned in an unknown offset location with respect to the iso-center of the third-generation X-ray source/detector system, to obtain a current image; (3) calculate, for each offset image, a corresponding error value between the offset image and the current image to obtain a plurality of error values; (4) determine a smallest error value of the plurality of error values; and (5) determine the positional offset of the center of the ring of fixed energy-discriminating detectors to be an offset location corresponding to an offset image, of the plurality of offset images, having the determined smallest error value.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The apparatus can further include a memory that stores the plurality offset images, each offset image being stored in association with a corresponding offset location of the offset image.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Turning now to the drawings, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a combine third/fourth generation system having stationary, sparsely distributed fourth generation detectors, along with a rotating third generation source/detector system.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">As can be seen from <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, shadows from the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detectors create artifacts in the resulting 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation image. The present inventors recognized that the artifacts will have a well-defined pattern and that the artifact pattern changes based on the position of 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detectors relative to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation isocenter. Accordingly, in the present embodiments, the artifact pattern is used to register the center of the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detectors to the 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation isocenter in the x-y plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">For example, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation image in which the inner, sparse ring is centered at the iso-center. In contrast, in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the inner ring is offset and is centered at x=â2 mm, y=â4 mm. Further, in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the inner ring is offset and is centered at x=1 mm, y=0.5 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the offset of the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation sparse ring from the 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation iso-center is calculated using the following method.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In step <b>201</b>, 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation images are reconstructed with the 4<sup>th</sup>-generation detector located in various known offset positions, e.g., with an air scan or a phantom scan. For example, ten x-direction offsets and ten y-direction offsets are used to generate 100 images. Other numbers of x and y offsets can be used. The obtained images are obtained once (or periodically) and stored in a database in a memory for later use.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In step <b>202</b>, a current 3<sup>rd</sup>-generation image is obtained for a scanner (having an unknown offset) at some time after the images in step <b>201</b> are obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In step <b>203</b>, the mean-squared error (MSE) between the pixel values of the current image and the pixel values of each of the offset images is calculated, e.g., as</p>
