    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present embodiments relate to devices and methods for assisting navigation of medical inserts inside a body of a patient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In most modern invasive medical procedures (e.g., angiography, biopsy, etc.) that require insertion of a medical invasive device or a medical insert such as catheter, guide wire, biopsy needle, endoscope, pacemaker, etc., inside a patient's body, the movement of the medical insert inside the body of the patient is tracked. To facilitate proper navigation of the medical insert, the medical insert inside the body of the patient is continuously visualized on a display screen or exam room display monitor for viewing by a physician who is navigating the medical insert.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As the medical insert is advanced by the physician inside the body of the patient from one position to another, the imaging modality that is rendering images to the exam room monitor is focused such that the medical insert remains within a field of view of the imaging modality. Hence, during the navigation of the medical insert, the imaging modality (e.g., a C-Arm of an X-Ray machine) is moved continuously or intermittently to maintain the medical insert inside the field of view of the imaging modality.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The movement of the imaging modality is performed by an operator of the imaging modality, such as a technician who moves the C-Arm to maintain the medical insert in its field of view as and when the medical insert is moved or navigated inside the patient's body. For accurately moving the imaging modality, individual skills and expertise of the technician are instrumental. At all times during the navigational procedure, the technician is required to be alert, attentive and focused towards the exam room monitor. Thus, there is a chance of manual error in the present scenario.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Though usually the exam room monitor is arranged such that the physician and the technician both have a direct view of the exam room monitor, there exist scenarios, depending on the layout scheme of the exam room or depending on a special position the physician needs to assume to perform insertion and navigation of the medical insert, in which the technician may not have direct view of the exam room monitor. In such scenarios, the physician monitors the movement of the medical insert by looking at the exam room monitor and provides instructions (e.g., through verbal or visual cues) to the technician to move the imaging modality whenever the medical insert moves out or is about to move out of the field of view or is required to be centered in the field of view of the imaging modality. The technician, without the direct view of the exam room display screen, is unaware of the position of the medical insert and hence relies on the inputs provided by the physician to position the imaging modality, for example, by rotating the C-Arm. This further introduces chances of manual error because the communication between the physician and the technician is prone to human error and may lead to confusion and thus improper movement of the imaging modality. Chances of the medical insert moving out of the field of view of the imaging modality are increased when the navigation is being performed at a zoomed display on the exam room monitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Additionally, the navigation is to be performed as quickly as possible to provide that the patient is subjected to minimal exposure to radiations from the imaging modality.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY AND DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is desirable to develop a technique for assisting navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient in which chances of human error are reduced. The technique is to aid navigation of the medical insert inside the body of the patient without requiring human intervention to move the imaging modality such that the medical insert is maintained in the field of view of the imaging modality. This will provide error free navigation of the medical insert and faster navigation times and thus lesser radiation exposures of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The scope of the present invention is defined solely by the appended claims and is not affected to any degree by the statements within this summary.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present embodiments may obviate one or more of the drawbacks or limitations in the related art. For example, an improved technique for assisting or aiding navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient is provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">As another example, a technique for assisting or aiding navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient that requires minimal manual interventions and obviates high reliance on skill and experience of an operator or a technician is provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">As yet another example, a technique for assisting or aiding navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient that facilitates the performance of the navigation procedure with reduction in radiation exposure of the patient is provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to one embodiment, a medical device for assisting navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient is presented. The medical device includes an imaging unit, an image processing unit and a drive unit. The imaging unit, having a field of view, is configured to generate image signals by sensing the field of view. The image processing unit is in communication with the imaging unit and receives the image signals from the imaging unit. The image processing unit includes a position determining module and a control module. The position determining module is configured to determine a position of the medical insert relative to a desired area within the field of view of the imaging unit. The position of the medical insert relative to the desired area is determined by the position determining module by using the image signals. The control module is configured to generate a control signal based on the position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view as determined by the position determining module. The drive unit is in communication with the image processing unit. The drive unit receives the control signal from the image processing unit and is configured to move the field of view of the imaging unit in accordance with the control signal such that the medical insert is maintained within the desired area.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In one embodiment, the image signals may include a series of images of the medical insert inside the body of the patient at different positions within the field of view. In another embodiment, the position determining module is configured to determine a change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view of the imaging unit. The change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area is determined by the position determining module by using at least a first image and a second image of the series. The control module is configured to generate the control signal based on the change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view as determined by the position determining module.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In another embodiment of the medical device, the position determining module is configured to detect a first position of the medical insert within the field of view from the first image of the series, to detect a second position of the medical insert within the field of view from the second image of the series, and to compare the first position and the second position to determine the change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to another embodiment, a method for assisting navigation of a medical insert inside a body of a patient is presented. In the method, image signals are generated by sensing a field of view of an imaging unit. Subsequently, a position of the medical insert relative to a desired area within the field of view is determined by using the image signals so generated. A control signal is generated based on the position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view. In the method, the field of view of the imaging unit is automatically moved in accordance with the control signal such that the medical insert is maintained within the desired area.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In one embodiment, the image signals may include a series of images of the medical insert inside the body of the patient at different positions within the field of view. In another embodiment of the method, determining the position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view includes determining a change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view by using at least a first image and a second image of the series. In the embodiment, the control signal is generated based on the change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In another embodiment of the method, in determining the change in position of the medical insert, a first position of the medical insert within the field of view is detected from the first image of the series, and a second position of the medical insert within the field of view is detected from the second image of the series. Subsequently, the first position and the second position are compared to determine the change in position of the medical insert relative to the desired area within the field of view.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The present technique has several advantages. The present technique provides that the medical insert is continuously or intermittently maintained within the desired area in the field of view of the imaging unit and thus provides that the medical insert is available for visualization of a physician performing the navigation procedure. The present technique results in minimization of human intervention, and thus reducing manual errors and reliance on skill and expertise of a technician to aim the imaging unit such that the medical insert is maintained within the desired area in its field of view. The technique results in expeditious performance of the navigation procedure and thus provides that exposure of the patient to radiations from the imaging unit is decreased. The present technique also reduces the requirement of having technicians to control the movement of the imaging modality during the navigation procedure and thus makes the navigation procedure simple and economical.</p>

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The ‘medical insert’ <b>5</b>, as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, a catheter, a guide wire, a biopsy needle, an endoscope, a pacemaker, and other medical invasive probes used in medical procedures like angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, ablation therapy, catheterization, surgical cardiac electrophysiology, etc. The term ‘navigation’, as used herein, includes intravascular and non-vascular navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b>. For the purposes of explanation and not for limitation, the medical insert <b>5</b> is shown as a guide wire in the accompanying FIGS.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The medical device <b>100</b> includes an imaging unit <b>10</b> having a field of view <b>12</b>, an image processing unit <b>30</b> and a drive unit <b>60</b>. The imaging unit <b>10</b> is configured to generate image signals by sensing the field of view <b>12</b>. The imaging unit <b>10</b> may be, but is not limited to, a fluoroscopic imaging device such as a C-Arm based X-Ray system. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic representation of an exemplary embodiment of an image <b>81</b> depicting the field of view <b>12</b> and a desired area <b>13</b> within the field of view <b>12</b>. The image <b>81</b> is an exemplary image and does not show the medical insert <b>5</b>. Though in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and the other accompanying FIGS, the field of view <b>12</b> and the desired area <b>13</b> are shown as circular, the field of view <b>12</b> and/or the desired area <b>13</b> may, however, be of any geometrical shape such as a rectangle or a square.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As shown in the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the imaging unit <b>10</b> may include a C-Arm mount <b>14</b>. A radiation source <b>16</b>, such as an X-ray emitter, is positioned at one end of the C-Arm mount <b>14</b>. An image acquisition module <b>18</b>, such as a radiographic receptor, a flat panel detector, etc. is mounted at the other end, opposite to the radiation source <b>16</b>, of the C-arm mount <b>14</b>. The body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> is positioned on a table such that a region of interest of the body <b>7</b> (e.g., a region where the medical insert <b>5</b> is to be inserted or navigated in the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>) is positioned in-between the radiation source <b>16</b> and the image acquisition module <b>18</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b> such that radiations <b>17</b> are allowed to pass through the region of interest. The imaging unit <b>10</b> generates the image signals by sensing the field of view <b>12</b> (e.g., by aiming radiations <b>17</b> from the radiation source <b>16</b> towards the region of interest of the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> and by detecting, at the image acquisition module <b>18</b>, the radiations <b>17</b> transmitted through the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>). The image signals generated from the imaging unit <b>10</b> may be visualized on a display unit <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">During the navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>, when the medical insert <b>5</b> is present in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>, the medical insert <b>5</b> is visualized in the display unit <b>80</b> along with surroundings formed by the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b> is movable or adjustable (e.g., the field of view <b>12</b> may be adjusted such that a different region of interest along the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> may be visualized on the display unit <b>80</b>). For example, the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> may be adjusted or moved to aim at a different region of interest in the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> by moving the C-Arm mount <b>14</b> (e.g., the radiation source <b>16</b> and the image acquisition module <b>18</b> together along a translational motion in a plane parallel to and/or vertical to the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>). The field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> may also be adjusted or moved to aim at a different region of interest in the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> by rotating the C-Arm mount <b>14</b> in yaw and/or pitch and/or roll motion as depicted by the arrows represented by reference numerals <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The image processing unit <b>30</b> is communicatively connected with the imaging unit <b>10</b> (e.g., the image processing unit <b>30</b> is capable of receiving the image signals from the imaging unit <b>10</b>). The communicative connection may be wired or wireless in nature. The image processing unit <b>30</b> is a processor such as a microprocessor, field programmable gate arrays, etc. and is configured to receive the image signals from the imaging unit <b>10</b>. The image processing unit <b>30</b> includes a position determining module <b>40</b> and a control module <b>50</b>. The position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to determine a position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) within the field of view <b>12</b>. The position determining module <b>40</b> determines the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> by using the image signals received from the imaging unit <b>10</b>. The position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to determine the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> by using edge detection techniques and/or object recognition techniques in the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The edge detection techniques and/or object recognition techniques help to determine the presence of the medical insert <b>5</b> in the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the position determining module <b>40</b> may be configured to implement an algorithm in which short line segments are identified in the generated image signals using steerable filters, an orientation-selective convolution kernel used for image enhancement and feature extraction, and/or Probabilistic Boosting Tree technique. Different types of features including Haar-like features are detected to identify segments such as edges and ridges in the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>. Subsequently, probabilities for multiple pairs of two segments are computed, and segments with highest probability are extended to form a curve. By repeating several times, the extension step to form a curve, multiple curves are obtained. The several curves obtained are modeled using Principle Component Analysis modeling. The medical insert <b>5</b> specific features are identified. This leads to recognition of the medical insert <b>5</b> in the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, other edge detection techniques and/or object recognition techniques may be used. Such edge detection techniques and/or object recognition techniques are well known in the art of image processing and thus not explained in detail herein for sake of brevity.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In an embodiment of the present technique, the position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to determine the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> by using a coordinate system <b>11</b>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, corresponding to the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the coordinate system <b>11</b> may be a Cartesian coordinate system and used to determine or mark the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> using the Cartesian coordinates. In another exemplary embodiment, the Cartesian coordinate system and the edge detection technique are simultaneously used to determine the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The control module <b>50</b> is configured to generate a control signal based on the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> within the field of view <b>12</b> as determined by the position determining module <b>40</b>. The functioning of the position determining module <b>40</b> and the control module <b>50</b> are explained in further detail later in reference to <figref>FIGS. 3 to 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The drive unit <b>60</b> is in communication with the image processing unit <b>30</b>. The drive unit <b>60</b> is configured to receive the control signal from the image processing unit <b>30</b> (e.g., the control module <b>50</b> of the image processing unit <b>30</b>) and to move the field of view <b>12</b> in accordance with the control signal such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is maintained within the desired area <b>13</b>. The drive unit <b>60</b> may include a pivot assembly (not shown) capable of effecting motion on at least a part of the imaging unit <b>10</b> (e.g., the C-arm mount <b>14</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>) in a translational manner along a plane parallel to and/or vertical to the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>, or in a rotational manner inducing rotation of the C-Arm mount <b>14</b> in yaw and/or pitch and/or roll motion as depicted by the arrows represented by reference numerals <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b>, respectively. The drive unit <b>60</b> may also include a motor (not shown) such as a stepper motor to move the pivot assembly in one or more of the abovementioned motions, and/or a controller (not shown) to control the motor. In another exemplary embodiment, the drive unit <b>60</b> may be a robotic arm (not shown) capable of moving the imaging unit <b>10</b> in one or more degrees of freedom.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In an embodiment of the medical device <b>100</b>, the drive unit <b>60</b> is configured to move the field of view <b>12</b> in accordance with the control signal such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is maintained at a fixed relative position within the desired area <b>13</b>. In another embodiment of the medical device <b>100</b>, the drive unit <b>60</b> is configured to move the field of view <b>12</b> in accordance with the control signal such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is maintained at a central location of the desired area <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The phrase, ‘the medical insert <b>5</b> is maintained within the desired area <b>13</b>’ may be that the imaging unit <b>10</b> is adjusted or moved by the drive unit <b>60</b> such that in the image signals or images successively generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>, the medical insert <b>5</b> is caused or enabled to continue within the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. Additionally, the phrase, “the medical insert <b>5</b> is maintained within the desired area <b>13</b>” provides that if in one of the image signals or images the medical insert <b>5</b> is seen to be out of the desired area <b>13</b>, then, subsequently, the drive unit <b>60</b> moves or adjusts the imaging unit <b>10</b> such that in the image signals or images generated subsequently (e.g., after the drive unit <b>60</b> has moved or adjusted the imaging unit <b>10</b>), the medical insert <b>5</b> is brought back within the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. This is explained further with reference to some exemplary scenarios depicted by <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> that represent different positions of the medical insert <b>5</b> on the Cartesian coordinate system <b>11</b> in different images <b>83</b>, <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In a first exemplary scenario as depicted in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> (e.g., in the image signal or the image <b>83</b> generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>), the medical insert <b>5</b> is determined to be positioned around the center of the Cartesian coordinate system <b>11</b> within the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In this scenario, the control module <b>50</b> will generate the control signal, which will not cause the drive unit <b>60</b> to move or adjust the field of view <b>12</b> (e.g., the imaging unit <b>10</b> will not be moved by the drive unit <b>60</b> and thus the field of view <b>12</b>, and hence the desired area <b>13</b>, will continue to have the medical insert <b>5</b> in the desired area <b>13</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In a second exemplary scenario as depicted in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> (e.g., in the image signal or the image <b>85</b> generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>), the medical insert <b>5</b> is determined to be positioned around an edge of the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In this scenario, further subsequent navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b> may cause a problem by leading the medical insert <b>5</b> outside the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. To avoid occurrence of the problem, the control module <b>50</b> will generate the control signal, which will cause the drive unit <b>60</b> to move or adjust the field of view <b>12</b> such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is moved inwards inside the desired area <b>13</b> towards the center of the Cartesian coordinate system <b>11</b>. This is achieved by moving the imaging unit <b>10</b> by the drive unit <b>60</b> to adjust the field of view <b>12</b>, and hence the desired area <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In a third exemplary scenario as depicted in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> (e.g., in the image signal or the image <b>86</b> generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>), the medical insert <b>5</b> is determined to be positioned beyond the edge of the desired area <b>13</b> and outside the desired area <b>13</b> in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. In this scenario, the probability is very high that further subsequent navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b> may cause a problem by leading the medical insert <b>5</b> completely outside the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. To avoid occurrence of the problem, the control module <b>50</b> will generate the control signal, which will cause the drive unit <b>60</b> to move or adjust the field of view <b>12</b> such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is moved inwards inside the desired area <b>13</b> towards the center of the Cartesian coordinate system <b>11</b>. This is achieved by moving the imaging unit <b>10</b> by the drive unit <b>60</b> to adjust the field of view <b>12</b>, and hence the desired area <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Thus, by the medical device <b>100</b>, the imaging unit <b>10</b> is adjusted or moved in an automated way by the action of the drive unit <b>60</b> controlled by the control module <b>50</b> via the control signal generated by the control module <b>60</b>. This depends on the position of the medical insert <b>5</b> as determined by the position determining module <b>40</b> of the image processing unit <b>30</b> using the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The functioning of the image processing module <b>30</b> is further explained hereinafter with the help of the embodiments shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 to 8</figref>. As mentioned earlier, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> schematically represents the image <b>81</b> depicting an instance before the medical insert <b>5</b> is visualized in the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b> (e.g., when the medical insert <b>5</b> is not present in the region of interest in the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>). <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> schematically represent exemplary embodiments of images <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, and <b>86</b> depicting the field of view <b>12</b> and the medical insert <b>5</b> within the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> at different positions relative to the desired area <b>13</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In accordance with aspects of the present technique, in an exemplary embodiment of the medical device <b>100</b>, the image signals include a series of images <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> at different positions within the field of view <b>12</b>. This is exemplified in <figref>FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>, for the purpose of explanation. In another exemplary embodiment, the series of images <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>85</b>, <b>86</b> may be a time series (e.g., a series formed by the image signals generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b> at regular time intervals during the navigational procedure of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In an exemplary embodiment of the medical device <b>100</b>, the position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to determine a change in position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> within the field of view <b>12</b> by using at least a first image and a second image of the series. In this embodiment of the medical device <b>100</b>, the control module <b>50</b> is configured to generate the control signal based on the change in position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> within the field of view <b>12</b>. In a related embodiment, the position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to detect a first position of the medical insert <b>5</b> within the field of view <b>12</b> from the first image of the series. The position determining module <b>40</b> is also configured to detect a second position of the medical insert <b>5</b> within the field of view <b>12</b> from the second image of the series, and to compare the first position and the second position to determine the change in position of the medical insert <b>5</b> relative to the desired area <b>13</b> within the field of view <b>12</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, the position determining module <b>40</b> is configured to use a technique of subtraction between the first image and the second image to compare the first position and the second position of the medical insert <b>5</b>. The technique of subtraction (e.g., an image subtraction technique or pixel subtraction technique), a process where the digital numeric value of one pixel or whole image is subtracted from another image for obtaining changes between two images, is a well known and prevalently used technique of image processing and hence is not explained in further detail herein for sake of brevity.</p>

      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">By a combination of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a fourth exemplary case is provided. In this embodiment, the first image is the image <b>83</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, and the second image is the image <b>86</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. For the purpose of this example, it is assumed that during the navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>, the scenario of <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is subsequent to the scenario of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Since, in the present exemplary case, the changed position of the medical insert <b>5</b> (e.g., the position in the second image <b>85</b>) is outside of the desired area <b>13</b> and since the direction of movement of the medical insert <b>5</b> is from the center of the desired area <b>13</b> towards the outside of the desired area <b>13</b>, in this exemplary case, further subsequent navigation of the medical insert <b>5</b> may cause a serious problem by leading the medical insert <b>5</b> completely outside the field of view <b>12</b> of the imaging unit <b>10</b>. To avoid occurrence of the problem, the control module <b>50</b> will generate the control signal, which will cause the drive unit <b>60</b> to move or adjust the field of view <b>12</b> such that the medical insert <b>5</b> is moved inwards inside the desired area <b>13</b> towards the center of the Cartesian coordinate system <b>11</b>. This is achieved by moving the imaging unit <b>10</b> by the drive unit <b>60</b> to adjust the field of view <b>12</b>, and hence the desired area <b>13</b>.</p>

The motion sensing unit <b>70</b> is configured to sense a movement of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> and to induce the imaging unit <b>10</b> to generate at least one image signal by sensing the field of view <b>12</b> in response to the movement of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b>. The motion sensing device <b>70</b> may be any device to detect the movement of the medical insert <b>5</b> inside the body <b>7</b> of the patient <b>9</b> (e.g., the motion sensing unit <b>70</b> may be a transmitter <b>72</b>—a receiver <b>74</b> pair such as RF (radio frequency) transmitter—receiver pair). As depicted in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the transmitter <b>72</b> may be positioned on the medical insert <b>5</b>, and the receiver <b>74</b> may be positioned outside the patient's body <b>7</b> (e.g., at a fixed spot (not shown) in the exam room). Thus, a subsequent image signal is generated by the imaging unit <b>10</b> only when the medical insert <b>5</b> is moved from a given position.</p>
