      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to chimeric genes for the catalytic protein of <i>Oplophorus </i>luciferase, use thereof and so on.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Bioluminescence is a phenomenon based on a chemical reaction in vivo, which is called a luciferin (a luminescence substrate)-luciferase (an enzyme that catalyzes the luminescence reaction) reaction. Numerous studies of the identification of luciferins or luciferases and the elucidation of the luminescence mechanism in a molecular level have been performed for a long time in the country and overseas. In bioluminescent marine organisms, <i>Oplophorus gracilirostris </i>luciferase from the deep-sea shrimp is an extracellularly secreted luciferase (Non-Patent Document 1). <i>Oplophorus </i>luciferase is a 106 kDa protein composed of a protein with a molecular weight of 35 kDa and a protein with a molecular weight of 19 kDa. The domain that catalyzes the luminescence is found to be 19 kDa protein. <i>Oplophorus </i>luciferase uses coelenterazine as a luminescence substrate and is classified as a coelenterazine-type luciferase (Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 2). <i>Oplophorus </i>luciferase is different from other coelenterazine-type luciferases in broad substrate specificity and uses coelenterazine analogues as a suitable substrate as well as coelenterazine (Non-Patent Document 2). When the gene for the 19 kDa protein is expressed in <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>) at ambient and lower temperatures, the protein is expressed mostly as an insoluble protein (Non-Patent Document 3). When the 19 kDa protein is expressed as a fusion protein to ZZ domain from protein A in a low temperature expression system, the fused protein can be expressed as a soluble protein (Non-Patent Document 4). It is also reported that when the 19 kDa protein was expressed in animal culture cells, the expressed protein was hardly secreted outside of cells (Non-Patent Document 2).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Recently, it is reported that the mutated 19 kDa protein having catalytic activity of luminescence was prepared by mutating the 16 amino acids of the 19 kDa protein and showed a higher luminescence activity than native 19 kDa protein, and was secreted into an extracellular medium (Patent Document 2, Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5). It is also reported that coelenterazine derivatives displayed higher activity than native coelenterazine used as a substrate (Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the luminescence reaction system using coelenterazine as a substrate, the luminescence reaction of luciferase proceeds only by a substrate and molecular oxygen. For this reason, a coelenterazine-type luciferase gene is used widely as a reporter assay in an animal cultured cell system at present. <i>Renilla </i>luciferase having 311 amino acids is used for a reporter assay inside of cells. For an extracellular reporter assay, the secreted <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase which is a secretory luciferase having 168 amino acids is used. When recombinant <i>Renilla </i>luciferase and <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase are compared in specific activity using coelenterazine as a luminescence substrate, the specific activity of <i>Renilla </i>luciferase is about 1/100 of <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase (Non-Patent Documents 5 and 6). On the other hand, the specific activity of mutated 19 kDa protein having catalytic activity of luminescence is 1/10 as compared to <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase, indicating that the mutated 19 kDa protein is obviously inferior as the gene for a reporter assay as a secreted protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it has been desired to develop a reporter gene which is an intracellular and secreted luciferase and has a higher luminescence activity than that of native 19 kDa protein when coelenterazine or even its analogue is used as the substrate.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0044">The present invention will be described below in detail.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">1. Luciferase Mutant of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0045">The term luciferase mutant of the present invention refers to a mutant of the protein with a molecular weight of 19 kDa of <i>Oplophorus </i>luciferase. Specifically, the luciferase mutant of the present invention is intended to mean a luciferase mutant having substantially the same activity as the luciferase mutant comprising an amino acid sequence in which tyrosine at position of 138 is substituted with another amino acid and at least 3 amino acids selected from the group consisting of isoleucine at position of 90, proline at position of 115, glutamine at position of 124 and asparagine at position of 166 are substituted with other amino acids, in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0046">The term âsubstantially the same activityâ is intended to mean at least one activity selected from luciferase activity, activity for little extracellular secretion when expressed in animal cells, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0047">The term âluciferase activityâ is intended to mean the activity for catalyzing the luminescence reaction using a luciferin (e.g., a coelenterazine analogue) which is used as a substrate, namely, the reaction in which luciferin (e.g., a coelenterazine analogue) is oxidized with molecular oxygen to produce oxyluciferin in its excited state. The excited state of oxyluciferin produced emits visible light and converts to the ground state of oxyluciferin.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0048">Luminescence activity can be determined by the method described in, e.g., Inouye, S. &amp; Shimomura, O. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 233, 349-353. Specifically, the luciferase mutant of the present invention is mixed with a luciferin to start the luminescence reaction, and the activity of catalyzing luminescence reaction can be determined using a luminometer. Commercially available luminometers, e.g., Luminescencer-PSN AB2200 (manufactured by Atto Inc.) or Centro 960 luminometer (manufactured by Berthold Inc.) may be used as luminometers.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0049">The luciferin used in the present invention may be any luciferin as far as it is used as a substrate for the luciferase mutants of the present invention. Specifically, the luciferin used in the present invention includes a coelenterazine analogue containing the imidazopyrazinone ring as the backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0050">The coelenterazine analogue is used to mean coelenterazine or its analogues. Coelenterazine analogues include, for example, bis-coelenterazine, deoxyfuran-coelenterazine (furimazine), h-coelenterazine, hcp-coelenterazine, cp-coelenterazine, f-coelenterazine, fcp-coelenterazine, n-coelenterazine, MeO-coelenterazine, e-coelenterazine, cl-coelenterazine, ch-coelenterazine, 3iso-coelenterazine, 3meo-coelenterazine, cf3-coelenterazine, i-coelenterazine, et-coelenterazine, me-coelenterazine, 3me-coelenterazine, ameh-coelenterazine 8-(1-naphthyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-naphthyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-thienyl)-coelenterazine, 6,8-di(2-thienyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-benzothienyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(b-styryl)-coelenterazine, 8-phenyl-coelenterazine, 6-deoxy-coelenterazine, 8-(3-thienyl)-coelenterazine and 8-(3-benzo[b]thienyl)-coelenterazine. Of these coelenterazines analogues, coelenterazine is particularly preferred in the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0051">These coelenterazine analogues could be synthesized by publicly known methods or may also be commercially available.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0052">The coelenterazine analogues could be synthesized by the methods described in, e.g., Shimomura et al. (1988) Biochem. J. 251, 405-410, Shimomura et al.

(2013) Biocchem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 437, 23-28, or respective modifications thereof. Furimazine may be produced by the method described in Hall et al. (2012) ACS Chem. Biol. 16; 848-1857.</p>

      <heading id="h-00041-en" level="1">Secretory Expression Vector for WNanoKAZ Using the Secretory Signal Peptide Sequence of <i>Gaussia </i>Luciferase</heading>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0168">The expression vector for WNanoKAZ was constructed as follows. Firstly, a novel vector pcDNA3-GLsp for expression in animal cultured cells was constructed. Specifically, the secretory signal peptide sequence of <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase was obtained from pcDNA3-GLuc vector (manufactured by Prolume Ltd.) by PCR using the GLsp-1R/EcoRI primer (SEQ ID NO: 21: 5â² ggc GAA TTC GGT GGG CTT GGC CTC GGC CAC 3â², EcoRI sequence underlined) and T7 primer (SEQ ID NO: 22: 5â² TAATACG ACTCACTATAGGG 3â²) by PCR. After digesting with HindIII/EcoRI, the resultant fragment was inserted into the HindIII/EcoRI site of pcDNA3 vector (manufactured by Invitrogen Inc.) to construct a novel expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp. That is, the novel expression vector is under the control of the CMV promoter, followed by the Kozak sequence, the secretory signal peptide sequence of <i>Gaussia </i>luciferase and a multiple-cloning site sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0169">Next, the expression vector for WNanoKAZ was constructed as follows, using the novel expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp. The DNA fragment obtained in EXAMPLE 1 was digested with the restriction enzymes of EcoRI/XbaI in a conventional manner and then ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI site of pcDNA3-GLsp to construct the expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ. The gene sequence inserted was confirmed by sequencing using a DNA Sequencer (manufactured by ABI Inc.). As a result, it was confirmed that the insert gene sequence was the nucleotide sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 5 (WNanoKAZ), and the amino acid sequence encoded by the gene sequence was the amino acid sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 6 (WNanoKAZ).</p>

The CHO-K1 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate in 1Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well/2 mL medium (n=2) and cultured in an incubator at 37Â° C. in 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub>. After 24 hours, the purified recombinant plasmid was transfected to CHO-K1 cells using a FuGene HD transfection kit (manufactured by Promega Corp.) and the cells were used for subsequent experiment. Specifically, 1 pg of the recombinant plasmid, 0.1 Î¼g of the internal standard vector pGL4.13 [Luc2/sv40] and 3 Î¼L of FuGene HD were added to 100 Î¼L of the medium and allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 100 Î¼L of the DNA-FuGene complex solution was added to the cells in the 6-well plate. After incubation for 46 hours, the culture medium was collected. On the other hand, the KAZ mutant expressed in the cells was washed 3 times with 3 mL of 1ÃPBS, then suspended in 1 mL of 1ÃPBS and disrupted by sonication on ice. The resultant cell extract of WNanoKAZ was used as the enzyme solution.</p>

      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0174">WNanoKAZ displayed 64-fold higher activity than that of dnKAZ as shown in EXAMPLE 3, when coelenterazine was used as the substrate. The higher activity is considered to be due to amino acid substitutions at 5 positions, in contrast to native KAZ. In order to identify amino acid residues associated with the increased activity, a mutant in which the substituted amino acid residues at 5 positions were replaced with the amino acid residues from native KAZ was constructed to examine its effects on luminescence activity.</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0180">To express as soluble proteins, single amino acid-substituted WNanoKAZ mutant genes were fused to ZZ domain to construct expression vectors. Specifically, pCold-ZZ-X (described in Inouye &amp; Sahara, Protein Express. Purif. (2009) 66: 52-57) was used. The DNA fragment obtained in EXAMPLE 7 was digested with the restriction enzymes of EcoRI and XbaI and ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI site of the expression vector to construct the following 5 expression vectors capable of expressing the ZZ domain-fused single amino acid-substituted WNanoKAZ mutants: pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-V90I, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-E115P, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-K124Q, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-I138Y and pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-R166N. The nucleotide sequence of the inserted DNA was confirmed by sequencing using a DNA Sequencer (manufactured by ABI Inc.).</p>

After 1 Î¼L of the crude enzyme solution was added to 100 Î¼L of 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) containing 1 Î¼g of coelenterazine (manufactured by JNC Corp.), a luminescence reaction was started. Luminescence activity was measured for 60 seconds using a luminometer (manufactured by Atto Inc.: AB2200). The maximum intensity of luminescence (I<sub>max</sub>) was given as a relative luminescence activity (rlu).</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0185">The results reveal that WNanoKAZ, WNanoKAZ-I90V, WNanoKAZ-E115P, WNanoKAZ-K124Q, WNanoKAZ-I138Y and WNanoKAZ-R166N showed 64-fold, 34-fold, 31-fold, 34-fold, 8.5-fold and 32-fold higher activity, respectively, than native KAZ.</p>

      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0187">The activity of WNanoKAZ-I138Y decreased to the same level as that of dnKAZ, clearly showing that the substitution of isoleucine for tyrosine at amino acid position 138 was critical for enhancing the activity of KAZ.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0188">These results revealed that the substitution of Y138I in the 5 amino acid substitutions was critical and the higher activity could be achieved by at least 3 substitutions out of the remaining 4 substitutions, and preferably 4 substitutions, as shown in TABLE 6.</p>

      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0189">Each of the coelenterazine analogues used for substrate specificity studies was synthesized by the methods described in publications. Specifically, bis-coelenterazine was synthesized by the method described in Nakamura et al. (1997) Tetrahedron Lett. 38: 6405-6406, furimazine by the method described in Hall et al. (2012) ACS Chem. Biol. 16; 848-1857, and, 6h-coelenterazine, f-coelenterazine and 6h-f-coelenterazine by the method described in Inouye et al (2013) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 437: 23-28. Luminescence activity was measured by the same method as in EXAMPLE 10, using the crude enzyme solution obtained in EXAMPLE 10, in which coelenterazine or its analogue was used as the luminescence substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0190">As a result, WNanoKAZ and its single amino acid-substituted mutants exhibited enhanced luminescence activity, namely, WNanoKAZ, WNanoKAZ-190V, WNanoKAZ-E115P, WNanoKAZ-K124Q, WNanoKAZ-I138Y and WNanoKAZ-R166N exhibited 8.6-fold, 4.6-fold, 4.2-fold, 4.6-fold, 1.1-fold and 4.3-fold higher activity, respectively, than the other coelenterazine analogues when coelenterazine was used as the substrate, as shown in TABLE 7. It is noted from TABLE 7 that even when h-coelenterazine was used as the substrate, WNanoKAZ and its single amino acid-substituted mutants showed the activity as high as in the case when coelenterazine was used as the substrate.</p>

The results reveal that the substitution of isoleucine at position of 138 was critical for the enhanced activity and, in the remaining 4 substitutions, at least 3 substitutions, preferably 4 substitutions are associated with the enhanced activity. In addition, these chimeric proteins have the property that into aminal culture cells and advantageously used for reporter assay in the cytoplasm, and the like.</p>
