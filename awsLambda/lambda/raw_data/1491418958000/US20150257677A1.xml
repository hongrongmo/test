      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a massage measurement apparatus that measures a characteristic parameter of massage and a massage measurement method for measuring a characteristic parameter of massage.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A massage is widely known as a therapy performed such that a skin is kneaded or rubbed with a finger, a palm, or the like. Effects of the massage greatly vary depending on how it is performed. Therefore, there is a need for acquiring details of an effective manner of massage and reproducing the massage. However, it is difficult to objectively determine the strength or the pattern of the massage. Hereinafter, the strength of massage or the pattern thereof or the like will also be referred to generically as characteristic parameters of the massage.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">One possible technique to measure the characteristic parameters of the actual massage is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 11-118635 (hereinafter, referred to as the conventional technique).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In the conventional technique, a pressure distribution sensor sheet disposed on a display is used to detect what pressure is applied to which position of the sheet. The pressure distribution sensor sheet is brought into direct contact with a part of a skin of interest for which measurement is to be performed to detect a distribution of pressure applied during massage (hereinafter, such a part will be referred as a measurement target part), and massage is performed through the pressure distribution sensor sheet. This makes it possible to detect the pressure applied to the measurement target part during the massage.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In general, the massage is performed over a rather large area such as a whole back area, a whole face area, or the like. Therefore, to accurately measure the characteristic parameters of the massage using the conventional technique, it is necessary to measure a large number of points in the measurement target part and collect a large number of measurement results, and thus a troublesome process is necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In view of the above, the size of the pressure distribution sensor sheet according to the conventional technique may be increased such that it becomes possible to obtain measurement results for a plurality of measurement target part at a time. However, there is a difference in arrangement of parts of a body (including a face) among individuals, which causes a reduction in accuracy of the measurement result.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">That is, it is difficult to easily measure the characteristic parameters of the massage with high accuracy using the conventional technique.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">One non-limiting and exemplary embodiment provides a massage measurement apparatus capable of easily measuring a characteristic parameter of massage with high accuracy.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one general aspect, the techniques disclosed here feature that a massage measurement apparatus includes a sheet member attachable to a skin of a body, and a measurement unit that measures a pressure distribution on the sheet member, wherein the sheet member has an indication that indicates an area of the skin, to which the sheet member is to be attached, and wherein the measurement unit measures the pressure distribution with reference to one or more positions on the body in a state in which the sheet member is attached to the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to the present disclosure, it is possible to easily measure a characteristic parameters of the massage with high accuracy.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">It should be noted that general or specific embodiments may be implemented as a system, a method, an integrated circuit, a computer program, a storage medium, or any selective combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Additional benefits and advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become apparent from the specification and drawings. The benefits and/or advantages may be individually obtained by the various embodiments and features of the specification and drawings, which need not all be provided in order to obtain one or more of such benefits and/or advantages.</p>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described below in detail with reference to drawings.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">A first embodiment of the present disclosure is an example of a basic aspect of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a structure of the massage measurement apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> includes a sheet member <b>110</b> and a measurement unit <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The sheet member <b>110</b> is a member attachable to a skin of a body. The sheet member <b>110</b> has an indication representing a skin area to which the sheet member <b>110</b> is to be attached. For example, the skin area corresponds to positions of parts of a body (one or more positions on the body).</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The measurement unit <b>120</b> measures a distribution of pressure applied to the sheet member <b>110</b>. The measurement unit <b>120</b> measures the pressure distribution using positions of parts of the body (one or more positions on the body) as reference positions in a state in which the sheet member <b>110</b> is attached to the area described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> includes, although not illustrated, for example, a central processing unit (CPU), a storage medium such as a read only memory (ROM) in which a control program is stored, a random access memory (RAM) or the like serving as a work memory, a pressure sensor, and the like. In this configuration, the function of the measurement unit <b>120</b> is realized by executing the control program by the CPU.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> configured in the above-described manner allows a massage massage reception person or a massage therapist or a measurement operator to easily attach the sheet member <b>110</b> to the skin area to which the sheet member <b>110</b> is to be attached. Furthermore, it becomes possible for the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> to measure the pressure distribution using positions of parts of the body (one or more positions on the body) as reference positions in a state in which the sheet member <b>110</b> is attached to the area described above. Thus, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is capable of easily measuring the characteristic parameters of the massage with high accuracy.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">A second embodiment of the present disclosure presents a specific example of an aspect of the present disclosure in which the sheet member is realized in the form of a face sheet that is to be attached to a face. That is, in this example, a face is the area of the body to which the massage is performed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Appearance and Configuration of Massage Measurement Apparatus</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">First, a description is given as to an external appearance and a structure of the massage measurement apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Appearance of Massage Measurement Apparatus</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the external appearance of the massage measurement apparatus according to the present embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> includes a sheet device <b>200</b> and a control unit <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The sheet device <b>200</b> is a device formed in the shape of a sheet capable of three-dimensionally covering the surface of a face and having openings formed at least at locations corresponding to eyes. The sheet device <b>200</b> is formed of an elastic sheet member as a main material. As for the sheet member serving as the main material, for example, an energy ray-curable composition material including a polyurethane polymer terminated with an acryloyl group and an acrylic monomer such as that disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-168575 may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A specific area of the skin of the body of a massage massage reception person to which the sheet member of the sheet device <b>200</b> is to be attached (hereinafter, such an area will be referred to as a target area) is, in this case, an area of a skin of a face excluding at least eye areas.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">When the sheet device <b>200</b> is attached to the target area of the face, a surface tension allows the sheet device <b>200</b> to remain in a state in the sheet device <b>200</b> is in intimate contact with the surface of the skin of the face. To ensure sufficiently high adhesion, an adhesive and biocompatible material such as spirit gum, a silicone adhesive, a latex adhesive, or the like may be additionally used.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">It is desirable to provide a plurality of sheet devices <b>200</b> with different sizes so that it is allowed to select a proper one of the sheet devices <b>200</b> depending on a size of a face. Note that the sheet device <b>200</b> may have a size slightly smaller than the size of the face to which the sheet device <b>200</b> is to be attached. That is, the sheet device <b>200</b> is produced assuming that it is expanded in a horizontal or vertical direction when it is attached to the face.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In a state in which the sheet member is attached to the target area, massage is performed on the skin in the target area via the sheet member (that is, via the sheet device <b>200</b>). It is desirable that the sheet device <b>200</b> is sufficiently thin and flexible so as to minimize inhibition against the effects of the massage on the skin. Hereinafter, the massage performed via the sheet member attached to the target area will be referred to simply as massage.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The sheet device <b>200</b> includes a plurality of pressure sensors (not illustrated) disposed on a surface of the sheet member that is in direct contact with the face (hereinafter, the surface on this side is referred to as an inner surface. The structure of the sheet device <b>200</b> including the pressure sensors and their locations will be described in further detail later.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The control unit <b>300</b> may be an information processing apparatus such as a personal computer. The control unit <b>300</b> measures the characteristic parameters of the massage by using the plurality of pressure sensors disposed on the sheet device <b>200</b>. Note that in the present embodiment, information on the characteristic parameters of the massage is information representing how large or small pressures are applied to which parts of the target area during the massage. Hereinafter, the measurement of the characteristic parameters of the massage will also be referred to simply as massage measurement. The control unit <b>300</b> is connected to the sheet device <b>200</b> via a cable <b>400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The cable <b>400</b> includes signal lines that connect the control unit <b>300</b> to the respective pressure sensors although they are not illustrated in figures.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Structure of Sheet Device</heading>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The sheet device <b>200</b> includes markers provided on a surface (an outer surface) of the sheet member opposite to the surface that is in direct contact with the face such that the markers represent points whose respective position are to be adjusted with respect to corresponding feature points of the face (hereafter also referred to as face feature points). The points whose respective positions are to be adjusted with respect to the face feature points are located close to the face feature points such as inner eye corners when the sheet device <b>200</b> is correctly attached to the target area.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an arrangement of markers on the sheet device <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the sheet device <b>200</b> includes markers <b>202</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>202</b><sub>2</sub>, <b>202</b><sub>5</sub>, <b>202</b><sub>3</sub>, and <b>202</b><sub>4 </sub>(denoted by solid dots in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) formed at locations corresponding to face feature points, that is, a left inner eye corner, a right inner eye corner, a point of jaw, an apex of a left cheekbone, an apex of a right cheekbone, and the like. That is, the sheet device <b>200</b> has markers <b>202</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>202</b><sub>5 </sub>serving as position adjust markers thereby making it possible to attach the sheet device <b>200</b> correctly to the target area. That is, the markers <b>202</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>202</b><sub>5 </sub>indicate the area of the skin (locations of parts of the face) to which the sheet device <b>200</b> is to be attached.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">For example, a massage massage reception person attaches the sheet device <b>200</b> to her/his face while expanding the sheet device <b>200</b> such that the respective markers <b>202</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>202</b><sub>5 </sub>are located close to the corresponding face feature points. This makes it possible for the massage reception person to attach the sheet device <b>200</b> correctly to the target area.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Note that in a case where the sheet device <b>200</b> has a shape representing the area of the face to which the sheet device <b>200</b> is to be attached to, as in the case of the example illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the markers are not necessarily needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">A relative coordinate system <b>203</b> for defining the locations of the pressure sensors is set based on a plurality of locations <b>202</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>202</b><sub>5 </sub>corresponding to the left inner eye corner, the right inner eye corner, the point of jaw, the apex of the left cheekbone, and the apex of the right cheekbone (the locations are the same as those of the markers in the present embodiment, but the locations are not limited to those in the present example). The relative coordinate system <b>203</b> will be described in further detail below.</p>

      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Each pressure sensor <b>210</b> detects a pressure applied to the sheet member <b>110</b> in a direction (a vertical direction in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) perpendicular to the sheet member <b>11</b>. That is, when massage is performed in a state in which the sheet device <b>200</b> is attached to the skin, the pressure sensors <b>210</b> detect pressures applied to respective corresponding parts of the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The pressure sensors <b>210</b> are disposed, for example, at intervals of d in a matrix such that one pressure sensor <b>210</b> is located in each one of imaginal subareas produced by conceptually dividing a part or all of the sheet member <b>110</b> (target area). The length d is, for example, equal to one eighth of the distance between the position <b>202</b><sub>1 </sub>corresponding to the and the position <b>202</b><sub>2 </sub>corresponding to the right inner eye corner in a state in which the sheet device <b>200</b> is not expanded, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">That is, each subarea has its own pressure sensor <b>210</b> disposed therein thereby making it possible to measure a pressure applied to the subarea. The each pressure sensor <b>210</b> output a measured pressure value.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As for each pressure sensor <b>210</b>, for example, a pressure sensor realized using an organic thin film transistor disclosed, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2007-178256 may be employed. Alternatively, as for each pressure sensor <b>210</b>, a pressure sensor realized using an organic thin film transistor formed in the shape of a flexible sheet disclosed, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2013-168575 may be employed. The organic thin film transistors described above are disposed such that the transistors are connected to a circuit board via conductors formed of a base material having elasticity.</p>

      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">For example, the relative coordinate system <b>203</b> is set in a plane including positions <b>202</b><sub>3 </sub>to <b>202</b><sub>5 </sub>(see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) respectively corresponding to the point of jaw, the apex of the left cheekbone, and the apex of the right cheekbone, such that an x axis passes through the positions <b>202</b><sub>3 </sub>and <b>202</b><sub>4 </sub>and a y axis is perpendicular to the x axis and passes through the position <b>202</b><sub>5</sub>. The unit of the coordinate value in the relative coordinate system <b>203</b> is based on the distance between the left inner eye corner and the right inner eye corner in the plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The relative coordinate system <b>203</b> defined in the above-described manner is not influenced by a difference in positions of face parts (face feature points) among individuals, and thus use of the relative coordinate system <b>203</b> makes it possible to give a spatially normalized expression of the distribution of the pressure applied to the skin during the massage. Thus by using the relative coordinate system <b>203</b>, it becomes possible to accurately measure the characteristic parameter of massage in such a manner that the measured result is applicable to a face of another person.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Furthermore, by referring to the correspondence relationship <b>510</b>, it becomes possible to map the pressure values measured by the respective pressure sensors <b>210</b> into the relative coordinate system <b>203</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The storage unit <b>310</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is also used as required by the acquisition unit <b>320</b> and the correction unit <b>330</b>, which will be described later, and various kinds of information such as information representing the measured characteristic parameters of the massage are stored in the storage unit <b>310</b>. The storage unit <b>310</b> preferably includes a frame memory serving as a memory area for storing the pressure values mapped to the relative coordinate system <b>203</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The acquisition unit <b>320</b> is connected to the respective first to L-th pressure sensors <b>210</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>210</b><sub>L </sub>via the cable <b>400</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) that connects the control unit <b>300</b> to the sheet device <b>200</b> and via high-elasticity signal lines (not illustrated) embedded in the sheet device <b>200</b>. Thus, the acquisition unit <b>320</b> is capable of outputting a control signal to each pressure sensor <b>210</b> to control the operation of the pressure sensor <b>210</b> and is capable of receiving an input of a pressure value output from each pressure sensor <b>210</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The acquisition unit <b>320</b> maps the pressure values output from the respective pressure sensors <b>210</b> onto the relative coordinate system <b>203</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>) while referring to the correspondence relationship <b>510</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The acquisition unit <b>320</b> stores a set of mapped pressure values at each time (hereinafter, such a set of values will be referred to as a time-specific pressure value distribution) in the storage unit <b>310</b> in relation to information representing the time t at which the pressure values were measured (hereinafter referred to as a measurement time).</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The measurement time t represents, for example, a time elapsed since a particular reference time such as a time at which a sequence of massage operations is started. The acquisition unit <b>320</b> performs the measurement of the pressure values using the first to L-th pressure sensors <b>210</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>210</b><sub>L </sub>and the mapping thereof at every predetermined time interval dt. Thus, the sequence of time-specific pressure value distributions along the time axis is integrated together on the time axis thereby obtaining information representing the pressure distribution in the massage expressed by a combination of the coordinate values in the relative coordinate system <b>203</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), the values along the time axis, and the pressure values. Hereinafter, the sequence of time-specific pressure value distributions is referred to as pressure distribution information.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The correction unit <b>330</b> corrects the pressure distribution information representing the result of the measurement by the first to L-th pressure sensors <b>210</b><sub>1 </sub>to <b>210</b><sub>L </sub>so as to more accurately characteristic parameter values of the actual massage, and the correction unit <b>330</b> stores the corrected pressure distribution information as the final characteristic parameters of the massage.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">More specifically, the correction unit <b>330</b> corrects each time-specific pressure value distribution stored in the storage unit <b>310</b>, individually for each level of the pressure value, such that an area corresponding to the level of interest form a closed area having a smooth contour.

      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The detection value output from each pressure sensor <b>210</b> may include noise caused by a manner of attaching the sheet device <b>200</b> to the skin or caused by a detection error. That is, the time-specific pressure value distribution may locally have a pressure value higher or lower than a correct value corresponding to the characteristic parameter of the actual massage. By performing the distribution correction process, it is possible to correct the measurement result so as to obtain characteristic parameter values more accurately representing the actual massage. The distribution correction process will be described in further detail later.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The control unit <b>300</b> includes, for example, a CPU, a storage medium such as a ROM in which a control program is stored, and a work memory such as a RAM, although they are not illustrated in the figure.

The acquisition unit <b>320</b> receives an input of massage identification information, for example, from the massage therapist or the measurement operator.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">In the state in which the sheet device <b>200</b> is attached to the target area, there is a possibility that a pressure caused by a tension or the like is detected even when no massage is being performed. In view of the above, the acquisition unit <b>320</b> may acquire an initial value of a pressure value from each pressure sensor <b>210</b> to make it possible to correct a measurement result obtained later based on the initial value. This makes it possible to measure the characteristic parameter of massage with higher accuracy.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The acquisition unit <b>320</b> starts counting, using a timer (not illustrated) or the like, a measurement time t with reference to a time at which the massage is started.

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In step S<b>1500</b>, the correction unit <b>330</b> corrects the stored time-specific pressure value distribution (pressure distribution information) for each measurement time t. The distribution correction process will be described in further detail later.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">According to the embodiments, as described above, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> includes the sheet member <b>110</b> having the indication representing the area of a skin to which the sheet member <b>110</b> is to be attached, measures the pressure distribution applied to the sheet member <b>110</b> using the relative coordinate system defined based on the locations of particular parts of the face (one or more positions on the face).</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">Thus the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> is capable of easily measuring what magnitude of the pressure is applied to what part of the face at which timing for a relatively large area without being influenced by a difference in locations of parts (face feature points) of the face among individuals. That is, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> is capable of easily measuring the characteristic parameter of the massage with high accuracy.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">Modifications of the Embodiments</heading>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">The relative coordinate system used to represent the pressure distribution is not limited to the example described above. For example, the relative coordinate system may be defined based on positions of other face parts (one or more positions of the face) such as ends of eyebrows, eye tails, or the like. The massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> does not necessarily need to use a relative coordinate system. For example, in a case where a relative position of each pressure sensor <b>210</b> with respect to a face feature point is known, the detection value of each pressure sensor <b>210</b> may is stored or output in relation with only identification information of each pressure sensor <b>210</b>. On the other hand, in a case where the target area of massage is limited to a particular area (for example, the target area of massage is not the whole face area but a limited area close to an eye), the relative coordinate system may be defined with respect to one position (for example, a middle point between a left inner eye corner and a right inner eye corner). In this case, only one marker may be provided on the sheet device (for example, a marker may be formed on the sheet device at the middle point between two eyes).</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">Furthermore, the area (target area) to which the sheet member <b>110</b> of the sheet device <b>200</b> is attached is not limited to an area of a skin of a face. For example, the target area may be a whole back area, a calf, a feet bottom, or other areas of a skin of a body. Alternatively, the target area may be an area including three ore more feature points, which are common among many general people, of a body.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">Furthermore, the massage to be measured is not limited to massage performed by a person with a hand or a finger. That is, the massage measurement apparatus is capable of measuring other types of massage such as massage performed using various kinds of massage tools, massage performed using a massage apparatus such as a massage chair, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">The method of the distribution correction process is not limited to the example described above. For example, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> may smooth a pressure value distribution in a plane of a relative coordinate system or along a time axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">The measurement may be limited to only part of a sequence of massage operation. For example, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> may measure only a pressure value distribution at a certain time to acquire a pressure distribution applied to a skin at that time.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">The massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> may present information indicating a type of massage to be performed and measured, and/or information that prompts a massage therapist to stop the massage or correct the characteristic parameters of the massage.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">For example, it is not very desirable to perform massage excessively. In view of the above, the massage measurement apparatus <b>100</b> may monitor the temperature of the skin, the blood flow rate, or the like.
