      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to food containers and eating utensils adapted for use by a user, and more particularly, to a hybrid apparatus or âpoduleâ that is reconfigurable from a food container, in a first configuration, to at least a second configuration that presents an eating utensil.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Food containers, such as condiment packets, are well known and long standing staples of the food processing and distribution arts. They enable a food item housed therein to remain esculent; and they enable individualized serving, storage, and shipping. The food item may be an appurtenance, such as a spice, jam, jelly, butter, or sauce, that is added to a food, such as a sandwich, biscuit, toast, or coffee; or it may be consumed by itself. Where use of the food item is desired, conventional containers are typically opened, expelled of their contents, and then discarded. Likewise, eating utensils are well known and long standing manual tools that aid users in the preparation and consumption of foods. Spoons, forks, and knives, for example, aid in manipulating food, e.g., cutting it down to a manageable portion, gathering and lifting it to the mouth, etc. It is common for a user who wishes to consume a food, such as bread, to use one or more utensils to add or apply a food item, such as butter, to the food; for example, the food item may be spread onto the food using a spreading knife, so as to provide a layer of generally uniform thickness. The one or more eating utensils may then be used to aid in consuming the food. Thus, to consume the food as desired, the user is required to possess both a container of food item, and the necessary utensil(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">After use, plastic utensils are often discarded, adding generally non-biodegradable waste to the Earth. It is appreciated that in the U.S. alone, some 30 million tons of plastic was discarded in 2014; and of that, only 25% was recycled or converted to energy, resulting in 22.5 million tons being deposited in landfills. The Earth Institute, at Colombia University estimates that global plastic consumption is over 110 million tons a year, and that there is also 100 million tons of plastic debris floating around in oceans (Cho, R., What Happens to All That Plastic, State of the Planet, Jan. 31, 2012). This results in a readily discernable concern, given that the decomposition rate of plastic has been estimated to be 1,000 years. Of further concern, once plastic decomposes, it releases harmful pollutants to the environment.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention provides a novel apparatus or âpoduleâ operable to present a food item container in a first configuration, and at least one eating utensil in a second configuration, once the food item stored therein has been expelled. Among other things, the invention is useful for eliminating the need to possess both a container of food item and a separate eating utensil to aid in preparing and/or consuming the food when desired. As such, the invention is further useful for facilitating the consumption of food by users, reducing packaging space, and increasing the functionality of food containers. By eliminating the need for both a food container and a utensil, an often times a plastic utensil, the invention is yet further useful for effecting an environmental benefit to the Earth, and to those that rely on its health, by reducing waste, including non-biodegradable plastic waste.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">More particularly, the present invention concerns an apparatus selectively reconfigurable from a container adapted to house a food item, and to at least one eating utensil. The apparatus comprises a planar body defining at least one fold line, and portions adjacent said at least one fold line. Said at least one fold line and portions are geometrically configured such that the body defines an enclosed space in a first configuration, by folding a first subset of the portions first predetermined degrees, and a second configuration when a second subset of the portions are folded second predetermined degrees. The first and second subsets and/or degrees are incongruent. The body, when in the second configuration, presents an eating utensil manually manipulable and operable to facilitate the preparation or consumption of food by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the body is formed of a bio-degradable material, and is able to achieve second and third configurations that present different utensils. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment(s) and the accompanying drawing figures.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the present invention concerns a hybrid apparatus or âpoduleâ <b>10</b> operable to achieve a first stable configuration, wherein it functions as a container for storing a food item <b>12</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>), and a second stable configuration, wherein it functions as an eating utensil. The food item <b>12</b> may be any edible substance, including solids (e.g., grain, spices, cereal, etc.), liquids (e.g., sauces, cream, etc.), or emulsions (e.g., jam, jelly, mayonnaise, butter, etc.). The podule <b>10</b> is adapted for manual use and transformation by a user <b>14</b>; and as such, is preferably sized and configured, so as to be manually manipulated. The podule <b>10</b> is preferably for single use, and as such, is preferably sized and configured to expel its entire serving of the food item <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The eating utensil that the podule <b>10</b> forms may be any eating or food preparatory utensil operable to facilitate the preparation or consumption of food by the user <b>14</b>, including but not limited to any of a variety of spoons or scoops (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>), knives (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>), spatulas, forks, cups, straws, bowls, or combinations thereof. To that end, it is appreciated that the illustrated embodiment presents a podule <b>10</b> operable to achieve spoon-like, and knife-like configurations; it is further appreciated, however, that one of ordinary skill in the art may achieve other utensils or spoons and knives of different configurations by changing the geometric configuration of the podule <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The preferred podule <b>10</b> is formed from a planar body <b>16</b> that is bent, folded, or otherwise manipulated to form the first and second configurations. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the body <b>16</b> may define at least one, and more preferably a plurality of fold lines <b>18</b>, and flat portions <b>20</b> adjacent the fold line(s) <b>18</b>, and the first and second configurations may be achieved by folding first and second subsets of the portions <b>20</b> first and second predetermined degrees respectively. It is appreciated that the first and second subsets and/or degrees are incongruent (i.e., the body <b>16</b> must be reconfigured to achieve the second configuration). The fold lines <b>18</b> are configured to facilitate folding, and may present a reduced thickness in comparison to the remainder of the body <b>16</b>. The preferred fold lines <b>18</b> are demarked as such by a solid line, so as to guide the user <b>14</b> in transforming the podule <b>10</b>. Additionally, indicia as to the contents inside and/or source of the container may be provided on the outside of the podule <b>10</b>, in addition to fold lines and instructions, when in the first configuration (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In the illustrated embodiment, the body <b>16</b> in its planar state presents a symmetrical shape comprising a central conical area <b>22</b>, and lateral wing areas <b>24</b>. The central area <b>22</b> presents an inverted cone extending four inches in length, and having a diameter of two inches at its rounded end. The central area or cone <b>22</b> defines a fold line <b>18</b><i>a </i>along the lateral center line of the podule <b>10</b>, and sloped fold lines <b>18</b><i>b </i>along the extremities of the cone. The wing areas or wings <b>24</b> run adjacent the sloped fold lines <b>18</b><i>b </i>and converge at the pointed tip of the cone <b>22</b>. Each of the illustrated wings <b>24</b> defines parallel sides, a half circle <b>24</b><i>a </i>having a one inch diameter adjacent the pointed tip, and a circular or elliptical sector <b>24</b><i>b </i>at the opposite end (<figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref>). The sectors <b>24</b><i>b </i>are sized and configured to predominately overlay the rounded end when the podule <b>10</b> is in the first configuration (<figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>). The wing areas <b>24</b> define vertical fold lines <b>18</b><i>c </i>that extend from the outside of the half circle <b>24</b><i>a </i>to the tangent of the sector <b>24</b><i>b </i>and rounded end of the cone <b>22</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wings present a span of 3.0625 inches, and a secondary near-vertical fold line <b>18</b><i>d </i>that extends from the outside of the half circle <b>24</b><i>a </i>to a point along the sloped fold line <b>18</b><i>b </i>near the tangent.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The fold lines <b>18</b> and portions <b>20</b> are geometrically configured such that the body <b>16</b> is caused to define an enclosed space (not shown) in a first configuration (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), by folding a first subset of the portions first predetermined degrees. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the body <b>16</b> is caused to achieve the first configuration and form the food container by folding the wing areas <b>24</b> ninety degrees until the half circles <b>24</b><i>a </i>are brought adjacent. It is appreciated that the half-circles <b>24</b><i>a </i>in this configuration provide a container handle that enables the podule <b>10</b> to be pinched using only two fingers (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Next, the wings <b>24</b> are themselves folded ninety degrees along the vertical lines <b>18</b><i>c </i>until the outer edges are brought adjacent, forming a seam therebetween. The sectors <b>24</b><i>b </i>are then caused to overlay the rounded end of the cone <b>22</b> to form a podule lid tab that facilitates opening. Once the first configuration is achieved the adjacent half circles <b>24</b><i>a, </i>the seam, and the sectors-cone overlay may be bonded (or equivalent), and more preferably, caused to form a hermetically sealed internal space, depending upon the type of food item <b>12</b> to be housed. It is appreciated that the food item <b>12</b> may be placed in the space defined by the podule <b>10</b> prior to sealing the lid. In the first configuration (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), it is appreciated that due to its geometric shape, a plurality of podules <b>10</b> may be efficiently assembled or aggregated to facilitate packaging, storage, and shipping (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">To achieve the second configuration, which presents a first eating utensil (<figref>FIGS. 5</figref><i>c</i>), a second subset of the portions <b>20</b> are folded second predetermined degrees. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, once the podule <b>10</b> is in the first configuration, and the lid has been opened, so as to expel the food item <b>12</b>, the body <b>16</b> may be caused to achieve the second configuration by collapsing the space along the cone-wing interface, while the half circles remain bonded <b>24</b><i>a. </i>More particularly, the user <b>14</b> uses his fingers to press against the lateral sides of the podule <b>10</b>. This causes the cone <b>22</b> to fold in half along the central fold line <b>18</b><i>a, </i>and the wings <b>24</b> to lay flat against each other (compare <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref><i>a</i>). The top of the wings <b>24</b> and sectors <b>24</b><i>b </i>are then separated from the remainder of the body <b>16</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>), by manually tearing or cutting the wings <b>24</b> along the vertical fold lines <b>18</b><i>c. </i>To facilitate this step, the vertical fold lines <b>18</b><i>c </i>preferably present perforated cut lines, which are preferably demarked as such by broken or dashed lines. After bifurcating the wings <b>24</b>, the remainder of the body <b>16</b> may be opened by unfolding the cone <b>22</b> along the central fold line <b>18</b><i>a. </i>The remaining wing sections traverse the planes formed by the cone <b>22</b>, so as to enclose at least a portion of the inner space on three sides, thus presenting a spoon or scoop (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>). Functionality is improved by folding the remainder wings <b>24</b> along the near-vertical fold lines <b>18</b><i>d, </i>so as to further enclose the space. The spoon or scoop <b>10</b> defines a partially enclosed cavity operable to retain a quantity of food when oriented upright.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">More preferably, the podule <b>10</b> is operable to achieve second and third configurations that present different utensils. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the podule <b>10</b> is able achieve a third configuration, which presents a spreading knife (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>). More particularly, to achieve the third configuration, and starting from the second configuration, the remaining wings <b>24</b> are folded inwardly, and more preferably, 180 degrees inwardly, along their near-vertical lines <b>18</b><i>d, </i>so as to form superjacent wing layers. Likewise, the cone <b>22</b> and remaining wings are folded along the central fold line <b>18</b><i>a </i>to collapse the body <b>16</b> and preferably form superjacent conical layers. Where manually held in this third configuration, the podule <b>10</b> forms a knife having a handle section <b>26</b> and a food engaging or spreading section <b>28</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>). At the spreading section <b>28</b>, the halved rounded end of the cone <b>22</b> forms a curvilinear edge, such that the section <b>28</b> is operable to pierce and cut soft foods, as well as spread viscous food items <b>12</b> (e.g., mayonnaise, soft butter, jelly, etc.). Creased, filleted, or chamfered edges are preferably provided to create an ergonomic tool for spoon and knife functions. More preferably, the body <b>16</b> may be treated so as to further improve the functioning of the utensil. For example, a cardboard body <b>16</b> may be compressed and corrugated along at least a portion of the curvilinear edge, so as to imitate a serrated edge when used as a knife.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The body <b>16</b> is preferably formed of a pliable material suitable for the intended purpose, as readily selectable by one of ordinary skill in the art. Such materials include durable paper, cardboard, organic composites, degradable plastics, foil sheets, and combinations thereof. More preferably, the body <b>16</b> is formed of a bio-degradable material such as durable cardboard, so as to effect an environmental benefit to the Earth. The preferred podule <b>10</b> may further include a protective, internal layer <b>30</b> fixedly attached to the body <b>16</b>, and disposed intermediate the body <b>16</b> and space in the first configuration, so as to space the food item <b>12</b> from the body <b>16</b>. The layer <b>30</b> is cooperatively configured with the food item <b>12</b>, so as to be non-reactive, and otherwise safe for use therewith. For example, the internal layer <b>30</b> may include a non-absorbing, and non-reactive coating, film, sheet, or bladder. Finally, in the illustrated embodiment, the exterior of the container is presented by one side of the planar body <b>16</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>), which facilitates the placement of indicia and the protective layer <b>30</b> on opposite sides prior to folding; further, it is appreciated that the exterior of the container forms the exterior of the utensil, which minimizes contact between the user <b>14</b> and remnants of the food item <b>12</b> when handling the utensil.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The preferred forms of the invention described above are to be used as illustration only, and should not be utilized in a limiting sense in interpreting the scope of the present invention. For example, as described, the podule <b>10</b> may present utensil surfaces having a rounded edge which functions as a spoon-like or knife-like utensil depending on the angle or position of use; however, the edge is not limited to the forms depicted and may present other regular (geometric) or irregular shapes. Obvious modifications to the exemplary embodiments and methods of operation, as set forth herein, could be readily made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The inventors hereby state their intent to rely on the Doctrine of Equivalents to determine and assess the reasonably fair scope of the present invention as pertains to any system or method not materially departing from but outside the literal scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
