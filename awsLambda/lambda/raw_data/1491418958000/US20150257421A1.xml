      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a shrimp flavor composition that contains 1,5-octadien-3-one and/or 1,5-octadien-3-ol, and to a food, a drink or a seasoning that contains the shrimp flavor composition, and further relates to a shrimp flavor enhancer that contains 1,5-octadien-3-one and/or 1,5-octadien-3-ol, and to a food, a drink or a seasoning that contains the shrimp flavor enhancer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Conventionally, shrimp flavor compositions use materials, for example, such as (1) a crustacean extract, (2) a crustacean oleoresin, (3) a seasoning oil, (4) a supercritical carbon dioxide gas extract of crustacean, (5) a fractionated flavoring, and (6) a synthetic flavoring, and one or more of these may be appropriately combined and prepared according to the intended use to obtain a shrimp flavor composition (Non Patent Literature 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As flavor characteristics desired for a shrimp flavor composition, a natural flavor characteristic of shrimp, and a flavor characteristic that evokes a perception of boiled flavor or a perception of roast flavor that stimulates appetite in harmony with a dish are required.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Patent Literature 1 proposes, as a stronger and more desirable crustacean flavor composition, a crustacean flavor composition characterized in that materials are classified into 12 categories: (A) hydrocarbons, (B) alcohols, (C) phenols, (D) aldehydes, (E) ketones, (F) esters, (G) lactones, (H) carboxylic acids, (I) furan compounds, (J) nitrogen-containing compounds, (K) sulfur-containing compounds, and (L) flavorings of natural origin, and at least one, preferably two or more materials selected from a group composed of these (A) to (L) are appropriately mixed with amino acids.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">However, it is rarely the case that a shrimp flavor composition prepared by directly replicating the quantitative analysis data of odor components is usable as a composition with the intended shrimp flavor, and usually, satisfying flavor was not able to be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Generally used synthetic flavoring-based shrimp flavors are designed flavors that highlight or elaborate the characteristic odor of shrimp by finding the specific odor components of shrimp through odor analyses. Specifically, the intended shrimp can be recognized by using a shrimp flavor composition in combination with a color and a taste of a final product relating shrimp, and the desired shrimp flavor could not be reproduced by the flavor itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">As noted above, in order to prepare desired shrimp flavor compositions, they were often composed of, mainly, materials such as (1) a crustacean extract, (2) a crustacean oleoresin, (3) a seasoning oil, (4) a supercritical carbon dioxide gas extract of crustacean, (5) a fractionated flavoring, and (6) a synthetic flavoring. However, because shrimp flavor compositions using such materials are of low potency, novel materials are needed and there was room for improvement for the preparation of a composition for obtaining a stronger and more desirable shrimp flavor.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Compounds such as 1,5-octadien-3-one and 1,5-octadien-3-ol are known as odor components, as noted above. However, use for imparting or enhancing a shrimp flavor was not known.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">It is accordingly a first object of the present invention to provide a shrimp flavor composition and a shrimp flavor enhancer that can provide a more desirable shrimp flavor. A further object of the present invention is such as to provide a variety of food, drink or a seasoning that uses the composition or the enhancer, and to impart a shrimp flavor to a food, a drink and a seasoning, or enhance it with the use of the composition and the enhancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As used in the present specification, âdesirable shrimp flavorâ means that flavor characteristics (shrimp flavor) are more desirable, that evoke such as a flavor of a soup that results from boiling shrimp or the flavor that results from sauteing shrimp (a perception of boiled flavor), a flavor of fried shrimp that results from frying shrimp with oil (a  perception of fried flavor), and a flavor of roast shrimp that results from roasting shrimp (a perception of roast flavor).</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The present inventors conducted intensive studies to find a solution to the foregoing problems, and found that a shrimp flavor composition obtained by mixing 1,5-octadien-3-one and/or 1,5-octadien-3-ol surprisingly has a shrimp flavor with strong flavor and body, and an excellent roast flavor, resulted in completion of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Specifically, the present invention relates to the following (1) to (12).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0000">(1) A shrimp flavor composition containing at least one of 1,5-octadien-3-one and 1,5-octadien-3-ol. <br /> (2) The shrimp flavor composition according to (1), containing a shrimp flavor selected from a boiled flavor, a fried flavor, and a roast flavor. <br /> (3) The shrimp flavor composition according to (1) or (2), in which a total content of the 1,5-octadien-3-one and the 1,5-octadien-3-ol is 0.001 ppm to 1000 ppm by mass. <br /> (4) A food, a drink or a seasoning, containing the shrimp flavor composition according to any one of (1) to (3). <br /> (5) A method for imparting a shrimp flavor to a food, a drink or a seasoning, in which the shrimp flavor composition according to any one of (1) to (3) is added. <br /> (6) A method for enhancing a shrimp flavor of a food, a drink or a seasoning, the method including adding the shrimp flavor composition according to any one of (1) to (3). <br /> (7) A shrimp flavor enhancer, containing at least one of 1,5-octadien-3-one and 1,5-octadien-3-ol. <br /> (8) The shrimp flavor enhancer according to (7), which enhances a shrimp flavor selected from a boiled flavor, a fried flavor, and a roast flavor. <br /> (9) A food, a drink or a seasoning, containing the shrimp flavor enhancer according to (7) or (8).

All panelists rated the shrimp flavor oils of Test Examples 1-2 to 1-7 as notably having a roundness and a richness with a sense of harmony, and having enduring shrimp flavor. The shrimp flavor oils of Test Examples 1-4 to 1-6 were particularly found to have a desirable shrimp flavor. On the other hand, all panelists rated that the shrimp flavor oil of Test Example 1-1 did not sufficiently develop a perception of shrimp flavor and that the shrimp flavor oil of Test Example 1-8 was undesirable because of the odorant note that was different from a shrimp flavor.</p>
