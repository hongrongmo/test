      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0024">Example embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings; however, they may be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey exemplary implementations to those skilled in the art.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0026">An adhesive composition for polarizing plates according to an embodiment may include a (meth)acrylic copolymer and a biphenyl group-containing photocuring agent. As used herein, the term â(meth)acrylâ may be interpreted as âacrylâ and/or âmethacrylâ. The biphenyl group-containing photocuring agent may include a biphenyl group and a photocurable functional group. The biphenyl group may increase cohesion, toughness, and modulus of an adhesive layer for polarizing plates.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0027">The photocurable functional group may undergo curing reaction with the (meth)acrylic copolymer, thereby improving cohesion, toughness, and modulus of an adhesive layer for polarizing plates. As a result, the adhesive composition for polarizing plates may form an adhesive layer that may prevent the polarizing plates from suffering from peeling, dragging, bubbling, cracking, and shrinkage, or reduce the likelihood thereof, thereby providing high durability and eliminating or reducing light leakage.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0028">The photocurable functional group may be a (meth)acrylate group. For instance, the biphenyl group-containing photocuring agent may be a polyfunctional (meth)acrylic monomer, for example, a bi- or higher functional (meth)acrylic monomer, or, for example a bi- or tri-functional (meth)acrylic monomer.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0029">By way of example, the biphenyl group-containing photocuring agent may be represented by Formula 1:</p>

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0097">The prepared adhesive compositions for polarizing plates were evaluated as to the following properties. Results are shown in Table 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0098">Evaluation of Properties</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0099">(1) Light leakage: In Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3, the adhesive composition was coated on a polarizing plate to a thickness of 20 Î¼m, followed by drying at 90Â° C. for 4 minutes. Then, the adhesive composition was UV cured by exposure using a Lichtzen UV lamp. In Comparative Example 4, the adhesive composition was coated onto a polarizing plate to a thickness of 20 Î¼M, followed by aging at 35Â° C./45% RH for 5 days, thereby curing the adhesive. The cured sample was cut into 125 mmÃ100 mm (lengthÃwidth, 7 inches) specimens, which were stacked on a glass substrate. The specimens for measurement of light leakage were stacked on both sides of the glass substrate such that optical absorption axes of the polarizing plate were perpendicular to each other. The specimens were maintained at 323K for 1,000 seconds in an autoclave under vacuum in order to obtain good adhesion. The specimens were left at 80Â° C. for 250 hours or at 60Â° C. and 90% RH for 250 hours (moist-heat resistance conditions) and then left at 25Â° C. for 1 hour or more before use thereof. After operating a liquid crystal display using the sample, brightness at the front side of the display panel was measured at a height of 1 m using a brightness tester (RISA, Hiland Co., Ltd.). Specifically, brightness {circle around (c)} at the central region of the panel and brightnesses {circle around (a)}, {circle around (b)}, {circle around (d)}, and {circle around (e)} at corners of the panel at which light leakage occurred were measured. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, brightness measuring points were placed at midpoints of sides of the panel. Here, each side of the panel adjoined the circumference of a circle for brightness measurement having a radius of 0.5 cm. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, {circle around (a)}, {circle around (b)}, {circle around (c)}, {circle around (d)} and {circle around (e)} indicate brightness measuring points. The degree of light leakage (ÎL) was quantified according to the following Equation 1. A lower ÎL value means better light leakage characteristics, which are evaluated according to the following criteria. Light leakage was measured for 7 inches and obtained as a ÎL value according to Equation 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]Î<i>L</i>=[(<i>a+b+d+e</i>)/4]/<i>câ</i>1ââ[Equation 1][/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0100">In Equation 1, a, b, d and e are brightness values measured at the edge portions {circle around (a)}, {circle around (b)}, {circle around (d)} and {circle around (e)} corresponding to brightness measurement points of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, respectively, and c is a brightness value at the center {circle around (c)} before reliability testing.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0101">â¯: No light leakage, ÎL of 0 to 0.1.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0102">Î: Low light leakage, ÎL of greater than 0.1 to 0.7.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0103">X: Significant light leakage, ÎL of greater than 0.7.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0104">(2) Durability: The adhesive-coated polarizing plates were cut into 10 cmÃ8 cm specimens, which were attached to a liquid crystal display or a glass substrate, followed by compression at 50Â° C. and 3.5 atm. The prepared specimens were left at 85Â° C. for 250 hours (heat resistant conditions) or at 60Â° C./95% RH for 250 hours (moist-heat resistance conditions), and then left at 25Â° C. for 1 hour or more before use thereof. Durability was evaluated by observing whether the specimens suffered from bubbling or peeling at the ends thereof. Evaluation criteria were as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0105">â¯: Neither bubbling nor peeling</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0106">Î: Slight bubbling or peeling</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0107">X: Significant bubbling or peeling</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0108">(3) Storage modulus and loss modulus (Pa): Each of the prepared adhesives for polarizing plates was applied to a polyethylene terephthalate release film, followed by drying at 90Â° C. for 4 minutes, thereby preparing an adhesive sheet having a 20 Î¼m thick adhesive layer. The prepared adhesive sheet was irradiated with UV at 1,000 mJ, thereby curing the adhesive layer. Several cured adhesive layers were stacked one above another to form a 1 mm thick adhesive sheet, which was then cut into a circular specimen having a diameter of 8 mm. Storage modulus and loss modulus of the specimen were measured using a storage modulus tester model MCR-501 (Physica Co., Ltd.) through frequency sweep testing at 30Â° C. and 85Â° C. and a frequency of 0.1 to 100 rad/s.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0109">(4) Peel strength (gf/25 mm): 180Â° peel strength between the adhesive composition and a glass substrate was measured in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS) 2107. The adhesive composition was coated onto a base film and dried such that the resultant adhesive layer had a thickness of 5 Î¼m. The adhesive layer was subject to aging under conditions of 35Â° C./45% RH to prepare a sample. The sample was cut into 25 mmÃ100 mm (widthÃlength) specimens, which were stacked on a glass substrate. Peel strength was measured using a tensile tester (e.g., a texture analyzer). The adhesive layer and glass substrate of each of the specimens were connected to upper and lower jigs, respectively, in a 30 kgf load cell. Then, peeling was performed at a tensile speed of 300 mm/min, and load at the time of peeling was measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0110">(5) Creep (Î¼m): After drying the adhesive composition, the adhesive composition was coated onto a polarizing plate such that the resultant adhesive layer had a thickness of 25 Î¼m. The adhesive layer was subject to aging under conditions of 35Â° C./45% RH to prepare a sample. The adhesive layer-coated polarizing plate was attached to a glass plate such that the contact area therebetween was 1.5 cmÃ1.5 cm (widthÃlength), and was left at 25Â° C. for 3 days, thereby preparing a specimen. Creep of the adhesive layer was measured using a universal testing machine (UTM) by applying a force of 2.250 kgf to the test specimen for 1,000 seconds and measuring the pushed distance (Î¼m).</p>

      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0111">As shown in Table 3, the adhesive compositions for polarizing plates according to Examples 1-5 were photocurable and exhibited good durability and excellent improvement in terms of light leakage under heat resistance and moist-heat resistance conditions. Further, the adhesive composition according to Examples 1-5 had desired modulus and peel strength within a predetermined range, thereby forming a semi-IPN (semi-interpenetrating polymer network) structure that has good balance between high modulus domain and flexible domain.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0112">Conversely, the adhesive compositions of Comparative Examples 1 to 3, which included a fluorene structure, bisphenol A, or an aliphatic structure as a photocuring agent, respectively, suffered from light leakage and poor durability. In addition, the adhesive composition of Comparative Example 4, which included a typical heat-curing agent, suffered from light leakage.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0113">By way of summation and review, acrylic copolymers contained in an adhesive for polarizing plates may be prepared by free radical polymerization. However, the acrylic copolymers prepared in this way may exhibit a high polydispersity index (PDI) and copolymers having a low molecular weight may be contained in the adhesive for polarizing plates. As a result, the polarizing plates may suffer from peeling, dragging, bubbling, cracking, or the like, thereby causing deterioration in durability. In addition, typical acrylic copolymers have disadvantages in minimization of light leakage.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0114">Embodiments provide an adhesive composition for polarizing plates, a polarizing plate including an adhesive layer formed of the same, and an optical display including the same. The adhesive composition provides an adhesive layer that minimizes light leakage and provides high durability, thereby preventing the polarizing plates from suffering from peeling, dragging, bubbling, cracking, shrinkage, or the like.</p>
