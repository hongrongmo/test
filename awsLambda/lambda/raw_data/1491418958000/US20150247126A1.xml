      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-039524 filed on Feb. 28, 2014 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method and a material for culturing induced pluripotent stem cells while their sternness is maintained, and in particular to a method and a material that enable rapid growth of the induced pluripotent stem cells with suppressed differentiation without using feeder cells, which have been used in conventional culture methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An induced pluripotent stem cell (hereinafter also called iPS cell) can be obtained by inducing four genes, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, into a somatic cell to initialize the somatic cell. iPS cells have differentiation potential to three kinds of germ layers that is equivalent to that of embryonic stem cells (called ES cells). An existing important task is to cause rapid growth of a large number of iPS cells maintained in undifferentiated state.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">General culture methods that have been established for iPS cells include a method using mouse or human cellular components (using a feeder cell sheet) and a method using a living biological (mouse) raw material (using BD Matrigel (registered trademark), which is a feeder-free method). These methods strongly depend on biological properties of a culture substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">On the other hand, it has been known that the surface chemical properties and mechanical properties of a cell culture substrate are important factors involved in not only speeding-up (increase in the efficiency and growth rate) of the cell culture but also lineage determination on stem cell differentiation. For example, a cell culture apparatus including an elastomer having Young's modulus in a certain range (Patent Document 1), and a method of introducing differentiation of a cluster of mesenchymal stem cells, the method using a coated polyacrylamide gel having a rigidity in a certain range (Patent Document 2).</p>

      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-540805 (JP 2009-540805 A)</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Patent Document 2: Patent Application Publication No. 2010-532166 (JP 2010-532166 A)</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The methods that mainly use biological cellular materials, such as methods using feeder cells or Matrigel as described above, can involve contamination by another protein or other substances and latent harmful pathogens, so that the safety of such materials is uncertain inside a human body. Thus, it cannot be said that these methods are suitable as culture methods for clinical application of iPS cells to humans.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The following describes a culture method of the present invention and a culture substrate used in the culture method, which are optimally designed for rapid growth of iPS cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The inventors of the present invention have found that the rapid growth of iPS cells can be achieved by, in designing a hydrogel substrate for culturing iPS cells, optimizing the surface elastic modulus of the gel and optimizing the density of cell adhesion proteins immobilized on the gel surface, thereby accomplishing the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In the present invention, a cell culture substrate is used in which cell adhesion proteins are immobilized at a certain density on a surface of an elasticity-variable gel having a certain surface elastic modulus.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">[Elasticity-Variable Gel]</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As the elasticity-variable gel, a gel can be used which includes, for example, a biopolymer such as collagen, gelatin, chitin, chitosan, alginic acid, and hyaluronic acid, and a synthetic polymer such as polyacrylamide, polydimethylsiloxane, and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and is formed by giving an appropriate cell adhesion property and controlling a degree of cross-linking.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The degree of cross-linking can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of a cross-linking agent, the reaction temperature, the reaction time, etc. When photoreaction is utilized for the cross-linking reaction, the degree of cross-linking can also be controlled by adjusting the intensity of irradiated light and the irradiation time, whereby the elastic modulus of the gel can be designed.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The elasticity-variable gel has an elastic modulus larger than 1 kPa and smaller than 100 MPa, preferably 10 kPa or larger and smaller than 10 MPa, and more preferably 10 kPa or larger and smaller than 1 MPa. For example, it is preferable to use a gel having an elastic modulus of 30 kPa, 40 kPa, 50 kPa, 60 kPa, 70 kPa, 80 kPa, or 90 kPa. In a case of a photocurable gelatin gel described below, its elastic modulus is suitably larger than 20 kPa and smaller than 100 kPa, preferably 30 kPa or larger and 90 kPa or smaller, and more preferably 40 kPa or larger and 60 kPa or smaller.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The use of such a gel having an elastic modulus of the above-stated numerical ranges can achieve far better rapid growth of iPS cells than growth of iPS cells in the culture system using existing Matrigel (registered trademark by Becton, Dickinson and Company), while their sternness such as undifferentiation property is maintained. It is not preferable to use a gel having an elastic modulus out of the above-stated numerical ranges, because such a case provides lower growth and culture behavior suggesting differentiation.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">A gelatin gel, in particular a gel of a photocurable gelatin can suitably be used as the elasticity-variable gel in the present invention. To provide a gelatin with photocurability, photoreactive moieties are introduced to functional groups of various amino-acid residues in the gelatin via appropriate chemical bonds. Examples of the photoreactive moieties (also called functional groups with photoreactivity) include ethylenically unsaturated groups such as vinyl groups, allyl groups, styryl groups, and (meth)acryloyl groups. For example, a gelatin with styryl groups introduced (called a photocurable styrenated gelatin) can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">A gelatin, selected as a constituent in a cell culture material, can be dissolved at high concentration in water. For this reason, a gel of the gelatin can have a larger mechanical strength than that of a gel of another material, and the mechanical strength can be adjusted more widely. In addition, gelatin can have various molecular weights and is available at low cost, thereby providing advantages such as cost reduction in cell culture. Among ethylenically unsaturated groups to be introduced to the gelatin, styryl groups are particularly high in hydrophobicity and therefore are associated in an aqueous solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">For this reason, the polymerization efficiency is higher in photopolymerization of the gelatin with styryl groups introduced than with another unsaturated groups introduced, which can reduce the curing time.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The photocurable gelatin gel can be obtained by preparing an aqueous solution containing a photocurable gelatin and a photoradical polymerization initiator and emitting light to the solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The photocurable gelatin can be obtained by reacting a gelatin with, for example, a compound (for example, 4-vinylbenzoic acid) having styryl group(s) and carboxy group(s) as photoreactive moieties in the presence of a carbodiimide as a condensing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In this reaction, amino groups of proteins in the gelatin are reacted with the carboxy groups of the compound having the photoreactive moieties to form amide bonds, whereby the photoreactive moieties (for example, styryl groups) are introduced to the proteins in the gelatin. Examples of the carbodiimide used as the condensing agent in introducing the photoreactive moieties to the gelatin include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), diethylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), ethylcyclohexylcarbodiimide, diphenylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The compound to provide the gelatin with photocrosslinkability (photocurability) in the reaction above can be any compound as long as it includes three factors: functional groups having photoreactivity, such as vinyl groups described above; a hydrophobic skeleton having a high association property in water; and functional groups usable for chemical bonding with the gelatin. Thus, the configuration of the photocurable gelatin is not limited to the styryl group-introduced gelatin described above as an example.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The gelatin used here preferably has a weight-average molecular weight of 95,000 to 105,000 (measured by HPLC, in terms of polystyrene). The rate of introduction of photoreactive moieties (for example, styryl groups) to the gelatin is preferably, for example, 80 to 100% with respect to the total number of amino groups in the gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The weight-average molecular weight of the gelatin and the rate of induction of photoreactive moieties within such numerical ranges can provide a gelatin gel having a mechanical strength suitable for culturing iPS cells and an elastic modulus as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The photoradical polymerization initiator may be any compound as long as it generates radicals by light irradiation. Examples of the photoradical polymerization initiator include: carbonyl compounds such as camphorquinone, acetophenone, benzophenone, and dimethoxy phenylacetophenone, and their derivatives; sulfur compounds such as dithiocarbamate, salts of xanthic acid, and thiophenol, and their derivatives; peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide and butyl peroxide, and their derivative; azobis compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile and esters of azobisisobutyric acid, and their derivatives; halides such as bromopropane and chloromethyl naphthalene, and their derivatives; azide compounds such as phenyl azide, and their derivatives; xanthene dyes such as rhodamine, erythrosine, fluorescein, and eosin, and their derivatives; and riboflavin and its derivative. Among these compounds, camphorquinone such as sulfonyl camphorquinone is a preferable photoradical polymerization initiator because its biogenic safety has been established.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The photoradical polymerization initiator may be a single compound of these compounds and a combination of two or more of these compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The photoradical polymerization initiator is used at, for example, 0.01 to 10% by mass, preferably 0.1 to 3% by mass, with respect to the total mass of the photocurable gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The aqueous solution that contains the photocurable gelatin and the photoradical polymerization initiator may be any aqueous solution as long as iPS cells to be used can live in the solution. Examples of the aqueous solution include physiological saline such as Ringer's solution and Locke's solution, phosphate buffer, and balanced saline such as Tyrode's solution, Hank's solution, Earle's solution, and HEPES solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The concentration of the photocurable gelatin in the aqueous solution is preferably 20 to 50% by mass, for example 30% by mass, with respect to the total mass of the aqueous solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The aqueous solution may contain an additional nutritional composition necessary for iPS cells to be cultured to grow. Examples of such a nutritional composition include minerals such as Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, and Cl, amino acids, vitamins, carbohydrates, fats, and growth factors, which can be selected as appropriate.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">A light source for light emission in curing the aqueous solution containing the photocurable gelatin and the photoradical polymerization initiator into gel can be, for example, a halogen lamp, a xenon lamp, an incandescent lamp, a mercury lamp, an excimer laser, and an argon ion laser. It is preferable to emit a light having a wavelength of 300 to 800 nm using such a light source. The light irradiation is performed until the aqueous solution turns into gel. The gelation generally takes about 0.5 to 5 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The aqueous solution containing the photocurable gelatin and the photoradical polymerization initiator will be cured into gel (gelate) by light irradiation in the following mechanism. First, the light irradiation causes the photoradical polymerization initiator to generate radicals. The radicals thus generated trigger radical polymerization of functional groups (for example, vinyl groups) having photoreactivity on the photocurable gelatin. The radical polymerization of the functional groups having photoreactivity initiated by the light irradiation causes gelatin to be cross-linked via the functional groups, which forms a network structure. The network structure swells with surrounding medium, which promotes gelation and thus forms gelatin gel. It is noted that the network structure described above can have not only the cross-linked structure of the functional groups having photoreactivity but also amide bonds of amino groups and carboxy groups in the gelatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">While the photocurable gelatin is being cured from liquid into gel with the progress of the radical polymerization, the degree of swelling of the gel being formed decreases as the cross-link density in the gelatin increases. This means increase in the mechanical strength of the gel being formed.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Thus, the gel having a mechanical strength suitable for culturing iPS cells and an elastic modulus as described above can be prepared by adjusting the irradiation time of light (control on the amount of radicals to be generated), the additive amount of the photoradical polymerization initiator, the concentration of gelatin in the aqueous solution, the molecular weight of the gelatin, the rate of introduction of the functional groups having photoreactivity into the gelatin, etc.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">[Cell Adhesion Protein]</heading>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The cell adhesion proteins to be immobilized on the surface of the elasticity-variable gel are preferably laminins, fibronectins, and vitronectins, for example. Alternatively, it is possible to utilize for surface immobilization a peptide sequence in the molecular structure of these proteins that forms a particular specific binding with an integrin of the cell. Laminins are particularly preferable as the cell adhesion proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Laminins are giant proteins in the basal lamina of extracellular matrix, and are heterotrimers including three subunit chains called Î±, Î², and Î³. There are 11 kinds of subunits: Î±<b>1</b> to Î±<b>5</b> for the Î± chain, Î²<b>1</b> to Î²<b>3</b> for the Î² chain, and Î³<b>1</b> to Î³<b>3</b> for the Î³ chain. The combination of subunit chains determines the name of a laminin. For example, a laminin having Î±<b>1</b> for the subunit Î±, Î²<b>1</b> for the subunit Î², and Î³<b>1</b> for the subunit Î³ is called laminin-111. Thus, 45 kinds of laminin can theoretically exist according to the combinations of the subunits.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Examples of the laminin to be immobilized on the surface of the gelatin gel of the present invention include 19 kinds of laminin families (laminin-111, 121, 211, 221, 212,222, 213, 3A11, 3A21, 3A32, 3A33, 3B32, 411, 421, 423, 511, 521, 522, and 523), which are currently known, another kind of laminin that can be found from these laminins, refined products from organs and cellular secretions, and recombinant laminins</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In the present invention, laminin-111 is particularly preferable.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">[Chemical Method of Immobilizing Cell Adhesion Proteins on Elasticity-Variable Gel Surface]</heading>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">When a gel of a photocurable styrenated gelatin is used as the elasticity-variable gel and laminins are used as the cell adhesion proteins, for example, the two materials are reacted in the presence of a carbodiimide as a condensing agent. This chemically immobilizes the laminins on the surface of the gelatin via amide bonds by the reaction of carboxy groups on the gelatin gel surface and amino groups of the laminins</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The carbodiimides recited above as usable in introducing photoreactive moieties to the gelatin can be used here.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">It is noted that the present invention is also directed to a gel including a photocurable gelatin and a laminin immobilized on a surface of the gel, in particular, a gel in which the photocurable gelatin is a photocurable styrenated gelatin and/or the laminin is laminin-111.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The cell adhesion proteins (for example, laminins) are reacted with the elasticity-variable gel (for example, a gelatin gel) at a reacting concentration of 0.1 to 2 mg, preferably 0.5 to 1.0 mg, with respect to 1 mL of the elasticity-variable gel. Thus, far better rapid growth than growth in the culture system using existing Matrigel (registered trademark) can be achieved.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">[Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell]</heading>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The culture method of the present invention is assumed to be applied to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), embryonic stem cells (ES cells), or other kinds of stem cells. The present invention is particularly directed to iPS cells, which are capable of being differentiated into various types of cells and thus expected to be utilized in medical treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In general, an iPS cell is prepared by introducing reprogramming factors (four genes: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) into an adult somatic cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The present invention may be applied to human iPS cells established directly from somatic cells of a patient for clinical use, and iPS cells available from cell banks for experimental works.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">[Dispersive Culture of iPS Cells]</heading>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">As described above, conventional methods of culturing iPS cells include a passage culture using a feeder cell sheet and a passage culture using Matrigel (BD Matrigelâ¢ Basement Membrane Matrix: BD 354234) instead of a feeder cell sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The operation for culturing iPS cells in the present invention can be performed on a cell culture substrate including the above-described elasticity-variable gel with the adhesion proteins immobilized thereon, similarly to the normal culture operation on Matrigel. In this operation, iPS cells in single-cell state are dispersively seeded on the culture substrate according to the present invention to be cultured.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The following describes an exemplary method of dispersively culturing iPS cells on the cell culture substrate including the elasticity-variable gel of the present invention with adhesion proteins immobilized thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">A ROCK inhibitor is added at a final concentration of 10 iM to a culture dish of iPS cells cultured in advance to subconfluence, and the cells are incubated at 37Â° C. for one hour or more. The culture medium is then aspirated off, and Accutase (or 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA) as a reagent for cell retrieval is added at 1 mL per 6-mm dish. The cells are incubated at 37Â° C. for five to seven minutes. Subsequently, the dish is tapped, 3 mL of a feeder-free serum-free culture medium (mTeSRâ¢ 1: STEMCELL Technologies 05850; when using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, a culture medium containing serum such as MEF medium) is added to the dish, and the cells are roughly dissociated into single cells by pipetting up and down. The cell suspension thus obtained is transferred into a 15-mL tube to be centrifuged at a centrifugal acceleration of 170 (Ãg) (1,000 rpm) for five minutes. The supernatant is aspirated off, the resultant is suspended with a feeder-free serum-free culture medium, and the cells are seeded on a culture substrate of the laminin-immobilized elasticity-variable gelatin gel of the present invention. A ROCK inhibitor is added for a final concentration of 10 miM. From the following day, adhesion of a cell cluster is observed, and the culture medium is replaced once per day, thereby continuing the culture.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The iPS cells, dispersively cultured on the culture substrate of the elasticity-variable gel of the present invention with the adhesion proteins immobilized thereon, can healthily grow to a density of 1.5Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more in a culture duration of about seven days, maintaining their undifferentiation property and multipotency.

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">A visible light having a wavelength of around 500 nm was emitted to a sol (containing 1.5% by mass of sulfonyl camphorquinone) of 30% by mass of a photocurable gelatin (photocurable styrenated gelatin: StG) with vinyl groups introduced (the molecular weight of the gelatin: about 100,000, the rate of introduction of the vinyl groups: 98% with respect to amino groups in the gelatin) in phosphate buffered saline (hereinafter called PBS) to cause photocrosslinking by way of radical polymerization of the vinyl groups, thereby a gel was prepared. The irradiation time of light was changed between 100 to 800 seconds to prepared gelatin gels. The surface elastic moduli of the prepared gelatin gels were measured by a microscopic injection test using an atomic force microscope. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates change in surface elastic moduli (Young's moduli) of the gels corresponding to the respective irradiation times of light in the gel preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the irradiation time of light of 300 seconds provided a gelatin gel having a surface elastic modulus of 50 kPa. The irradiation times of light of 300 seconds or more provided a linear increase in Young's moduli.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">[Production Example 2: Immobilization of Laminin on Elasticity-Variable Gel Surface]</heading>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">On a surface of the gel having the surface elastic modulus of 50 kPa, which was prepared in Production Example 1, a solution of 0.5 mg/mL of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (water-soluble carbodiimide) in phosphate buffer (pH 4.8) was reacted overnight at 4Â° C. Subsequently, solutions of fluorescently-labeled laminin-111 in phosphate buffer at various concentrations were dropped on the gel to be reacted at 4Â° C. for a certain time.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">[Evaluation of the Amount of Laminins on the Gel Surface]</heading>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">After the reactant obtained in Production Example 2 was washed with PBS, immunostaining was performed for laminin-111 (hereinafter called LAM) to perform fluorescence observation of the gel surface using a confocal microscope or an electron-multiplier CCD camera. <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates change in fluorescence intensity with respect to the concentrations of reacted LAM, and <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates change in fluorescence intensity in 14 days after the LAM immobilization (the LAM concentration: 1.0 mg/ml). It is noted that the fluorescence intensity illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> corresponds to the amount of LAM immobilized on the gel surface (immobilization density).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The amounts of LAM immobilized on the substrate were roughly constant among the reaction times of one hour or more. In contrast, linear increase in accordance with the increase in the LAM reacting concentration was shown. In particular, the reaction condition with the LAM concentration of 1.5 mg/mL achieved an amount of laminin-111 immobilized on the gelatin gel equivalent to the amount in an existing culture system Matrigel (registered trademark) of Becton, Dickinson and Company (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Furthermore, temporal stability of immobilized LAM (desorption of LAM) was evaluated by way of fluorescent observation of the gel surface at certain points of time after the immobilization. Although slight decrease was observed in fluorescence intensity due to desorption of non-specifically adhesive LAM, a constant amount of LAM was stably present on the gel surface up to <b>14</b> days after the immobilization (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Matrigel (registered trademark) of Becton, Dickinson and Company was melted on ice, and then diluted 30 fold with a serum-free medium. Two milliliters of the diluted Matrigel was transferred into a 60-mm dish to be incubated for one hour at 37Â° C. (or overnight at 4Â° C.). The diluted Matrigel was aspirated off, and the dish was lightly washed with a feeder-free serum-free medium, thereby a Matigel substrate was obtained.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">A human iPS cell strain 253G1 was dispersively seeded at 2.0Ã10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>on the substrates prepared in Design Examples 1 to 4 described above and the substrate in Comparative Example to be cultured for seven days. The density of adherent cells was measured on each day. For comparison, the human iPS cell strain was dispersively seeded and cultured in a similar way on substrates without immobilized LAM in Design Examples 1 to 4 described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">
        <figref>FIGS. 3 to 7</figref> show phase-contrast micrographs of the respective substrates having the LAM reacting concentration of 0.5 mg/mL on a first day (day1), fourth day (day4), and seventh day (day7). <figref>FIGS. 8A to 8D</figref> show change in density of immobilized cells on each substrate at different LAM-reaction concentrations with respect to culturing days. <figref>FIGS. 8A to 8D</figref> show the results of the 3-kPa substrates, the 20-kPa substrates, the 50-kPa substrates and the Matrigel substrate, and the 100-kPa substrates and the Matrigel substrate, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">As for the 3-kPa substrates prepared in Design Example 1, the number of cells decreased with the culturing days under any laminin-concentration condition (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">As for the 20-kPa substrates prepared in Design Example 2, small cell clusters were formed under any laminin-concentration condition. The cell clusters were observed to collapse thereafter into single cells, and no growth of the cells was observed (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">In contrast, as for the 50-kPa substrates prepared in Design Example 3, growth of iPS cells was observed under the LAM reacting concentration of 0.5 mg/mL or 1.0 mg/mL (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8C</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">With reference to <figref>FIG. 8C</figref> in particular, a result shows that far better cell growth was observed on the 50-kPa substrates in Design Example 3 under the LAM reacting concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL and 1.0 mg/mL than on the Matrigel substrate in Comparative Example. However, a cell cluster was formed but no growth was observed on the 50-kPa substrate under the LAM reacting concentration of 1.5 mg/mL, which provided an amount of immobilized laminins equivalent to that of Matrigel (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">According to the procedures in Production Example 1 and Production Example 2 described above, a gelatin gel was prepared so as to have a surface elastic modulus of 50 kPa with a controlled irradiation time of light. Immobilizing reaction was performed on the gelatin gel at an LAM reacting concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, thereby a culture substrate (Design Example 5) to be used here was obtained. According to the procedure in Example 1 described above, a human iPS cell strain was seeded on the substrate in Design Example 5 to be cultured for seven days. The iPS cells cultured for seven days were retrieved from the culture substrate to be reseeded on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as feeder cells. After seven-day culture, immunostaining was performed to examine expression of undifferentiation marker proteins (SSEA-1, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81). <figref>FIGS. 9A to 9D</figref> show images of immunofluorescent-stained undifferentiation marker proteins observed in the cultured iPS cells. <figref>FIGS. 9A to 9D</figref> show SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, and SSEA-1, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9A to 9D</figref>, normal colonization of the iPS cells, positive reaction in all of the three positive markers (SSEA-4, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81), and negative reaction in the negative marker (SSEA-1) were confirmed.
