      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Compatibilization of polar polymers, such as polyamide and/or EVOH, with nonpolar polymers such as polyethylene and/or polypropylene is commonly achieved by maleic anhydride grafted polymers. Polymer compositions containing functionalized polymers are described in the following references: U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,091, US 20060199914, WO 1994/025526, WO 2007/146875, and WO2011/163176. See also, A. Mendez-Prieto et al., Multilayer Structure Using Reprocessed Coextruded LLDPE/TIE/PA-6 Films, <i>Journal of Polymer Engineering</i>, Vol. 18, No. 3, 1998, 221-234; M. M. Nir et al., Performance of Reprocessed Multilayer LDPE/Nylon-6 Film, Polymer Engineering and Sciences, 1995, Vol. 35, No. 23, 1878-1883.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Traditional maleic anhydride functionalized olefin-based polymers, containing high maleic anhydride content, have been used as compatibilizers between polyolefin and EVOH and/or polyamide, in multicomponent compositions, where the maleic anhydride functionalized polyolefin compatibilizes olefin-based polymers and EVOH and/or polyamide. However, in multicomponent compositions, where the interfacial surface areas are higher, the traditional maleic anhydride functionalized polyolefins can react and form a crosslinked interphase with the polar polymer. Articles such as films, sheets produced from such compositions typically have poor optical and mechanical properties. There is a need for new polymer compositions that will effectively compatibilize polyolefin/polyamide, polyolefin/EVOH, or, polyolefin/polyamide/EVOH systems, without resulting in crosslinked interphases, and which can be used to form films, or sheets with improved optical and mechanical properties. These needs have been met by the following invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0115">The terms âhomogeneousâ and âhomogeneously-branchedâ are used in reference to an ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymer, in which the Î±-olefin comonomer is randomly distributed within a given polymer molecule, and all of the polymer molecules have the same or substantially the same comonomer-to-ethylene ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0116">The homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers are ethylene polymers, which lack long chain branching, but do have short chain branches, derived from the comonomer polymerized into the interpolymer, and which are homogeneously distributed, both within the same polymer chain, and between different polymer chains. These ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers have a linear polymer backbone, no measurable long chain branching, and a narrow molecular weight distribution. This class of polymers is disclosed, for example, by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992, and subsequent processes to produce such polymers, using bis-metallocene catalysts, have been developed, as shown, for example, in EP 0 129 368; EP 0 260 999; U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,432; U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,301; U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,397; U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,438; and WO 90/07526; each incorporated herein by reference. As discussed, the homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers lack long chain branching, just as is the case for the linear low density polyethylene polymers or linear high density polyethylene polymers. Commercial examples of homogeneously branched linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers include TAFMER polymers from the Mitsui Chemical Company, and EXACT and EXCEED polymers from ExxonMobil Chemical Company.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0117">The homogeneously branched substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,272,236; 5,278,272; 6,054,544; 6,335,410 and 6,723,810; each incorporated herein by reference. The substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers have long chain branching. The long chain branches have the same comonomer distribution as the polymer backbone, and can have about the same length as the length of the polymer backbone. âSubstantially linear,â typically, is in reference to a polymer that is substituted, on average, with â0.01 long chain branches per 1000 carbonsâ to â3 long chain branches per 1000 carbons.â The length of a long chain branch is longer than the carbon length of a short chain branch, formed from the incorporation of one comonomer into the polymer backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0118">Some polymers may be substituted with 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 3 long chain branch per 1000 total carbons, further from 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 2 long chain branch per 1000 total carbons, and further from 0.01 long chain branches per 1000 total carbons to 1 long chain branch per 1000 total carbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0119">The substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers form a unique class of homogeneously branched ethylene polymers. They differ substantially from the well-known class of conventional, homogeneously branched linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers, as discussed above, and, moreover, they are not in the same class as conventional heterogeneous âZiegler-Natta catalyst polymerizedâ linear ethylene polymers (for example, ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) or high density polyethylene (HDPE), made, for example, using the technique disclosed by Anderson et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698); nor are they in the same class as high pressure, free-radical initiated, highly branched polyethylenes, such as, for example, low density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0120">The homogeneously branched, substantially linear ethylene/Î±-olefin interpolymers useful in the invention have excellent processability, even though they have a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. Surprisingly, the melt flow ratio (I10/I2), according to ASTM D 1238, of the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers can be varied widely, and essentially independently of the molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn or MWD). This surprising behavior is contrary to conventional homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymers, such as those described, for example, by Elston in U.S. Pat. No. 3,645,992, and heterogeneously branched, conventional âZiegler-Natta polymerized,â linear polyethylene interpolymers, such as those described, for example, by Anderson et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. Unlike substantially linear ethylene interpolymers, linear ethylene interpolymers (whether homogeneously or heterogeneously branched) have rheological properties, such that, as the molecular weight distribution increases, the I10/I2 value also increases.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0121">Long chain branching can be determined by using 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and can be quantified using the method of Randall (Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C29 (2 &amp;3), 1989, p. 285-297), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Two other methods are Gel Permeation Chromatography, couple with a Low Angle Laser Light Scattering detector (GPCLALLS), and Gel Permeation Chromatography, coupled with a Differential Viscometer detector (GPC-DV). The use of these techniques for long chain branch detection, and the underlying theories, have been well documented in the literature. See, for example, Zimm, B H and Stockmayer, W. H., J. Chem. Phys., 17, 1301 (1949), and Rudin, A., Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991) pp. 103-112.</p>

The spindle used, in general, is a SC-31 hot-melt spindle, suitable for measuring viscosities in the range from 10 to 100,000 centipoise. The sample is poured into the chamber, which is, in turn, inserted into a Brookfield Thermoset, and locked into place. The sample chamber has a notch on the bottom that fits the bottom of the Brookfield Thermoset, to ensure that the chamber is not allowed to turn when the spindle is inserted and spinning. The sample (approximately 8-10 grams of resin) is heated to the required temperature, until the melted sample is about one inch below the top of the sample chamber. The viscometer apparatus is lowered, and the spindle submerged into the sample chamber. Lowering is continued, until the brackets on the viscometer align on the Thermoset. The viscometer is turned on, and set to operate at a shear rate which leads to a torque reading in the range of 40 to 60 percent of the total torque capacity, based on the rpm output of the viscometer. Readings are taken every minute for about 15 minutes, or until the values stabilize, at which point, a final reading is recorded.</p>

The polystyrene standard peak molecular weights are converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the following equation (as described in Williams and Ward, J. Polym. Sci., Polym. Let., 6, 621 (1968)):</p>

      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0000">where M is the molecular weight, A has a value of 0.4315 and B is equal to 1.0. Polyethylene equivalent molecular weight calculations were performed using VISCOTEK TriSEC software Version 3.0. The molecular weights for polypropylene-based polymers can be determined using Mark-Houwink ratios according to ASTM D6474.9714-1, where, for polystyrene a=0.702 and log K=â3.9, and for polypropylene, a=0.725 and log K=â3.721. For polypropylene-based samples, the column and carousel compartments are operated at 160Â° C.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">DSC</heading>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0156">Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used to measure crystallinity in polyethylene (PE) based samples and polypropylene (PP) based samples. About five to eight milligrams of sample is weighed and placed in a DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The sample pan is placed in a DSC cell, and then heated, at a rate of approximately 10Â° C./min, to a temperature of 180Â° C. for PE (230Â° C. for PP). The sample is kept at this temperature for three minutes. Then the sample is cooled at a rate of 10Â° C./min to â60Â° C. for PE (â40Â° C. for PP), and kept isothermally at that temperature for three minutes. The sample is next heated at a rate of 10Â° C./min, until complete melting (second heat). The percent crystallinity is calculated by dividing the heat of fusion (H<sub>f</sub>), determined from the second heat curve, by a theoretical heat of fusion of 292 J/g for PE (165 J/g, for PP), and multiplying this quantity by 100 (e.g., for PE, % cryst.=(H<sub>f</sub>/292 J/g)Ã100; and for PP, % cryst.=(H<sub>f</sub>/165 J/g)Ã100).</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0157">Unless otherwise stated, melting point(s) (T<sub>m</sub>) of each polymer is determined from the second heat curve obtained from DSC, as described above. The crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>) is measured from the first cooling curve.</p>

      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0159">The concentration of maleic anhydride is determined by the ratio of peak heights of the maleic anhydride, at wave number 1791 cm<sup>â1</sup>, to the polymer reference peak, which, in case of polyethylene, is at wave number 2019 cm<sup>â1</sup>. Maleic anhydride content is calculated by multiplying this ratio with the appropriate calibration constant. The equation used for maleic grafted polyolefins (with reference peak for polyethylene) has the following form, as shown in Equation 1A.</p>

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">The calibration constant A can be determined using C13 NMR standards. The actual calibration constant may differ slightly depending on the instrument and polymer. The signal at wave number 1712 cm<sup>â1 </sup>accounts for the presence of maleic acid, which is negligible for freshly grafted material. Over time however, maleic anhydride is readily converted to maleic acid in the presence of moisture. Depending on surface area, significant hydrolysis can occur in just a few days under ambient conditions. The acid has a distinct peak at wave number 1712 cm<sup>â1</sup>. The constant B in Equation 1 is a correction for the difference in extinction coefficients between the anhydride and acid groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">The sample preparation procedure begins by making a pressing, typically 0.05 to 0.15 millimeters in thickness, in a heated press, between two protective films, at 150-180Â° C. for one hour. MYLAR and TEFLON are suitable protective films to protect the sample from the platens. Aluminum foil must never be used (maleic anhydride reacts with aluminum). Platens should be under pressure (Ë10 ton) for about five minutes. The sample is allowed to cool to room temperature, placed in an appropriate sample holder, and then scanned in the FTIR. A background scan should be run before each sample scan, or as needed. The precision of the test is good, with an inherent variability of less than Â±5%. Samples should be stored with desiccant to prevent excessive hydrolysis. Maleic anhydride and acid are represented by peaks at about 1791 and 1712 cm<sup>â1</sup>, respectively.</p>

The die temperature was set to 190Â° C. There was no side arm feeder and no vacuum was pulled. The compounded material was extruded through a two hole die into a 16 foot long chilled water bath. The strands were then passed through a BERLYN Air Knife to remove excess water. Once the strands were cooled and dried, they were pelletized with a LabTech side cut pelletizer. The chopped pellets were then dropped into a plastic lined 50 lb bag. The blends were further dried for 12 hours, at 60Â° C., at ambient atmosphere.</p>

      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0171">Transmission Electron Microscopy: Thin strips of the films (monolayer films) were cut with razor blade, and embedded in an epoxy/hardener system. A block face of each film specimen was polished and trimmed to an appropriate size. A flat specimen surface was finally polished, at â60Â° C., to prevent smearing, using a diamond knife on a LEICA UCT microtome, prior to staining. The polished specimens were adhered to glass slides with the aid of double-sided tape, and placed in a glass jar with a screw lid. The slides were placed in the jar, in order to suspend the blocks about one inch above the staining solution. The polished blocks were stained using the vapor phase of an aqueous ruthenium tetraoxide solution, for two hours, at ambient temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0172">The staining solution was prepared by weighing â0.2 gmâ of ruthenium (III) chloride hydrate (RuCl3ÃH<sub>2</sub>O) into a glass jar, and adding 10 ml of â5.25 wt %â aqueous sodium hypochlorite to the jar. Sections of approximately 100 nanometers, in thickness, were collected at ambient temperature, using a diamond knife on a LEICA UCT microtome, and these sections were placed on formvar coated, 150 square mesh copper, TEM grids, for TEM observation. A JEOL TEM 1230 was operated at 100 kV accelerating voltage, and bright-field images were collected using GATAN 791 and GATAN 794 cameras.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0173">Optical Microscopy: Optical sections of the monolayer films of approximately, 5 microns thick, were collected at â120Â° C., using a diamond knife on a LEICA UCT microtome, equipped with an FCS cryo-sectioning chamber. The sections were transferred to a microscope slide, containing a drop of Dow Corning E-200 silicon oil, and covered with a cover glass prior to analysis. Additional sections were obtained and placed on a potassium bromide (KBr) salt window for infra-red micro-spectroscopy analysis. Transmitted, brightfield light, under crossed-polarized, as well as epi-flourescence illumination, modes were used to view the film cross-sections, using a Carl Zeiss Axiolmager Z1m compound microscope. Images were acquired with the aid of a HRc digital camera. In order to capture the observed macro differences between the films, a LEICA MZ-16 stereo microscope was used at low magnification (2 mm scale). The films were illuminated with reflected light to enhance the surface topographies, and reveal the influence of compatibilization on gel formation. Digital images were captured using a NIKON DXM digital camera.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0174">EVOH was agglomerated into larger domains in Comparative Ex. A, which was the control blend, with no additional compatibilizer. Addition of â8.5 wt % MAH-g-EO1â in Inventive Ex.1 significantly improved the EVOH dispersion in the blend, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (right TEM images). Inventive Ex.1 produced globally dispersed EVOH domains, in comparison to Comparative Ex. A, which was comprised of a combination of very large domains and a lower concentration of smaller domains. Comparative Ex. B, with 10 wt % TY 1053H as the compatibilizer, resulted in a bimodal size distribution of EVOH domains, with both larger EVOH domains as well as some smaller domains. The optical images in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> (Comparative Ex. A left; Comparative ex. B center; Inventive Ex. 1 right) verified that surfaces of the films formed from Comparative Ex. A and Comparative Ex. B consisted of very large gels, believed to be associated with EVOH, in comparison to Inventive Ex. 1 which displayed much fewer gels.</p>

      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0182">As can be seen from <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the control film (Comparative Ex. E, left top), exhibited large polyamide domains in polyethylene matrix. Films formed from Comparative Ex. F 9 right top) and Inventive Ex. 4 (center bottom) both had smaller domains than the control. However, Comparative Ex. F showed more clustering (aggregation) of the domainsâthe domains were not as globally dispersed as in Inventive Ex. 4. Inventive Ex. 4 showed globally, well-dispersed, less agglomerating, domain particles. The improved dispersion of the small domains in Inventive Ex. 4 provides better optical and mechanical properties, as shown in Table 10 and 11. See also <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
