      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention relates generally to a cosmetic skin guard, and more specifically to a guard adapted to fit around a fingernail to prevent nail polish from contacting the skin surrounding the fingernail during application of the nail polish to the fingernail.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is common practice for individuals to enhance and beautify their fingernails through the application of color or other finishes on the outer surface of the fingernail. This application may be done through the use of various nail enamels or nail polishes. A common current method of applying such polishes is done by applying the nail polish to the surface of the fingernail with an applicator brush.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is desirable to apply the polish in a manner which results in a clean appearance. Along these lines, since the polish typically spreads along the fingernail, extreme care must be exercised in applying the polish. It may take 30 minutes or more for the polish to dry after it is applied to the fingernail. During this time, it is advisable for the user to minimize movements and remain still to mitigate inadvertent spreading of the polish into the surrounding skin or cuticle. Application of the polish onto the fingernail may be further complicated when applying the polish with a non-dominant hand. For instance, it may be difficult for a right-handed individual to apply nail polish to a fingernail on the right hand using the non-dominant left hand, and conversely, it may be difficult for a left-handed individual to apply nail polish to a fingernail on the left hand using the non-dominant right hand. Furthermore, application of polish may be difficult for those lacking dexterity or coordination. For example, young children or teenagers who are inexperienced in applying polish may struggle in keeping polish away from the skin surrounding the fingernail. Likewise, elderly individuals suffering from arthritis or other joint-related conditions may also suffer from precisely applying the polish.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In the event polish is inadvertently applied to the skin or spread onto the skin while the polish is drying, and the polish is not cleaned from the skin, the resultant appearance may be sloppy or careless.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a device which simplifies the process of applying nail polish by protecting the skin surrounding the fingernail during application of the nail polish thereto. Various aspects of the present invention address this particular need, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a device which protects the skin and/or cuticle surrounding a fingernail while applying nail polish to the fingernail. The device is specifically configured and adapted to extend around at least a portion of the fingernail to effectively form a border for protecting the skin from contacting the nail polish. The device may remain on the finger while the nail polish dries, upon which time, the device may be removed from the finger.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to one embodiment, there is provided a guard for use with a finger of a user while painting a fingernail. The guard includes a main body formed of a flexible material to allow the main body to be at least partially wrapped around the finger. The main body includes a first surface and an opposing second surface, wherein the first surface includes an adhesive for adhering the main body to the finger. The main body further includes an inner periphery sized and configured to conform to the anatomy of the fingernail and extend at least partially around the fingernail. The inner periphery is of a generally concave configuration to define a main body opening adapted to be placed over the fingernail.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The main body may further include an outer periphery spaced from inner periphery along at least a portion of the main body. The outer periphery and inner periphery may intersect to define a pair of terminal ends. The outer periphery may define a plurality of rounded segments.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The main body may include perforations formed therein to segregate the main body into at least two regions separable from each other. The perforations may extend from the inner periphery toward an outer periphery. The perforations may also extend generally parallel to the inner periphery.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The guard may further comprise a template adapted to extend over the opening. The template includes a first surface, an opposing second surface, and an opening extending through the template between the first and second surfaces. The template may be coupled to the main body and transitional relative thereto between a covered configuration, wherein the template extends over the main body opening, and an uncovered configuration, wherein the main body opening is uncovered by the template. The template may include an adhesive to allow the template to be adhered to one of the main body and the finger when the template is in the uncovered configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The main body may be formed of a single piece of material. The main body may be formed of polyethylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to another embodiment, there is provided a single-use guard capable of being applied to a finger around a fingernail to protect skin around the fingernail from nail polish. The guard includes a body having a pair of opposed arms positioned in spaced relation to each other and joined by a connecting segment. The arms and connecting segment collectively define a body opening having a closed end portion at the connecting segment and an open end portion opposite the connecting segment. The body opening is sized and configured to conform to the fingernail of the user. The body further includes an adhesive surface adapted to be selectively adhered to the finger during application of nail polish to the fingernail.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The present invention will be best understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of certain embodiments of a protective guard placeable around a fingernail and is not intended to represent the only forms that may be developed or utilized. The description sets forth the various structure and/or functions in connection with the illustrated embodiments, but it is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent structure and/or functions may be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and the like are used solely to distinguish one entity from another without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Various aspects of the present invention are directed toward providing a guard <b>10</b> which may be selectively adhered to a user's finger <b>12</b> immediately adjacent the fingernail <b>14</b> to provide a barrier around the fingernail <b>14</b> for preventing nail polish from contacting the user's skin or cuticle during application and drying of the nail polish on the fingernail <b>14</b>. The guard <b>10</b> may include an adhesive surface to facilitate adhering of the guard <b>10</b> to the finger <b>12</b>. Once the nail polish has dried, the guard <b>10</b> may be removed from the skin. The finished look of the applied nail polish on the fingernail <b>14</b> is clean and crisp, with the nail polish contained to the nail, preferably extending across substantially the entirety of the fingernail <b>14</b>, without being applied to the user's skin. The guard <b>10</b> may simplify application of the nail polish for those lacking dexterity, such as young children or teenagers, the elderly, or those suffering from arthritis.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As used herein, the term ânail polishâ broadly refers to conventional nail polish, as well as enamels, lacquers, paints, creams, gels, or other topical applications which may be applied to the surface of a fingernail <b>14</b>. Along these lines, although a preferred embodiment of the guard <b>10</b> may be for applying cosmetic nail polishes, it is also understood that the guard <b>10</b> also be used for applying medical applications to the fingernail <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the present invention only, and are not for purposes of limiting the same, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of the guard <b>10</b> adhered to the fingernail <b>14</b> of the user. It is understood that the guard <b>10</b> may be formed in several different shapes and sizes, as exemplified in <figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, wherein the guard <b>10</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>that is a small size compared to the guard <b>10</b><i>b </i>depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The guard <b>10</b> includes a main body <b>16</b> including opposed upper and lower surfaces <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, and is of a generally U-shaped configuration, and thus, includes a pair of opposed arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> positioned in spaced relation to each other and joined by a connecting segment <b>26</b>. The arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and connecting segment <b>26</b> collectively define a main body opening <b>28</b> having a closed end portion at the connecting segment <b>26</b> and an open end portion opposite the connecting segment <b>26</b>. The main body <b>16</b> further includes an inner periphery <b>30</b> and an outer periphery <b>32</b>, wherein the inner periphery <b>30</b> defines the main body opening <b>28</b> and is sized and configured to conform to the anatomy of the fingernail <b>14</b> and extend at least partially around the fingernail <b>14</b>. According to one embodiment, the inner periphery <b>30</b> is of a generally concave configuration to define the main body opening <b>28</b> adapted to be placed over the fingernail <b>14</b>. The outer periphery <b>32</b> and inner periphery <b>30</b> may intersect to define a pair of terminal ends <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>. The outer periphery <b>32</b> may be configured to include a plurality of rounded segments or flower-petal like segments, to catch any excess nail polish which may fall of the brush or applicator.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The main body <b>16</b> further includes an adhesive surface adapted to be selectively adhered to the finger <b>12</b> during application of nail polish to the fingernail <b>14</b>. In particular, the lower surface <b>20</b> may include an adhesive coating or layer applied thereto for adhering the guard <b>10</b> to the user's finger <b>12</b>. The adhesive may be a medical-grade adhesive or other adhesives known in the art for adhering to skin. It is contemplated that a preferred embodiment of the guard <b>10</b> is specifically intended for a single-use, and thus, the adhesive may be intended to secure the guard <b>10</b> to the user's finger <b>12</b> for a short period of time, such as less than an hour, or in some cases, less than twenty minutes. However, in other embodiments, the guard <b>10</b> may be adapted for multiple, repeated uses, and thus, the adhesive may be stronger to sustain repeated application and removal during the lifespan of the guard <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The guard <b>10</b> may be formed of a single sheet of flexible material to allow the main body <b>16</b> to be at least partially wrapped around the finger <b>12</b>. According to one particular implementation, the main body <b>16</b> may be formed of polyethylene, although other materials known by those skilled in the art may also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The main body <b>16</b> may include perforations <b>38</b> formed therein to segregate the main body <b>16</b> into at least two regions separable from each other. The perforations <b>38</b> may extend from the inner periphery <b>30</b> toward an outer periphery <b>32</b>, or generally parallel to the inner periphery <b>30</b>. The perforations <b>38</b> extending between the inner and outer peripheries <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> allow for selective adjustment in the length of the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, particularly, that by tearing off a distal end portion of the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, a user may decrease the overall length of the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The perforations <b>38</b> extending parallel to the inner periphery <b>30</b> allow for selective adjustment of the size of the main body opening <b>28</b>. In particular, a user may increase the size of the main body opening <b>28</b> by tearing away the inner-most portion of the main body <b>16</b>, i.e., that portion which defines the inner periphery <b>30</b>. Thus, a new inner periphery <b>30</b> is formed which defines a larger main body opening <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Although the foregoing describes a generally U-shaped guard <b>10</b> having a closed end portion and an open end portion, it is also contemplated that other embodiments of the guard <b>10</b> may define a completely enclosed area. In such an embodiment, the guard <b>10</b> may completely circumnavigate the user's fingernail <b>14</b> when the guard is applied to the finger <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The guard <b>10</b> may further comprise a template <b>40</b> adapted to extend over the main body opening <b>28</b>. The template <b>40</b> may be used to impart a design or other indicia onto the fingernail <b>14</b>, typically over a base coat of nail polish. The design may include a shape, letter, number, word, symbol, logo, or other indicia known in the art. In this respect, there is no limit as to the shape or configuration of the template design. In the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIGS. 4-5</figref>, the template <b>40</b> includes a palm tree design, while the template <b>40</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a diamond-shaped design.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">According to one embodiment, the template <b>40</b> includes a first surface, an opposing second surface, and a template opening <b>42</b> extending through the template <b>40</b> between the first and second surfaces. The template opening <b>42</b> corresponds to the shape of the template design. The template <b>40</b> may be coupled to the main body <b>16</b> and transitional relative thereto between a covered configuration, wherein the template <b>40</b> extends over the main body opening <b>28</b>, and an uncovered configuration, wherein the main body opening <b>28</b> is uncovered by the template <b>40</b>. The template <b>40</b> may include an adhesive to allow the template <b>40</b> to be adhered to either the main body <b>40</b> or the user's finger <b>12</b> when the template <b>40</b> is in the uncovered configuration. <figref>FIGS. 4-5</figref> depict an overlay-style template <b>40</b><i>a, </i>which is separate from the main body <b>16</b> and is adapted to cover the main body opening <b>28</b> during use of the template <b>40</b><i>a. </i><figref>FIG. 6</figref> depicts a flap-style template <b>40</b><i>b, </i>which is coupled to the main body <b>16</b> and may be folded relative thereto between the covered and uncovered configurations, as will be described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Although the exemplary embodiments of the template <b>40</b> include an opening <b>42</b> corresponding to the shape of the desired design or indicia, it is contemplated that in other embodiments, the template <b>40</b> may include a surface corresponding to the shape of the desired design or indicia, with that surface being surrounded by an opening. In this regard, the template may allow a user to apply nail polish in the ânegative spaceâ surrounding the design or indicia. In this respect, the term âtemplateâ may broadly refer to anything useable in concert with the main body <b>16</b> for assisting in creating a desired look on the fingernail <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">According to one embodiment, the guard <b>10</b> may be adapted to provide benefits to the skin and/or cuticle when applied thereto. For instance, the guard <b>10</b> may include a cosmetic or medicinal moisturizing layer integrated into the adhesive, template <b>40</b>, or other layer. It is also understood that in connection with use of the guard <b>10</b>, a moisturizing cream, gel, or the like may be applied before and/or after use of the guard <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">With the basic structure of the guard <b>10</b> described above, the following discussion will focus on an exemplary use of the guard <b>10</b>. The method of using the guard <b>10</b> may begin by removing the guard <b>10</b> from a sheet or liner so as to expose an adhesive layer. If the guard <b>10</b> includes perforations <b>38</b> for size adjustment, the guard <b>10</b> may be specifically sized to fit around a specific one of the user's fingernails <b>14</b> by tearing the guard <b>10</b> along the perforations <b>38</b>. The guard <b>10</b> may be sized to increase the size of the main body opening <b>28</b>, or to adjust the size of one or both of the main body arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The guard <b>10</b> is placed on the user's finger <b>12</b>, with the main body opening <b>28</b> extending over the fingernail <b>14</b>, and the main body <b>16</b> of the guard <b>10</b> covering the skin adjacent the fingernail <b>14</b>. In this regard, the inner periphery <b>30</b> of the main body <b>16</b> defines an outer boundary for the area upon which the nail polish may be applied. The guard <b>10</b> may be positioned on the finger <b>12</b> with the closed end portion of the guard <b>10</b> extending around the bottom of the fingernail <b>14</b> and the open end portion of the guard <b>10</b> positioned adjacent the tip of the fingernail <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Alternatively, the guard <b>10</b> may be positioned as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, with the open end portion of the guard <b>10</b> positioned adjacent the bottom of the fingernail <b>14</b>, and the closed end portion of the guard <b>10</b> being adjacent the tip of the fingernail <b>14</b>. In some instances, it may be desirable to completely circumscribe the fingernail <b>14</b> with guard material, and thus, two guards <b>10</b> may be used, wherein one guard <b>10</b> extends around the bottom of the fingernail <b>14</b>, while another guard <b>10</b> extends around the top of the fingernail <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">With the guard <b>10</b> placed in the desirable position on the user's finger <b>12</b>, the guard <b>10</b> is pressed against the finger <b>12</b> to adhere the guard <b>10</b> to the finger <b>12</b>. The arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may extend in a circumferential direction along the finger (e.g., the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may wrap around the finger <b>12</b>), and in some instance, the arms <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may overlap with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">It is understood that a user will likely apply nail polish to every fingernail <b>14</b> on a given hand. Thus, the user may repeat the above-described process for each fingernail <b>14</b> before applying nail polish to the fingernail(s) <b>14</b>. However, there is no requirement that nail polish is applied only after guards <b>10</b> have been applied to all fingernails <b>14</b>. Along these lines, the user may adhere a guard <b>10</b> to a single fingernail <b>14</b>, and apply nail polish to that fingernail <b>14</b> before applying guards <b>10</b> to the other fingernails <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">When the guard <b>10</b> has been adhered to the finger <b>12</b>, the nail polish may be applied to the fingernail <b>14</b> using application methods known in the art, such as using a brush or similar applicator. The guard <b>10</b> preferably remains on the finger <b>12</b> until the nail polish is dried or at least partially dried. When the user desires to remove the guard <b>10</b>, the user peals the guard <b>10</b> off the finger <b>12</b>. The guard <b>10</b> may be disposed of after a single use, or stored for subsequent use.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some instances, the guard <b>10</b> may include a template <b>40</b> for applying a design or other indicia to the user's fingernail <b>14</b>. In particular, the template <b>40</b> may be used to create the design using a nail polish color that contrasts with an underlying base coat color. The template <b>40</b> may be an overlay-type template <b>40</b><i>a </i>which fits over the main body opening <b>28</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) or a flap-like body <b>40</b><i>b </i>which is foldable relative to the main body <b>16</b> (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In the case of an overlay-type template <b>40</b><i>a, </i>the overlay <b>40</b><i>a </i>is removed from the main body <b>16</b> when applying the base coat. Once the base coat has dried, the overlay <b>40</b><i>a </i>is placed over the main body opening <b>28</b> to assume a covered configuration. The overlay <b>40</b><i>a </i>may include an adhesive area for temporarily securing the adhesive to the finger <b>12</b> during use. Along these lines, the template <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be adhered to the fingernail <b>14</b>, guard <b>10</b>, or finger <b>12</b>. Once the template <b>40</b><i>a </i>is secured, the user may apply the nail polish over the template <b>40</b><i>a </i>to apply the design to the fingernail <b>14</b>. The nail polish flows through the opening <b>42</b> formed in the template <b>40</b><i>a </i>and dries on the fingernail <b>14</b> in the shape of the opening <b>42</b>. The template <b>40</b><i>a </i>is preferably maintained in the covered position while the nail polish is applied to the fingernail <b>14</b>, as well as during drying of the nail polish. Subsequently, the template <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be removed, either separate from the main body <b>16</b> or concurrently with removal of the main body <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In the case of a flap-type template <b>40</b><i>b, </i>the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be selectively transitioned between covered and uncovered configurations. Since the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may remain coupled to the main body <b>16</b> throughout use of the guard <b>10</b>, the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be transitioned to the uncovered configuration during application of the underlying base coat nail polish. The flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may include an adhesive area to allow the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>to be secured to the main body <b>16</b> or finger <b>12</b> for maintaining the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the uncovered configuration. Alternatively, the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be folded from the covered position toward the uncovered position for maintaining the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the uncovered configuration. Once the base coat has dried, the flap <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be transitioned from the uncovered configuration to the covered configuration to cover the main body opening <b>28</b>. When in the covered configuration, the nail polish for the template design may be applied over the template to create the template design over the base coat. The template <b>40</b><i>b </i>preferably remains in the covered configuration during application of the nail polish as well as drying of the nail polish. Afterwards, the guard <b>10</b> may be removed from the finger <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The guard <b>10</b> may simplify the application of nail polish on the fingernail <b>14</b>, as the user may not be required to exhibit as much precision and control over application of the nail polish to the surface of the fingernail <b>14</b> because the guard <b>10</b> may prevent nail polish from being inadvertently applied to the skin surrounding the fingernail <b>14</b>. Thus, the guard <b>10</b> may allow the user to more quickly apply nail polish to the fingernail <b>14</b>. Use of the guard <b>10</b> may also result in a more professional overall appearance, since the nail polish will define clean, crisp boundaries.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The particulars shown herein are by way of example only for purposes of illustrative discussion, and are not presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, no attempt is made to show any more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the different features of the various embodiments, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how these may be implemented in practice.</p>
