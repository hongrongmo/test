      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Mice that express antibodies that are fully human, or partly human and partly mouse, are known in the art. For example, transgenic mice that express fully human antibodies from transgenes containing human light and heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region genes have been reported. Genetically modified mice that comprise a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain variable region (HCVR) gene segments and kappa (Îº) light chain variable region (LCVR) gene segments with human HCVR and LCVR gene segments and that make chimeric antibodies with a chimeric human/mouse kappa chain are known as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Antibody light chains are encoded by one of two separate loci: kappa (Îº) and lambda (Î»). Mouse antibody light chains are primarily of the Îº type. The ratio of Îº to Î» light chain usage in humans is about 60:40, whereas in mice it is about 95:5. Biased usage of Îº light chains in mice is reportedly sustained in genetically modified mice capable of expressing fully or partly human antibodies. Thus, mice that express fully or partly human antibodies appear to be constrained in lambda variable usage.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There is a need in the art to generate lambda variable regions, whether mouse or human, for use in making epitope-binding proteins. There is a need in the art for mice that express fully or partly human antibodies, wherein the mice display an increased lambda variable (VÎ») usage.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0172">Although specific features of various embodiments are discussed in detail, the descriptions of the specific aspects, embodiments, and examples do not limit the subject matter of the claims; it is the claims that describe the scope of the invention. All terms and phrases used in this disclosure include the meanings normally ascribed to them in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0173">The term âcontiguousâ includes reference to occurrence on the same nucleic acid molecule, e.g., two nucleic acid sequences are âcontiguousâ if they occur on the same nucleic molecule but are interrupted by another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a rearranged V(D)J sequence is âcontiguousâ with a constant region gene sequence, although the final codon of the V(D)J sequence is not followed immediately by the first codon of the constant region sequence. In another example, two V gene segment sequences are âcontiguousâ if they occur on the same genomic fragment, although they may be separated by sequence that does not encode a codon of the V region, e.g., they may be separated by a regulatory sequence, e.g., a promoter or other noncoding sequence. In one embodiment, a contiguous sequence includes a genomic fragment that contains genomic sequences arranged as found in a wild-type genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0174">The phrase âderived fromâ when used concerning a variable region âderived fromâ a cited gene or gene segment includes the ability to trace the sequence back to a particular unrearranged gene segment or gene segments that were rearranged to form a gene that expresses the variable domain (accounting for, where applicable, splice differences and somatic mutations).</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0175">The phrase âfunctionalâ when used concerning a variable region gene segment or joining gene segment refers to usage in an expressed antibody repertoire; e.g., in humans VÎ» gene segments 3-1, 4-3, 2-8, etc. are functional, whereas VÎ» gene segments 3-2, 3-4, 2-5, etc. are nonfunctional.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">A âheavy chain locusâ includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse heavy chain variable (V<sub>H</sub>), heavy chain diversity (D<sub>H</sub>), heavy chain joining (J<sub>H</sub>), and heavy chain constant (C<sub>H</sub>) region DNA sequences are found.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0177">A âÎº locusâ includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse Îº variable (VÎº), Îº joining (JÎº), and Îº constant (CÎº) region DNA sequences are found.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">A âÎ» locusâ includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse Î» variable (VÎ»), Î» joining (JÎ»), and Î» constant (CÎ») region DNA sequences are found.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">The term âunrearrangedâ includes the state of an immunoglobulin locus wherein V gene segments and J gene segments (for heavy chains, D gene segments as well) are maintained separately but are capable of being joined to form a rearranged V(D)J gene that comprises a single V,(D),J of the V(D)J repertoire.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Mice Expressing Human Î» Variable Domains</heading>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">Mice that express antibodies that are fully human, or partly human and partly mouse, have previously been reported. VELOCIMMUNEÂ® genetically engineered mice comprise a replacement of unrearranged V(D)J gene segments at endogenous mouse loci with human V(D)J gene segments. VELOCIMMUNEÂ® mice express chimeric antibodies having human variable domains and mouse constant domains (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,605,237). Most other reports concern mice that express fully human antibodies from fully human transgenes in mice that have disabled endogenous immunoglobulin loci.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">Antibody light chains are encoded by one of two separate loci: kappa (Îº) and lambda (Î»). Mouse antibody light chains are primarily of the Îº type. Mice that make mouse antibodies, and modified mice that make fully human or chimeric human-mouse antibodies, display a bias in light chain usage. Humans also exhibit light chain bias, but not so pronounced as in mice; the ratio of Îº light chains to Î» light chains in mice is about 95:5, whereas in humans the ratio is about 60:40. The more pronounced bias in mice is not thought to severely affect antibody diversity, because in mice the Î» variable locus is not so diverse in the first instance. This is not so in humans. The human Î» light chain locus is richly diverse.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">The human Î» light chain locus extends over 1,000 kb and contains over 80 genes that encode variable (V) or joining (J) segments (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). Within the human Î» light chain locus, over half of all observed VÎ» domains are encoded by the gene segments 1-40, 1-44, 2-8, 2-14, and 3-21. Overall, about 30 or so of the human VÎ» gene segments are believed to be functional. There are seven JÎ» gene segments, only four of which are regarded as generally functional JÎ» gene segmentsâJÎ»1, JÎ»2, JÎ»3, and JÎ»7.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0183">The Î» light chain locus in humans is similar in structure to the Îº locus of both mice and humans in that the human Î» light chain locus has several variable region gene segments that are capable of recombining to form a functional light chain protein. The human Î» light chain locus contains approximately 70 V gene segments and 7 JÎ»-CÎ» gene segment pairs. Only four of these JÎ»-CÎ» gene segment pairs appear to be functional. In some alleles, a fifth JÎ»-CÎ» gene segment pair is reportedly a pseudo gene (CÎ»6). The 70 VÎ» gene segments appear to contain 38 functional gene segments. The 70 VÎ» sequences are arranged in three clusters, all of which contain different members of distinct V gene family groups (clusters A, B and C; <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). This is a potentially rich source of relatively untapped diversity for generating antibodies with human V regions in non-human animals.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">In stark contrast, the mouse Î» light chain locus contains only two or three (depending on the strain) mouse VÎ» region gene segments (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). At least for this reason, the severe Îº bias in mice is not thought to be particularly detrimental to total antibody diversity.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0185">According published maps of the mouse Î» light chain locus, the locus consists essentially of two clusters of gene segments within a span of approximately 200 kb (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). The two clusters contain two sets of V, J, and C genes that are capable of independent rearrangement: VÎ»2-JÎ»2-CÎ»2-JÎ»4-CÎ»4 and VÎ»1-JÎ»3-CÎ»3-JÎ»1-CÎ»1. Although VÎ»2 has been found to recombine with all JÎ» gene segments, VÎ»1 appears to exclusively recombine with CÎ»1. CÎ»4 is believed to be a pseudo gene with defective splice sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0186">The mouse Îº light chain locus is strikingly different. The structure and number of gene segments that participate in the recombination events leading to a functional light chain protein from the mouse Îº locus is much more complex (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). Thus, mouse Î» light chains do not greatly contribute to the diversity of an antibody population in a typical mouse.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0187">Exploiting the rich diversity of the human Î» light chain locus in mice would likely result in, among other things, a source for a more complete human repertoire of light chain V domains. Previous attempts to tap this diversity used human transgenes containing chunks of the human Î» light chain locus randomly incorporated into the mouse genome (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,998,514 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,435,871). Mice containing these randomly integrated transgenes reportedly express fully human Î» light chains, however, in some cases, one or both endogenous light chain loci remain intact. This situation is not desirable as the human Î» light chain sequences contend with the mouse light chain (Îº or Î») in the expressed antibody repertoire of the mouse.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0188">In contrast, the inventors describe genetically modified mice that are capable of expressing one or more Î» light chain nucleic acid sequences directly from a mouse light chain locus, including by replacement at an endogenous mouse light chain locus. Genetically modified mice capable of expressing human Î» light chain sequences from an endogenous locus may be further bred to mice that comprise a human heavy chain locus and thus be used to express antibodies comprising V regions (heavy and light) that are fully human. In various embodiments. The V regions express with mouse constant regions. In various embodiments, no endogenous mouse immunoglobulin gene segments are present and the V regions express with human constant regions. These antibodies would prove useful in numerous applications, both diagnostic as well as therapeutic.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0189">Many advantages can be realized for various embodiments of expressing binding proteins derived from human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments in mice. Advantages can be realized by placing human Î» sequences at an endogenous light chain locus, for example, the mouse Îº or Î» locus. Antibodies made from such mice can have light chains that comprise human VÎ» domains fused to a mouse C<sub>L </sub>region, specifically a mouse CÎº or CÎ» region. The mice will also express human VÎ» domains that are suitable for identification and cloning for use with human C<sub>L </sub>regions, specifically CÎº and/or CÎ» regions. Because B cell development in such mice is otherwise normal, it is possible to generate compatible VÎ» domains (including somatically mutated VÎ» domains) in the context of either CÎ» or CÎº regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">Genetically modified mice are described that comprise an unrearranged VÎ» gene segment at an immunoglobulin Îº or Î» light chain locus. Mice that express antibodies that comprise a light chain having a human VÎ» domain fused to a CÎº and/or CÎ» region are described.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Sterile Transcripts of the Immunoglobulin Îº Light Chain Locus</heading>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">Variations on the theme of expressing human immunoglobulin Î» sequences in mice are reflected in various embodiments of genetically modified mice capable of such expression. Thus, in some embodiments, the genetically modified mice comprise certain non-coding sequence(s) from a human locus. In one embodiment, the genetically modified mouse comprises human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments at an endogenous Îº light chain locus, and further comprises a human Îº light chain genomic fragment. In a specific embodiment, the human Îº light chain genomic fragment is a non-coding sequence naturally found between a human VÎº gene segment and a human JÎº gene segment.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">The human and mouse Îº light chain loci contain sequences that encode sterile transcripts that lack either a start codon or an open reading frame, and that are regarded as elements that regulate transcription of the Îº light chain loci. These sterile transcripts arise from an intergenic sequence located downstream or 3â² of the most proximal VÎº gene segment and upstream or 5â² of the Îº light chain intronic enhancer (EÎºi) that is upstream of the Îº light chain constant region gene (CÎº). The sterile transcripts arise from rearrangement of the intergenic sequence to form a VÎºJÎº1 segment fused to a CÎº.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">A replacement of the Îº light chain locus upstream of the CÎº gene would remove the intergenic region encoding the sterile transcripts. Therefore, in various embodiments, a replacement of mouse Îº light chain sequence upstream of the mouse CÎº gene with human Î» light chain gene segments would result in a humanized mouse Îº light chain locus that contains human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments but not the Îº light chain intergenic region that encodes the sterile transcripts.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">As described herein, humanization of the endogenous mouse Îº light chain locus with human Î» light chain gene segments, wherein the humanization removes the intergenic region, results in a striking drop in usage of the Îº light chain locus, coupled with a marked increase in Î» light chain usage. Therefore, although a humanized mouse that lacks the intergenic region is useful in that it can make antibodies with human light chain variable domains (e.g., human Î» or Îº domains), usage from the locus decreases.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">Also described is humanization of the endogenous mouse Îº light chain locus with human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments coupled with an insertion of a human Îº intergenic region to create a VÎ» locus that contains, with respect to transcription, between the final human VÎ» gene segment and the first human JÎ» gene segment, a Îº intergenic region; which exhibits a B cell population with a higher expression than a locus that lacks the Îº intergenic region. This observation is consistent with a hypothesis that the intergenic regionâdirectly through a sterile transcript, or indirectlyâsuppresses usage from the endogenous Î» light chain locus. Under such a hypothesis, including the intergenic region would result in a decrease in usage of the endogenous Î» light chain locus, leaving the mouse a restricted choice but to employ the modified (Î» into Îº) locus to generate antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0196">In various embodiments, a replacement of mouse Îº light chain sequence upstream of the mouse CÎº gene with human Î» light chain sequence further comprises a human Îº light chain intergenic region disposed, with respect to transcription, between the 3â² untranslated region of the 3â² most VÎ» gene segment and 5â² to the first human JÎ» gene segment. Alternatively, such an intergenic region may be omitted from a replaced endogenous Îº light chain locus (upstream of the mouse CÎº gene) by making a deletion in the endogenous Î» light chain locus. Likewise, under this embodiment, the mouse generates antibodies from an endogenous Îº light chain locus containing human Î» light chain sequences.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Approaches to Engineering Mice to Express Human VÎ» Domains</heading>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0197">Various approaches to making genetically modified mice that make antibodies that contain a light chain that has a human VÎ» domain fused to an endogenous C<sub>L </sub>(e.g. Ck or CÎ») region are described. Genetic modifications are described that, in various embodiments, comprise a deletion of one or both endogenous light chain loci. For example, to eliminate mouse Î» light chains from the endogenous antibody repertoire a deletion of a first VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster and replacement, in whole or in part, of the VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments of a second gene cluster with human VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments can be made. Genetically modified mouse embryos, cells, and targeting constructs for making the mice, mouse embryos, and cells are also provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0198">The deletion of one endogenous VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster and replacement of the VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments of another endogenous VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster employs a relatively minimal disruption in natural antibody constant region association and function in the animal, in various embodiments, because endogenous CÎ» genes are left intact and therefore retain normal functionality and capability to associate with the constant region of an endogenous heavy chain. Thus, in such embodiments the modification does not affect other endogenous heavy chain constant regions dependent upon functional light chain constant regions for assembly of a functional antibody molecule containing two heavy chains and two light chains. Further, in various embodiments the modification does not affect the assembly of a functional membrane-bound antibody molecule involving an endogenous heavy chain and a light chain, e.g., a hVÎ» domain linked to a mouse CÎ» region. Because at least one functional CÎ» gene is retained at the endogenous locus, animals containing a replacement of the VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments of an endogenous VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster with human VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments should be able to make normal Î» light chains that are capable of binding antigen during an immune response through the human VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments present in the expressed antibody repertoire of the animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0199">A schematic illustration (not to scale) of a deleted endogenous mouse VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster is provided in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. As illustrated, the mouse Î» light chain locus is organized into two gene clusters, both of which contain function gene segments capable of recombining to form a function mouse Î» light chain. The endogenous mouse VÎ»1-JÎ»3-CÎ»3-JÎ»1-CÎ»1 gene cluster is deleted by a targeting construct (Targeting Vector 1) with a neomycin cassette flanked by recombination sites. The other endogenous gene cluster (VÎ»2-VÎ»3-JÎ»2-CÎ»2-JÎ»4-CÎ»4) is deleted in part by a targeting construct (Targeting Vector 2) with a hygromycin-thymidine kinase cassette flanked by recombination sites. In this second targeting event, the CÎ»2-JÎ»4-CÎ»4 endogenous gene segments are retained. The second targeting construct (Targeting Vector 2) is constructed using recombination sites that are different than those in the first targeting construct (Targeting Vector 1) thereby allowing for the selective deletion of the selection cassette after a successful targeting has been achieved. The resulting double-targeted locus is functionally silenced in that no endogenous Î» light chain can be produced. This modified locus can be used for the insertion of human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments to create an endogenous mouse Î» locus comprising human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments, whereby, upon recombination at the modified locus, the animal produces Î» light chains comprising rearranged human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments linked to an endogenous mouse CÎ» gene segment.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0200">Genetically modifying a mouse to render endogenous Î» gene segments nonfunctional, in various embodiments, results in a mouse that exhibits exclusively Îº light chains in its antibody repertoire, making the mouse useful for evaluating the role of Î» light chains in the immune response, and useful for making an antibody repertoire comprising VÎº domains but not VÎ» domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0201">A genetically modified mouse that expresses a hVÎ» linked to a mouse CÎ» gene having been recombined at the endogenous mouse Î» light chain locus can be made by any method known in the art. A schematic illustration (not to scale) of the replacement of the endogenous mouse VÎ»2-VÎ»3-JÎ»2 gene segments with human VÎ» and JÎ» gene segments is provided in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. As illustrated, an endogenous mouse Î» light chain locus that had been rendered nonfunctional is replaced by a targeting construct (12/1-Î» Targeting Vector) that includes a neomycin cassette flanked by recombination sites. The VÎ»2-VÎ»3-JÎ»2 gene segments are replaced with a genomic fragment containing human Î» sequence that includes 12 hVÎ» gene segments and a single hJÎ» gene segment.</p>

      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0203">Further modifications to the modified endogenous Î» light chain locus can be achieved with using similar techniques to insert more hVÎ» gene segments. For example, schematic illustrations of two additional targeting constructs (+16-Î» and +12-Î» Targeting Vectors) used for progressive insertion of addition human hVÎ» gene segments are provided in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>. As illustrated, additional genomic fragments containing specific human hVÎ» gene segments are inserted into the modified endogenous Î» light chain locus in successive steps using homology provided by the previous insertion of human Î» light chain sequences. Upon recombination with each targeting construct illustrated, in sequential fashion, 28 additional hVÎ» gene segments are inserted into the modified endogenous Î» light chain locus. This creates a chimeric locus that produces a Î» light chain protein that comprises human VÎ» JÎ» gene segments linked to a mouse CÎ» gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0204">The above approaches to insert human Î» light chain gene segments at the mouse Î» locus, maintains the enhancers positioned downstream of the CÎ»2-JÎ» gene segments (designated Enh 2.4, Enh and Enh 3.1 <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>).

The methods include selectively rendering one endogenous mouse VÎ»-JÎ»-CÎ» gene cluster nonfunctional (e.g., by a targeted deletion), and employing a hVÎ» and JÎ» gene segments at the endogenous mouse Î» light chain locus to express a hVÎ» domain in a mouse.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0206">Alternatively, in a second approach, human Î» light chain gene segments may be positioned at the endogenous Îº light chain locus. The genetic modification, in various embodiments, comprises a deletion of the endogenous Îº light chain locus. For example, to eliminate mouse Îº light chains from the endogenous antibody repertoire a deletion of the mouse VÎº and JÎº gene segments can be made. Genetically modified mouse embryos, cells, and targeting constructs for making the mice, mouse embryos, and cells are also provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0207">For the reasons stated above, the deletion of the mouse VÎº and JÎº gene segments employs a relatively minimal disruption. A schematic illustration (not to scale) of deleted mouse VÎº and JÎº gene segments is provided in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The endogenous mouse VÎº and JÎº gene segments are deleted via recombinase-mediated deletion of mouse sequences position between two precisely positioned targeting vectors each employing site-specific recombination sites. A first targeting vector (JÎº Targeting Vector) is employed in a first targeting event to delete the mouse JÎº gene segments. A second targeting vector (VÎº Targeting Vector) is employed in a second, sequential targeting event to delete a sequence located 5â² of the most distal mouse VÎº gene segment. Both targeting vectors contain site-specific recombination sites thereby allowing for the selective deletion of both selection cassettes and all intervening mouse Îº light chain sequences after a successful targeting has been achieved. The resulting deleted locus is functionally silenced in that no endogenous Îº light chain can be produced. This modified locus can be used for the insertion of hVÎ» and JÎ» gene segments to create an endogenous mouse Îº locus comprising hVÎ» and JÎ» gene segments, whereby, upon recombination at the modified locus, the animal produces Î» light chains comprising rearranged hVÎ» and JÎ» gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse CÎº gene segment. Various targeting vectors comprising human Î» light chain sequences can be used in conjunction with this deleted mouse Îº locus to create a hybrid light chain locus containing human Î» gene segments operably linked with a mouse CÎº region.</p>

These new BAC clones were then digested with I-CeuI and PI-SceI to release the unique fragments containing the upstream neomycin cassette and the contiguous human Î» and Îº sequences and ligated into a modified mouse BAC clone 302g12 which contained from 5â² to 3â² mouse genomic sequence 5â² of the endogenous Îº locus, an I-CeuI site, a 5â² Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3â² Frt site, hVÎ» gene segments (3-12 to 3-1), a NotI site Ë200 bp downstream of VÎ»3-1, 23 kb of human Îº sequence naturally found between the human VÎº4-1 and JÎº1 gene segments, either a hJÎ»1 gene segment or a genomic fragment containing hJÎ»1, JÎ»2, JÎ»3 and JÎ»7 gene segments, the mouse EÎºi, the mouse CÎº gene and EÎº3â² (FIG. 4, 12hVI-VkJk-hJI1 and 12hVI-VkJk-4hJI Targeting Vectors). Homologous recombination with both of these targeting vectors created two separate modified mouse Îº light chain loci containing 12 hVÎ» gene segments, human Îº genomic sequence, and either one or four hJÎ» gene segments operably linked to the endogenous mouse CÎº gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric human Î»/mouse Îº light chain.</p>

A Ë172 kb DNA fragment from human BAC clone RP11-761113 (Invitrogen) containing 21 consecutive hVÎ» gene segments from cluster A was engineered with a 5â² homology arm containing mouse genomic sequence 5â² to either the endogenous Îº or Î» light chain loci and a 3â² homology arm containing human genomic Î» sequence.

A 93,674 bp DNA fragment from human BAC clone RP11-22118 (Invitrogen) containing 12 consecutive hVÎ» gene segments from cluster B was engineered with a 5â² homology arm containing mouse genomic sequence 5â² to either the endogenous mouse Îº or Î» light chain loci and a 3â² homology arm containing human genomic Î» sequence. The 5â² homology arms used in this targeting construct were the same 5â² homology arms used for the addition of 16 hVÎ» gene segments described above (<figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>).

      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0252">Targeted BAC DNA made according to the foregoing Examples was used to electroporate mouse ES cells to create modified ES cells for generating chimeric mice that express human Î» light chain gene segments. ES cells containing an insertion of unrearranged human Î» light chain gene segments were identified by a quantitative TAQMANÂ® assay. Specific primers sets and probes were design for insertion of human Î» sequences and associated selection cassettes (gain of allele, GOA), loss of endogenous mouse sequences and any selection cassettes (loss of allele, LOA) and retention of flanking mouse sequences (allele retention, AR). For each additional insertion of human Î» sequences, additional primer sets and probes were used to confirm the presence of the additional human Î» sequences as well as the previous primer sets and probes used to confirm retention of the previously targeted human sequences. Table 1 sets forth the primers and associated probes used in the quantitative PCR assays. Table 2 sets forth the combinations used for confirming the insertion of each section of human Î» light chain gene segments in ES cell clones.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0253">ES cells bearing the human Î» light chain gene segments are optionally transfected with a construct that expresses FLP in order to remove the Frt'ed neomycin cassette introduced by the insertion of the targeting construct containing human VÎ»5-52-VÎ»1-40 gene segments (<figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>). The neomycin cassette may optionally be removed by breeding to mice that express FLP recombinase (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,774,279). Optionally, the neomycin cassette is retained in the mice.</p>

      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0256">Mice homozygous for each of three successive insertions of hVÎ» gene segments with a single hJÎ» gene segment (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) and mice homozygous for a first insertion of hVÎ» gene segments with either a single hJÎ» gene segment or four human JÎ» gene segments including a human VÎº-JÎº genomic sequence (<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>) were analyzed for Îº and Î» light chain expression in splenocytes using flow cytometry.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0257">Briefly, spleens were harvested from groups of mice (ranging from three to seven animals per group) and grinded using glass slides. Following lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) with ACK lysis buffer (Lonza Walkersville), splenocytes were stained with fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies specific for mouse CD19 (Clone 1 D3; BD Biosciences), mouse CD3 (17A2; Biolegend), mouse IgÎº (187.1; BD Biosciences) and mouse IgÎ» (RML-42; Biolegend). Data was acquired using a BDâ¢ LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FLOWJOâ¢ software (Tree Star, Inc.). Table 3 sets forth the average percent values for B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>), Îº light chain (CD19<sup>+</sup>IgÎº<sup>+</sup>IgÎ»<sup>â</sup>) and Î» light chain (CD19<sup>+</sup>IgÎº<sup>â</sup>IgÎ»<sup>+</sup>) expression observed in splenocytes from groups of animals bearing each genetic modification.</p>

Bone marrow was collected from femurs by flushing with complete RPMI medium (RPMI medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, 2-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, and gentamycin). RBCs from spleen and bone marrow preparations were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Lonza Walkersville), followed by washing with complete RPMI medium. 1Ã10<sup>6 </sup>cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (2.4G2, BD Biosciences) on ice for 10 minutes, followed by labeling with a selected antibody panel for 30 min on ice.</p>

      <p id="p-00270-en" num="0265">Mice heterozygous for a first insertion of human Î» sequences (hVÎ»3-12-hVÎ»3-1 and hJÎ»1, <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) and homozygous for a third insertion of human Î» sequences (hVÎ»5-52-hVÎ»3-1 and hJÎ»1, <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) were analyzed for human Î» light chain gene usage by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using RNA isolated from splenocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0266">Briefly, spleens were harvested and perfused with 10 mL RPMI-1640 (Sigma) with 5% HI-FBS in sterile disposable bags. Each bag containing a single spleen was then placed into a STOMACHERâ¢ (Seward) and homogenized at a medium setting for 30 seconds. Homogenized spleens were filtered using a 0.7 Î¼m cell strainer and then pelleted with a centrifuge (1000 rpm for 10 minutes) and RBCs were lysed in BD PHARM LYSEâ¢ (BD Biosciences) for three minutes. Splenocytes were diluted with RPMI-1640 and centrifuged again, followed by resuspension in 1 mL of PBS (Irvine Scientific). RNA was isolated from pelleted splenocytes using standard techniques known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0267">RT-PCR was performed on splenocyte RNA using primers specific for human hVÎ» gene segments and the mouse CÎº gene (Table 6). PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced with primers M13 Forward (GTAAAACGAC GGCCAG; SEQ ID NO:55) and M13 Reverse (CAGGAAACAG CTATGAC; SEQ ID NO:56) located within the vector at locations flanking the cloning site. Eighty-four total clones derived from the first and third insertions of human Î» sequences were sequenced to determine hVÎ» gene usage (Table 7). The nucleotide sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»1-mCÎº junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00273-en" num="0268">In a similar fashion, mice homozygous for a third insertion of human Î» light chain gene sequences (i.e. 40 hVÎ» gene segments and four hJÎ» gene segments including a human VÎº-JÎº genomic sequence, bottom of <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>) operably linked to the endogenous mouse CÎº gene were analyzed for human Î» light chain gene usage by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from splenocytes (as described above). The human Î» light chain gene segment usage for 26 selected RT-PCR clones are shown in Table 8. The nucleotide sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»-mCÎº junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0269">In a similar fashion, mice homozygous for a first insertion of human Î» light chain gene segments (12 hVÎ» gene segments and hJÎ»1, <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> &amp; <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>) operably linked to the endogenous mouse CÎ»2 gene were analyzed for human Î» light chain gene usage by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from splenocytes (as described above). The primers specific for hVÎ» gene segments (Table 6) were paired with one of two primers specific for the mouse CÎ»2 gene; CÎ»2-1 (SEQ ID NO:104) or CÎ»2-2 (SEQ ID NO:105).</p>
      <p id="p-00275-en" num="0270">Multiple hVÎ» gene segments rearranged to hÎ»1 were observed from the RT-PCR clones from mice bearing human Î» light chain gene segments at the endogenous mouse Î» light chain locus. The nucleotide sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»-mCÎ»2 junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows the sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»1-mCÎº junction for RT-PCR clones from mice bearing a first and third insertion of hVÎ» gene segments with a single hJÎ» gene segment. The sequences shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> illustrate unique rearrangements involving different hVÎ» gene segments with hJÎ»1 recombined to the mouse CÎº gene. Heterozygous mice bearing a single modified endogenous Îº locus containing 12 hVÎ» gene segments and hJÎ»1 and homozygous mice bearing two modified endogenous Îº loci containing 40 hVÎ» gene segments and hJÎ» were both able to produce human Î» gene segments operably linked to the mouse CÎº gene and produce B cells that expressed human Î» light chains. These rearrangements demonstrate that the chimeric loci were able to independently rearrange human Î» gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, these modifications to the endogenous Îº light chain locus did not render any of the hVÎ» gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining multiple hVÎ» and a hJÎ» (JÎ»1) gene segment during B cell development as evidenced by 16 different hVÎ» gene segments that were observed to rearrange with hJÎ» (Table 7). Further, these mice made functional antibodies containing rearranged human VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments operably linked to mouse CÎº genes as part of the endogenous immunoglobulin light chain repertoire.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> shows the sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»-mCÎº junction for selected RT-PCR clones from mice homozygous for 40 hVÎ» and four hJÎ» gene segments including a human VÎº-JÎº genomic sequence. The sequences shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref> illustrate additional unique rearrangements involving multiple different hVÎ» gene segments, spanning the entire chimeric locus, with multiple different hJÎ» gene segments rearranged and operably linked to the mouse CÎº gene. Homozygous mice bearing modified endogenous Îº loci containing 40 hVÎ» and four hJÎ» gene segments were also able to produce human Î» gene segments operably linked to the mouse CÎº gene and produce B cells that expressed human Î» light chains. These rearrangements further demonstrate that the all stages of chimeric loci were able to independently rearrange human Î» gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, these additional modifications to the endogenous Îº light chain locus demonstrates that each insertion of human Î» gene segments did not render any of the hVÎ» and/or JÎ» gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining the hVÎ» and JÎ» gene segments during B cell development as evidenced by 12 different hVÎ» gene segments that were observed to rearrange with all four hJÎ» gene segments (Table 8) from the 26 selected RT-PCR clone.

        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> shows the sequence of the hVÎ»-hJÎ»-mCÎ»2 junction for three individual RT-PCR clones from mice homozygous for 12 hVÎ» gene segments and hJÎ»1. The sequences shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> illustrate additional unique rearrangements involving different hVÎ» gene segments, spanning the length of the first insertion, with hJÎ»1 rearranged and operably linked to the mouse CÎ»2 gene (2D1=VÎ»2-8JÎ»1; 2D9=VÎ»3-10JÎ»1; 3E15=VÎ»3-1JÎ»1). One clone demonstrated a nonproductive rearrangement due to N additions at the hVÎ»-hJÎ» junction (2D1, <figref>FIG. 13</figref>). This is not uncommon in V(D)J recombination, as the joining of gene segments during recombination has been shown to be imprecise. Although this clone represents an unproductive recombinant present in the light chain repertoire of these mice, this demonstrates that the genetic mechanism that contributes to junctional diversity among antibody genes is operating normally in these mice and leading to an antibody repertoire containing light chains with greater diversity.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0274">Homozygous mice bearing modified endogenous Î» loci containing 12 hVÎ» gene segments and hJÎ»1 were also able to produce human Î» gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse CÎ» gene and produce B cells that expressed reverse chimeric Î» light chains containing hVÎ» regions linked to mouse CÎ» regions. These rearrangements further demonstrate that human Î» light chain gene segments placed at the other light chain locus (i.e., the Î» locus) were able to independently rearrange human Î» gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, the modifications to the endogenous Î» light chain locus demonstrate that the insertion of human Î» gene segments did not render any of the hVÎ» and/or hJÎ»1 gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining the hVÎ» and hJÎ»1 gene segments during B cell development. Further, these mice also made functional antibodies containing human VÎ»-JÎ» gene segments operably linked to a mouse CÎ» region as part of the endogenous immunoglobulin light chain repertoire.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0275">As shown in this Example, mice bearing human Î» light chain gene segments at the endogenous Îº and Î» light chain loci are capable of rearranging human Î» light chain gene segments and expressing them in the context of a mouse CÎº and/or CÎ» region as part of the normal antibody repertoire of the mouse because a functional light chain is required at various checkpoints in B cell development in both the spleen and bone marrow. Further, early subsets of B cells (e.g., pre-, pro- and transitional B cells) demonstrate a normal phenotype in these mice as compared to wild type littermates (<figref>FIGS. 9D</figref>, <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B). A small deficit in bone marrow and peripheral B cell populations was observed, which may be attributed to a deletion of a subset of auto-reactive immature B cells and/or a suboptimal association of human Î» light chain with mouse heavy chain. However, the IgÎº/IgÎ» usage observed in these mice demonstrates a situation that is more like human light chain expression than that observed in mice.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Breeding of Mice Expressing Human Î» Light Chains from an Endogenous Light Chain Locus</heading>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0276">To optimize the usage of the human Î» gene segments at an endogenous mouse light chain locus, mice bearing the unrearranged human Î» gene segments are bred to another mouse containing a deletion in the opposing endogenous light chain locus (either Îº or Î»). For example, human Î» gene segments positioned at the endogenous Îº locus would be the only functional light chain gene segments present in a mouse that also carried a deletion in the endogenous Î» light chain locus. In this manner, the progeny obtained would express only human â light chains as described in the foregoing examples. Breeding is performed by standard techniques recognized in the art and, alternatively, by commercial companies, e.g., The Jackson Laboratory. Mouse strains bearing human Î» light chain gene segments at the endogenous Îº locus and a deletion of the endogenous Î» light chain locus are screened for presence of the unique reverse-chimeric (human-mouse) Î» light chains and absence of endogenous mouse Î» light chains.</p>
      <p id="p-00285-en" num="0277">Mice bearing an unrearranged human Î» light chain locus are also bred with mice that contain a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain variable gene locus with the human heavy chain variable gene locus (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,541, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the VELOCIMMUNEÂ® genetically engineered mouse). The VELOCIMMUNEÂ® mouse includes, in part, having a genome comprising human heavy chain variable regions operably linked to endogenous mouse constant region loci such that the mouse produces antibodies comprising a human heavy chain variable region and a mouse heavy chain constant region in response to antigenic stimulation. The DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chains of the antibodies can be isolated and operably linked to DNA encoding the human heavy chain constant regions. The DNA can then be expressed in a cell capable of expressing the fully human heavy chain of the antibody. Upon a suitable breeding schedule, mice bearing a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain locus with the human heavy chain locus and an unrearranged human Î» light chain locus at the endogenous Îº light chain locus is obtained. Antibodies containing somatically mutated human heavy chain variable regions and human Î» light chain variable regions can be isolated upon immunization with an antigen of interest.</p>

      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="1">Generation of Antibodies from Mice Expressing Human Heavy Chains and Human Î» Light Chains</heading>
      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0278">After breeding mice that contain the unrearranged human Î» light chain locus to various desired strains containing modifications and deletions of other endogenous Ig loci (as described above), selected mice are immunized with an antigen of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0279">Generally, a VELOCIMMUNEÂ® mouse containing one of the single rearranged human germline light chain regions is challenged with an antigen, and lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from serum of the animals. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies containing human heavy chain and human Î» light chain that are specific to the antigen used for immunization. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chains and the Î» light chains may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Due to the presence of the additional hVÎ» gene segments as compared to the endogenous mouse Î» locus, the diversity of the light chain repertoire is dramatically increased and confers higher diversity on the antigen-specific repertoire upon immunization. The resulting cloned antibody sequences may be subsequently produced in a cell, such as a CHO cell. Alternatively, DNA encoding the antigen-specific chimeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen-specific lymphocytes (e.g., B cells).</p>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0280">Initially, high affinity chimeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described above, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody containing a somatically mutated human heavy chain and a human A light chain derived from an unrearranged human Î» light chain locus of the invention. Suitable human constant regions include, for example wild type or modified IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4.</p>
