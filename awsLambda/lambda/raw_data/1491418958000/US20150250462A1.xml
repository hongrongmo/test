      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to medical devices, and, more particularly, to an internal tissue puncture closure apparatus.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Various medical procedures, particularly cardiology procedures, involve accessing a corporeal vessel or other lumen through a percutaneous sheath. Access to the vessel necessarily requires the formation of a hole or puncture in the vessel wall so that a medical procedure can be performed. After the particular medical procedure has been performed, the sheath and other tools must eventually be removed from the vessel and the access hole in the vessel wall must be closed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Therefore, a number of closure devices have been developed to close the hole in the vessel wall. Examples of prior vascular puncture closure devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,179,863; 6,090,130; and 6,045,569 and related patents that are hereby incorporated by reference. The closure devices disclosed in the above-referenced patents and others are intended to seal an arteriotomy with an absorbable anchor and a collagen sponge. The anchor and the collagen sponge are held together with a self-tightening slip knot at the arteriotomy by a length of absorbable suture. The anchor and collagen sponge are cinched together across the arteriotomy, creating a sandwich-like effect. In order to seal the hole, it is necessary to apply a compressive sealing force to the arteriotomy, which is normally supplied by the slip-knotted suture. However, if the collagen sponge does not position correctly over the hole, there is potential for bleeding. The prior designs for the collagen sponge are generally rectangular, and have a three-hole or five-hole weave pattern allowing the collagen sponge to corkscrew through the puncture tract as the suture is pulled. However, the size of the rectangular-shaped collagen sponge is limited, because the collagen sponge must fit inside a carrier tube of the tissue puncture closure device.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Because of the limited size and surface area available for the standard rectangular-shaped collagen sponge, sometimes the hole in the vessel is not completely covered or adequately sealed. If the hole is not adequately sealed, residual bleeding may occur, resulting in an extended period of time to reach hemostasis. Therefore, there is a need to provide better coverage at a tissue puncture site to cover a wider area at arterial or other punctures.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one of many possible embodiments, the present invention provides a tissue puncture closure device for partial insertion into and sealing of an internal tissue wall puncture. The tissue puncture closure device comprises a filament, an anchor for insertion through the tissue wall puncture attached to the filament at a first end of the closure device, and a sealing plug disposed proximal of the anchor. The sealing plug, however, includes a high surface area for providing more coverage at the tissue wall puncture site. The high surface area is provided by folding the sealing plug in various configurations, such as an S-fold, a V-fold, two engaged U-folds, or other folds. In addition, other sealing plug configurations such as a cross or X-shaped collagen sponge may provide higher surface areas.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The present specification describes techniques and apparatus for closing an internal tissue wall puncture, preferably using a closure device and an insertion sheath, while reducing the likelihood of leaks. The reduction in the likelihood of leaks is facilitated according to some embodiments by providing more sealing material or more sealing material surface area to provide better coverage at the tissue wall puncture. While the methods and devices shown and described below include reference to specific insertion sheaths and puncture sealing devices, the application of principles described herein to close a tissue puncture is not limited to these specific devices. The principles described herein may be used to close or seal any interior tissue puncture, particularly punctures or incisions in arteries or other bodily lumens. Therefore, while the description below is directed primarily to arterial procedures, the methods and apparatus may be used according to principles described herein with any lumen to control bleeding.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term âtissueâ means an aggregation of morphologically similar cells and associated intercellular matter acting together to perform one or more specific functions in a body. A âlumenâ is any open space or cavity in a bodily organ, especially in a blood vessel. âOpen,â when used as an adjective to modify a shape means without any folds or modifications. âSurface areaâ refers to areas of exposed and unexposed surfaces, including folded surfaces that may be initially internal due to folding, but does not include end surfaces. âLatitudeâ refers to a sidewise distance from a given point or line; a breadth or width. Therefore, âlatitudinallyâ is used as an adverb with reference to a fold across a width, as opposed to a length, of an item. The words âincludingâ and âhaving,â as used in the specification, including the claims, have the same meaning as the word âcomprising.â</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, an internal tissue puncture closure assembly <b>100</b> including a tissue puncture closure device <b>102</b> inserted through an insertion sheath <b>104</b> is shown according to one embodiment of the present invention. The tissue puncture closure device <b>102</b> includes a carrier tube <b>106</b> with a filament such as a suture <b>108</b> extending at least partially therethrough. According to <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, the suture <b>108</b> extends from a first or distal end <b>110</b> of the closure device <b>102</b> to a second or proximal end <b>112</b> of the closure device <b>102</b>. External to the first or distal end <b>110</b> of the carrier tube <b>106</b> is an internal component, which according the present embodiment is an anchor <b>114</b>. The anchor <b>114</b> is an elongated, stiff, low-profile member with a protruding eye <b>116</b>. The anchor <b>114</b> is made of a non-hemostatic biologically resorbable polymer according to the embodiment shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The suture <b>108</b> is also made of a biologically resorbable material and is threaded through the anchor <b>114</b>. An external component, which, according to the present embodiment, is a biologically resorbable collagen sponge <b>118</b> that acts as a sealing plug, is initially disposed within the carrier tube <b>106</b> proximal of the anchor <b>114</b>. The suture <b>108</b> weaves through the collagen sponge <b>118</b> and ties into a self-tightening knot <b>120</b> proximal of the collagen sponge <b>118</b>. Following deployment of anchor <b>114</b> on one side of an interior tissue puncture in a bodily lumen (such as arteriotomy <b>122</b>) and the collagen sponge <b>118</b> on an opposite side of the interior tissue puncture, the suture <b>108</b> may be pulled to contact the anchor <b>114</b> and collagen sponge <b>118</b> on inner and outer surfaces, respectively, of the bodily lumen to compress or sandwich the anchor <b>114</b> and the collagen sponge <b>118</b> across the interior tissue puncture.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The tissue puncture closure device <b>102</b> may also include a tamping tube <b>124</b> disposed within the carrier tube <b>106</b> proximal to the collagen sponge <b>118</b>. The tamping tube <b>124</b>, if used, is slidingly mounted over the suture <b>108</b>. The tamping tube <b>124</b> may be used to tamp the collagen sponge <b>118</b> toward the arteriotomy <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">At the distal end <b>110</b> of the carrier tube <b>106</b> is a nest <b>126</b>. Prior to deployment of the anchor <b>114</b> within an artery, the protruding eye <b>116</b> seats outside the distal end <b>110</b> of the carrier tube <b>106</b>, and one wing of the anchor <b>108</b> rests in the nest <b>126</b>. The nest <b>126</b> is typically crushed into the carrier tube <b>102</b> to a sufficient depth such that the anchor <b>114</b> is flush with an outer diameter of the carrier tube <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The flush arrangement of the anchor <b>114</b> and carrier tube <b>106</b> allows the anchor <b>114</b> to be inserted into the insertion sheath <b>104</b>, and eventually through an internal tissue puncture such as the arteriotomy <b>122</b>. The insertion sheath <b>104</b> comprises a generally flexible tubular member <b>128</b> with a hemostatic valve <b>129</b> at a proximal end thereof. The insertion sheath <b>104</b> includes a fold <b>130</b> disposed at a distal end. The fold <b>130</b> acts as a one-way valve to the anchor <b>114</b>. The fold <b>130</b> is a plastic deformation in a portion of the tubular member <b>128</b> that elastically flexes as the anchor <b>114</b> is pushed out through the distal end of the tubular member <b>128</b>. However, as the anchor <b>114</b> passes though and out of the distal end of the tubular member <b>128</b>, the fold <b>130</b> attempts to spring back to its original deformed position such that the fold <b>130</b> engages the carrier tube <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">After the anchor <b>114</b> passes through the distal end <b>130</b> of the tubular member <b>128</b>, the anchor <b>114</b> enters the arteriotomy <b>122</b> in an artery <b>132</b> or other lumen through a percutaneous incision in a patient. When the anchor <b>114</b> enters the artery <b>132</b>, it rotates and deploys such that its wings are arranged adjacent to an internal wall <b>134</b> of the artery <b>132</b>. The puncture closure device <b>102</b> may be pulled in a proximal direction with respect to the insertion sheath <b>104</b> to facilitate rotation of the anchor <b>114</b>. The fold <b>130</b> in the insertion sheath <b>104</b> prevents reinsertion of the anchor <b>114</b> into the insertion sheath <b>104</b> and causes the anchor <b>114</b> to rotate if it does not do so automatically after passing out of the insertion sheath <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">When the anchor <b>114</b> is properly positioned inside the artery <b>132</b> abutting the internal wall <b>134</b>, the closure device <b>102</b> and the insertion sheath <b>104</b> are withdrawn from the arteriotomy <b>122</b> together. However, because the anchor <b>114</b> is established inside the artery <b>132</b>, retraction of the insertion sheath <b>104</b> and the closure device <b>102</b> exposes the collagen sponge <b>118</b> and, if used, the tamping tube <b>124</b>. Accordingly, the collagen sponge <b>118</b> is deposited at an external situs of the arteriotomy <b>122</b> opposite of the anchor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">However, depositing the collagen sponge <b>114</b> without compressive force at the puncture arteriotomy <b>122</b> does not normally seal the hole. Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, an operator may apply tension to the suture <b>108</b> to compress the collagen sponge <b>118</b> and the anchor <b>114</b> across the arteriotomy <b>122</b>. The suture <b>108</b> weaves distally though the collagen sponge <b>118</b> and the anchor <b>114</b>, then returns proximally back through the collagen sponge <b>118</b> where it is tied into the self-tightening knot <b>120</b> that cinches the collagen sponge <b>118</b> toward the anchor <b>114</b> as tension is applied to the suture.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The collagen sponge <b>118</b> or other sealing plug may comprise a number of shapes to provide better coverage and therefore more reliable sealing of the arteriotomy <b>122</b> than previously available. Various embodiments of sealing plugs are shown and described in more detail below with reference to <figref>FIGS. 2A-6B</figref>. The configurations of the sealing plugs shown in the figures and described below may comprise the collagen sponge <b>118</b> of the internal tissue puncture closure assembly <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> or other devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The sealing plugs according to some embodiments of the present invention comprise shapes having a higher surface-area-to-volume-ratio than an open rectangle for a given set of rectangular dimensions. For example, an open rectangle fitting into dimensions measuring 4 units long, 2 units wide, and 1 unit thick has a surface area of 24 units<sup>2</sup>, a volume of 8 units<sup>3</sup>, and therefore a surface-area-to-volume-ratio of 24:8 or 3.0:1. However, referring to <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, a sealing plug <b>218</b> in relation to the anchor <b>114</b> is shown according to one embodiment that has a greater surface-area-to-volume-ratio than 3.0:1 for the same rectangular dimensions. The surface area of the sealing plug <b>218</b>, if sized to fit within the same 4Ã2Ã1 unit dimensions and folded as shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> has an approximate surface area of 38 units<sup>2</sup>, a volume of 8 units<sup>3</sup>, and therefore a surface-area-to-volume-ratio of 42:8 or 4.75:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The sealing plug <b>218</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> in an open or unfolded position as it appears after being deployed from the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>). According to <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the sealing plug <b>218</b> is arranged in a generally V-shape with a first portion or leg <b>236</b> and a second portion or leg <b>238</b> defining the V-shape. The first leg <b>236</b> includes a first filament weave pattern <b>240</b> comprising a plurality of holes. A first portion <b>242</b> of the filament <b>108</b> extends from a first side <b>244</b> of the anchor <b>114</b> and loops through the first filament weave pattern <b>240</b>. Similarly, the second leg <b>238</b> includes a second filament weave pattern <b>246</b> comprising a plurality of holes. The first and second weave patterns <b>240</b>, <b>246</b> shown each comprise a five-hole zigzagging pattern, but this is not necessarily so. There may be other weave patterns with any number of holes, and while the first and second weave patterns <b>240</b>, <b>246</b> are shown identically, they are not necessarily always the same. A second portion <b>247</b> of the filament <b>108</b> extends from a second side <b>248</b> of the anchor <b>114</b> and loops through the second weave pattern <b>246</b>. The first and second portions <b>242</b>, <b>247</b> of the filament <b>108</b> are then tied into the self-tightening knot <b>120</b> shown. Therefore, the anchor <b>114</b> is arranged substantially in the middle of sealing plug <b>218</b>, as opposed to being attached at an end, which is typical of the prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The first and second legs <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> of sealing plug <b>218</b> meet at a latitudinal vertex or centerline <b>250</b>. To facilitate insertion of the sealing plug <b>218</b> into the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>), the sealing plug <b>218</b> is folded at the centerline <b>250</b> into a generally rectangular configuration shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> with the two legs <b>236</b>, <b>238</b> substantially aligned, with one surface <b>251</b> sloped along the centerline <b>250</b> after the fold.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Referring next to <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>, another embodiment of a sealing plug <b>318</b> is shown according to the present invention. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, the sealing plug <b>318</b> may initially comprise a generally rectangular shape. However, the generally rectangular shape is substantially wider than a conventional sealing plug. The sealing plug <b>318</b> according to <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> is two-to-three times wider than a conventional sealing plug or more. While the wider sealing plug <b>318</b> provides more surface area and coverage to the arteriotomy <b>122</b>, it does not fit into the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>) in the configuration shown. Therefore, the sealing plug <b>318</b> is tri-folded as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>. The sealing plug <b>318</b> is longitudinally folded at least twice along two longitudinal axes <b>352</b>, <b>354</b> to form a generally S-shape or trifold, shown from an end view in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>. By folding the sealing plug <b>318</b> at least twice as shown, the sealing plug <b>318</b> fits into the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>) and also provides better sealing coverage when deployed.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Similar to the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, the sealing plug <b>318</b> of <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref> includes a weave pattern <b>340</b>. The filament <b>108</b> extends though the weave pattern <b>340</b>, loops through the anchor <b>114</b>, returns back to the through the weave pattern, and then ties into the self-tightening knot <b>120</b> proximal of the sealing plug <b>318</b>. However, unlike the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, the anchor <b>114</b> is attached at an end <b>341</b> of the sealing plug <b>318</b> according to <figref>FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. The weave pattern <b>340</b> is a spiral configuration and tends to cause the sealing plug <b>318</b> to âcorkscrewâ into a different shape toward the anchor to seal the arteriotomy <b>122</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>) when the filament <b>108</b> is put into tension.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Referring next to <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, a sealing plug <b>418</b> according to another embodiment of the present invention shown. The sealing plug <b>418</b> of <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, however the sealing plug <b>418</b> is arranged in a rectangular manner when it is both folded and unfolded. The sealing plug <b>418</b> includes a first half <b>436</b> with a first weave pattern <b>440</b>, and a second half <b>438</b> with a second weave pattern <b>446</b>. As with the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>, the first portion <b>242</b> of the filament <b>108</b> extends from the first side <b>244</b> of the anchor <b>114</b> and loops through the first filament weave pattern <b>440</b>. The second portion <b>247</b> of the filament <b>108</b> loops through the second filament weave pattern <b>446</b>. Therefore, again the anchor <b>114</b> is arranged substantially in the middle of sealing plug <b>418</b>, as opposed to an attachment at an end.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The first and second halves <b>436</b>, <b>438</b> of the sealing plug <b>418</b> meet at a latitudinal centerline <b>450</b>. To facilitate insertion of the sealing plug <b>418</b> into the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>), the sealing plug <b>418</b> is folded at the centerline <b>450</b> into the configuration shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> with the two halves <b>436</b>, <b>438</b> facing one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring next to <figref>FIGS. 5A-5B</figref>, another folded configuration of a sealing plug <b>518</b> is shown. The sealing plug <b>518</b> of <figref>FIGS. 5A-5B</figref> comprises two separate components, a first component <b>560</b> and a second component <b>562</b>. According to <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, the two components <b>560</b>, <b>562</b> are generally rectangular and similar or identical to one another. Each of the two components <b>560</b>, <b>562</b> is longitudinally folded into a general U-shape and engaged or interconnected with the other as illustrated more clearly in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>. The folding and engagement facilitates insertion of the sealing plug <b>518</b> into the carrier tube <b>106</b> (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The anchor <b>114</b> is attached via the suture <b>108</b> at a longitudinal end <b>541</b>, as opposed to a middle, of the sealing plug <b>518</b>. The suture <b>108</b> passes distally through a portion of a weave pattern <b>540</b> in the sealing plug <b>518</b>, loops through the anchor <b>114</b>, and returns proximally to pass through another portion of the weave pattern <b>540</b>. As with the other embodiments, the filament <b>108</b> is tied into a self-tightening slip knot <b>120</b> proximal of the sealing plug.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">While the embodiment shown and described above disclose various ways to fold a sealing plug to provide more surface area and better coverage than conventional collagen sponges used in tissue puncture closure devices, other embodiments that do not include folds may also provide similar advantages. For example, another sealing plug <b>618</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> according to principles of the present invention. The sealing plug <b>618</b> of <figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> comprises two walls or cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> having a weave pattern <b>640</b> through with the filament <b>108</b> extends. The two cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> are arranged in a generally X-shaped configuration in cross-section. According to some embodiments, the two cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> are substantially perpendicular to one another, although this in not necessarily so. Angles other than right angles may also be used between the two cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> or others.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The weave pattern <b>640</b> through the two cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> comprises a plurality of holes alternating between the first and second cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b>. The holes are staggered longitudinally such that the first portion <b>242</b> of the filament <b>108</b> may alternately extend through a first set of holes in the first and second cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> in a spiral pattern, and the second portion <b>247</b> may alternately extend through a second set of holes in the first and second cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> in a complementary spiral pattern. According to <figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>, the weave pattern is comprised of a first set of equally longitudinally spaced hole pairs <b>674</b> in the first cross member <b>670</b>, and a second set of equally longitudinally spaced hole pairs <b>676</b> in the second cross member <b>672</b> staggered from the first set <b>674</b>. The weave pattern <b>640</b> thus provides the âcorkscrewâ effect as the filament <b>108</b> is put in tension, and results in compression between the anchor <b>114</b> and the sealing plug <b>618</b>. The cross member configuration for a sealing plug provides more surface area to more effectively seal internal tissue punctures. And while only two cross members <b>670</b>, <b>672</b> are shown in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>, more cross members may also be added according to principles described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various other changes in the form and details may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
