      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-047790, filed on Mar. 11, 2014, in the Japan Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a vertical heat treatment apparatus which forms films on all of a plurality of substrates, a method of operating the vertical heat treatment apparatus, and a non-transitory computer-readable recording medium storage medium for storing a program for performing the operating method.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In general, a film forming treatment such as ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) or CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) is performed on a semiconductor wafer (hereinafter, referred to as a wafer) composed of a silicon substrate, etc. in order to fabricate a semiconductor product. The film forming treatment may be performed in a batch type vertical heat treatment apparatus for treating a plurality of wafers at a time. In this case, the wafers are moved and mounted onto a vertical wafer boat so that they are supported in the shape of shelves in multi-stages on the wafer boat. The wafer boat is carried (loaded) into an evacuable reaction chamber (reaction tube) from below, and a variety of gases are then supplied into the reaction chamber in a state that the interior of the reaction chamber is airtightly sealed, thereby performing the film forming treatment on the wafers. A method of performing the CVD with wafers mounted on the wafer boat is known as prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dummy wafers are held and supported in upper and lower sides of the wafer boat, and a plurality of wafers (for convenience of explanation, which may be described as product wafers), which are target substrates for manufacturing the semiconductor products, is held and supported such that the product wafers are inserted between dummy wafers located in the upper and lower sides of the wafer boat. In such a state, the wafer boat is carried into the reaction chamber as described above. As such, the reason why the dummy wafers are held and supported along with the product wafers in the wafer boat is to form films with high uniformity on the product wafers by smoothing the gas flow in a treatment chamber and by increasing uniformity of temperature among the product wafers, and is to prevent particles from being entrained on the product wafers when particles are produced from the wafer boat made of quartz. Unlike the product wafers, various films for forming the semiconductor products are not formed on surfaces of the dummy wafers, and thus convex and concave portions for forming wiring are not formed. Hereinafter, the dummy wafer may be described as a bare wafer.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As a semiconductor product is being miniaturized, the convex and concave portions are formed with high density on a surface of a product wafer and thus a surface area of the product wafer is gradually increasing. For this reason, in the film forming treatment, the amount of gas consumed by the product wafer is gradually increasing as compared with the amount (reacted amount) of processing gas consumed by a bare wafer. Therefore, for product wafers respectively supported in upper and lower sections of a wafer boat, a relatively large amount of processing gas is supplied by disposing bare wafers, which consumes a small amount of processing gas, in the vicinity of such product wafers, so that. However, a larger amount of processing gas is consumed by product wafers that are supported above and below than the product wafers, which are supported in a middle section of the wafer boat. In this case, the product wafers supported in a middle section of the wafer boat consume a relatively small supply amount of processing gas per wafer. As a result, there is a concern that the thickness of films formed by the processing gas among the product wafers may vary.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In order to control the distribution of the processing gas for the product wafers, it was suggested that a film forming treatment is performed by CVD with dummy wafers mounted in a wafer boat. In this case, the dummy wafers are made of silicon and have a surface area approximately equal to that of a product wafer. Further, it was suggested that the dummy wafers are reused by immersing the dummy wafers in a hydrofluoric acid solution after the film formation process, thereby removing the formed film. However, such a configuration requiring such wet etching is disadvantageous in that the dummy wafers should be transferred from the vertical heat treatment apparatus to another apparatus, thereby causing a need for a great deal of labor.</p>

More specifically, the control unit <b>100</b> includes a memory unit configured to store sequence programs for performing a series of treatment steps, which will be described later, carried out in the reaction tube <b>11</b>, a means for reading out instructions of the respective programs and outputting control signals to the respective components, and the like. Moreover, the programs are stored in the control unit <b>100</b> in a state that they are stored in a storage medium such as a hard disk, a flexible disk, a compact disk, a magneto-optical (MO) disk, a memory card or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Next, the wafer boat <b>3</b> will be further explained. The wafer boat <b>3</b> is made of quartz, and includes a ceiling plate <b>31</b> and a bottom plate <b>32</b> which are placed parallel to each other during a film forming treatment. The ceiling plate <b>31</b> and the bottom plate <b>32</b> are respectively connected to one end and the other end of each of three pillars <b>33</b> extending in the vertical direction. Supports <b>34</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) are provided in multi-stages for each of the pillars <b>33</b> in order to horizontally hold and support wafers on the supports <b>34</b>. Thus, wafers are held and supported in the shape of shelves in multi-stages in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. A region where a wafer is supported on each of the supports <b>34</b> is referred to as a slot, and 120 slots are provided in this example. In addition, the respective slots are designated by numbers <b>1</b> to <b>120</b>, and a smaller number is assigned to a slot positioned closer to an upper end.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In the first embodiment, wafers <b>10</b> and wafers <b>71</b> are mounted in the slots. The wafer <b>10</b> is a product wafer for manufacturing a semiconductor product described in the BACKGROUND, and is made of, for example, a silicon substrate. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, convex and concave portions for forming wiring are formed on a surface of the wafer <b>10</b>. In this figure, the reference numeral <b>35</b> designates a polysilicon film, and the reference numeral <b>36</b> designates a tungsten film. The reference numeral <b>37</b> is a concave portion formed in the films <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>. The reference numeral <b>38</b> is a SiN film (silicon nitride film) formed by the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The wafer <b>71</b> is a wafer made of quartz (hereinafter, referred to as a quartz wafer). The quartz wafer <b>71</b> is configured to have a contour corresponding to that of the wafer <b>10</b> when seen from the top, so as to be mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. In order to prevent the wafer from breaking during handling, the thickness of the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is, for example, slightly greater than that of the wafer <b>10</b> and is, for example, 2 mm. A longitudinal sectional side view of the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is shown in an enlarged scale within a dotted-line circle depicted at the end of a dotted-line arrow of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As shown herein, convex and concave portions are formed in front and back sides of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>. The convex and concave portions are formed by laser processing, mechanical machining, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A surface area per unit region, which is obtained by dividing the surface area of the wafer <b>10</b> by a surface area calculated based on an external dimension of the wafer <b>10</b>, is referred to as S0. The surface area obtained based on the external dimension is a virtual surface area obtained by assuming that the surfaces of the wafer <b>10</b> are flat surfaces without considering concave portions <b>37</b> of the surface of the wafer <b>10</b>. That is, a value obtained by dividing the actual surface area of the wafer <b>10</b> by the virtual surface area is the surface area per unit region S0. The surface area of the wafer, which is referred to herein, is the area of a top side (front side) of the wafer+the area of a bottom side (back side) of the wafer. In addition, a surface area per unit region, which is obtained by dividing the surface area of the quartz wafer <b>71</b> by a surface area calculated based on external dimension of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>, is referred to as S. In the same manner as the wafer <b>10</b>, the surface area obtained based on the external dimension of the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is a virtual surface area obtained by assuming that the front and back sides of the quartz wafer <b>71</b> are flat surfaces without considering concave portions formed in the front and back sides of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>. In order to adjust a gas distribution in the vertical direction in the wafer boat <b>3</b> as described later, S/S0 is set to be 0.8 or more. In this example, the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is configured such that S/S0=1.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are held and supported in a plurality of slots at upper and lower sections among the slots of the wafer boat <b>3</b>. The wafers <b>10</b> are held and supported in slots in which the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are not held and supported. Thus, a group of wafers is held and supported by the wafer boat <b>3</b> such that it is inserted between above and below quartz wafers <b>71</b>. In the same manner as the wafers <b>10</b>, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> may be configured to be detachably attached to or to be fixed to the wafer boat <b>3</b>. The wafers <b>10</b> are transferred to and mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b> by a transferring/mounting mechanism (not shown). If the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are configured to be detachably attached to the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the quartz wafers are transferred and mounted, for example, by the transferring/mounting mechanism, in the same manner as the wafers <b>10</b>. In this example, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are fixed to the wafer boat <b>3</b> for easy handling.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Next, the film forming treatment performed in the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. First, the wafer boat <b>3</b> mounted with the group of wafers <b>10</b> inserted between the above and below quartz wafers <b>71</b> as described above is lifted from below and is carried (loaded) into the reaction tube <b>11</b> which was previously set to a predetermined temperature. The lower opening <b>22</b> of the manifold <b>2</b> is closed by the lid <b>25</b>, thereby hermetically sealing the interior of the reaction tube <b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Then, the interior of the reaction tube <b>11</b> is vacuum-evacuated by the vacuum pump <b>68</b> to a predetermined degree of vacuum. Subsequently, the pressure in the reaction tube <b>11</b> becomes, for example, 665.5 Pa (5 Torr), and DCS gas and N<sub>2 </sub>gas are supplied into the reaction tube <b>11</b> from the first raw material gas supply nozzles <b>41</b>, for example, respectively at flow rates of 1,000 sccm and 2,000 sccm, for example, for three seconds in a state that the high frequency power source <b>64</b> is turned off. Thus, molecules of the DCS gas are adsorbed onto a surface of each of the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported in the shape of shelves in the rotating wafer boat <b>3</b> (Step S<b>1</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Thereafter, the supply of the DCS gas is stopped. The N<sub>2 </sub>gas is continuously supplied into the reaction tube <b>11</b> and the pressure in the reaction tube <b>11</b> becomes, for example, 120 Pa (0.9 Torr), thereby purging the interior of the reaction tube <b>11</b> with the N<sub>2 </sub>gas (Step S<b>2</b>). Then, while the pressure in the reaction tube <b>11</b> becomes, for example, 54 Pa (0.4 Torr), NH<sub>3 </sub>gas and N<sub>2 </sub>gas are supplied into the reaction tube <b>11</b> from the second raw material gas supply nozzle <b>51</b>, for example, respectively at flow rates of 5,000 sccm and 2,000 sccm, for example, for 20 seconds in a state that the high frequency power source <b>64</b> is turned on (Step S<b>3</b>). Thus, active species, such as N radicals, H radicals, NH radicals, NH<sub>2 </sub>radicals, and NH<sub>3 </sub>radicals, react with the molecules of the DCS gas, thereby generating a SiN film <b>38</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Thereafter, the supply of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas is stopped. The N<sub>2 </sub>gas is continuously supplied into the reaction tube <b>11</b> and the pressure in the reaction tube <b>11</b> becomes, for example, 106 Pa (0.8 Torr), thereby purging the interior of the reaction tube <b>11</b> with the N<sub>2 </sub>gas (Step S<b>4</b>). <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a timing chart illustrating a timing at which each gas is supplied and a timing at which the high frequency power source <b>64</b> is turned on. As shown in this chart, by repeating Steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b> plural times, e.g., 200 times, a thin SiN film <b>38</b> are laminated on a layer-by-layer basis and grown on the surface of the wafer <b>10</b>, thereby forming the SiN film <b>38</b> having a desired thickness on the surface of the wafer <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The status of the wafer <b>10</b> and quartz wafer <b>71</b> when the DCS gas is supplied during the film forming treatment will be described using a schematic view of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. In this figure, the reference numeral <b>70</b> designates molecules of the DCS gas. In a middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the wafers <b>10</b> having large surface areas by forming a surface with convex and concave portions are disposed in multi-stages, and the molecules <b>70</b> supplied to the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> are consumed for (adsorbed onto) the wafers <b>10</b>. As such, the molecules <b>70</b> are consumed such that they are distributed with high uniformity among the wafers <b>10</b>. Thus, the absorption amount of the molecules <b>70</b> per sheet of the wafer <b>10</b> is prevented from being excessive.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Similarly to the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported in the middle section, wafers having large surface areas, i.e., quartz wafers <b>71</b>, exist in the vicinity of the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported in upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>. Thus, the molecules <b>70</b> supplied to the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> are consumed such that they are distributed with high uniformity on the wafers <b>10</b> and the quartz wafers <b>71</b>. That is, the adsorption amount of molecules <b>70</b> onto the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is relatively large due to the large surface area of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>. Thus, it is possible to prevent excessive molecules <b>70</b> from being supplied to the wafer <b>10</b>, thereby suppressing an excessive absorption amount of molecules <b>70</b> per sheet of the wafer <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic view for the purpose of comparison with <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a state that the molecules <b>70</b> are adsorbed onto the wafers <b>10</b> when performing a treatment by disposing a bare wafer <b>72</b> described in the BACKGROUND, instead of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>, into each slot in which the quartz wafer <b>71</b> described above is disposed. As previously explained above, the bare wafer <b>72</b> is made of, for example, silicon. Since the bare wafer <b>72</b> does not have any convex and concave portions for forming a device on its surfaces, it has a small surface area. Even in a case where the bare wafers <b>72</b> are disposed, as described in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the molecules <b>70</b> are distributed onto each of the wafers <b>10</b> in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, thereby suppressing the absorption amount of molecules <b>70</b> per sheet of the wafer <b>10</b>. However, for the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported in the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the bare wafers <b>72</b> exist in the vicinity of the wafers <b>10</b> and they have a small amount of adsorption of molecules <b>70</b> due to small surface areas. Thus, surplus molecules <b>70</b> that are not consumed at the bare wafers <b>72</b> are adsorbed onto the wafers <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, because the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are held and supported by the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the molecules <b>70</b> are prevented from being excessively absorbed onto the wafers <b>10</b> at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat. As a result, the molecules <b>70</b> are adsorbed with high uniformity among the wafers. Although the example in which the molecules <b>70</b> of the DCS gas are adsorbed has been described, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> held and supported by the wafer boat <b>3</b> also allow radicals generated from NH<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>gases to be supplied with high uniformity among the wafers <b>10</b>, as the molecules <b>70</b>. In addition, the supplied radicals react with the molecules <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">After the process is terminated by repeating Steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b> 200 times as described above, the wafer boat <b>3</b> is unloaded from the reaction tube <b>11</b>. After the wafers <b>10</b> for which the film formation treatment is terminated are taken out from the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the wafer boat <b>3</b> is again loaded into the reaction tube <b>11</b> and the opening <b>22</b> is closed. The interior of the reaction tube <b>11</b> is vacuum-evacuated and is set to a predetermined pressure, while setting the interior temperature of the reaction tube <b>11</b> to, for example, 350 degrees C. Then, the aforementioned cleaning gas composed of F<sub>2 </sub>and HF is supplied into the reaction tube <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the SiN film <b>38</b> formed in the reaction tube <b>11</b> and on the wafer boat <b>3</b> and quartz wafers <b>71</b> are etched and removed from the reaction tube <b>11</b> through entrainment in an exhaust stream. Thereafter, the supply of the cleaning gas is stopped, and the wafer boat <b>3</b> is unloaded from the reaction tube <b>11</b>. Then, subsequent wafers <b>10</b> are mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>, and the film forming treatment is performed on the subsequent wafers <b>10</b> according to Steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows a graph illustrating relationships between film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> and positions of the slots. The abscissa axis of the graph corresponds to the film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b>, and the ordinate axis of the graph corresponds to the positions of the slots. Slot numbers are assigned to the wafer boat <b>3</b> such that the heights of the slots correspond to scales of the ordinate axis of the graph. A curve indicated by a dotted line represents data obtained based on an experiment, and shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> in the respective slots when the film forming treatment is performed by holding and supporting the bare wafers <b>72</b>, instead of the quartz wafer <b>71</b>, in the wafer boat <b>3</b> as described in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. For the reason described with reference to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> gradually increase from the slots in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> toward the slots at the upper and lower sections. Hence, differences in film thickness between the wafers <b>10</b> in the slots in the upper and lower sections and the wafers <b>10</b> in the slots in the middle section are relatively large. That is, a variation in film thickness among the slots is large. Further, in the wafer boat <b>3</b> in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a state of holding and supporting the quartz wafers <b>71</b> according to an embodiment, not the bare wafers <b>72</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">A curve indicated by a solid line in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a curve of the case that the film forming treatment is performed by disposing the quartz wafers <b>71</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>, and shows the effect of the first embodiment. For the reason described with reference to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, excessive supply of a gas to the wafers <b>10</b> at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> is suppressed by the quartz wafers <b>71</b>. Thus, as shown in the curve, an increase in the film thickness of each of the wafers <b>10</b> at the upper and lower sections is suppressed. As a result, it is possible to improve the uniformity of film thicknesses among the wafers <b>10</b> in the slots.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">As the surface areas of the quartz wafers <b>71</b> become larger, it is believed that the supply of a gas to the wafers <b>10</b> at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> can be suppressed. In <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, a curve indicated by a two-dot chain line is a curve of a film thickness distribution in a case that the surface areas of the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are greater than those of the wafers <b>10</b>. The surface areas of the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are determined to have an appropriate film thickness distribution depending on the surface areas of the wafers <b>10</b>. Even when only one quartz wafer <b>71</b> is provided at each of the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, a gas distribution for the wafers <b>10</b> can be adjusted as described above. However, it is preferable to provide a plurality of quartz wafers in view of controlling a temperature distribution among the wafers <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Further, since the quartz wafer <b>71</b> is made of quartz, corrosion, which is caused by the cleaning gas including the fluorine gas or a gas composed of a fluorine compound, is suppressed as compared to a wafer made of Si. For this reason, the quartz wafer <b>71</b> can be repeatedly used in the film forming treatment as described above. Further, since it is unnecessary to transfer the quartz wafer <b>71</b> to an apparatus for performing wet etching in order to perform cleaning, it is possible to save labor for operating such an apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Meanwhile, there is a case that the film forming treatment is performed with a relatively small number of wafers <b>10</b> held and supported in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. In this case, for example, the film forming treatment is performed by holding and supporting the wafers <b>10</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. Specifically, the wafers <b>10</b> are held and supported in slots in the middle section. In the example of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the wafers <b>10</b> are consecutively mounted in slots around Slot Nos. 35 to 60. Then, the quartz wafers <b>71</b>, e.g., a plurality of quartz wafers, are held and supported in slots respectively above and below Slot Nos. 35 to 60. In the example shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, about 5 quartz wafers <b>71</b> are held and supported in the slots respectively above and below the slots with the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The bare wafers <b>72</b> are held and supported in slots respectively at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> so that the group of quartz wafers <b>71</b> and the group of wafers <b>10</b> are inserted between the bare wafers. The bare wafers <b>72</b> are mounted to prevent disturbance of the flow of a gas in the reaction tube <b>11</b> or distortion of the temperature distribution in the wafers <b>10</b>. As such, any one of the wafers <b>10</b>, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> and the bare wafers <b>72</b> is held and supported in each of Slot Nos. 1 to 120.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Similarly to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, <figref>FIG. 8</figref> also is a graph showing a film thickness distribution. A curve indicated by a solid line shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> when performing a film forming treatment on the wafers <b>10</b> with the quartz wafers <b>71</b> mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b> as described above. A curve indicated by a dotted line shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> when performing a film forming treatment by holding and supporting the bare wafers <b>72</b>, instead of the quartz wafers <b>71</b>, in the above explained slots in which the quartz wafers <b>71</b> are held and supported. As illustrated in the graph of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> can be mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b> as described above even when the film forming treatment is performed on a small number of wafers <b>10</b>. For the reason illustrated with reference to <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, it is possible to prevent an increase in the film thickness of each of the wafers <b>10</b>, which are at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, in the group of wafers <b>10</b> mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. As a result, it is possible to improve uniformity of film thicknesses among the wafers <b>10</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As explained in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, if there are members having relatively large surface areas above and below a group of wafers <b>10</b> mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>, it is possible to adjust the film thickness distribution among the wafers <b>10</b> by reducing the supply amounts of the gas above and below the group of wafers <b>10</b>. Thus, the member for adjusting gas distribution is not limited to the quartz wafer <b>71</b>. <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show a longitudinal sectional side view and a cross sectional plan view of a vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to a second embodiment, respectively. A vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the second embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment as to the configuration of the reaction tube <b>11</b> but the other components are constructed in the same manner. In <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, some of the members described in the first embodiment are omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the second embodiment, convex and concave portions are formed in an upper region <b>81</b> including a ceiling surface and an upper circumferential surface of the reaction tube <b>11</b> and in a lower region <b>82</b> that is a lower circumferential surface of the reaction tube <b>11</b>, in order to increase the surface areas. The upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> are inner circumferential surfaces of the reaction tube <b>11</b>. When the wafer boat <b>3</b> is accommodated in the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the lower region <b>82</b> includes a region lower than the group of wafers <b>10</b> mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. The convex and concave portions of the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> are formed, for example, by means of a sandblasting treatment or a chemical solution treatment. If the sandblasting treatment is performed, arithmetic average roughness (Ra) is, for example, 0.4 to 4.0 Î¼m. If the chemical solution treatment is performed, the arithmetic average roughness (Ra) is, for example, 0.3 to 4.0 Î¼m. Convex and concave portions may be formed also in the quartz wafer <b>71</b> according to the first embodiment by means of the sandblasting or chemical solution treatment. Further, in the same manner as the quartz wafer <b>71</b>, convex and concave portions may be formed in the reaction tube <b>11</b> by laser processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">By forming roughness (convex and concave portions) as described above, the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> serve to adjust supply distribution of a gas in the same manner as quartz wafer <b>71</b> according to the first embodiment. To this end, if a surface area per unit region for each of the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> is S, the convex and concave portions are formed such that the relationship S/S0 with the surface area S0 per unit region of the wafer <b>10</b> becomes 0.8 or more as in the first embodiment. The surface area of each of the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> is a surface area of a surface facing the treatment space into which a gas is supplied. To further explain the surface area S per unit region of the upper region <b>81</b> in detail as an example, it is assumed that the upper region <b>81</b> has no convex and concave portions and is cut to obtain a segment having an area A equal to the area of a region surrounded by the contour of the wafer <b>10</b>. If the surface area of a surface of the cut segment facing the treatment space in the reaction tube <b>11</b> is B, S is B/A. The surface area B is a surface area measured under the assumption that there are convex and concave portions. The surface area S of the lower region <b>82</b> is calculated in the same manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In the inner circumferential surface of the reaction tube <b>11</b>, a region interposed between the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> is referred to as a middle region <b>83</b>. The middle region <b>83</b> is positioned around an outer periphery of the group of wafers <b>10</b> when the wafer boat <b>3</b> is loaded into the reaction tube <b>11</b>. The middle region <b>83</b> is configured to have a smooth surface without performing the sandblasting or chemical solution treatment. That is, the roughness of the middle region <b>83</b> is smaller than that of the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The film forming treatment and cleaning treatment are performed also in the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> according to the second embodiment in the same manner as the first embodiment. By forming the rough inner circumferential surface of the reaction tube <b>11</b> as described above, a gas supplied into upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> during the film forming treatment is consumed in the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>. Accordingly, as in the first embodiment, it is possible to prevent the gas from being excessively supplied to the wafers <b>10</b> held and supported at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>. As such, the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> of the reaction tube <b>11</b> perform the same function as the quartz wafers <b>71</b> of the first embodiment as described above. Hence, unlike the first embodiment, the bare wafers <b>72</b>, instead of the quartz wafers <b>71</b>, are detachably held and supported by the wafer boat <b>3</b> in this embodiment. That is, the group of wafers <b>10</b> is held and supported such that it is inserted between above and below bare wafers <b>72</b>. Unlike a case using the quartz wafers <b>71</b>, the bare wafers <b>72</b> are removed from the wafer boat <b>3</b> during the cleaning treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Similarly to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> in the respective slots. In this figure, a curve indicated by a dotted line shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> when the film forming treatment is performed without forming the roughness to the reaction tube <b>11</b>. A curve indicated by a solid line shows a film thickness distribution among the wafers <b>10</b> when the film forming treatment is performed by forming the roughness in the upper region <b>81</b> and lower region <b>82</b> as described above. As illustrated in the graph, by forming the roughness in the reaction tube <b>11</b>, a gas is prevented from being excessively supplied to the wafers <b>10</b>, which are at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, in the group of wafers <b>10</b> held and supported by the wafer boat <b>3</b>, thereby improving uniformity of the film thicknesses among the wafers <b>10</b>, as in the first embodiment.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In the third embodiment, a vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> similar to that of the first embodiment is used, but the roughness described in the second embodiment is not formed, for example, in the inner surface of the reaction tube <b>11</b>. Instead, the surface of each of the ceiling plate <b>31</b> and the bottom plate <b>32</b> of the wafer boat <b>3</b> is roughened as in the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> of the reaction tube <b>11</b> described in the second embodiment, resulting in the surface area S per unit region thereof/the surface area per unit region S0 of the wafer <b>10</b>â§0.8. <figref>FIG. 12</figref> shows a wafer boat <b>3</b> in which the roughness is formed as described above. For example, in the same manner as the second embodiment, a film forming treatment is performed with the wafers <b>10</b> and the bare wafers <b>72</b> mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b>. During the film forming treatment, the ceiling plate <b>31</b> and the bottom plate <b>32</b> perform the same function as the quartz wafers <b>71</b> described in the first embodiment and the upper and lower regions <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> of the reaction tube <b>11</b> described in the second embodiment, thereby adjusting the film thickness distribution among the wafers <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">To explain the surface area S per unit region of the ceiling plate <b>31</b> of the wafer boat <b>3</b> in detail, it is assumed that the ceiling plate <b>31</b> has no convex and concave portions and is cut to obtain a segment having an area A equal to that of a region surrounded by the contour of the wafer <b>10</b>. If the surface area of a surface of the cut segment which faces the treatment space in the reaction tube <b>11</b> is B, S is B/A. Since both upper and lower surfaces of the ceiling plate <b>31</b> face the treatment space, the surface area B is the sum of surface areas of the upper and lower surfaces. The surface area S per unit region of the bottom plate <b>32</b> of the wafer boat <b>3</b> is calculated in the same manner. The lower surface of the bottom plate <b>32</b> is covered by a stage <b>39</b> (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) for supporting the wafer boat and does not face the treatment space.

When the surface area S per unit region of the bare wafer <b>76</b> is obtained in the same manner as the first embodiment, the relationship with the surface area S0 per unit region of the wafer <b>10</b> becomes S/S0&lt;1.0.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, slots in which the wafers <b>10</b> and <b>76</b> are mounted are different from those of the second and third embodiments. The bare wafers <b>76</b> are mounted in a plurality of slots at an upper section and in a plurality of slots at a lower section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> as in the second and third embodiments. In addition, the bare wafers <b>76</b> are mounted in slots of which numbers are consecutive in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b>. In the example of <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, the bare wafers <b>76</b> are consecutively mounted in slots around Slot Nos. 50 to 60. The wafers <b>10</b> are mounted in slots in which the bare wafers <b>76</b> are not mounted.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Also in the fourth embodiment, the filming forming treatment and the cleaning treatment are performed in the same manner as the other embodiments. Since the plurality of bare wafers <b>76</b> are mounted in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, the consumption amount of the gas is reduced in the vicinity of the middle section during the film forming treatment. Therefore, the supply amount of a gas is increased for the wafers <b>10</b> mounted in slots close to the slots with the bare wafers <b>76</b> mounted.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, a curve indicated by a dotted line shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> when the film forming treatment is performed with the bare wafers <b>76</b> mounted only at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b>. A curve indicated by a solid line shows a film thickness distribution of the wafers <b>10</b> when the film forming treatment is performed with the bare wafers <b>76</b> mounted also in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> as described above. As shown in the respective graphs, when the bare wafers <b>76</b> are mounted in the middle section, the consumption amount of a gas in the middle section is suppressed as described above. Hence, from the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> toward the middle section, the film thickness decreases once and then increases. Such a film thickness distribution suppresses a variation in film thickness as compared to the case without the bare wafers <b>76</b> mounted in the middle section.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Since the bare wafers <b>76</b> are made of quartz as described above, they are loaded along with the wafer boat <b>3</b> into the reaction tube <b>11</b> during the cleaning treatment, as in the first embodiment. In the same manner as the quartz wafers <b>71</b> of the first embodiment, the bare wafers <b>76</b> may be fixed or detachably attached to the wafer boat <b>3</b>. Although the plurality of bare wafers <b>76</b>, which are plate-shaped members between the target substrates, are mounted in the middle section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> in order to sufficiently improve the supply distribution of a gas, only one bare wafer <b>76</b> may be mounted.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The fourth embodiment may be combined with the other embodiments. Specifically, the bare wafers <b>76</b> are used as the wafers mounted respectively in the plurality of slots at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>. However, when combined with the first embodiment, the film forming treatment is performed with, for example, the quartz wafers <b>71</b> mounted instead of the bare wafers <b>76</b>. Moreover, the film forming treatment may be performed while the wafer boat <b>3</b> mounted with the respective wafers <b>10</b> and <b>76</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is loaded into the reaction tube <b>11</b> with a roughened inner surface as described in the second embodiment. Further, the film forming treatment may be performed while the respective wafers <b>10</b> and <b>76</b> are mounted as shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref> in the wafer boat <b>3</b> with the ceiling plate <b>31</b> and bottom plate <b>32</b> roughened as described in the third embodiment. That is, the film forming treatment may be performed in a state that one bare wafer or a plurality of bare wafers <b>76</b> are disposed between the wafers <b>10</b> as described above and members made of quartz and having relatively large surface areas are disposed above and below the wafers <b>10</b> in order to adjust a gas distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Although the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> is configured to perform ALD, the present disclosure may be applied to a batch type treatment apparatus for forming a film by supplying a gas. Thus, the present disclosure may be applied to a vertical heat treatment apparatus for performing CVD. Further, the respective embodiments described above may be implemented in combination with one another. For example, in the first embodiment, the film forming treatment may be performed using the reaction tube <b>11</b> formed with the roughness as described in the second embodiment. In the first to third embodiments, the bare wafers <b>76</b> may be disposed between a group of wafers <b>10</b> and a group of wafers <b>10</b> by applying the fourth embodiment. Further, in the second and third embodiments, the film forming treatment may be performed by mounting the bare wafers <b>76</b> instead of the bare wafers <b>72</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Meanwhile, it may be considered that wafers <b>10</b> per every lot carried into the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b> have different surface areas. That is, it may be considered that the wafers are subjected to different treatments for every lot and they are mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b> in a state that line width of patterns or thickness of a film formed with convex and concave portions is different. In this case, for example, plural kinds of quartz wafers <b>71</b> in the first embodiment, which are detachably attached to the wafer boat <b>3</b> and have different surface areas, are prepared. Among the plural kinds of quartz wafers <b>71</b>, quartz wafers <b>71</b> to be mounted in the wafer boat <b>3</b> may be selected according to the lot of wafers <b>10</b> on which the film forming treatment is performed in the vertical heat treatment apparatus <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the amount of a gas supplied to the wafers <b>10</b> at the upper and lower sections of the wafer boat <b>3</b> can be controlled for every lot of wafers <b>10</b>, thereby further improving uniformity of film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> among respective slots.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">(Evaluation Test)</heading>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Evaluation tests performed according to the present disclosure will be described. In Evaluation Test 1, as described in the BACKGROUND, bare wafers <b>72</b> were mounted in a plurality of slots at an upper section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> and a plurality of slots at a lower section of the wafer boat <b>3</b>, wafers <b>10</b> were mounted in other slots, and a film forming treatment was performed in the vertical heat treatment apparatus. After the film forming treatment, the film thickness of the wafer <b>10</b> in each slot was measured. Further, in Evaluation Test 2, test wafers were mounted instead of the bare wafers <b>72</b> and a film forming treatment was performed. The test wafer has the same surface area as the wafer <b>10</b> and is made of the same material as the wafer <b>10</b>. The surface area of both the wafer <b>10</b> and the test wafer is three times greater than that of the bare wafer <b>72</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Although an apparatus configured to be approximately similar to the apparatus of the aforementioned embodiment was used as the vertical heat treatment apparatus used in this evaluation test, an injector for supplying DCS gas is configured as shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. That is, the injector was configured such that a raw material gas supply nozzle <b>41</b><i>b </i>for supplying a gas to the upper section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> and a first raw material gas supply nozzle <b>41</b><i>c </i>for supplying a gas to the lower section of the wafer boat <b>3</b> were installed and DCS gas was supplied from each of the nozzles <b>41</b><i>b </i>and <b>41</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The graph of <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is a graph showing results of Evaluation Tests <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The slot numbers are represented on the abscissa axis, and the measured film thicknesses (unit: A) of the wafers <b>10</b> are represented on the ordinate axis. Further, in each of the evaluation tests, a variation range of film thicknesses among the slots mounted with the wafers <b>10</b> is indicated by an arrow. As clearly seen from <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, in Evaluation Test 1, the film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> in the slots close to slots at the upper and lower sections, i.e., in the slots close to slots mounted with the bare wafers <b>72</b>, are larger than those in Evaluation Test 2. For this reason, in Evaluation Test 1, a variation in film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> among the slots is larger than that in Evaluation Test 2. On the contrary, in Evaluation Test 2, film thicknesses of the wafers <b>10</b> in the slots at the upper and lower sections are prevented from increasing, thereby suppressing the variation in film thickness among the slots. From the results of these tests, as described in each of the embodiments, it can be found that it is effective to install members having large surface areas above and below a region in which the group of wafers <b>10</b> is disposed.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">According to the present disclosure, gas distribution adjusting members made of quartz are provided to be positioned respectively above and below a region in which a plurality of target substrates, which are held and supported by a substrate holding and supporting unit, are disposed. Thus, gas supply amounts into above and below the substrate holding and supporting unit can be adjusted respectively, thereby improving uniformity of film thicknesses among the substrates. Further, since the gas distribution adjusting members are made of quartz, the gas distribution adjusting members are difficult to be etched by a cleaning gas, which is a fluorine-based gas including fluorine or a fluorine compound supplied into the reaction tube, as compared with the gas distribution adjusting members made of silicon. Thus, the gas distribution adjusting members can be cleaned together with the interior of the reaction tube by the gas, thereby saving labor for operating an apparatus.</p>
