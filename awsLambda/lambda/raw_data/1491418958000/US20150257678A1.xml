      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of custom knee braces and the manner in which such knee braces are produced in particular.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Custom knee braces, i.e., knee braces that have been made to fit a leg of a specific person, have been made have been made from a hand-modified positive model (filled cast) of a patient's leg. That is, to order a custom knee brace, the doctor would make a negative casting of the patient's leg and send it to the knee brace manufacturer with an order for the type of brace desired. The knee brace manufacturer would use the negative casting to make a positive model of the patient's leg to which the custom brace would be fit. There are significant costs associated with taking and shipping a cast mold, and with health insurance reimbursements declining and expenses increasing a need has arising for a less costly way of obtaining a custom knee brace.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In recent years, various devices for 3D printing of three dimensional solid objects from a digital model using additive processes have been developed. 3D printers create an object by laying down successive layers of material. The machine reads in data from a CAD drawing and lays down successive layers of liquid, powder, or sheet material, and in this way builds up the model from a series of cross sections. These layers, which correspond to the virtual cross section from the CAD model, are joined together or fused automatically to create the final shape. Examples of 3D printers can be found, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,175,734; 8,119,053; and 7,291,002 among very many others. This technology is used in the fields of jewelry, footwear, industrial design, architecture, engineering and construction (AEC), automotive, aerospace, dental and medical industries, education, geographic information systems, civil engineering, and many others. U.S. Pat. No. 7,756,325 discloses an algorithm for estimating the 3D shape of a 3-dimensional object, such as a human face, based on information retrieved from a single photograph by recovering parameters of a 3-dimensional model as well as methods and systems using same. Beside the pixel intensity, the invention uses various image features in a multi-features fitting algorithm (MFF) that has a wider radius of convergence and a higher level of precision and provides thereby better results. However, to date, a method of using 3D printer technology to create custom knee braces has not existed, at least in part, due to the lack of a means of obtaining a usable image.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method of producing digital images that are usable for producing a knee brace without the need to have the prescribing doctor prepare a positive model (filled cast) of a patient's leg and send it to the brace manufacturer for preparing of a model of the patient's leg, and to provide tools for use in such a process. While the method could be used with a commercially available 3D printer having the capability of producing an object of the size and shape of a knee brace, the method is not limited to such a method of knee brace production, which the current cost of such machines makes presently too expensive for use in the production of custom knee braces. Thus, currently the invention will find applicability with knee braces formed using malleable aluminum bands to create leg form on which graphite pre-preg is applied and cured.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref> are views an image alignment guide (IAG) <b>1</b> in accordance with the present invention. The IAG <b>1</b> comprises an arm <b>3</b> that carries a focal angle tube <b>5</b>, a removably mounted tape measure <b>7</b>, a level <b>9</b>, ruler arms <b>11</b>, focusing element <b>12</b>, and support arms <b>15</b>, which are shown in greater detail in the enlarged view of an end portion of the IAG shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The purpose and use of the various parts of the IAG are explained below in connection with the method aspect of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a front view of a tibial contour gauge <b>16</b> in accordance with the present invention shown positioned a schematically depicted leg of a patient. The tibial contour gauge <b>16</b> is formed of two indicator parts <b>16</b><i>a, </i><b>16</b><i>b </i>that are pivotably mounted on a gauge part <b>16</b><i>c, </i>being pivoted out for use, and folded parallel with arm <b>3</b> for shipping. Here again, the purpose and use of the various parts of the tibial contour gauge are explained below in connection with the method aspect of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The steps for performance of the method of the present invention will now be explained with reference to <figref>FIGS. 7-19</figref>. Initially, a patient is seated on the edge of a chair with his/her leg held straight out at full extension with the heel of the foot on the floor and the toes pointing up and slightly dorsiflexed (no toe out). In this regard, it is noted that flexion of over 10Â° can prevent use of the IAG. In this position, the IAG is either held against the lateral side of the leg by the patient with the aid of the support arms <b>15</b>, or can be attached to the leg of the patient using a pair of straps, for example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 &amp; 10</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 &amp; 8</figref>, the IAG is positioned at the midline of the leg with the focal angle tube <b>5</b> face up and approximately Â¼â³ inward from the side of the knee at the anterior/posterior midline of the thigh, knee and calf with bubble of the bubble level <b>9</b> centered as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, but some slight displacement of the bubble from the fully centered position is acceptable.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">At this point in the method, a low angle side view image is taken at the midline of the leg that shows the full length of the IAG. In preparation of a second frontal image, the tape measure <b>7</b> is extended to a predetermined distance, e.g., four feet. With the camera or smart phone at the end of the tape measure (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>), standing directly in front of the patient's foot, looking down at the IAG, the camera position is adjusted so that only the rim of the focal angle tube <b>5</b> is visible and not any of its interior; for this purpose, it is helpful if the interior of the tube has a distinctively different coloration from that of the rim. The focusing element(s) <b>12</b> (one as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, but preferably two as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>) are used to insure that a clear picture is obtained and that the camera or smart phone is aimed straight on the focus angle tube <b>5</b>. An image of the image alignment guide attached to the leg of a patient is then taken such as that shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, and preferably two or three are taken so that the brace manufacturer can choose the best image. In this regard, the image should be examined to insure that there is no toe out, the bubble appears centered and only the rim of the focus angle tube <b>5</b> appears.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">After satisfied with the frontal image(s), the tape measure <b>7</b> can be removed (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>) and used to measure the distance from the center of the patella to a position on the shin bone that corresponds with the length of the tibia shell of the brace to be ordered, as shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>; of course, a separate tape measure could be used instead of disconnecting the tape measure <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">At this point, the tibial contour gauge <b>16</b> is applied at a position 6-8â³ below the patella, centered on the crest of the tibia. The alignment arms <b>16</b><i>a, </i><b>16</b><i>b </i>are then adjusted until the gauge <b>16</b> is in full contact with the medial and lateral contour of the shin with no gapping (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>). The gauge is then moved down toward the ankle (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>) and removed without changing the position of the alignment arms <b>16</b><i>a, </i><b>16</b><i>b </i>so that the numbers on the scales <b>16</b><i>d </i>can be read off (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>) and recorded.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 18 &amp; 19</figref>, after removal of the tibial contour gauge <b>16</b>, four circumferential measurements of the leg, about 3â³ and 7â³ above and below the knee center are taken and recorded along with the associated distance at which each was obtained. Of course, these measurements could be taken at a different point in the process, such as between the measurement step of <figref>FIG. 15</figref> and use of the tibial contour gauge <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The images, readings and measurements obtained can easily transmitted electronically to the brace manufacturer, or can be recorded on a conventional electronic medium, such as a CD, DVD or the like and mailed to the brace manufacturer. With the aid of this information as well as the dimensions visible on the ruler arms <b>11</b> in the frontal image, the brace manufacture will have all of the data required for inputting into the software of a 3D printer for producing of a knee brace that is custom fit for the particular patient's leg with a high degree of accuracy.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">However, as noted above, until the costs of suitable 3D printers becomes such as to make their use commercially feasible for producing custom knee braces, the present invention will find current utility in the production of custom knee braces using malleable aluminum bands to create leg form on which graphite pre-preg is applied and cured. <figref>FIGS. 20-24</figref> show steps in one such method.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 20-24</figref>, first, using known landmarks on the IAG, a scale factor is determined (<figref>FIG. 20</figref>) and the image printed in actual (1:1 scale) size, and the full size image is then put on a layout board (<figref>FIG. 21</figref>). Using the circumferential measurements, the correct malleable aluminum bands to create a leg form are determined (<figref>FIG. 22</figref>). Malleable aluminum bands are then formed to the 1:1 image and inserted into the hinge blocks (<figref>FIG. 23</figref>). The pre-bent joints are then removed from the joint blocks and are inserted into uncured pre-preg graphite and which is surrounded with a flexible silicone mold (<figref>FIG. 24</figref>). The uncured pre-preg wrapped in the flexible silicone mold is applied over the formed aluminum shells, a vacuum bag is put over the entire assembly and it is put into an oven to cure the pre-preg (<figref>FIG. 25</figref>). Once in the oven, the vacuum bag holds the silicone mold tightly to the formed aluminum bands. The silicone mold expands and creates the compression that is needed to insure structurally sound cuff pieces. The mold also creates the space where the pads will fit.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">After the curing process, the silicone molds are removed and the cured pre-preg bands, with the joints bonded in, are removed from the joint block. The cured graphite bands are smoothed and painted. The joints are assembled, straps and pads added and the custom brace is ready to deliver to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The above method of production should be viewed solely as an example of one custom knee brace manufacturing process, and various others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill, especially given that different knee brace designs may require other, additional or different steps to be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As will be apparent, the method in accordance with the present invention allows for the possibility of brace manufacture being commenced the same day as the patient's visit to the prescribing doctor if electronic transmission is used to send images, readings and measurements to the brace manufacturer, as well as reducing the costs that would otherwise be associated with producing and shipping a negative cast and using the cast to make a model of the patient's leg.</p>
