Suitably, the computer is configured to enter the menu mode when the pressure sensor detects two or more short bursts of sucking on the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">A pressure sensor may in normal mode be used to identify when a user is inhaling on the device so as to activate the vaporiser to vaporise a liquid for inhalation. Using the same pressure sensor as an input device therefore reduces the number of components needed for a device and provides the user with a means to enter a menu mode and control menu option selection.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Suitably, the device further comprises a vaporiser having a heating element. Suitably, the vaporiser is prevented from activating when the device is in menu mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">It is advantageous to disable the vaporiser in menu mode since this provides greater safety for the user. Also, when the pressure sensor is used as an input device for the menu mode, this prevents unintended activation of the vaporiser.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> there is shown an electronic inhalation device in the form of a cigarette-shaped electronic cigarette. The electronic cigarette has a mouthpiece <b>2</b> and a cigarette body <b>4</b>. The mouthpiece <b>2</b> has an air outlet <b>6</b> at a first end and is connected to the cigarette body <b>4</b> at a second end.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Inside the electronic cigarette there is a liquid store <b>8</b> towards the mouthpiece end and a vaporiser <b>10</b> having a heating coil <b>12</b>. The vaporiser <b>10</b> is arranged next to the liquid store <b>8</b> to allow liquid to be transferred onto the vaporiser <b>10</b> for vaporising. A circuit board <b>14</b> contains a pressure sensor <b>16</b>, an audio signalling means <b>18</b> such as a buzzer or a speaker, and a computer <b>20</b>. A power cell <b>22</b> provides power to the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The general operation of the electronic cigarette is similar to that of known devices. When a user takes a draw on the electronic cigarette, a suction force is applied to the mouthpiece <b>2</b> and the air outlet <b>6</b>. A reduced pressure inside the electronic cigarette causes the power cell <b>22</b> to provide power to the vaporiser <b>10</b> which in turn vaporises the nicotine liquid solution. The resultant vapour is then inhaled by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In this example the operation of the electronic cigarette goes beyond that of a general device. In a normal operating mode, when a user applies a suction force to the electronic cigarette, the resultant airflow causes a drop in pressure from ambient pressure to a lower pressure, within the device. The pressure sensor <b>16</b> provides a signal to the computer <b>20</b>. The computer <b>20</b> runs software that monitors the pressure signal from the pressure sensor <b>16</b> and when it determines that the pressure has been reduced below a threshold pressure, the computer <b>20</b> provides an electrical current to the heating coil <b>12</b> in order to heat the heating coil <b>12</b> and vaporise liquid from the liquid store <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The software running on the computer <b>20</b> controls the operation of the device. The computer <b>20</b> allows a user to enter a menu mode. When a user has finished using the device and wishes to enter a menu mode they can activate the menu mode by carrying out an action on the device that is different to how they use it in a normal mode. In a normal mode, a user typically inhales on the device for 2 to 3 seconds, replicating the action of smoking a real cigarette. In this situation the computer <b>20</b> receives a signal from the pressure sensor <b>16</b> and activates the vaporiser <b>10</b>, heating up the heating coil <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">To enter a menu mode, a user can blow briefly into the device. The pressure sensor <b>16</b> sends a signal to the computer <b>20</b>, and the computer recognises that this is not normal operation but a signal to enter a menu mode. Alternatively a user can blow briefly into the device, suck suddenly on the device in a quick burst or indeed blow or suck two or more times in rapid succession. In each of these circumstances, the pressure sensor <b>16</b> will send a signal to the computer <b>20</b> and the computer <b>20</b> will determine that this is not normal operation but a signal for the device to enter a menu mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">When the device enters the menu mode the user is notified by a sound being played by the audio signalling means <b>18</b>. In addition, the normal operation of vaporisation is suspended. In this way, whilst the user is in menu mode, the user can suck or Now on the device without activating the vaporiser <b>10</b> and heating coil <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">After entering a menu mode, the user is able to control the menu and navigate through the menu options using the pressure sensor for control. For example, slight blowing on the device could move forward through the menu options, and slight sucking could move backwards through the menu options. By having a sensitive control of the menu options, the user would not interfere with the liquid transfer process of the liquid out of the liquid store <b>8</b> and onto the vaporiser <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As a user progresses through the menu options, the user is notified by sound signals and is able to differentiate between the menu options by the different sound signals. For example a first menu option could sound a single beep, a second menu options could sound a double beep and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">When a user wishes to select a menu option then again they can do this by sucking or blowing into the device. For instance, if slight pressure change is used to control the navigation through the menu as described, a more forceful pressure change from a more forceful sucking or blowing can select an menu option.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In this way, the user is able to have complete control of the menu options including navigating through the different menu options and selecting a given menu option.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The menu options are selectable to change the technical configuration of the electronic inhalation device. One of the menu options is selectable to configure the vaporisation properties. A user can select this option and set the vaporisation lower or higher. The computer <b>20</b> would then act to modify the current sent to the heating coil <b>12</b> to change the vaporisation properties during normal use.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Another menu option is to provide a boost such that at the start of the vaporisation during normal use, a higher current is delivered providing a peak in the temperature and an initial boost to vaporisation.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Another menu option acts to calibrate the device. If the device is required to have a fixed amount of liquid vaporisation per unit time, then the control of vaporisation could be used to achieve this.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Another menu option acts to change the device country settings. Different countries may have different tastes and requirements for vaporisation and vapour delivery so enabling the user to select their host country would provide a simple means for them to achieve this. This enables a single product to be sold across multiple territories.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Another menu option acts to change the threshold pressure at which the device is activated during normal operation. This enables the threshold pressure to be increased or decreased. Changing of the threshold pressure could also be a result of the country selection by the user because a given location may be at a particular altitude and this affects the ambient pressure, which may have an impact on the threshold pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Another menu option acts to modify the heating element activation time. In normal mode, a user inhaling on the device activates the heating coil to vaporise liquid. In an example use, the vaporiser may be activated for a predetermined time once activated and this time may be modified using the menu system.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Another menu option acts to modify other time parameters such as the time an electronic inhalation device is deactivated following a coil overheat scenario or the time until a device is deactivated following lack of use of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Another menu option acts to reset the device such that the variables and parameters modified by the user are reset back to factory conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The computer <b>20</b> comprises a memory means and use data corresponding to the user's use of the device can be stored in the memory means. Another menu option acts to initiate transmission of this data. Once activated the data may be transmitted using modulated sound and received by a device configured to interpret this modulated sound signal. A related menu option acts to wipe the data from the memory, thereby clearing the memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Another menu option acts to leave the menu mode, returning the device to a normal mode. A user is notified by a sound signal that the menu mode has been exited and a normal mode has been entered into.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In addition, whilst in menu mode, if the computer <b>20</b> determines that the device is inactive for a given threshold inactive time, the device leaves menu mode and may enter either a normal mode or a sleep mode. The sleep mode being a lower power mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref> show a device similar to that shown in relation to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The difference is that the mouthpiece <b>2</b> is releasably-attachable to the cigarette body <b>4</b>. The mouthpiece comprises a female screw thread connection means, the cigarette body <b>4</b> is a control unit <b>24</b> having a male screw thread connection means. The mouthpiece <b>2</b> and the control unit <b>24</b> can be screwed together or taken apart.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In this example, the mouthpiece <b>2</b> comprises the liquid store <b>8</b> and the vaporiser <b>10</b> with heating coil <b>12</b>. The control unit <b>24</b> comprises the power cell <b>22</b> and circuit board <b>14</b> with pressure sensor <b>16</b>, audio signaling means <b>18</b> and computer <b>20</b>. The screw thread connection provides an electrical connection such that when the mouthpiece <b>2</b> and control unit <b>24</b> are screwed together, electrical current can be delivered to the heating coil <b>12</b> upon activation of the vaporiser <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In this example, the device can only enter a menu mode when the parts are assembled since the user can only operate the device when it is assembled. Whilst in menu mode, if the user disconnects the mouthpiece, the device leaves menu mode and the user is notified by a sound signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> and <figref>FIG. 6</figref> show a device similar to that shown in relation to <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. However in this example, the vaporiser <b>10</b> is removable from the mouthpiece <b>2</b>. The mouthpiece <b>2</b> has a cylindrical opening that forms a interference push-fit with the vaporiser <b>10</b>. As such the mouthpiece <b>2</b> can be separated from the vaporiser <b>10</b>. The mouthpiece <b>2</b> comprises the liquid store <b>8</b>. The vaporiser <b>10</b> comprises the heating coil <b>12</b> and a wick <b>26</b>. The wick <b>26</b> protrudes from the end of the vaporiser <b>10</b> such that when the mouthpiece <b>2</b> and the vaporiser <b>10</b> are connected, the wick <b>26</b> dips into the liquid store <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In use, as a user inhales on the device, liquid is transferred from the liquid store <b>8</b> and onto the wick <b>26</b> before being transferred onto the heating coil <b>12</b> for vaporisation.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">
        <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate another embodiment of an electronic inhalation device in the form of an electronic cigarette. The device is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, and the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, although the embodiment in <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> shows the internal components thereof in greater detail. The device comprises a mouthpiece <b>31</b>, vaporiser device <b>32</b> and control unit <b>33</b> which can be assembled as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref> to provide a generally cylindrical device that can be used as a substitute for a conventional tobacco burning cigarette. The control unit <b>33</b> is provided with a threaded extension <b>34</b> that is received in an interior thread <b>35</b> in the vapour device <b>32</b>. The mouthpiece <b>31</b> comprises a generally cylindrical plastics casing <b>36</b> that can be push-fitted on to the vapour device <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The mouthpiece <b>31</b> has an outlet <b>37</b> to supply vapour to the mouth of the user and an outlet passageway <b>38</b> for the vapour which, in use is produced by the vapour device <b>32</b>. The mouthpiece <b>31</b> also includes a liquid reservoir comprising a porous storage matrix <b>39</b> such as plastics open foam material impregnated with a vaporisable liquid, such as a nicotine containing liquid that in use is vaporised by the vapour device <b>32</b>. The matrix <b>39</b> acts as a reservoir for the liquid and since the mouthpiece <b>31</b> is readily removable and replaceable, it can be used as a refill capsule when the liquid in the porous matrix <b>39</b> becomes depleted and needs to be replenished.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The vapour device <b>32</b> includes an electronic heating coil <b>40</b> that is wound around a ceramic core <b>41</b>, supported on a ceramic base <b>42</b>. A generally U-shaped wicking member <b>43</b> is configured to wick liquid from the reservoir <b>39</b> towards the heating element <b>40</b> by capillary action. The wicking member <b>43</b> may for example by made of a metallic foam such as nickel foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The heater coil <b>40</b> is powered by a rechargeable battery <b>44</b> located in the control unit <b>33</b> through electrical contacts <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> (not shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, see <figref>FIG. 9</figref>) which electrically couple the heater coil to the battery <b>44</b> when the control unit <b>33</b> is fitted to the vapour device <b>32</b> by the engagement of threads <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>. The electrical power of the battery <b>44</b> is supplied to the heater coil <b>40</b> under the control of a control circuit <b>45</b> mounted on circuit board <b>46</b> within the control unit <b>33</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The supply of current from the battery <b>44</b> to the mouth controller is controlled by switching transistor <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">When the user draws on the mouthpiece <b>1</b> so as to draw vapour through the outlet <b>37</b>, the pressure sensor <b>50</b> detects the drop in pressure which is communicated from within the vapour device <b>32</b> through the interior of the control unit <b>33</b> to the circuit board <b>45</b>. Microcontroller <b>47</b> responds to the pressure drop detected by the sensor <b>50</b> to supply electrical current to the heater coil <b>40</b>, which vaporises liquid supplied by capillary action through the U-shaped wicking member <b>43</b>. An air inlet passageway <b>55</b> is provided in the joint between the vapour unit <b>32</b> and control unit <b>33</b> so that air can be drawn through the threaded extension <b>34</b> of the control unit <b>33</b> into the vapour device <b>32</b> in the direction of arrows A, so that the resulting vapour is drawn in the direction of arrows B through passageway <b>38</b> to the outlet <b>37</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The operation of the device of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may be the same as that of the devices of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> described previously and so a detailed description of such operation will not be repeated here. However, it is intended that the control circuit <b>46</b> of the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may be configured as per the circuit board <b>14</b> of the embodiments of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, and vice versa. Specifically, the circuit board <b>46</b> may comprise a separate audio signalling means <b>18</b>. Alternatively, the signalling unit <b>51</b> may act as the audio signalling means described in the previous embodiments. Also, the pressure sensor <b>50</b> may be disposed on the circuit board <b>46</b> within the control unit <b>33</b> and the vapour device <b>32</b> may be in fluid communication with the area within the control unit <b>33</b>, via an open passageway for example (not shown), such that a drop in pressure within the vapour device <b>32</b> is detectable by a pressure sensor on the circuit board <b>46</b> within control unit <b>33</b>. Also, the microcontroller <b>47</b> of the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> may be programmed as per the computer <b>20</b> of the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> to monitor the measured pressure from the pressure sensor <b>16</b> to control the device accordingly and as described previously, particularly to run software to control the various menu modes as described previously.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Although examples have been shown and described it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications might be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The computer processor could be a microprocessor or a microcontroller. The device is not restricted to being cigarette shaped. The computer processor, audio signaling means and pressure sensor are not restricted to being on the same circuit board.
