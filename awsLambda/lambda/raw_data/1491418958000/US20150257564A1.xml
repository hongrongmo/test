Numeral <b>22</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as the left half trapezoid of short butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>19</b>. Right half trapezoid wedge <b>21</b> and left half trapezoid wedge <b>22</b> are two identical trapezoid wedges which join together side by side at their shorter parallel sides to make a shape of M at one side and a shape of W at the other side at each end. Numeral <b>23</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as the right half trapezoid wedge of long butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>20</b>. Numeral <b>24</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as the left half trapezoid wedge of long butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>20</b>. Right half trapezoid wedge <b>23</b> and left half trapezoid wedge <b>24</b> are two identical trapezoid wedges which join together side by side at their shorter parallel sides to make a shape of M at one side and a shape of W at the other side at each end.

Side trapezoid wedge <b>26</b> is of the same shape and size as those of trapezoid slot <b>25</b> and is located outside at the brim of cylindrical can connector <b>13</b> and cubic can connector <b>14</b>. Trapezoid slot <b>25</b> can admit snuggly and tightly side trapezoid wedge <b>26</b>. Numeral <b>27</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> is the middle partition. Numeral <b>28</b> Of <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> is central cylindrical hollow. Middle partition <b>27</b> is located at the middle of central cylindrical hollow <b>28</b> and divides it into two equal parts. Central cylindrical hollow <b>28</b> has the same diameter as that of a beverage can or food can, and central cylindrical hollow <b>28</b> can admit the beverage can or food can snuggly and tightly. Short butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>19</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> can connect together side by side any two of the combination of cylindrical and cubic can connectors. Long butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>20</b> can connect together, side by side and up and down, any four of the combination of cylindrical and cubic can connectors. Anyone can use butterfly-shaped conjoint trapezoid wedge <b>11</b> to connect together cylindrical and cubic can connectors, then insert the beverage aluminum can or food can whose diameter is the same as that of central cylindrical hollow <b>28</b> of cylindrical and cubic can connector to build toys or other things for fun and for use. Anyone can also use the built-in trapezoid slot <b>25</b> and built-in side trapezoid wedge <b>26</b> of cylindrical and cubic can connector to connect them together and then insert beverage aluminum cans or food cans, whose diameter is the same as that of central cylindrical hollow <b>28</b> to make things, such as toys, little dog house, little table, little stool, etc. for use or fun according to his/her creativity and imagination. The conjoint wedge can have different shapes, such as trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>11</b>, semicircular wedge <b>29</b> and H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b>. All these wedges have a narrower section that join together at the middle portion of the conjoint wedge or attach to the outside of the can connector. The built-in slots <b>25</b> are shaped to admit snugly the wedge. Numeral <b>29</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge.

Short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>29</b> is of the same shape as that of long butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>30</b>. Long butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>30</b> is twice as long as short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>29</b>. Numeral <b>31</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as right half of short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge. Numeral <b>32</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as left half of short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge. Right half of short butterfly-shaped semi-circular conjoint wedge <b>31</b> and left half of short butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>32</b> are two identical semi-circular wedges which join together side by side at their vertical sides. Numeral <b>33</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as right half of long semicircular conjoint wedge <b>30</b>. Numeral <b>34</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as left half of long butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>30</b>. Right half of long semicircular conjoint wedge <b>33</b> and left half of long semicircular conjoint wedge <b>34</b> are two identical semicircular wedges which join together side by side at their vertical sides. When short butterfly semicircular conjoint wedge <b>29</b> and long butterfly-shaped semicircular conjoint wedge <b>30</b> are used to replace short butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>19</b> and long butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>20</b>, the built-in trapezoid slot <b>25</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> and built-in trapezoid wedge <b>26</b> of <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> have to be changed to be semicircular slot and semicircular wedge and share the same shape and size of either the right half <b>31</b> or the left half <b>32</b> of short semicircular conjoint wedge <b>29</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Numeral <b>35</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is short H-shaped conjoint wedge. Numeral <b>36</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is long H-shaped conjoint wedge. Short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is divided into two equal T-shaped wedges, <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>. Numeral <b>37</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as right half of short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b>. Numeral <b>38</b> is designated left half of short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b>. Right half <b>37</b> and left half <b>38</b> of short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b> are identical. Long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> is divided into two equal T-shaped wedges, <b>39</b> and <b>40</b>. Numeral <b>39</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as right half of long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b>. Numeral <b>40</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is designated as left half of long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b>. Right half <b>39</b> of long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> and left half <b>40</b> of long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> are identical. Short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b> and long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> are identical in shape and size, but long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> is twice as long as short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b>. When short H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>35</b> and long H-shaped conjoint wedge <b>36</b> are used to replace butterfly-shaped trapezoid conjoint wedge <b>11</b>, the built-in trapezoid slot <b>25</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> and built-in side trapezoid wedge <b>26</b> of <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> have to be changed to share the same shape and size of either the right half <b>37</b> or the left half <b>38</b> of short H-shaped wedge <b>35</b>.</p>
