      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a wavelength conversion member, a production method thereof, and a light-emitting device fabricated by combining a wavelength conversion member and a semiconductor light-emitting element. More specifically, the present invention relates to a wavelength conversion member composed of polycrystalline ceramics having an orange emission color, a production method thereof, and a light-emitting device fabricated by combining the wavelength conversion member having an orange emission color with a semiconductor light-emitting element having a violet-to-blue emission color.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In recent years, a white LED fabricated by combining a blue light-emitting diode, such as GaN, with a wavelength conversion member has come into widespread use. The wavelength conversion member is generally a phosphor particle, and a member obtained by dispersing phosphor particles in a resin is used. However, the wavelength conversion member obtained by dispersing phosphor particles in a resin has drawbacks, such as insufficient durability, due to heat resistance, etc., of the resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">On the other hand, as in Patent Document 1, a wavelength conversion member obtained by dispersing a phosphor powder in glass has also been developed as the wavelength conversion member. Furthermore, as described in Patent Document 2, an attempt to use polycrystalline ceramics as the wavelength conversion member is also being made.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The wavelength conversion member obtained by dispersing a phosphor powder in glass or the polycrystalline ceramics phosphor material is an aluminum.garnet-based phosphor using Ce as an activator (YAG:Ce phosphor), and these techniques are related to developing a pseudo-white light-emitting device in which a blue emission color of a blue light-emitting diode and a yellow emission color of a YAG:Ce phosphor are combined.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In addition, with regard to a light-emitting device other than pseudo-white LED, as described in Patent Document 3, it is being attempted as well to use a semiconductor light-emitting element as the light source for a vehicular marker lamp, and a wavelength conversion member having an orange-to-red emission color is also required as the wavelength conversion member.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As disclosed in Patent Documents 4 and 5, using a phosphor material composed of polycrystalline ceramics as the wavelength conversion member having an orange-to-red emission color is also being attempted. However, whether the wavelength conversion members described in Patent Documents 4 and 5 have a luminescence intensity of a practical level and can achieve a wavelength control to obtain target chromaticity is unknown, and moreover, it is difficult to say that the production conditions are sufficiently studied.</p>

      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0105">Next, the production method of the wavelength conversion member of the present invention is specifically described. A substance serving as a silicon source, a substance serving as a europium source, a substance serving as a calcium source, and a substance serving as an aluminum source are mixed, and an oxynitride phosphor powder obtained by firing the mixture at a temperature of 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere is molded and fired at a temperature of 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere, whereby the wavelength conversion member of the present invention can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0106">Conventionally, in the case of producing Î±-SiAlON, raw material powders, i.e., a substance serving as a silicon source, a substance serving as a europium source, a substance serving as a calcium source, and a substance serving as an aluminum source, are mixed so as to obtain a composition represented by composition formula (2), and the mixture is fired at a temperature of 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere to obtain Î±-SiAlON. As the raw material powder, an oxide or a substance capable of producing an oxide by a heat treatment is also used, in addition to a nitride, but the content of the oxide in the raw material powders is adjusted to essentially conform to the theoretical oxygen amount in the composition of Î±-SiAlON to be produced. Although a oxide thin film is sometimes present on the surface of the raw material powders, the content of oxygen as the impurity is only 1.0 mass % or less with respect to 100 mass % of the Î±-SiAlON, and therefore the effects taught in the present invention are not exerted. Even when oxygen is contained in the atmosphere of firing the raw material powder mixture, the composition (oxygen content) of the Î±-SiAlON produced from the raw material powders is substantially unchanged.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0107">On the other hand, in the present invention, the composition of the raw material powder mixture obtained by mixing a substance serving as a silicon source, a substance serving as a europium source, a substance serving as a calcium source, and a substance serving as an aluminum source is selected such that an obtained oxynitride phosphor powder, through or not through an oxidation step after firing, has a composition, exclusive of oxygen, represented by composition formula (1):</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0109">In the present invention, when the raw materials are mixed to satisfy composition formula (1), the mixing ratio of the raw material powders, i.e., the substance serving as a silicon source, the substance serving as a europium source, the substance serving as a calcium source, and the substance serving as an aluminum source, is determined, based on the amounts of silicon, europium, calcium and aluminum, respectively, and the masses of compounds theoretically calculated as a nitride, an oxide or other compounds of those elements. Impurities (for example, oxygen present in nitride) are not taken into account in the calculation. For example, in the case of using silicon nitride as a raw material, the mixing ratio of silicon nitride is determined by assuming it as a material not containing oxygen. With regard to the raw material used for the production of an oxynitride phosphor powder, a material in which the content of metal impurity is of negligible level (for example, 100 ppm or less) is used. For example, calculation may be performed by assuming the silicon nitride raw material as pure silicon nitride, but if needed, performed by taking into account the silicon nitride content of the raw material.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0110">In the present invention, the thus-calculated oxygen content as a theoretical content in the oxynitride phosphor powder represented by composition formula (1) produced from the raw materials and the oxygen content as a measured value are compared, and the difference therebetween is defined as the excess oxygen content.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0111">The substance serving as a silicon source of the raw material is selected from nitride, oxynitride and oxide of silicon and a precursor substance capable of becoming an oxide of silicon by pyrolysis. A silicon nitride, more specifically, a crystalline silicon nitride or an amorphous silicon nitride, is preferably used, as the substance serving as a silicon source. A crystalline silicon nitride or an amorphous silicon nitride is preferably used since a sintered body of the polycrystalline ceramics is likely to have a larger density and an increased conversion efficiency. In particular, in the case of using a crystalline silicon nitride, a crystalline silicon nitride having a specific surface area of 9 to 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g is more preferred. In the case of using an amorphous silicon nitride, the specific surface area thereof is more preferably from 600 to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g. When the specific surface area of a crystalline silicon nitride is from 9 to 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g or the specific surface area of an amorphous silicon nitride is from 600 to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g, the density of a sintered body becomes larger and the conversion efficiency more increases.</p>

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0113">The substance serving as a europium source of the raw material is selected from nitride, oxynitride and oxide of europium and a precursor substance capable of becoming an oxide of europium by pyrolysis. In the case of preparing the raw material to satisfy z=0 in composition formula (1), europium nitride is preferably used. In the case of preparing the raw material to satisfy z&gt;0, it is preferable to use europium oxide alone or use europium oxide and europium nitride in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0114">The substance serving as a calcium source of the raw material is selected from nitride, oxynitride and oxide of calcium and a precursor substance capable of becoming an oxide of calcium by pyrolysis. In the case of preparing the raw material to satisfy z=0 in composition formula (1), calcium nitride is preferably used. In the case of preparing the raw material to satisfy z&gt;0, it is preferable to use calcium carbonate alone or use calcium carbonate and calcium nitride in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0115">The substance serving as an aluminum source of the raw material includes aluminum oxide, metal aluminum and aluminum nitride, and the powders thereof may be used individually or in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0116">In the firing of oxynitride phosphor, an Li-containing compound serving as a sintering aid is preferably added for the purpose of accelerating the sintering and producing an Î±-SiAlON crystal phase at a lower temperature. The Li-containing compound used includes lithium oxide, lithium carbonate, metal lithium, and lithium nitride, and the powders thereof may be used individually or in combination. The amount of the Li-containing compound added is, in terms of Li element, preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 mol, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 mol, per mol of the fired oxynitride.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0117">The method for mixing the substance serving as a silicon source, the substance serving as a europium source, the substance serving as a calcium source, the substance serving as an aluminum source, and an optional sintering aid, is not particularly limited. A method known per se, for example, a method of dry mixing the substances, and a method of wet mixing the substances in an inert solvent substantially incapable of reacting with each raw material component and then removing the solvent, may be employed. As the mixing apparatus, a V-shaped mixer, a rocking mixer, a ball mill, a vibration mill, a medium stirring mill, etc. are suitably used.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0118">A mixture of the substance serving as a silicon source, the substance serving as a europium source, the substance serving as a calcium source, the substance serving as an aluminum source, and an optional sintering aid, is fired at a temperature of 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere, whereby a fired oxynitride can be obtained. The inert gas atmosphere means an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen, and the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere is preferably 100 ppm or less, more preferably 10 ppm or less. The inert atmosphere where the inert gas is nitrogen may be a reducing atmosphere containing a hydrogen gas. The firing temperature less than 1,500Â° C. is not practical since the production of Î±-SiAlON requires heating for a long time. The firing temperature exceeding 2,000Â° C. is undesirable since silicon nitride and Î±-SiAlON are sublimated and decomposed to produce free silicon. A temperature range from 1,600 to 2,000Â° C. is preferred. The heating furnace used for firing is not particularly limited as long as firing at 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere can be performed. For example, a batch electric furnace of high frequency induction heating system or resistance heating system, a rotary kiln, a fluidized firing furnace, and a pusher-type electric furnace can be used. As for the crucible filled with the mixture, a BN-made crucible, a silicon nitride-made crucible, a graphite-made crucible, and a silicon carbide-made crucible can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0119">An oxynitride phosphor powder having a sharp particle size distribution can be obtained by subjecting the fired oxynitride to disintegration and classification. The disintegration as used herein means an operation of disintegrating an aggregate (secondary particle) of primary particles constituting the fired oxynitride into primary particles and is differentiated from pulverization. The method for disintegrating is not particularly limited, but a disintegrating method, such as roll crusher, ball mill, bead mill and stamp mill, can be used. The method for classification is not particularly limited, but a classification device, such as sieve classifier, cyclone classifier and dry air flow classifier, can be used. By performing classification after disintegration, an oxynitride phosphor powder having a particle diameter (D<sub>50</sub>) of 50 Î¼m or less, preferably 20 Î¼m or less, can be obtained. When the particle diameter is 50 Î¼m or less, a sintered body is likely to have a larger density, and the conversion efficiency more increases. Furthermore, the particle diameter 20 Î¼m or less is preferable since not only a sintered body is likely to have a larger density and the conversion efficiency more increases but also at the time of sintering of the polycrystalline ceramics, a lower sintering temperature or a shorter firing time can be employed. In the production method of the present invention, it is only necessary to disintegrate the fired oxynitride, but pulverizing the fired oxynitride to obtain particles having a desired particle diameter is not precluded.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0120">D<sub>50 </sub>of the oxynitride phosphor powder is a 50% diameter (weight-based median value) in the particle size distribution curve measured by a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution measuring apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0121">In the present invention, the oxygen amount larger than the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1) of the oxynitride phosphor powder is from 1.1 to 11.5 mass %. In the present invention, the oxygen amount in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount is calculated assuming the theoretical mass of the oxynitride phosphor represented by formula (1) to be 100 mass %. When the oxygen amount larger than the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1) of the oxynitride phosphor powder is less than 1.1 mass %, the relative density of a sintered body becomes small. When the relative density of a sintered body becomes small, light excited by light at 300 to 500 nm and wavelength-converted, that is, light at 590 to 610 nm, is scattered due to voids present in the polycrystalline ceramics, leading to very poor light extraction. Therefore, the conversion efficiency significantly decreases. When the oxygen amount above exceeds 11.5 mass %, the oxygen content becomes large, and the contents of oxygen and nitrogen greatly deviate from composition formula (1) to significantly disrupt the charge compensation in the phosphor crystal, as a result, the conversion efficiency decreases. The oxygen amount in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount is preferably from 1.1 to 7.8 mass %, more preferably from 1.1 to 3.5 mass %. The oxygen amount in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount may also be 1.2 mass % or more, 1.4 mass % or more, or 1.5 mass % or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0122">In the production method of the present invention, a substance serving as a silicon source, a substance serving as an aluminum source, a substance serving as a calcium source, a substance serving as a europium source, and an optional sintering aid, are mixed, and the mixture is fired or is fired and then subjected to oxidation treatment, whereby the oxygen content in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1) can be from 1.1 to 11.5 mass % in the oxynitride phosphor powder. The oxygen in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount is supplied from oxygen in the raw material or oxygen in the atmosphere. For example, even when a commercially available silicon nitride powder is assumed as an oxygen-free raw material and weighed and mixed to satisfy z=0, the obtained oxynitride phosphor powder contains oxygen in an amount of approximately from 0.5 to 1.0 mass % since the commercially available silicon nitride powder actually contains a certain amount of oxygen. This is attributable to trace impurity oxygen contained in the raw material or to an amorphous phase containing oxygen present on the surface of the oxynitride phosphor powder. The oxygen amount of the present invention is an oxygen concentration including the impurity oxygen derived from the raw material and the oxygen contained in the amorphous phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0123">The specific method for adjusting the oxygen amount in excess of the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1) to the range from 1.1 to 11.5 mass % in the oxynitride phosphor powder includes a method of adjusting the concentration of impurity oxygen contained in the raw material. For example, an oxygen amount in the range above can be achieved by adjusting the oxygen concentration of a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride serving as a main raw material. The crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride usually contains 1.0 mass % or less of impurity oxygen. The impurity oxygen includes oxygen present in a silicon nitride particle, and oxygen present on the particle surface. The method for reducing the impurity oxygen concentration can be performed by subjecting the silicon nitride powder to a cleaning treatment with use of an acid, such as nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid. The method for increasing the impurity oxygen concentration can be performed by heat-treating the silicon nitride powder in the air or in an oxygen-containing atmosphere. The concentration of oxygen contained in a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride as a raw material powder is preferably 5.0 mass % or less. The oxygen concentration of 5.0 mass % or more is not preferred since the compositional deviation from composition formula (1) is too large.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0124">As the specific surface area of a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride serving as a raw material is larger, the concentration of impurity oxygen contained is likely to be increased. Furthermore, when the specific surface area of a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride serving as a raw material is large, oxygen more than the concentration of oxygen contained in the crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride as a raw material is contained in the oxynitride phosphor powder. This is because due to the large specific surface area of the crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride as a raw material, oxygen adsorbed to the surface thereof is readily mixed into the oxynitride phosphor powder in the production process of the powder. Accordingly, in the case of adjusting the oxygen concentration of the oxynitride phosphor powder, the specific surface area of a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride serving as a raw material must be appropriately controlled. In the present invention, a crystalline silicon nitride having a specific surface area of 9 to 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g is preferably used, and an amorphous silicon nitride having a specific surface area of 600 to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g is more preferably used.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0125">As another method for adjusting the oxygen amount of the oxynitride phosphor powder, an oxidation step of heat-treating the oxynitride phosphor powder in the air or in an oxygen-containing atmosphere may be provided. The oxygen concentration in the oxygen-containing atmosphere is preferably from 0.1 to 21.0 vol %. In that case, the thickness of an amorphous phase present on the surface of the oxynitride phosphor powder is increased, and the oxygen amount of the oxynitride phosphor powder increases. With regard to the conditions of heat treatment, a temperature range from 800 to 1,200Â° C. is preferred although not limited to this range. A temperature of less than 800Â° C. is undesirable since there is no or very slight increase in the oxygen concentration. On the other hand, a temperature of 1,200Â° C. or more is not preferred, since oxidation of the oxynitride phosphor powder rapidly proceeds and the oxygen concentration becomes difficult to control. A temperature range from 800 to 950Â° C. is more preferred. In the case of performing a heat treatment, the time for which the powder is held at the maximum temperature is preferably from 0.5 to 10 hours so as to obtain, among others, high conversion efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0126">The method for adjusting the oxygen content of the oxynitride phosphor powder according to the present invention includes, as described above, a method of adjusting the oxygen amount of the raw material powder, and a method of providing a heat-treatment step to oxidize the oxynitride phosphor powder, and these methods may be employed in combination. Accordingly, in the case where a sufficient oxygen amount is ensured in the raw material, it is not necessary to provide a heat treatment step. In the case where the oxygen amount in the raw material is small, an oxynitride phosphor powder containing the required excess oxygen can be obtained by adjusting the conditions of the heat-treatment step.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0127">The oxygen amount larger than the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1) of the oxynitride phosphor powder is preferably from 1.1 to 4.0 mass %. As described above, when the oxygen amount larger than the theoretical oxygen amount is less than 1.1 mass %, the density of a sintered body becomes small. When the oxygen content exceeds 4 mass %, the contents of oxygen and nitrogen greatly deviate from composition formula (1) to disrupt the charge compensation in the phosphor crystal, as a result, the effect of improving the conversion efficiency is reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0128">The thickness of an oxygen-containing amorphous phase present on the phosphor powder surface of the oxynitride phosphor powder is preferably from more than 1 nm to less than 10 nm. When the thickness of the oxygen-containing amorphous phase is 1 nm or less, the density of a sintered body of the polycrystalline ceramics may become small to decrease the conversion efficiency. When the thickness of the oxygen-containing amorphous phase (there is a composition (O, N) gradient in the thickness direction wherein the outermost surface is substantially an oxide phase, and the oxygen concentration is reduced toward the inner side) is 10 nm or more, the conversion efficiency may decrease.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0129">The thickness of the above-described amorphous phase present on the surface of the oxynitride phosphor powder can be adjusted, as described above, by a method of heat-treating the oxynitride phosphor powder in the air or in an oxygen-containing atmosphere or a method of adjusting the oxygen content of the raw material serving as a silicon source. Specifically, the thickness of the oxygen-containing amorphous phase of the obtained oxynitride phosphor powder can be increased by using an amorphous silicon nitride. In the case of using a crystalline silicon nitride, the thickness of the oxygen-containing amorphous phase of the obtained oxynitride phosphor powder can be increased by using a crystalline silicon nitride having a large oxygen content or using a crystalline silicon nitride having a large specific surface area.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0130">The oxygen amount of the oxynitride phosphor powder is preferably from 1.4 to 5.0 mass %. An oxygen content of 1.4 to 5.0 mass % is preferred, since the density of a sintered body of the polycrystalline ceramics is likely to become large and the conversion efficiency increases. When the oxygen amount is less than 1.4 mass %, the density of a sintered body of the polycrystalline ceramics may be little increased, and due to voids present in the polycrystalline ceramics, the improvement of extraction efficiency of the wavelength-converted light may decrease, leading to a small improvement of the conversion efficiency. When the oxygen amount exceeds 5 mass %, the emission peak wavelength is likely to become 590 nm or less, and the improvement of conversion efficiency may be reduced. The oxygen amount of the oxynitride phosphor can be adjusted by controlling z in composition formula (1). Specifically, the oxygen amount can be adjusted by using an oxygen-containing raw material to obtain a predetermined oxygen concentration. When the oxygen amount of the oxynitride phosphor powder is adjusted to 5 mass % or more by controlling z in composition formula (1), the emission peak wavelength is likely to become 590 nm or less and the improvement of the conversion efficiency may be reduced. In addition, as described above, there is a method of increasing oxygen to exceed the theoretical oxygen amount of composition formula (1), specifically, a method of adjusting the concentration of impurity oxygen contained in the raw material, or a method of providing an oxidation step of heat-treating the powder in the air or in an oxygen-containing atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0131">The oxygen contents of the oxynitride phosphor powder, crystalline silicon nitride and amorphous silicon nitride can be measured by an oxygen/nitrogen analyzer or an oxygen-nitrogen simultaneous analyzer manufactured by LECO. The thickness of the surface amorphous phase of the oxynitride phosphor powder can be measured by a scanning transmission electron microscope, Cs-corrected STEM Model JEM-2100F (hereinafter, referred to as STEM), manufactured by JEOL Ltd.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0132">As the method for molding and firing the polycrystalline ceramics, although not limited to these methods, a normal pressure sintering method, a pressure sintering method, a hot plasma sintering method, a discharge plasma sintering method, etc. can be utilized. In order to obtain polycrystalline ceramics having a large sintering density without using a sintering aid, a pressure sintering method, a hot plasma sintering method or a discharge plasma sintering method is preferably employed. In the pressure sintering method, the oxynitride phosphor powder filled in a graphite-made die can be fired at a temperature of 1,500 to 2,000Â° C. in an inert gas atmosphere while applying a uniaxial pressure. In order to suppress sublimation and decomposition of the oxynitride phosphor powder, a gas pressure of 0.2 to 1 MPa is preferably applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0133">Sintering (firing) of the polycrystalline ceramics is preferably performed under the conditions affording a large sintering density and at a lower temperature. Firing at a high temperature is not preferred, since calcium, europium and silicon contained in the oxynitride phosphor are sublimated to change the composition of the obtained polycrystalline ceramics. For this reason, the firing temperature is preferably from 1,500 to 2,000Â° C., more preferably from 1,500 to 1,850Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0134">In order to obtain polycrystalline ceramics having a large density at a lower firing temperature, the primary particle constituting the oxynitride phosphor powder is preferably small. The primary particle as used herein indicates a minimum unit of a crystal grain constituting the powder, that is, a region where the crystal orientation is aligned and a grain boundary is not formed in the interior. The phosphor powder is composed of a secondary particle resulting from fusion or aggregation of primary particles. The primary particles can be made small by increasing the specific surface area of a crystalline silicon nitride or amorphous silicon nitride serving as a raw material of the oxynitride phosphor powder. In the present invention, a crystalline silicon nitride having a specific surface layer of 9 to 30 m<sup>2</sup>/g is preferably used, and an amorphous silicon nitride having a specific surface area of 600 to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g is more preferably used.</p>

The thickness of the polycrystalline ceramics is preferably from 100 to 300 Î¼m. The thickness of the polycrystalline ceramics less than 100 Î¼m is not preferred, since cracking, chipping, etc. may be generated in the course of processing the polycrystalline ceramics. The thickness more than 300 Î¼m is not preferred, since the conversion efficiency decreases.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0136">The oxynitride phosphor powder and polycrystalline ceramics of the present invention may contain fluorine but need not contain fluorine. The oxynitride phosphor powder and polycrystalline ceramics preferably contain less than 20 ppm of fluorine, 10 ppm or less of fluorine, or substantially no fluorine.</p>
