      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a natural rubber-containing thermoplastic resin composition and a molded article thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Thermoplastic resin compositions used in fields such as automobile materials, home electric appliances and general merchandise are demanded to have a good balance between mechanical strength such as impact resistance and rigidity, and moldability. Therefore, rubbery polymer-containing rubber-reinforced thermoplastic resin compositions represented by high-impact polystyrenes (HIPS) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resins are widely utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Meanwhile, from the viewpoint of achieving carbon neutrality, there is an increasing need for a resin composition utilizing a naturally-occurring material represented by polylactic acid. One example of application of a naturally-occurring material to a rubbery polymer-containing thermoplastic resin composition is a technology that substitutes a synthetic rubber used as a rubbery polymer such as polybutadiene, with a natural rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">WO 2011/132795 describes a rubbery polymer-containing ABS resin comprising a deproteinized natural rubber having a nitrogen content of 0.1% by mass or less and a synthetic rubber. However, WO '795 explains that deproteinization of natural rubber latex by a known deproteinization method is necessary because impurities contained in natural rubber, particularly proteins, interfere with graft polymerization reaction. Furthermore, WO '795 explains that a high impact resistance-improving effect could not be obtained by using undeproteinized natural rubber latex. As natural rubber deproteinization methods, specifically, a method of degrading proteins by an addition of a proteinase to a natural rubber latex (JP H6-56902 A), a method of washing a natural rubber with a surfactant (JP 2004-99696 A) and a method of degrading proteins by an addition of an urea-based protein denaturant to a natural rubber latex (JP 2009-84333 A) have been disclosed.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Deproteinization of a natural rubber is a complicated process. Therefore, practical application of a deproteinized natural rubber as a rubbery polymer (R) of a rubber-reinforced thermoplastic resin composition such as HIPS or ABS resin is difficult at an industrial level. In view of this, it could be helpful to provide a natural rubber-containing thermoplastic resin composition having an excellent balance of physical properties in terms of impact resistance, fluidity and color tone, by using a natural rubber latex, but without requiring a complicated deproteinization treatment of a natural rubber.</p>

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0074">The natural rubber-containing thermoplastic resin composition (hereinafter, may be simply referred to as âthe thermoplastic resin compositionâ) is constituted by the below-described eight composition groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0075">In the thermoplastic resin composition of the first composition group, the particle sizes of the natural rubber and the synthetic rubber that are contained in the graft copolymer (A) as well as the internal graft ratio of the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) containing these particles are the characteristic features. These characteristic features are also common to the second to eighth composition groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0076">The thermoplastic resin composition is characterized in that: it comprises a graft copolymer (A) obtained by graft-polymerizing a vinyl monomer mixture (a) comprising at least an aromatic vinyl monomer to a rubbery polymer (R) composed of 10 to 70% by mass of a natural rubber having a weight-average particle size of 0.3 to 1.2 Î¼m and 30 to 90% by mass of a synthetic rubber having a weight-average particle size of 0.2 to 0.4 Î¼m; particles of the natural rubber include not less than 5% by mass of natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber; and particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger have an internal graft ratio of 20% or higher.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0077">The ânatural rubberâ used in the graft copolymer (A) refers to a substance that is normally contained in the sap of a rubber tree and comprises cis-poly-1,4-isoprene as a main repeating structural unit. In addition to such natural rubber produced by in-vivo addition polymerization, the sap contains a trace amount of impurities such as proteins and fatty acids. It is preferred to use a natural rubber that is contained in a natural rubber latex obtained by purifying a sap (having a natural rubber concentration of about 30% by mass) by an arbitrary purifica-tion/solid-liquid separation method and subsequently adjusting the natural rubber concentration to be 60% by mass or higher. The natural rubber is not required to be subjected to a deproteinization treatment in advance and a deproteinized natural rubber latex may be used, or the natural rubber may be deproteinized in the process of producing the thermoplastic resin composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0078">The natural rubber used in the graft copolymer (A) is characterized by comprising particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger in an amount of not less than 5% by mass with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber and having a weight-average particle size of 0.3 to 1.2 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0079">The size of the natural rubber particles influences the shock-absorbing properties of the graft copolymer (A) as well as those of a resin composition containing the graft copolymer (A). Therefore, a focus was given to natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger that exhibit superior shock-absorbing properties. When the amount of the natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is less than 5% by mass with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin composition is reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0080">The content of the natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is preferably not less than 20% by mass with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber. Meanwhile, the upper limit of the content of the natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is not particularly restricted. However, from the standpoint of further improving the impact resistance, the content is preferably not greater than 50% by mass, more preferably not greater than 45% by mass, with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0081">Further, in addition to the difficulty of collecting a natural rubber with a weight-average particle size of smaller than 0.3 Î¼m and the laborious secondary processing thereof, when the weight-average particle size of the natural rubber is smaller than 0.3 Î¼m, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin composition may be reduced. It is thus preferred that the natural rubber have a weight-average particle size of 0.6 Î¼m or larger. Meanwhile, when the weight-average particle size of the natural rubber is larger than 1.2 Î¼m, the impact resistance, color tone and surface gloss of the thermoplastic resin composition may be deteriorated. It is thus preferred that the natural rubber have a weight-average particle size of 1.0 Î¼m or smaller.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0082">The content of the natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger and the weight-average particle size of the natural rubber can be determined by the following method. First, using water as a medium, the natural rubber (or natural rubber latex) is diluted and dispersed to measure the particle size distribution using a laser scattering-diffraction particle size distribution analyzer. As the laser scattering-diffraction particle size distribution analyzer, âLS 13 320â (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) or the like can be employed. From the thus obtained particle size distribution, the content of the natural rubber particles with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is calculated, and the weight-average particle size of the rubber particles is calculated using Equation 1:</p>

      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0083">Examples of the synthetic rubber used in the graft copolymer (A) include polybutadiene, poly(butadiene-styrene) (SBR), poly(butadiene-acrylonitrile) (NBR), polyisoprene, poly(butadiene-butyl acrylate), poly(butadiene-methyl methacrylate), poly(butyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate), poly(butadiene-ethyl acrylate), ethylene-propylene rubber, poly(ethylene-isoprene) and poly(ethylene-methyl acrylate). Two or more of these synthetic rubbers may be used in combination. Thereamong, from the standpoint of further improving the impact resistance, polybutadiene, SBR, NBR and ethylene-propylene rubber are preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0084">As the synthetic rubber used in the graft copolymer (A), it is preferred to employ one which is contained in a synthetic rubber latex produced by addition polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0085">The synthetic rubber is characterized by having a weight-average particle size of 0.2 to 0.4 Î¼m. When the weight-average particle size of the synthetic rubber is smaller than 0.2 Î¼m, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin composition is reduced. Meanwhile, also when the weight-average particle size of the synthetic rubber is larger than 0.4 Î¼m, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin composition is reduced. It is thus preferred that the synthetic rubber have a weight-average particle size of 0.3 Î¼m or smaller.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0086">The weight-average particle size of the synthetic rubber can be determined by the following method.

From the thus obtained particle size distribution, the weight-average particle size of the synthetic rubber is calculated using the above-described Equation 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0087">The rubbery polymer (R) used in the graft copolymer (A) is characterized by being composed of 10 to 70% by mass of the natural rubber and 30 to 90% by mass of the synthetic rubber. When the amount of the natural rubber is less than 10% by mass and that of the synthetic rubber is greater than 90% by mass, the impact resistance of the thermoplastic resin composition is reduced.

So, it is preferred that an alkali fatty acid salt is used as an emulsifier and coagrated by the acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0114">When an emulsion polymerization method is used to produce the graft copolymer (A), the method of supplying the rubbery polymer (R) and the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is not particularly restricted. For example, both of these components may be supplied at once in the beginning. Alternatively, to control the distribution of the resulting copolymer composition, a part of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) may be continuously supplied, or a part or the entirety of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) may be supplied in portions. Continuous supplying of a part of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) means that a portion of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is supplied in the beginning and the rest is continuously supplied with time. Further, supplying of a part or the entirety of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) in portions means that a part or the entirety of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is supplied later than the initial supplying. To control the internal graft ratio of the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger to be 20% or higher as described below, it is preferred to supply not less than 10% by mass of the whole vinyl monomer mixture (a) prior to the start of polymerization. By supplying not less than 10% by mass of the whole vinyl monomer mixture (a) prior to the start of polymerization, under such an environment where the natural rubber and the vinyl monomer mixture (a) are brought into contact with each other, the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is made likely to infiltrate into the natural rubber particles coated with protein. Therefore, the graft copolymer (A), in which the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger have an internal graft ratio of 20% or higher, can be easily produced. The term âstart of polymerizationâ used herein refers to the time when addition of an initiator is started.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0115">There is no particular restriction with regard to the duration of contact between the natural rubber and the vinyl monomer mixture (a) prior to the start of polymerization. However, to allow the natural rubber to be sufficiently impregnated with the vinyl monomer mixture (a), it is preferably 30 minutes or longer. Even if the contact is made for an excessively long time, the effect thereof tends to be saturated; therefore, the duration of the contact is preferably 90 minutes or shorter. For example, it is preferred to start the supplying of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) at least 30 to 90 minutes before the start of polymerization. Further, it is not necessary to bring the whole vinyl monomer mixture (a) into contact with the natural rubber before the polymerization, and not less than 10% by mass of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) to be reacted may be brought into contact with the natural rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0116">The temperature at which the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is supplied before the start of polymerization is not particularly restricted. However, it is preferably 40 to 70Â° C. By setting the supplying temperature at 40Â° C. or higher, the vinyl monomer mixture (a) is allowed to sufficiently infiltrate into the natural rubber. Meanwhile, by setting the loading temperature at 70Â° C. or lower, emulsification stability of latex can be maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0117">The pH in the emulsion polymerization is not particularly restricted. However, it is preferably 10 to 12. By controlling the pH from 10 to 12, the emulsified state of the graft copolymer (A) can be stabilized. In addition, hydrolysis of some proteins is facilitated so that graft polymerization is likely to proceed. To control the pH in a range of 10 to 12, for example, potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide is used, and potassium hydroxide is more preferably used because of its excellent emulsification stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0118">The graft ratio of the graft copolymer (A) is preferably 30% or higher, more preferably 35% or higher, still more preferably 40% or higher. When the graft ratio is 30% or higher, the compatibility between the rubbery polymer (R) contained in the thermoplastic resin composition and the below-described vinyl-based copolymer (B) can be further improved. Meanwhile, from the standpoint of further improving the impact resistance, the upper limit of the graft ratio is preferably 70% or lower, more preferably 60% or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0119">The particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger that are contained in the thermoplastic resin composition are characterized by having an internal graft ratio of 20% or higher. As described above, the size of the natural rubber particles influences the shock-absorbing properties of the graft copolymer (A) as well as those of a resin composition containing the graft copolymer (A). By allowing the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger to have an internal graft ratio of 20% or higher, the rubbery polymer (R) can be incorporated into the thermoplastic resin composition in a dispersed manner. The âinternal graft ratioâ refers to the ratio of the amount of the vinyl-based copolymer (Y) contained in the rubbery polymer (R), with respect to the total amount [(Y)+(R)] of the rubbery polymer (R) and the vinyl-based (Y) copolymer contained therein. Specifically, in a photograph of a sample adjusted by osmic acid staining which was taken under an electron microscope (TEM) at a magnification of Ã20,000, 5 particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger are randomly selected, and the ratio between the cross-sectional area of each rubbery polymer (R) particle and the area of the vinyl-based copolymer (Y) existing inside the cross-sectional area is determined and an average thereof is calculated. The internal graft ratio of the rubbery polymer (R) is determined without differentiation between a natural rubber and a synthetic rubber. When the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger have an internal graft ratio of lower than 20%, the compatibility between the rubbery polymer (R) contained in the thermoplastic resin composition and ungrafted vinyl-based copolymer is reduced so that the thermoplastic resin composition tends to have a reduced impact resistance. The internal graft ratio of the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is preferably 30% or higher. Meanwhile, the upper limit of the internal graft ratio of the particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger is not particularly restricted. However, it is preferably 50% or lower. As a means of controlling the internal graft ratio at 20% or higher, for example, a method in which, as described above, emulsion polymerization is initiated after supplying 10% by mass or more of the vinyl monomer mixture (a) and the remaining vinyl monomer mixture (a) is added thereafter, can be employed.</p>

Examples of the terminal blocking agent used in this case include monovalent phenols, monovalent carboxylic acids, and carbonic acid diesters.

      <p id="p-00276-en" num="0315">The method of producing the thermoplastic resin composition is not particularly restricted. The thermoplastic resin composition may be a composition obtained by mixing the components constituting the thermoplastic resin composition using, for example, a mixer such as a V-blender, a super mixer, a super floater or a Henschel mixer. However, normally, the thermoplastic resin composition is often a mixture obtained by uniformly melt-mixing a product of the above-described mixing. Such a mixture can be obtained by, for example, melt-kneading the above-described mixed product using a kneading means at a temperature of preferably 210 to 320Â° C., more preferably 230 to 300Â° C. or so, and subsequently pelletizing the resultant.

In cases where the thermoplastic resin composition is produced by mixing the above-described components, alkaline degradation of the polylactic acid-based resin (F) may occur depending on the components mixed. Therefore, to inhibit alkaline degradation of the polylactic acid-based resin (F), it is preferred to prepare a pellet in advance by kneading the graft copolymer (A), vinyl-based copolymer (B-4) and phosphoric acid and/or monosodium phosphate (U).</p>
      <p id="p-00279-en" num="0318">Further, when the thermoplastic resin composition is produced to be molded into an extrusion-molded article such as a sheet, it is preferred that the thermoplastic resin composition be produced by first melt-kneading the components other than the polylactic acid-based resin (F) and then further melt-kneading the resultant with an addition of the polylactic acid-based resin (F).</p>

The polylactic acid-based resin (F) is fed through a side feed port (auxiliary material-feeding side) arranged near the center of the full length of the barrel of the biaxial extruder, and the resulting mixture is further melt-kneaded to obtain the thermoplastic resin composition. An importance may be given to the surface appearance in molded articles such as a sheet, and this method is capable of reducing the spot generation that impairs the surface appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0320">The thermoplastic resin composition obtained in the above-described manner can be molded by an arbitrary method such as injection molding, extrusion molding, blow molding, vacuum molding, compression molding or gas-assisted molding. The molding method is not particularly restricted. However, the thermoplastic resin composition is preferably molded by injection molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0321">The injection molding can be performed in a normal molding temperature of preferably 210 to 320Â° C. Particularly, it is more preferred that the thermoplastic resin compositions of the second, third, fourth, sixth and seventh composition groups be injection-molded at 210 to 260Â° C.; the thermoplastic resin composition of the fifth composition group be injection-molded at 240 to 270Â° C.; and the thermoplastic resin composition of the eighth composition group be injection-molded at 240 to 300Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00283-en" num="0322">The mold temperature in the injection molding is in a range normally used for molding, which is preferably 30 to 80Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00284-en" num="0323">The thermoplastic resin composition can be molded by an arbitrary method such as injection molding, extrusion molding, inflation molding or blow molding, to be widely used as a molded article in a variety of shapes. Examples of the molded article include films, sheets, fibers, cloths, nonwoven fabrics, injection-molded articles, extrusion-molded articles, vacuum compression-molded articles, blow-molded articles and composites with other materials, which are useful in applications such as automobile materials, materials of electric and electronic devices, agricultural materials, gardening materials, fishing materials, civil engineering and construction materials, stationeries, medical supplies, toilet seats and miscellaneous goods.</p>

      <p id="p-00286-en" num="0325">A natural rubber latex and a synthetic rubber latex were diluted and dispersed in an aqueous medium to measure their particle size distributions using a laser scattering diffraction particle size distribution analyzer, âLS 13 320â (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). From the thus obtained particle size distributions, the weight-average particle sizes of the subject natural rubber and synthetic rubber were determined. For the natural rubber, the ratio of particles with a size of 1.0 m or larger with respect to all of the particles of the natural rubber was calculated from the particle size distribution.</p>

      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0326">After adding 80 ml of acetone to about 1 g of a graft copolymer (A) sample (m: sample mass), the resultant was refluxed for 3 hours in a 70Â° C. hot-water bath. This solution was centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m. (10,000 G) for 40 minutes, and insoluble matter was subsequently removed by filtration. The thus obtained acetone-insoluble component was dried under reduced pressure at 80Â° C. for 5 hours, and the mass (n) of the dried component was measured to calculate the graft ratio using Equation 2. X represents the content of the rubbery polymer in the graft copolymer (A).</p>

      <p id="p-00290-en" num="0328">The ratio of the amount of vinyl-based copolymer contained in the rubbery polymer (R) (internal graft amount), (Y), with respect to the total amount of the rubbery polymer (R) and the vinyl-based copolymer contained therein, [(Y)+(R)], was calculated as the internal graft ratio. Specifically, in a photograph of a sample adjusted by osmic acid staining which was taken under an electron microscope (TEM) at a magnification of Ã20,000, 5 particles of the rubbery polymer (R) with a size of 1.0 Î¼m or larger were randomly selected, and the ratio between the cross-sectional area of each rubbery polymer (R) particle and the area of the vinyl-based copolymer (Y) existing inside the cross-sectional area was determined and an average thereof was calculated. For the calculation of the area ratio, the TEM image was color-coded in black and white by automatic color coding performed by an image analysis software âWinROOFâ manufactured by Mitani Corporation. With a value of 1.4 times of the âthreshold valueâ at which 80% of the particle cross-sectional area is coded in white, the proportion of the white area, and the proportion of the black area being each defined as the critical value, the internal graft amount (Y) and the rubbery polymer amount (R), respectively, the internal graft ratio was calculated using Equation 3:</p>

      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0332">For each of the acetone-soluble component of the graft copolymer (A), the vinyl-based copolymer (B) and the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer (S) of the fifth composition group, the weight-average molecular weight [Mw] was measured using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) apparatus manufactured by Water Corporation. As a detector, a differential refractometer WATER 2414 was used. As columns, two MIXED-B columns manufactured by Polymer Laboratories, Ltd. were used, and tetrahydrofuran was used as an eluent. The measurement was carried out at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a column temperature of 40Â° C. From the measurement results, the weight-average molecular weight [Mw] was calculated in terms of polystyrene. The weight-average molecular weight [Mw] of the acrylic resin (V) of the seventh composition group was measured using the same apparatus and conditions as in the above-described case of the vinyl-based copolymer (B), except that weight-average molecular weight [Mw] was calculated in terms of polymethacrylate (PMMA). Further, the weight-average molecular weight [Mw] of the polylactic acid-based resin (F) of the seventh composition group was also measured using the same apparatus and conditions as in the above-described case of the vinyl-based copolymer (B), except that hexafluoroisopropanol was used as the eluent and the weight-average molecular weight [Mw] was calculated in terms of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).</p>

For the thus obtained test pieces, the flame retardancy was evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria prescribed in UL94. Each combustion test piece was held vertically and 20-mm long blue flame was brought into contact with the center of the lower end of the combustion test piece for 10 seconds. The flame was removed thereafter and the combustion time was measured. After extinction of the first flame, flame was again brought into contact with the test piece for 10 seconds, and the combustion time and the glow extinction time were measured. The evaluation criteria were as follows:</p>

The initiator mixture was continuously added dropwise over a period of 6 hours. Starting simultaneously with the start of the dropwise addition of the initiator mixture, a monomer mixture of 30.66 parts by mass of styrene, 11.34 parts by mass of acrylonitrile and 0.16 parts by mass of t-dodecyl mercaptan was also continuously added dropwise over a period of 4 hours. For 2 hours after the dropwise addition of this monomer mixture, only the initiator mixture was continuously added dropwise, and the polymerization was terminated thereafter. The thus polymerized latex was coagulated with 1.5 parts-by-mass sulfuric acid and then neutralized with sodium hydroxide, followed by washing, centrifugation and drying, thereby obtaining a powder-form graft copolymer [A-(2)]. This graft copolymer [A-(2)] had a graft ratio of 39% and an internal graft ratio of 25%, and the acetone-soluble component had a weight-average molecular weight [Mw] of 83,000.</p>

      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0370">First, as a medium for suspension polymerization, a methyl methacrylate-acrylamide copolymer was produced. The concrete production method is described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0371">To a reaction vessel, 80 parts by mass of acrylamide, 20 parts by mass of methyl methacrylate, 0.3 parts by mass of potassium persulfate and 1,800 parts by mass of ion-exchanged water were supplied, and the gas phase in the reaction vessel was replaced with nitrogen gas and maintained at 70Â° C. with thorough stirring. Reaction was continued until the monomers were completely converted into a polymer, thereby obtaining a binary copolymer of acrylamide and methyl methacrylate as an aqueous solution. The thus obtained reaction solution was a slightly cloudy, viscous aqueous solution. To this aqueous solution, 35 parts by mass of sodium hydroxide and ion-exchanged water were added to maintain the alkalinity of the solution as a 0.6% aqueous solution of acrylamide-methyl methacrylate binary copolymer. The aqueous solution was stirred at 70Â° C. for 2 hours and subsequently cooled to room temperature, thereby obtaining a transparent aqueous solution as a medium for suspension polymerization.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0372">In a 20-L autoclave, 6 parts by mass of the thus obtained aqueous solution of the methyl methacrylate-acrylamide binary copolymer was supplied and stirred at 400 rpm, and the atmosphere in the system was replaced with nitrogen gas. After increasing the temperature to 70Â° C., a monomer mixture composed of 28.9 parts by mass of acrylonitrile, 11.1 parts by mass of styrene, 0.32 parts by mass of azobis-isobutyronitrile and 0.32 parts by mass of t-dodecyl mercaptan was added over a period of 30 minutes while stirring the reaction system, thereby initiating polymerization reaction. One hour after the addition of the monomer mixture, 15 parts by mass of styrene was added thereto using a feed pump. Thereafter, styrene was added to the reaction vessel three times at 30-minute intervals, each time in an amount of 15 parts by mass. After all of the monomers were added, the reaction system was heated to 100Â° C. over a period of 60 minutes. Thereafter, the temperature was maintained at 100Â° C. for 30 minutes, and the reaction system was subjected to cooling, polymer separation, washing and drying, thereby obtaining a vinyl-based (co)polymer [B-(1)] in the form of beads. The thus obtained vinyl-based (co)polymer [B-(1)] had a weight-average molecular weight [Mw] of 12,000.</p>

      <heading id="h-00055-en" level="1">Vinyl-Based (Co)Polymer [B-(2)]</heading>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0373">A vinyl-based (co)polymer [B-(2)] was obtained in the form of beads in the same manner as in Reference Example 14, except that the initially added monomer mixture was composed of 24 parts by mass of acrylonitrile, 76 parts by mass of styrene and 0.3 parts by mass of t-dodecyl mercaptan; and that no further addition of a monomer mixture was made. The thus obtained vinyl-based (co)polymer [B-(2)] had a weight-average molecular weight [Mw] of 12,000.</p>

      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0375">Introduced below is the thermoplastic resin composition of the second composition group. In accordance with the respective blending ratios shown in Tables 5 to 8, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each blended with the vinyl-based polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14. As additives, 0.3 parts by mass of t-butylhydroxytoluene and 0.3 parts by mass of tri(nonylphenyl)phosphite were further added, and the resultant was mixed at 23Â° C. using a Henschel mixer. The resulting mixture was extruded into a gut form at an extrusion temperature of 230Â° C. using a 40-mmÏ extruder and then made into a pellet. The thus obtained pellet was injection-molded at a molding temperature of 230Â° C. and a mold temperature of 40Â° C., thereby preparing a test piece for evaluations. Physical properties were measured for the thus obtained test piece. The measurement results of Examples are shown in Tables 5 and 6, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Tables 7 and 8.</p>

      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0376">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 201 to 207 all had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and surface gloss. Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled, these thermoplastic resin compositions had excellent impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0377">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 201, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, showed poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 202 to 204 were poor in terms of impact resistance, color tone and surface gloss. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 205 also had poor impact resistance. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 206 was poor in terms of impact resistance, color tone and surface gloss. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 207 had poor impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 207 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

As additives, 0.3 parts by mass of t-butylhydroxytoluene and 0.3 parts by mass of tri(nonylphenyl)phosphite were further added, and the resultant was mixed at 23Â° C. using a Henschel mixer. The resulting mixture was extruded into a gut form at an extrusion temperature of 230Â° C. using a 40-mmÏ extruder and then made into a pellet. The thus obtained pellet was injection-molded at a molding temperature of 230Â° C. and a mold temperature of 40Â° C., thereby preparing a test piece for evaluations. Physical properties were measured for the thus obtained test piece. The measurement results of Examples are shown in Tables 9 and 10, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Tables 11 and 12.</p>

      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0380">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 301 to 311 all had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone, outer appearance and chemical resistance. Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled, these thermoplastic resin compositions had excellent impact resistance. Moreover, in Example 312 where the blending ratio of the ethylene-carbon monoxide-(meth)acrylate copolymer (C) was increased, although the thermoplastic resin composition had poor outer appearance due to layer delamination, it showed excellent impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and chemical resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0381">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 301, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, showed poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 302 to 304 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 305 also had poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 306 and 307 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 307 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

      <p id="p-00360-en" num="0385">A solution A was prepared by dissolving 5.472 kg (24 mol) of bisphenol A, 6.0 g of hydrosulfide and 1.028 kg of p-tert-butyl phenol in 42.1 L of 8-wt % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. Further, while stirring 24.0 L of dichloromethane and maintaining its temperature at 15Â° C., 3.0 kg of phosgene was allowed to pass therethrough over a period of 50 minutes, thereby preparing a solution B. Next, while stirring the solution A, the solution B was added thereto to allow reaction to proceed. After the reaction, 12.0 mL of triethylamine was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at 20 to 25Â° C. for about 1 hour to allow polymerization to take place. After completion of the polymerization, the reaction solution was separated into an aqueous phase and an organic phase, and the organic phase was neutralized with phosphoric acid, followed repetitive washing with water until the electrical conductivity of the washing liquid (water) became 10 Î¼S/cm or less. The thus obtained polymer solution was added dropwise to warm water maintained at 45Â° C. and the solvent was subsequently removed by evaporation, thereby obtaining a white powder-form precipitate. This precipitate was recovered by filtration and dried at 110Â° C. for 24 hours to obtain an aromatic carbonate oligomer (K).</p>
      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0386">The thus obtained aromatic carbonate oligomer (K) had a limiting viscosity [Î·] of 0.19 dl/g at 20Â° C. It is known that the limiting viscosity [Î·] and the viscosity-average molecular weight [Mv] have a relationship represented by Schnell's viscosity formula: [Î·]=1.23Ã10<sup>â4</sup>Ã(Mv)<sup>0.83</sup>. As a result of conversion from the value of the limiting viscosity [Î·], [Mv] was determined to be 6,950. Further, as a result of analyzing the infrared absorption spectrum, absorption by carbonyl group was found at about 1,770 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and absorption by ether bond was found at about 1,240 cm<sup>â1</sup>; therefore, the aromatic carbonate oligomer (K) was confirmed to have a carbonate bond.</p>

      <p id="p-00365-en" num="0390">Introduced below is the thermoplastic resin composition of the fourth composition group. In accordance with the respective blending ratios shown in Tables 13 to 15, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each blended with the vinyl-based (co)polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14 or 15, the phosphate-based flame retardant (J) shown in Reference Example 17, the aromatic carbonate oligomer (K) prepared in Reference Example 18, the phosphorus-containing organic compound-based antioxidant (M) shown in Reference Example 20 and the silicone compound (N) shown in Reference Example 21. After mixing these materials at 23Â° C. using a Henschel mixer, the resulting mixture was extruded into a gut form at an extrusion temperature of 230Â° C. using a 40-mmÏ extruder and then made into a pellet. The thus obtained pellet was injection-molded at a molding temperature of 230Â° C. and a mold temperature of 40Â° C., thereby preparing a test piece for evaluations. Physical properties were measured for the thus obtained test piece. The measurement results of Examples are shown in Tables 13 and 14, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Table 15.</p>

      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0391">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 401 and 412 had excellent impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and outer appearance and also had excellent flame retardancy. Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled, these thermoplastic resin compositions had excellent impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0392">The thermoplastic resin composition of Example 413, in which the aromatic carbonate oligomer (K) was not blended, had poor flame retardancy. However, it showed excellent impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and outer appearance. The thermoplastic resin composition of Example 414 contained only a small amount of the phosphate-based flame retardant [J-(1)] and thus had poor flame retardancy. However, it had excellent impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and outer appearance. The thermoplastic resin composition of Example 415 contained the aromatic polycarbonate (L) in place of the aromatic carbonate oligomer (K) and thus had poor flame retardancy. However, it also had excellent impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and outer appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0393">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 401, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, showed poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 402 to 404 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 405 also had poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 406 and 407 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 407 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0398">Introduced below is the thermoplastic resin composition of the fifth composition group. In accordance with the respective blending ratios shown in Tables 16 to 18, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each blended with the vinyl-based (co)polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14 or 15, the polyethylene terephthalate resin (D) shown in Reference Example 22 and the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer (S) shown in Reference Example 23. Using a vent-equipped 30-mm biaxial extruder, the resulting mixture was melt-kneaded and extruded at a cylinder preset temperature of 260Â° C. to produce a pellet-form thermoplastic resin composition. The thus obtained thermoplastic resin composition was pre-dried for 5 hours in a 105Â° C. hot-air dryer and then molded into the shape of multi-purpose test piece A prescribed by ISO 3167 (2002) (total length: 150 mm, test section width: 10 mm, thickness: 4 mm) using an electric injection molding machine, SE50 manufactured by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., at a cylinder temperature of 260Â° C. and a mold temperature of 60Â° C. For the thus obtained test piece, the Charpy impact strength was measured. Further, the thermoplastic resin composition was also molded into a square shape plate molded article (thickness: 3 mm), for which color tone and outer appearance were evaluated. For the thus obtained test piece, physical properties were measured. The measurement results of Examples are shown in Tables 16 and 17, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Table 18.</p>

      <p id="p-00380-en" num="0399">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 501 to 511 all had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone, outer appearance and chemical resistance. Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled and the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer (S) was incorporated, these thermoplastic resin compositions had an even more excellent impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00381-en" num="0400">The thermoplastic resin composition of Example 512 contained a large amount of the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer [S-(1)] and thus had a tendency to exhibit poor outer appearance due to generation of a gel compound. However, this thermoplastic resin composition was excellent in terms of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and chemical resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00382-en" num="0401">The thermoplastic resin composition of Example 513, in which the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer [S-(2)] was used in place of the epoxy group-containing acryl-styrene-based copolymer [S-(1)], also had a tendency to exhibit poor outer appearance due to generation of a gel compound. However, this thermoplastic resin composition had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone and chemical resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00383-en" num="0402">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 501, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, had poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 502 to 505 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 506 also had poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 507 and 508 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 508 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

After heating the supplied materials with stirring for 60 minutes at a temperature of 260Â° C. to obtain a transparent and homogenous solution, the pressure was reduced to 0.07 kPa or less. To the thus obtained solution, 0.1 parts by mass of tetrabutyl titanate was added, and the resultant was allowed to react for 2 hours under a reduced pressure of 0.07 kPa or less and a temperature of 260Â° C. The thus obtained polymer was extruded into the form of a strand, which was subsequently cut to prepare a pellet-form polyamide elastomer (E).</p>

In accordance with the respective blending ratios shown in Tables 19 to 22, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each blended with the vinyl-based (co)polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14 or 15, the polyamide elastomer (E) prepared in Reference Example 24 and the carboxyl group-containing modified vinyl-based copolymer (T) prepared in Reference Example 25. Using a vent-equipped 30-mm biaxial extruder, the resulting mixture was melt-kneaded and extruded at a cylinder preset temperature of 230Â° C. to produce a pellet-form thermoplastic resin composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00387-en" num="0406">The thus obtained thermoplastic resin composition was pre-dried for 5 hours in a 90Â° C. hot-air dryer and then molded into the shape of multi-purpose test piece A prescribed by ISO 3167 (2002) (total length: 150 mm, test section width: 10 mm, thickness: 4 mm) using an electric injection molding machine, SE50 manufactured by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd., at a cylinder temperature of 230Â° C. and a mold temperature of 60Â° C. For the thus obtained test piece, the Charpy impact strength was measured. Further, the thermoplastic resin composition was also molded into a plate molded article (thickness: 3 mm), for which surface specific resistance and electrostatic diffusivity performance (static voltage and static voltage decay half-life) were evaluated. For the thus obtained test piece, physical properties were measured. The measurement results of Examples are shown in Tables 19 and 20, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Tables 21 and 22.</p>

      <p id="p-00392-en" num="0407">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 601 to 607 and 610 all had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone, outer appearance, surface specific resistance and electrostatic diffusivity performance. Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled and the modified vinyl-based copolymer (T) was incorporated in an appropriate amount, these thermoplastic resin compositions had an even more excellent impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00393-en" num="0408">The thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 608 and 609 contained a large amount of the modified vinyl-based copolymer (T) and thus had a tendency to exhibit poor outer appearance due to generation of a gel compound. However, these thermoplastic resin compositions also had an excellent balance of impact resistance, fluidity, color tone, surface specific resistance and electrostatic diffusivity performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00394-en" num="0409">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 601, which did not contain any natural rubber, showed poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 602 to 605 were poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 606 also had poor impact resistance. The resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 607 was poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. The composition obtained in Comparative Example 608 was also poor in terms of impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 608 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

      <p id="p-00399-en" num="0414">Introduced below is the thermoplastic resin composition of the seventh composition group. In accordance with the respective blending ratios shown in Tables 23 to 26, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each dry-blended with the vinyl-based (co)polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14 or 15, the polylactic acid (F) shown in Reference Example 26, the phosphoric acid and/or monosodium phosphate (U) shown in Reference Example 27 and the acrylic resin (V) shown in Reference Example 28. Then, using a biaxial screw extruder (âTEX-30â, manufactured by The Japan Steel Works, Ltd.) at an extrusion temperature of 220Â° C., the resultant was melt-kneaded and made into a pellet. The thus obtained pellet was injection-molded using an injection molding machine (âIS55EPN Injection Molding Machineâ, manufactured by Toshiba Machine Co., Ltd.) at a molding temperature of 220Â° C. and a mold temperature of 60Â° C., thereby preparing a test piece. Various physical properties were measured and evaluated for the thus obtained test piece. The evaluation results of Examples are shown in Tables 23 and 24, and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Tables 25 and 26.</p>

      <p id="p-00404-en" num="0415">As clearly seen from the results of Examples 701 to 709, by producing the rubber-containing graft copolymer (A) with a specific internal graft ratio by blending prescribed amounts of natural and synthetic rubbers each having a specific particle size, more environmentally friendly resin compositions having a superior balance of properties such as high impact resistance, good fluidity and color tone, as compared to conventional resin compositions containing only the polylactic acid-based resin (F) were provided without having to introduce a complicated deproteinization treatment. In addition, by incorporating the phosphoric acid [U-(1)] and/or the monosodium phosphate [U-(2)], the impact resistance and the thermal stability were further improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00405-en" num="0416">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 701, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, had low impact resistance. In the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 702, since a natural rubber was not used and the polylactic acid-based resin (F) having a low thermal deformation temperature was used, although the biomass level was comparable to that of the resin composition of Example 706, the thermal deformation temperature was greatly reduced. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 703 to 708 had poor impact resistance and color tone.</p>

In accordance with the respective ratios shown in Tables 27 and 28, the graft copolymers (A) prepared in Reference Examples 1 to 13 were each blended with the vinyl-based (co)polymer (B) prepared in Reference Example 14 or 15 and the polycarbonate resin (G) shown in Reference Example 29. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 minute using a blender and subsequently melt-kneaded using a unidirectionally-rotating biaxial extruder having a screw diameter of 30 mm (âPCM-30â, manufactured by Ikegai Machinery Co.; temperature range: 240 to 250Â° C.). The molten resin extruded from a die nozzle was received by a cutter via a water tank and then cut to obtain a resin pellet. Thereafter, using a molding machine (SE50DU Injection Molding Machine, manufactured by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.; molding temperature: 250Â° C., mold temperature: 60Â° C.), the thus obtained resin pellet was made into a test piece suitable for evaluation of various physical properties. The evaluation results of Examples are shown in Table 27 and those of Comparative Examples are shown in Table 28.</p>

Further, particularly because the particle size of the rubbery polymer (R) was controlled, these thermoplastic resin compositions had excellent impact resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00411-en" num="0420">On the other hand, the resin composition obtained in Comparative Example 701, which did not contain any natural rubber that is a naturally-occurring material, had poor impact resistance. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 802 to 805 had poor impact resistance and color tone. The resin compositions obtained in Comparative Examples 806 and 807 also had poor impact resistance and color tone. Furthermore, the graft copolymer [A-(13)] used in Comparative Example 807 was observed to generate a large amount of aggregates in the latex during the graft polymerization.</p>

Therefore, it can be widely utilized in the application fields such as home electric appliances, communication-related devices and general merchandise.</p>
