    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a molded article of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads and, more specifically, to a molded article of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads which has void spaces between the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Foam products formed of general-purpose resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene resins are now used in various fields because of their good heat insulating property, cushioning property and lightness in weight.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In recent years, with an increase of the consciousness on global environment, environmental problems such as depletion of petroleum resources are now close up. In this circumstance, in lieu of the above-described general-purpose resins produced from the petroleum resources, attention is now being paid upon polylactic acid which is a "carbon neutral" material.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Polylactic acid is produced from a plant such as corn as a starting material and is a thermoplastic resin that is regarded as being of a low environmental load type from the standpoint of carbon neutral. An attempt has been made to use such polylactic acid as an environmentally gentle, plant-derived resin for foams. Thus studies are being made on foams made of polylactic acid as a raw material. For instance, Japanese Kokai Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="JP2011213906A"><text>JP-A-2011-213906</text></patcit> discloses a molded article that is obtained from expanded beads formed of polylactic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is generally more difficult to produce foamed molded articles of polylactic acid expanded beads than to produce foamed molded articles of general purpose resin expanded beads, because the degree of crystallinity of the polylactic acid has a great influence on the moldability of the expanded beads. For example, a foamed molded article of polylactic acid expanded beads that have a low degree of crystallinity is not good in its dimensional stability and strength. When polylactic acid having a high degree of crystallinity is used, on the other hand, it is difficult to produce a foamed molded article of expanded beads having high fusion bonding strength between the expanded beads. These problems are of great concern for the production of a molded article of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads that has void spaces between the expanded beads, because an increase of void spaces between the expanded beads will generally result in lowering of fusion bonding strength therebetween and in an increased tendency toward shrinkage.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">With the above problems in view, the objective problem of the present invention is to provide a molded article of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads which has void spaces between the expanded beads and yet which has good fusion-bonding strength therebetween and suitable mechanical strength.</p>

    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The molded article according to the present invention may be produced from polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads. Whilst it has been hitherto difficult to perform in-mold molding of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads due to their tendency to change their crystallinity degree, the molded article of the present invention shows high fusion bonding strength between the expanded beads and, yet, has appropriate void spaces therebetween useful for multi-purpose applications.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention which follows, when considered in light of the accompanying drawings, in which: <ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li><figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a first heating run DSC curve (I) of a measurement sample as measured by a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter;</li><li><figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a second heating run DSC curve (I);</li><li><figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of a second heating run DSC curve (II) showing an endothermic calorific value (Br:endo) of a measurement sample as measured with a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter; and</li><li><figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another example of a second heating run DSC curve (II) showing an endothermic calorific value (Br:endo) of a measurement sample as measured with a heat flux differential scanning calorimeter.</li></ul></p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The polylactic acid-based resin foamed molded article may be obtained by heating polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads in a mold cavity to fuse-bond the polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads together. The term "polylactic acid-based resin foamed molded article" and the term "polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads" will be hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as "molded article" and "expanded beads", respectively. The term "polylactic acid-based resin" will be hereinafter occasionally referred to simply as "PLA resin".</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The PLA resin may be polylactic acid or a mixture of polylactic acid with other resin or resins. The polylactic acid is preferably a polymer containing at least 50 mol % of component units derived from lactic acid. Examples of the polylactic acid include (a) a polymer of lactic acid, (b) a copolymer of lactic acid with other aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid or acids, (c) a copolymer of lactic acid with an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid and an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol, (d) a copolymer of lactic acid with an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid, (e) a copolymer of lactic acid with an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol, and (f) a mixture of two or more of (a)-(e) above. Examples of the polylactic acid also include so-called stereocomplex polylactic acid and stereoblock polylactic acid. Specific examples of the lactic acid include L-lactic acid, D-lactic acid, DL-lactic acid, a cyclic dimer thereof (i.e. L-lactide, D-lactide or DL-lactide) and mixtures thereof.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the present invention, preferably used is polylactic acid which gives the expanded beads satisfying conditions (1) and (2) described hereinafter and which has a ratio of lactic acid isomers (D-isomer/L-isomer) of 99:1 to 94:6 or 6:94 to 1:99, particularly preferably 97:3 to 94:6 or 6:94 to 3:97. It is also preferred that the polylactic acid has a melting point (Tm) of 135 to 175°C, more preferably 145 to 175°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Examples of other aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acid in (b) above include glycolic acid, hydroxybutyric acid, hydroxyvaleric acid, hydroxycaproic acid and hydroxyheptoic acid. Examples of the aliphatic polyhydric alcohol in (c) and (e) above include ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, neopentyl glycol, decamethylene glycol, glycerin, trimethylolpropane and pentaerythritol. Examples of the aliphatic polycarboxylic acid in (c) and (d) above include succinic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedicarboxylic acid, succinic anhydride, adipic anhydride, trimesic acid, propanetricarboxylic acid, pyromellitic acid and pyromellitic anhydride.</p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Polylactic acid used in the present invention is preferably capped at its molecular chain ends. By this, it is possible to surely suppress hydrolysis during the course of the preparation of expanded beads, so that the dispersing medium release foaming method (hereinafter described) can be much easily carried out. Namely, it becomes easy to reliably form and control a high temperature peak on its first heating run DSC curve (hereinafter described). Thus, it becomes easy to produce expanded beads that are capable of withstanding in-mold molding. Additionally, a molded article obtained by in-mold molding of the expanded beads has improved durability. In the case of an extrusion molding method, too, it is possible to suppress hydrolysis which is not wanted.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Examples of the end capping agent include carbodiimide compounds, oxazoline compounds, isocyanate compounds and epoxy compounds. Above all, carbodiimide compounds are preferred. Specific examples of the diimide compounds include an aromatic monocarbodiimide such as bis(dipropylphenyl)carbodiimide, an aliphatic polycarbodiimide such as poly(4,4'-dicyclohexylmethanecarbodiimide, and an aromatic polycarbodiimide. These end capping agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. The using amount of the end capping agent is preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 3 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the polylactic acid.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The PLA resin used in the present invention may contain other resin or resins in addition to the polylactic acid as long as the objects and effects of the present invention are not adversely affected. When the PLA resin is a mixed resin composed of polylactic acid and other resin or resins, it is preferred that the polylactic acid is contained in the mixed resin in an amount of at least 50% by weight, more preferably at least 70 % by weight, still more preferably at least 90 % by weight. It is also preferred that the PLA resin has a content of lactic acid components of at least 50% by weight. Examples of the other resin to be mixed with the polylactic acid include a polyethylene resin, a polypropylene resin, a polystyrene resin, a polyester resin and a polycarbonate resin. Above all, the use of a biodegradable aliphatic polyester resin containing at least 35 mol % of aliphatic ester component units is preferred. Examples of the aliphatic polyester resin include a polycondensation product of a hydroxyacid other than the PLA resins, a ring open polymerization product of a lactone (e.g. polycaprolactone), and a polycondensation product of an aliphatic polyhydric alcohol with an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid or/and an aromatic polycarboxylic acid, such as polybutylene succinate, polybutylene adipate, polybutylene succinate adipate and poly(butylene adipate/terephthalate).</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">It is preferred that the expanded beads used for the preparation of the molded article of the present invention, when subjected to heat flux differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under the Condition 1 described below, should give a first heating run DSC curve (I) and a second heating run DSC curve (I) as follows. In the first heating run DSC curve (I), there appear at least one fusion peak (hereinafter occasionally referred to as "high temperature peak") having a peak top temperature which is higher than a reference temperature, and another at least one fusion peak (hereinafter occasionally referred to as "intrinsic peak") having a peak top temperature which is not higher than the reference temperature. The reference temperature is a peak top temperature of a fusion peak of the second heating run DSC curve (I). When, in the second heating run DSC curve (I), there are a plurality of fusion peaks or when there is a shoulder on high temperature side of a fusion peak, the reference temperature in the second heating run DSC curve (I) is defined as the peak top temperature of the fusion peak or the flection point temperature of the shoulder that is the highest among the peak top temperatures of the fusion peaks and the flection point temperatures of the shoulders.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Incidentally, the above feature with respect to the DSC characteristics of the expanded beads that are used for producing the molded article is the same as the feature of the expanded beads that are sampled from the molded article. Therefore, in a preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polylactic acid-based resin foamed molded article comprising a multiplicity of polylactic acid-based resin expanded beads that are fusion-bonded to each other to define void spaces therebetween,<br /> said polylactic acid-based resin foamed molded article having a voidage of 5 to 45% by volume, a bulk density BD [g/cm<sup>3</sup>] of 0.01 to 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and a ratio FT/BD of a flexural strength FT [MPa] thereof to the bulk density BD in the range of 6 to 25 MPa·cm<sup>3</sup>/g,<br /> wherein said expanded beads show at least one high temperature peak having a peak top temperature higher than a reference temperature and at least one low temperature peak having a peak top temperature equal to or lower than the reference temperature on a first heating run DSC curve obtained when a measurement samples from the expanded beads is heated from 23°C to a first temperature higher by 30°C than a fusion peak ending temperature at a heating speed of 10°C/min according to heat flux differential scanning calorimetry referenced in JIS K7122(1987),<br /> wherein said reference temperature is a peak top temperature of an endothermic peak that is located on the highest temperature side on a second heating run DSC curve obtained when the measurement sample, after having been maintained at said first temperature for 10 minutes and then cooled to 30°C at a cooling speed of 10°C/min, is heated from 30°C to a second temperature higher by 30°C than a fusion peak ending temperature at a heating speed of 10°C/min according to heat flux differential scanning calorimetry referenced in JIS K7122(1987).</p>
    <heading id="h-00001-en">Condition 1</heading>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">Method for measuring first and second heating run DSC curves (I):</heading>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The first and second heating run DSC curves (I) are measured and defined as follows: <ol><li>(a) a measurement sample of the expanded beads is subjected to heat flux differential scanning calorimetry measurement according to JIS K7122 (1987) by heating the measurement sample at a heating rate of 10°C/minute from 23°C to a first temperature higher by 30°C than the temperature at which the endothermic peak ends, thereby obtaining the first heating run DSC curve (I);</li><li>(b) the measurement sample is then maintained for 10 minutes at the first temperature higher by 30°C than the temperature at which the endothermic peak ends in the first heating run DSC curve;</li><li>(c) the measurement sample is then cooled to 30°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/minute;</li><li>(d) the measurement sample is then measured again for another DSC curve by being heated at a heating rate of 10°C/minute to a second temperature higher by 30°C than the temperature at which the endothermic peak ends, thereby obtaining the second heating run DSC curve (I).</li></ol></p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">It is believed that because the expanded beads, which show the high temperature peak, have improved heat resistance and rigidity at high temperatures and are prevented from excessively secondarily expanding during in-mold molding of the expanded beads, a heating medium is permitted to sufficiently heat the expanded beads located all parts in the mold cavity. As a result, the fusion bonding of the expanded beads during the in-mold molding is improved while making it possible to produce the molded article having void spaces. It follows that the obtained molded article shows excellent fusion bonding between the expanded beads even when void spaces are formed between the bonded expanded beads and even when the thickness thereof is large or the shape thereof is complicated.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The above-described high temperature peak appears on a first heating run DSC curve (I) obtained in the DSC measurement of the expanded beads, but does not appear in a second heating run DSC curve (I). The high temperature peak that appears in the first heating run DSC curve (I) is attributed to crystals that have grown during a thermal treatment of the expanded beads which will be described hereinafter. That is, such a high temperature peak in the first heating run DSC curve (I) is considered to be ascribed to secondary crystals formed through the thermal history in a process for expanding resin particles to obtain the expanded beads. On the other hand, the endothermic peak that appears in the second heating run DSC curve (I) of the expanded beads is a fusion peak which is attributed to the intrinsic crystal structure of the PLA resin.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
      <figref>FIG. 1 and FIG. 2</figref> illustrate examples of the first and second heating run DSC curves (I), respectively, of expanded beads. In order to investigate existence of a high temperature peak of the expanded beads, the reference temperature is determined from the second heating run DSC curve (I) of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Since, by definition, the reference temperature is a peak top temperature that is the highest among the peak top temperatures of the fusion peaks, the peak top temperature of the fusion peak "c" in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> represents the reference temperature. In the first heating run DSC curves (I) of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, there is a fusion peak "b" whose peak top temperature is higher than the above-determined reference temperature. Thus, the expanded beads have a high temperature peak "b". In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, there is a fusion peak "a" whose peak top temperature is not higher than the above-determined reference temperature. The fusion peak "a" represents the intrinsic peak.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Incidentally, a peak top temperature of a fusion peak that has the largest area among fusion peaks in the second heating run DSC curve (I), for example, the peak top temperature of the fusion peak "c" in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, is defined as a melting point Tm of the PLA resin that constitutes the expanded beads. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the temperature at which the skirt on a high temperature-side of the fusion peak (peak "c") returns to the base line is defined as a fusion peak ending temperature Te.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Although the DCS curve shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> has smooth two fusion peaks "a" and "b", DSC curves are not always simple. There are cases where a plurality of overwrapped fusion peaks appear in DSC curves so that one or more intrinsic peaks and one or more high temperature peaks are present in the DSC curves.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The calorific value (heat of fusion) (J/g) of the high temperature peak is determined from the first heating run DSC curve (I) shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> as follows. A straight line segment connecting a point α at which an endothermic peak begins separating from a low temperature-side base line and a point β at which the endothermic peak returns to a high temperature-side base line is drawn. Next, a line which is in parallel with the ordinate and which passes a point γ on the DSC curve at the bottom of the valley between the intrinsic peak "a" and the high temperature peak "b" is drawn. This line intersects the straight line (α-β) at point δ. The calorific value (heat of fusion) of the high temperature peak corresponds to the area (shaded portion in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) defined by the line segments (γ-δ) and (δ-β) and the part of the DSC curve forming the high temperature peak "b". Incidentally, there is a case where an exothermic peak contiguous with the fusion peak "a" appears in the low-temperature side of the fusion peak "a" (this is not the case in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), which makes it difficult to determine the point α at which the fusion peak begins separating from the low temperature-side base line. In such a case, the point α is determined as a point at which the exothermic peak begins separating from the low temperature-side base line.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The endothermic calorific value of the high temperature peak (a total endothermic calorific value of the fusion peaks when the high temperature peak is constituted of a plurality of fusion peaks) is preferably 5 to 20 J/g for reasons that the fusion bonding strength between expanded beads is high and uniform throughout the molded article. The lower limit of the calorific value of the high temperature peak is more preferably 6 J/g, still more preferably 7 J/g, while the upper limit of the calorific value of the high temperature peak is more preferably 15 J/g, still more preferably 10 J/g.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The molded article according to the present invention has a multiplicity of fusion-bonded expanded beads defining void spaces therebetween and has a voidage of 5 to 45% by volume, preferably 8 to 45% by volume, more preferably 10 to 35% by volume, further more preferably 15 to 30% by volume. The void spaces are preferably interconnected. As a consequence of the void spaces, the molded article may be used as an air permeable material, a water permeable material, a sound proof material, a cushioning material, a light weight material or the like material.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As used herein, the voidage of a molded article is determined as follows. The molded article is placed in an environment with a temperature of 23°C and a relative humidity of 50% for at least 24 hours. A test piece in a cuboid shape with a size of 20mm×15mm×80mm is then cut out from the molded article in such a way that no skin of the molded article remains present on the surfaces of the test piece. An apparent volume Va of the test piece is determined from the external dimension. The test piece is also measured for its true volume Vt by being immersed in a 200 mL measuring cylinder containing about 120 mL of ethanol at 23°C using a wire net. From a rise of the liquid level in the measuring cylinder, the true volume Vt is determined. The voidage is calculated by the following equation: <maths id="maths-00003-en" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi>Voidage</mi><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mfenced open="[" close="]" separators=""><mfenced separators=""><mi>Va</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>Vt</mi></mfenced><mo>/</mo><mi>Va</mi></mfenced><mo>×</mo><mn>100.</mn></mrow></math><img id="img-00003-en" wi="67" he="6" img-content="math" file="imgb0003.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths></p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The molded article has a bulk density BD of 0.01 to 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 0.015 to 0.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, still more preferably 0.02 to 0.1 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, for reasons of excellency in balance between its strength and lightness in weight.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As used herein, the bulk density BD of the molded article is measured as follows. The molded article is first placed in an environment with a temperature of 23°C and a relative humidity of 50% for at least 24 hours. Then, the bulk volume of the molded article is determined from the external dimension thereof and the weight of the molded article is precisely measured. The bulk density BD is calculated by dividing the measured weight (g) by the determined bulk volume (cm<sup>3</sup>).</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">It is important that the molded article of the present invention shows a ratio FT/BD of a flexural strength FT [MPa] thereof to the bulk density BD in the range of 6 to 25 MPa·cm<sup>3</sup>/g. The lower limit of the ratio FT/BD is preferably 7 MPa·cm<sup>3</sup>/g, more preferably 8 MPa·cm<sup>3</sup>/g. It is difficult to manufacture a molded article having a ratio FT/BD of more than 25 MPa·cm<sup>3</sup>/g.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">When the FT/BD ratio falls within the above range, the molded article exhibits good fusion bonding between the expanded beads.

Namely, when the heat treatment is carried out sufficiently to increase the degree of crystallinity of the polylactic acid which constitutes the expanded beads, the molded article has an appropriately increased degree of crystallinity. Therefore, there is no fear of excessive reduction of the mechanical strengths and heat resistance such as compressive strength at high temperatures of the molded article.

This means that, when the expanded beads are sufficiently heat treated, the degree of crystallinity of the polylactic acid in the center region is increased. Because of the improved degree of crystallinity of the polylactic acid in the center region of the expanded beads, the expanded beads can meet the above formula (1) and can show improved heat resistance, etc. as a whole. On the other hand, since the polylactic acid in the surface region of the expanded beads has a lower degree of crystallinity as compared with that in the center region of the expanded bead even when the expanded beads are sufficiently heat treated, the softening point of surface region of the expanded beads is low. Therefore, the expanded beads which satisfy the relationship shown in the formula (2) are capable of showing excellent fusion bonding between the expanded beads during an in-mold molding stage, irrespective of the thermal history before and after the fabrication of the expanded beads. From this point of view, the endothermic calorific value (Brs:endo) of the surface region of the expanded bead is preferably 35 J/g or less (inclusive of 0) for reasons of improved fusion bonding property of the expanded bead. For reasons of improved heat resistance and mechanical strengths of the expanded beads, the endothermic calorific value (Brc:endo) of the center region of the expanded beads is preferably 30 to 40 J/g. It is also preferred that between (Brc:endo) and (Brs:endo) there is a difference in calorific value of at least 3 J/g, more preferably at least 4 J/g.

The endothermic calorific value (Br:endo) is an area defined by a line segment (a-b) and the DSC curve. The DSC device should be preferably operated so that the base line is as straight as possible.

Similarly, the curved base line on the high temperature side is extended to the low temperature side with the radius of the curvature of the base line being maintained. The point at which the endothermic peak returns to the high temperature side curved base line is the point "b". The endothermic calorific values (Brs:endo) and (Brc:endo) may also be obtained from their second DSC curves (II) by drawing base lines in the same manner as in the case of (Br:endo) and may be each determined from the area defined by a line segment (a-b) and the DSC curve.</p>

The resin of which the core layer of the multi-layer expanded beads is formed may be exposed on a part of the exterior surface of the multi-layer expanded beads.</p>

The multi-layer expanded beads that show the above specific range of the difference in softening point may be produced by a method as described hereinafter which includes coextruding PLA resins with softening points (B) and (A) of the outer and core layers, and expanding the obtained multi-layered resin particles. It is preferred, from the standpoint of handling efficiency of the multi-layer expanded beads and mechanical strengths at elevated temperatures of molded articles obtained therefrom, that the softening point of the PLA resin of the outer layer not only meets the above-mentioned relationship with the softening point of the PLA resin of the core layer but also is 50°C or more, more preferably 55°C or more, particularly preferably 65°C or more.

When the weight proportion of the resin of the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads is excessively small, the thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads is so thin that the effect of improving the fusion bonding efficiency of the multi-layer expanded beads in an in-mold molding stage decreases. When the weight proportion of the outer layer is excessively great, there is a possibility that the mechanical properties of the molded article are deteriorated. In the multi-layer expanded beads, the resin forming the outer layer may be expanded as long as the objects and effects of the present invention are not adversely affected.</p>

Further, it is also possible to suppress hydrolysis during the course of the preparation of molded articles so that the production efficiency of the molded articles can be produced in a stable manner. Moreover, when the molded articles are subjected to actual use, they are expected to show improved durability and withstand use under a high temperature and high humidity environment.</p>
    <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the multi-layer expanded beads, the thickness of the outer layer is desired to be thin, because cells are hard to be formed in the outer layer and because mechanical strengths of the expanded beads molded article are improved. When the thickness of the outer layer is excessively low, there may be apprehension that the effect of improving fusion bonding between the multi-layer expanded beads is adversely affected. In actual, however, sufficient fusion bonding improving effect is achieved when the thickness is in the range described below. Namely, the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads preferably has an average thickness of 0.1 to 25 µm, more preferably 0.2 to 15 µm, particularly preferably 0.3 to 10 µm. The average thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads may be controlled by a control of the weight ratio of a resin of a core layer to a resin of an outer layer of the multi-layered resin particles during the fabrication thereof. The average thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layered resin particles should be controlled as appropriate in view of the weight of the resin particles and desired expansion ratio, but preferably has an average thickness of 2 to 100 µm, more preferably 3 to 70 µm, particularly preferably 5 to 50 µm.</p>
    <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The average thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads is measured as follows. One multi-layer expanded bead is cut into nearly equal halves. From a photograph of the enlarged cross section of the bead, the thickness of the outer layer in each of the four positions (upper and lower sides, and left and right sides) thereof is measured. The arithmetic mean of the four thickness values is the thickness of the outer layer of the expanded bead. Similar procedures are repeated for a total of 10 expanded beads. The arithmetic mean of the ten thickness values is the average thickness of the outer layer of the expanded beads. The average thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layered resin particles is also measured in a similar manner. In the multi-layer expanded beads and multi-layered resin particles, when the outer layer is formed on parts of the peripheral surface of the core layer, there may arise a case where the thickness of the outer layer cannot be measured in any way at the above four positions. In such a case, the thickness of the outer layer is measured at sixteen randomly selected measurable positions and the arithmetic mean thereof is defined as the thickness of the outer layer of the multi-layer expanded beads or resin particles. Also, when the outer layer of the expanded beads is not easily discriminated, it is preferable to produce the multi-layer expanded beads in such a manner that a suitable colorant is incorporated in the resin of which the outer layer is formed.</p>

With an increase of the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo), the degree of crystallinity of the PLA resin of which the expanded bead is formed becomes higher upon a heat treatment of the expanded bead. Thus, a high (Bfc:endo) is desirable because a molded article having higher mechanical strengths may be prepared. The upper limit of the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) is generally 70 J/g, preferably 60 J/g. When the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) is excessively small, there is a possibility that the mechanical strengths, especially mechanical strengths at high temperatures, of the final molded article is unsatisfactory. From this point of view, (Bfc:endo) is more preferably 35 J/g or higher.</p>
    <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo)] is preferably 3 to 20 J/g, more preferably 5 to 15 J/g, for reasons of easiness in controlling the voidage of the molded article. The fact that the exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) is low means that crystallization of the PLA resin in the center region of the expanded bead has significantly proceeded before the heat flux differential scanning calorimetry measurement.</p>
    <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) and the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) as used herein are determined by the heat flux differential scanning calorimetry (Condition 3) as referenced in JIS K7122 (1987), as described previously. The measurement of the exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) and the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) is carried out as follows.</p>
    <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In a first heating run DSC curve (II), when a point where the exothermic peak begins separating from a low temperature-side base line of the exothermic peak is assigned as point "c" and a point where the exothermic peak returns to a high temperature-side base line is assigned as point "d", the exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) of the expanded beads is a calorific value determined from the area defined by the line segment (c-d) and the DSC curve. In the first heating run DSC curve (II), when a point where the endothermic peak begins separating from a low temperature-side base line is assigned as point "e" and a point where the endothermic peak returns to a high temperature-side base line is assigned as point "f", the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) of the expanded beads is a calorific value determined from the area defined by the line segment (e-f) and the DSC curve. The DSC device should be preferably operated so that the base line of the first heating run DSC curve (II) is as straight as possible. When the base line is inevitably curved, the curved base line on the low temperature side of the exothermic peak is extended to the high temperature side with the radius of the curvature of the base line being maintained. The point at which the exothermic peak begins separating from the low temperature side curved base line is the point "c". Similarly, the curved base line on the high temperature side of the exothermic peak is extended to the low temperature side with the radius of the curvature of the base line being maintained. The point at which the exothermic peak returns to the high temperature side curved base line is the point "d". Further, the curved base line on the low temperature side of the endothermic peak is extended to the high temperature side with the radius of the curvature of the base line being maintained. The point at which the endothermic peak begins separating from the low temperature side curved base line is the point "e". Similarly, the curved base line on the high temperature side of the endothermic peak is extended to the low temperature side with the radius of the curvature of the base line being maintained. The point at which the endothermic peak returns to the high temperature side curved base line is the point "f".</p>
    <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067"> When it is difficult to determine points "d" and "e" by the above-described method, points "c" and "f" are first determined by the above-described method and a point at which the straight line segment (c-f) intersects the DSC curve is assigned as the point "d" (also point "e"), whereupon the exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) and the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo) of the expanded beads are determined. When there are a plurality of exothermic (or a plurality of endothermic peaks), the exothermic calorific value (Bfc:exo) (or the endothermic calorific value (Bfc:endo)) is a total area of the plural peaks.</p>
    <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In the above-described measurement of the endothermic calorific values (Bfc:endo) and (Bfc:exo), the sample is measured for its DSC curve under condition 3 including heating rate of 2°C/min. This is for the purpose of separating the positions of the exothermic and endothermic peaks from each other so as to determine the endothermic calorific values (Bfc:endo) and [(Bfc:endo)-(Bfc:exo)] as precisely as possible.</p>
    <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The apparent density of the expanded beads used for producing the molded article is not specifically limited but is preferably 0.025 to 0.25 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably 0.03 to 0.15 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, from the standpoint of production of a molded article having a bulk density of 0.01 to 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, reduction of shrinkage of the produced molded article, reduction of variation in the apparent density of the produced molded article, improvement in fusion bonding between the expanded beads of the produced molded article, and improvement in moldability and mechanical properties of the produced molded article.</p>
    <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As used herein, the apparent density of the expanded beads is measured by the following method. The expanded beads are allowed to stand for aging in a constant temperature and humidity room at 23°C under atmospheric pressure and a relative humidity of 50% for 10 days. In the same room, about 500 mL of the aged expanded beads are weighed to determine their weight W1 (g). The weighed expanded beads are immersed in water at 23°C contained in a measuring cylinder using a wire net or the like tool. From a rise of the water level volume, the volume V1 (cm<sup>3</sup>) of the expanded beads placed in the measuring cylinder is determined by subtracting the volume of the wire net and the like tool placed therein. The apparent density (g/ cm<sup>3</sup>) is calculated by dividing the weight W1 of the expanded beads placed in the measuring cylinder by the volume V1 (W1/V1).</p>
    <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The expanded beads used for producing the molded article preferably have an average cell diameter of 30 to 500 µm, more preferably 50 to 250 µm, from the standpoint of their in-mold moldability and improved appearance of the molded article obtained therefrom.</p>
    <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The average cell diameter of the expanded beads is measured as follows. The expanded beads are allowed to stand for aging in a constant temperature and humidity room at 23°C under atmospheric pressure and a relative humidity of 50% for 10 days. One aged expanded bead is cut into nearly equal halves. From an enlarged image of the cross section taken by a microscope, the average cell diameter is determined. Namely, on the enlarged image of the cross section of the expanded bead, four line segments each passing nearly through the center of the cross section and extending from one surface of the expanded bead to the other surface thereof are drawn such that eight angularly equally spaced straight lines extend radially from nearly the center of the cross section toward the external surface of the expanded bead. The number of the cells that intersect each of the four lines is counted. The total number N of the cells that intersect the above four line segments is counted. Also measured is a total length L (µm) of the four line segments. The value (UN) obtained by dividing the total length L by the total number N is an average cell diameter of the one expanded bead. Similar procedures are repeated for randomly-selected 10 expanded beads in total. The arithmetic mean of the average cell diameters of the ten expanded beads represents the average cell diameter of the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The shape of the molded article according to the present invention is not specifically limited. Not only molded article with a plate-like, columnar, vessel-like or block-like form but also a molded article with a complicated three-dimensional shape or an article with a large thickness may be produced.</p>
    <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The molded article having void spaces of the present invention is preferably obtained from the expanded beads having a high temperature peak on the first heating run DSC curve (I) as described above and, therefore, shows excellent fusion bonding between the expanded beads and improved dimensional stability and mechanical strength. Further, when the molded article is heat treated (heat set) for sufficiently increasing the degree of crystallinity of the PLA resin, more excellent heat resistance can be achieved.</p>
    <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">A method for preparing the expanded beads and a method for producing the molded article of the present invention will be next described. As the preferred method for preparing the expanded beads, there may be mentioned a dispersing medium release foaming method. By adopting the dispersing medium release foaming method, it is easy to control stretching of cell walls, formation of the high temperature peak and the calorific value of the high temperature peak during a process for expanding resin particles to obtain the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The dispersing medium release foaming method is a method including melting and kneading a PLA resin in an extruder, extruding the kneaded resin in the form of strands, cutting the extrudate to obtain resin particles (resin particle preparation step), dispersing the resin particles in a dispersing medium contained in a pressure resisting vessel, impregnating a physical blowing agent into the resin particles, while heating them, to obtain foamable resin particles (blowing agent impregnation step), and releasing the foamable resin particles together with the dispersing medium, at a high temperature and a high pressure, from the pressure resisting vessel into a lower pressure atmosphere to obtain expanded beads (foaming step). While the resin particle preparation step, blowing agent impregnation step and foaming step may be performed separately, the blowing agent impregnation step and the foaming step are generally carried out in a single stage.</p>
    <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In the resin particle preparation step, resin particles may be prepared by extruding a PLA resin into which required additives have been incorporated, the extrudate being then pelletized by, for example, a strand cutting method or an under-water cutting method. When the above-described multi-layered resin particles each composed of a core layer and an outer layer are intended to be produced, there may be utilized a coextrusion molding technique which is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Kokoku Publications Nos. <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="JPS4116125B"><text>JP-B-S41-16125</text></patcit>, <patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="JPS4323858B"><text>JP-B-S43-23858</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="JPS4429522B"><text>JP-B-S44-29522</text></patcit> and Japanese Kokai Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00005" dnum="JPS60185816A"><text>JP-A-S60-185816</text></patcit> and which uses, for example, a device including an extruder for forming the core layer, an extruder for forming the outer layer, and a coextrusion die connected to each of the extruders. The use of the multi-layered resin particles is preferable to produce the expanded beads that satisfy the above formula (2). The expanded beads that satisfy the above formula (1) may be suitably produced by using PLA resin having Rr:endo (described hereinafter) of more than 25 J/g.</p>
    <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In pelletization in the resin particle preparation step, a PLA resin and, if needed, additives are fed to an extruder and melted and kneaded. The molten kneaded mass thus obtained is extruded in the form of strands through small holes of a mouthpiece attached to a die exit at a tip of the extruder. The extruded strands are cooled by being immersed in water and then cut with a pelletizer such that the resin particles obtained each have a specific weight, whereby resin particles are obtained. Alternatively, such resin particles may be obtained by cutting the extruded strands into resin particles each have a specific weight, the resin particles being cooled after or simultaneous with the cutting.</p>
    <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The resin particles preferably have an average weight per one particle of 0.05 to 10 mg, more preferably 0.1 to 4 mg. When the average weight is excessively small, it is necessary to use a special production method. When the average weight is excessively large, on the other hand, there is a possibility that the expanded beads obtained therefrom have a broad density distribution and cannot be filled in a mold cavity in an efficient manner at the time of molding. The shape of the resin particles may be, for example, a cylindrical column, a sphere, a rectangular column, an oval sphere or a cylinder. Expanded beads obtained by foaming and expanding the resin particles have a shape that is similar to that of the resin particles before expansion.</p>
    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Before initiating the resin particle producing step, it is preferable to dry the PLA resin for reasons of prevention of degradation of the PLA resin by hydrolysis. In order to suppress degradation of the PLA resin by hydrolysis, a method using an extruder provided with a vent hole may also be adopted so that moisture is removed from the PLA resin by evacuation through the vent hole. The removal of moisture from the PLA resin may permit the prevention of the generation of bubbles in the resin particles and may improve the stability of the extrusion process.</p>
    <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In the dispersing medium release foaming method, resin particles are dispersed in a dispersing medium, such as, water in a pressure resisting vessel, such as an autoclave, to which a blowing agent is fed under a pressure in a predetermined amount. The dispersion is then stirred at an elevated temperature for a predetermined time to impregnate the blowing agent into the resin particles to obtain foamable resin particles. The resin particles in the softened state and the dispersing medium in the vessel are then released from the high temperature and high pressure vessel into a lower temperature and lower pressure atmosphere to obtain the expanded beads. At the time of the release, it is preferred that the contents in the vessel are discharged while applying a back pressure to the space in the vessel.</p>
    <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">An additive may be previously incorporated into the resin particles for the purpose of controlling the apparent density and cell diameter of the obtained expanded beads. Examples of the additive include an inorganic powder such as talc, calcium carbonate, borax, zinc borate, aluminum hydroxide and silica, and a polymer such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene wax, polypropylene wax, polycarbonate and crosslinked polystyrene. Among the above additives, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyolefin wax and crosslinked polystyrene are preferred. Particularly preferred is hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene powder and polyethylene wax.</p>
    <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The additive may be kneaded as such together with the PLA resin in the pelletization step. For reasons of improved dispersibility, however, it is preferred that the additive is formed into a master batch and the master batch is then kneaded with the PLA resin.</p>
    <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Since the apparent density and cell diameter of the expanded beads vary depending upon the blending amount of the additive, it is expected that the additive has an effect of controlling these properties. The amount of the additive is generally 0.001 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0.005 to 3 parts by weight, more preferably 0.01 to 2 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the PLA resin. Within such a range, it is possible to reduce the apparent density (to increase the expansion ratio) and to uniformize the cell diameter of the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Since the PLA resin is easily hydrolyzed, the additive to be blended with the PLA resin is desired to be selected from hydrophobic substances while avoiding the use of a hydrophilic substance as much as possible. Thus, when a hydrophobic additive is used, it is possible to obtain an effect of the additive while preventing degradation of the PLA resin due to hydrolysis.</p>
    <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The high temperature peak of the expanded beads preferably has an endothermic calorific value of 5 to 20 J/g. The calorific value may be adjusted within the above range during the course of the blowing agent impregnation step in which the resin particles placed within a pressure resisting vessel are heated at a temperature at which crystals thereof are not completely melted. The heat treatment is carried out by holding the resin particles at a specific temperature and for a specific period of time as described below. The temperature at which the high temperature peak is allowed to develop is generally in the range from [melting point minus 30°C] to [melting point minus 10°C] where the melting point is that of the PLA resin of which the resin particles are formed, although the temperature varies depending upon the kind of the blowing agent and the aimed apparent density of the expanded beads. The heat treatment time is generally 5 to 60 minutes, preferably 5 to 30 minutes. Too long a heat treatment time may cause hydrolysis of the PLA resin and is not preferred. Thus, the resin particles are preferably held in the above temperature range for at least 5 minutes in order for the high temperature peak to develop in the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">When particularly low apparent density (high expansion ratio) expanded beads are to be produced, there may be adopted so-called two-step expansion in which expanded beads produced in the above method are aged in an atmospheric pressure in the customarily employed manner, then charged again in a pressure resisting vessel and subjected to a pressurizing treatment (bead internal pressure increasing treatment) using a pressurized gas such as air so that the internal pressure of the expanded beads is increased to 0.01 to 0.10 MPa(G) and, finally, heated in the expansion vessel with a heating medium, such as hot wind, steam or a mixture of steam and air, to obtain the desired expanded beads with a high expansion ratio.</p>
    <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In the production of expanded beads, the foaming temperature is preferably between (melting point minus 10°C) to (melting point minus 30°C), more preferably between (melting point minus 15°C) to (melting point minus 25°C), where the melting point is that of the PLA resin. When the foaming temperature is excessively low, it is difficult to obtain expanded beads with a low apparent density. When excessively high, on the other hand, shrinkage of the expanded beads is apt to occur and, thus, there is a possibility that the mechanical properties of molded articles obtained by in-mold molding of the obtained beads are deteriorated.</p>
    <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">A dispersing agent or a dispersing aid may be added to the dispersing medium, if necessary, when dispersing the resin particles in the dispersing medium. Examples of the dispersing agent include inorganic substances such as aluminum oxide, tribasic calcium phosphate, magnesium pyrophosphate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, basic magnesium carbonate, basic zinc carbonate, calcium carbonate, kaolin, mica and clay; and water soluble polymer protective colloid agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and methyl cellulose. The dispersing medium may also be incorporated with a dispersing aid such as an anionic surfactant, e.g. sodium dodecylbenzenesulonate and sodium alkanesulfonate.</p>
    <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The dispersing agent may be used in an amount of 0.05 to 3 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles, while the dispersing aid may be used in an amount of 0.001 to 0.3 part by weight per 100 parts by weight of the resin particles.</p>
    <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">As the physical blowing agent, there may be used, for example, organic physical blowing agents such as hydrocarbons (e.g. butane, pentane and hexane), alicyclic hydrocarbon and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g. 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene, 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene, trans-1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoropropene), ether such as diethyl ether, alcohol such as methanol and inorganic physical blowing agents such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, air and water. These physical blowing agents may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof. Among the physical blowing agents, those which are composed mainly of an inorganic physical blowing agent such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and air are preferably used. Carbon dioxide is particularly preferred. The term "physical blowing agent composed mainly of an inorganic physical blowing agent" as used herein is intended to refer to a physical blowing agent which contains at least 50% by mole, preferably at least 70% by mole, more preferably at least 90% by mole, of an inorganic physical blowing agent in 100% by mole of the total physical blowing agent.</p>
    <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092"> The amount of the physical blowing agent is determined as appropriate in consideration of the kind of the blowing agent, amount of the additives, the apparent density of the desired expanded beads, etc. For example, the inorganic physical blowing agent is used in an amount of about 0.1 to 30 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 15 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the PLA resin.</p>
    <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">The molded article of the present invention may be produced by using conventional in-mold molding device. It is not necessary to perform procedures for increasing the secondary expansion performance of the expanded beads. Namely, by utilizing the secondary expansion suppressing effect that is given to the expanded beads showing a high temperature peak, the desired molded article may be easily produced by in-mold molding, without need of a bead internal pressure increasing treatment and without greatly increasing the amount of the expanded beads introduced into the mold cavity. For example, when a cracking molding method is adopted for producing a molded article having a voidage of 5 to 45%, the expanded beads showing a high temperature peak are fed, without a bead internal pressure increasing treatment, to the cavity of the mold having a relatively low degree of cracking so that the compression percentage of the expanded beads is preferably 20% or less, still more preferably 10% or less, more preferably 5% or less. As used herein the term "compression percentage" refers to a value calculated from the formula: <maths id="maths-00010-en" num=""><math display="block"><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Compression percentage</mi><mspace width="1em" /><mfenced><mo>%</mo></mfenced><mo>=</mo><mn mathvariant="normal">100</mn><mo>×</mo><mfenced separators=""><mfenced separators=""><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></mrow></msub></mfenced><mo>/</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi></mrow><mrow><mn mathvariant="normal">0</mn></mrow></msub></mfenced></mrow></math><img id="img-00010-en" wi="100" he="6" img-content="math" file="imgb0010.tif" img-format="tif" /></maths> wherein V<sub>0</sub> is a volume of the molded article and V<sub>1</sub> is a bulk volume of the expanded beads supplied to the mold cavity.</p>
    <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">As the generally preferably adopted in-mold molding method, there may be mentioned a batch-type in-mold molding method in which expanded beads are filled in a mold cavity of a conventional mold for thermoplastic resin expanded beads adapted to be heated and cooled and to be opened and closed. A heating medium such as steam or a mixture of steam and air is then fed to the mold cavity to heat the expanded beads and to expand and fuse bond the expanded beads together. The obtained molded article is then cooled and taken out of the mold cavity. In the production of molded articles having a voidage of 8 to 45%, steam having a lower vapor pressure than that generally employed in the ordinary in-mold molding, is suitably used. Namely, steam having a saturation vapor pressure of 0.01 to 0.15 MPa(G), preferably 0.01 to 0.10 MPa(G), is preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">The feed of the steam may be carried out by a conventional method such as a combination of one-direction flow heating, reversed one-direction flow heating and both-direction flow heating. The particularly preferred heating method includes preheating, one-direction flow heating, reversed one-direction flow heating and both-direction flow heating which are successively performed in this order.</p>
    <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">The molded article of the present invention which is constituted of biodegradable expanded beads and which has void spaces formed between the expanded beads, is useful as a plastic article in various fields such as automobile, construction and civil engineering, and may be suitably used in various applications such as sound proof materials, water permeable materials, cushioning materials and core materials of FRP.</p>

    <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">Meanwhile, the PLA resin of the core layer contained 1,000 ppm by weight of polytetrafluoroethylene powder (Trade name: TFW-1000, manufactured by Seishin Enterprise Co., Ld.) as a cell controlling agent and 1.5% by weight of a carbodiimide compound (bis(dipropylphenyl)carbodiimide, Stabaxol 1-LF produced by Rhein Chemie) as an end capping agent. The cell controlling agent and end capping agent were mixed into the PLA resin in the form of a master batch. The PLA resin of the outer layer contained 1.5% by weight of a carbodiimide compound (bis(dipropylphenyl)carbodiimide, Stabaxol 1-LF produced by Rhein Chemie) as an end capping agent. The end capping agent was mixed into the PLA resin in the form of a master batch.</p>
    <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">The MFR, glass transition temperature and melting point of the resin particles are shown in Table 2.</p>
    <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Using the thus obtained resin particles, expanded beads were prepared. First, 1 kg of the obtained resin particles were charged in a 5 L pressure resisting vessel (autoclave) equipped with a stirrer together with 3 L of water as a dispersing medium, to which 1 g of aluminum oxide as a dispersing agent and 0.1 g (as effective amount) of a surfactant (sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate, Trade name: Neogen S-20F, manufactured by Dai-ichi Kogyou Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) were added. The contents in the vessel were then heated with stirring to the foaming temperature shown in Table 2. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a blowing agent was then injected into the pressure resisting vessel until the pressure within the pressure resisting vessel reached the value shown in Table 2. After having been allowed to stand at the foaming temperature for 15 minutes, the contents were released from the pressure resisting vessel (inside temperature and pressure of the vessel were the foaming temperature and the inside pressure shown in Table 2, respectively) to the atmospheric having an ambient temperature and an ambient pressure while applying a back pressure with carbon dioxide to maintain the pressure within the vessel at constant, whereby expanded beads having an apparent density as shown in Table 2 were obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">DSC analysis of the obtained expanded beads revealed that the expanded beads obtained in Examples 1 to 9 and Comparative Example 2 each had a crystal structure that showed an intrinsic peak and a high temperature peak on the first heating run on DSC curve (I) thereof. The expanded beads obtained in Comparative Example 1 had a crystal structure that showed only an intrinsic peak on the first heating run DSC curve (I).</p>
    <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Physical properties of the thus obtained expanded beads such as various calorific values, apparent density, closed cell content, average cell diameter, were measured and evaluated. The results are shown in Table 2. <tables id="tables-00002-en" num="0002"><img id="img-00011-en" wi="146" he="199" img-content="table" file="EP2940070A1_00013.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0011.tif" /></tables><tables id="tables-00003-en" num="0003"><img id="img-00012-en" wi="149" he="198" img-content="table" file="EP2940070A1_00014.PNG" img-format="png" original="imgb0012.tif" /></tables></p>
    <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Next, molded articles were prepared using the expanded beads obtained in the foregoing Examples and Comparative Examples. The expanded beads obtained were placed and compressed in the compression percentage shown in table 3 as such (without being subjected to an inside pressure imparting treatment) in a cavity of the flat plank mold having a length of 200 mm, a width of 250 mm and a thickness of 50 mm and in-mold molded by steam heating to obtain molded articles in the form of a plank having interconnected void spaces between the expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">The heating with steam was performed as follows. Steam with a source pressure of 0.6 MPa(G) was fed to the mold for 5 seconds for preheating in such a state that drain valves on both stationary and moveable mold sides were maintained in an open state (purging step). Next, while maintaining the drain valve on the stationary mold side in an open state and the drain valve on the moveable mold side in a closed state, steam with a source pressure of 0.3 MPa(G) was fed from the moveable mold side for 3 seconds. Then, while maintaining the drain valve on the moveable mold in an open state and the drain valve on the stationary mold side in a closed state, steam with a source pressure of 0.3 MPa(G) was fed from the stationary mold side for 3 seconds. Thereafter, with drain valves kept closed, steam at the heating steam pressure (molding vapor pressure) shown in Table 3 was fed to the mold to heat the expanded beads for 8 seconds. After completion of the heating, cooling with water was carried out until a surface pressure attributed to the expanding force of the molded article was reduced to 0.01 MPa(G). The molds were then opened and the molded product was taken out therefrom. The molded product was aged for drying in an oven at 40°C for 15 hours, then aged for heat treatment in another oven at 70°C for 15 hours, and thereafter allowed to gradually cool to room temperature to obtain a molded article having interconnected void spaces between the fuse-bonded expanded beads.</p>
    <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Each of the thus prepared molded articles were evaluated for their various physical properties including bulk density, shrinkage, reproducibility of the shape of the mold cavity, voidage, flexural strength, and 50% compression stress. The results are summarized in Table 3. <tables id="tables-00004-en" num="0004"><table frame="all"><title>Table 3</title><tgroup cols="12"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="65mm" /><colspec
