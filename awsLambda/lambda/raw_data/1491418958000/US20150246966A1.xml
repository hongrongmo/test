      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a relatively common condition characterized by inadequate tear film protection of the cornea. Dry eye symptoms have traditionally been managed with eyelid hygiene, topical antibiotics (erythromycin or bacitracin ointments), oral tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, or minocycline), anti-inflammatory compounds (cyclosporine) and corticosteroids which are often time consuming, frustrating, and frequently ineffective or variably effective treatments.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Tens of millions of people (mostly women) are affected worldwide by dry eye. 10 million people in US are affected with severe dry eyes with more than 3.2 million women and 1.6 million men above the age of 50 years being affected by dry eye in the US. DED is a potentially disabling disease adversely impacting the vision-related quality of life. It leads to ocular discomfort, a degradation in visual performance (reading speed, contrast sensitivity) and a loss of productivity. Current therapeutic options are limited and costly. Topical cyclosporine-A (RestasisÂ®) is the only approved treatment for DED in US. Despite the high incidence of DED, there is currently no consistently effective treatment for this condition and it still remains a therapeutic challenge. As such, there is a need for new therapeutic modalities to treat DED.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention discloses a novel method for the treatment of dry eye disease in humans comprising local application of an anti-lymphangiogenic agent onto the ocular surface. The present invention is based on novel evidence for the selective growth of lymphatic vessels in DED cornea. Additionally, significant increase in both caliber and extent of lymphatics in DED corneas is accompanied by over expression of lymphangiogenic receptor VEGFR-3, further correlating DED with lymphangiogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">An anti-lymphangiogenic agent of the invention is selected from the group consisting of: a nucleic acid molecule, an aptamer, an antisense molecule, an RNAi molecule, a protein, a peptide, a cyclic peptide, an antibody or antibody fragment, a polysaccharide, and a small molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is an inhibitor of VEGF-C or VEGF-D mediated signal transduction by VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3. Preferably, the amount of the anti-lymphangiogenic agent employed is effective to inhibit the binding of VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D ligand to VEGFR-3 or the stimulatory effect of VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D on VEGFR-3.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one aspect of the invention, the inhibitor of VEGF-C or VEGF-D mediated signal transduction by VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 is a molecule such as but not restricted to an antibody, a small molecule or a peptide that prevents binding of VEGF-C or VEGF-D to the receptors VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another aspect of the invention, the inhibitor of VEGF-C or VEGF-D mediated signal transduction is a VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 soluble receptor. Soluble receptors of VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 can be administered directly. Alternatively, increase in the secretion of VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 is accomplished by inserting the VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3 soluble receptors genes into the genome of corneal cells. This could be epithelial cells, keratocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or bone marrow-derived cells. Methods to introduce genes into a genome of a cell are well-known in the art. Genes are introduced in the genome of corneal cells using viral or non-viral vectors. Viral vectors include for example adenoviruses, retroviruses or lentiviruses. Non-viral vectors include, for example, liposomes such as cationic lipids, nanoparticles, lipoplexes and polyplexes (complexes of polymers with DNA).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In some embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is a VEGF-C antibody, wherein the antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region set forth in amino acids 1-118 of SEQ ID NO: 34 or a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 34. In some embodiments, the EGF-C antibody is selected from the group consisting of antibodies 69D09, 103, MM0006-2E65 and 193208.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In alternative embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of antibody 69D09 to VEGF-C.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is a VEGF-D antibody selected from the group consisting of antibodies 2F8, 4A5(VD1), 4E10, 5F12, 4H4, 3C10 28AT743.288.48, MM0001-7E79, RM0007-8C35, 78902, 78939 and 90409.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In some embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is a human or humanized antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In other embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is a soluble VEGFR-3 fragment that binds VEGF-C or VEGF-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In still other embodiments, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is a VEGFR-2 inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In one embodiment of the invention, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is administered in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent such as, but not limited to, a composition inhibiting the activity of an inflammatory cytokine selected from the group comprising IL-1,IL-17, TNF-a and IL-6.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Exemplary functional blockers of IL-1 are described in WO/2009/025763. Exemplary functional blockers of TNF-a include, but are not limited to, recombinant and/or soluble TNF-a receptors, monoclonal antibodies, and small molecule antagonists and/or inverse agonists. One or more commercially-available TNF-a blocking agents are reformulated for topical administration in this embodiment. Exemplary commercial TNF-a blocking agents used for reformulation include, but are not limited to, etanerept/Ernbrel, infliximab/Remicade, and adalimumab/Humira.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In one embodiment of the invention, the anti-lymphangiogenic agent is administered in combination with an antiobiotic. Exemplary antibiotic compositions used for combination-therapy with antagonists of IL-mediated inflammation include but are not limited to, amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clarithromycin, dirithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, troleandomycin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azlocillin, carbenicillin, clozacillin, dicloxacillin, flucozacillin, meziocillin, nafcillin, penicillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, bacitracin, colistin, polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, oflazacin, trovafloxacin, mafenide, sulfacetamide, sulfamethizole, sulfasalazine, sulfisoxazole, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, demeclocycline, soxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline, or tetracycline.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The composition of the invention is locally applied to the ocular tissue, alternatively the composition of the invention is applied to the eyelids, the ocular surface, the meibomian glands or the lacrimal glands.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The composition can be in the form of a solid, a paste, an ointment, a gel, a liquid, an aerosol, a mist, a polymer, a film, an emulsion, or a suspension.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Optionally, the composition further contains a compound selected from the group consisting of a physiological acceptable salt, poloxamer analogs with carbopol, carbopol/hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (RP MC), carbopol-methyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hyaluronic acid, cyclodextrin, and petroleum.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Dry eye disease may be attributable to a number of factors, and treatment of subjects who have developed dry eye disease due to a variety of specific factors is contemplated. In some variations, the DED to be treated is DED caused by any condition other than an alloimmune response. Alloimmune responses may result, for example, in some corneal transplant patients. More specifically, in some variations, the DED to be treated is an autoimmune DED or a DED associated with Sjogren's syndrome. In some variations, the DED is due to excessively fast tear evaporation (evaporative dry eyes) or inadequate tear production. In some variations, the dry eye disease is attributable to one or more causes selected from: aging, contact lens usage and medication usage. In some variations, the dry eye disease is a complication of LASIK refractive surgery. In other variations, the DED arises in a subject who has not had eye surgery of any kind, e.g., treatment of subjects in whom the DED is caused by LASIK surgery, corneal transplant surgery, or other ocular surgeries.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Dry Eye</heading>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), also called keratitis sicca, sicca syndrome, xerophthalmia, dry eye syndrome (DES),or simply dry eyes, is an eye disease caused by decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation commonly found in humans and some animals. Typical symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis are dryness, burning and a sandygritty eye irritation that gets worse as the day goes on.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is characterized by inadequate tear film protection of the cornea because of either inadequate tear production or abnormal tear film constitution, which results in excessively fast evaporation or premature destruction of the tear film. The tear film is constituted by 3 layers: (1) a lipid layer, produced by the Meibomian glands; (2) an aqueous layer, produced by the main and accessory lacrimal glands; and (3) a hydrophilic mucin layer, produced by the conjunctival goblet cells. Any abnormality of 1 of the 3 layers produces an unstable tear film and symptoms of keratitis sicca.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Sjogren's syndrome and autoimmune diseases associated with Sjogren's syndrome are also conditions associated with aqueous tear deficiency. Drugs such as isotretinoin, sedatives, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, nasal decongestants, beta-blockers, phenothiazines, atropine, and pain relieving opiates such as morphine can cause or worsen this condition. Infiltration of the lacrimal glands by sarcoidosis or tumors, or postradiation fibrosis of the lacrimal glands can also cause this condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can also be caused by abnormal tear composition resulting in rapid evaporation or premature destruction of the tears. When caused by rapid evaporation, it is termed evaporative dry eyes. In this, although the tear gland produces a sufficient amount of tears, the rate of evaporation of the tears is too rapid. There is a loss of water from the tears that results in tears that are too âsaltyâ or hypertonic. As a result, the entire conjunctiva and cornea cannot be kept covered with a complete layer of tears during certain activities or in certain environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Aging is one of the most common causes of dry eyes. About half of all people who wear contact lenses complain of dry eyes. There are two potential connections between contact lens usage and dry eye. Traditionally, it has been believed that soft contact lenses, which float on the tear film that covers the cornea, absorb the tears in the eyes. However, it is also now known that contact lens usage damages corneal nerve sensitivity, which may lead to decreased lacrimal gland tear production and dry eye. The effect of contact lenses on corneal nerve sensitivity is well established for hard contact lenses as well as soft and rigid gas permeable contact lenses. The connection between this loss in nerve sensitivity and tear production is the subject of current research. Dry eyes also occur or get worse after LASIK and other refractive surgeries. The corneal nerves stimulate tear secretion. Dry eyes caused by these procedures usually resolves after several months. Persons who are thinking about refractive surgery should consider this.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A variety of approaches can be taken to treat dry eyes. These can be summarized as: avoidance of exacerbating factors, tear stimulation and supplementation, increasing tear retention, eyelid cleansing and treatment of eye inflammation. Application of artificial tears every few hours can provide temporary relief. Inflammation occurring in response to tears film hypertonicity can be suppressed by mild topical steroids or with topical immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine. Consumption of dark-fleshed fish containing dietary omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a decreased incidence of dry eyes syndrome in women. Early experimental work on omega-3 has shown promising results when used in a topical application (Rashid S et al (2008). Arch Ophthalmo1126 (2): 219-225).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">DED is increasingly recognized as an immune-mediated disorder. Desiccating stress in DED initiates an immune-based inflammation response that is sustained by the ongoing interplay between the ocular surface and various pathogenic immune cells, primarily the CD4+ cells in the conjunctivia and the CD11b+ monocytic cells in the corneal. Desiccating stress induces secretion of inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1, TNF-a and IL-6 by ocular tissues, which facilitates the activation and migration of resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) toward the regional draining lymph nodes (LNs). In the LNs, these APCs stimulate naive T-cells, leading to the expansion of IL-17 secreting Th17 cells and interferon (IFN)-y-secreting Th1 cells. Once these effectors are generated in the LNs, they migrate to the ocular surface and secrete effector cytokines.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">VEGF</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is a sub-family of growth factors, specifically the platelet-derived growth factor family of cystine-knot growth factors. They are important signaling proteins involved in both vasculogenesis (the de novo formation of the embryonic circulatory system) and angiogenesis (the growth of blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature). Members of the platelet-derived growth factor family include the Placenta growth factor (PIGF), VEGF-A (also known as VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGF-E.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGF-D exert their effects by variously binding to and activating structurally related membrane receptor tyrosine kinases; VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1 or Flt-I), VEGFR-2 (flk-1 or KDR), and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). Members of the VEGF family may also interact with the structurally distinct receptor neuropilin-1. Binding of a VEGF to these receptors initiates a signaling cascade, resulting in effects on gene expression and cell survival, proliferation, and migration.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">VEGF-A binds to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and to VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). VEGFR-2 appears to mediate almost all of the known cellular responses to VEGF-A. The function of VEGFR-1 is less well-defined, although it is thought to modulate VEGFR-2 signaling. VEGF-A is believed to play a central role in the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the survival of immature blood vessels (vascular maintenance).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">VEGF-C and VEGF-D are ligands for VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 and are involved in the mediation of lymphangiogenesis.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Lymphangiogenesis</heading>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Lymphangiogenesis refers to formation of lymphatic vessels, particularly from pre-existing lymphatic vessels, but as used herein, the term applies to formation of lymph vessels under any condition. It also applies to the enlargement of lymphatic vessels, commonly known as lymphatic hyperplasia. Lymphangiogenesis plays an important physiological role in homeostasis, metabolism and immunity. Lymphatic vessel formation has also been implicated in a number of pathological conditions including neoplasm metastasis, oedema, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and impaired wound healing.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The normal human cornea is avascular, thus suppressing the afferent lymphatic and efferent vascular arms or the immune cycle. Inflammation however negates this immune and angiogenic privileged state of the cornea and giving the corneal and ocular surface the potential to mount an immune response. Our results show that corneal lymphatics play an important role in mediating the corneal inflammation in dry eyes. Inhibition of corneal lymphangiogenesis decreases ocular surface inflammation in a well characterized mouse model of DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Lymphangiogenesis is regulated to a large extent by VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Lymphangiogenesis appears to be regulated by signaling mediated by VEGFR-3, particularly upon specifically binding its ligands, VEGF-C and VEGF-D. VEGF-C and VEGF-D are two of six members of a family of angiogenic regulators. Other members are VEGF-A (also known as VEGF), VEGF-B, VEGF-E and placental growth factor (P1GF).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">During embryogenesis, lymphatic endothelial cell sprouting, proliferation and survival is promoted by VEGF-C. Lymphatic vessels fail to develop in mice in which VEGF-C is absent (Vegfc knockout mice), and such mice develop severe edema. Indeed, absence of VEGF-C is embryonic lethal. Lymphatic vessel hypoplasia and lymphedema is exhibited in the skin of mice hemizygous for Vegfc (i.e. mice possessing one functional allele).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Lymphangiogenesis is also partly regulated by VEGF-D, similar to VEGF-C. However, lymphangiogenesis during embryonic development is not dependent upon VEGF-D, as demonstrated by Vegfd knockout mice. The lymphatic system in Vegfd knockout mice is relatively normal and Vegfd knockout mice are viable and fertile. The absolute abundance of lymphatic vessels in the lung is, however, reduced by approximately 30% compared to wild-type mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Lymphatic vessels express VEGFR-3, the receptor for VEGF-C and VEGF-D, and both VEGF-C and VEGF-D signal predominantly through VEGFR-3. It is also becoming apparent that lymphatic vessels variously express VEGFR-2. VEGF-C and VEGF-D are synthesized as prepro-polypeptides and are proteolytically processed by proprotein convertases. In humans, mature proteolytically processed forms of VEGF-C and VEGF-D bind to VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. In mice, mature VEGF-D binding is restricted to VEGFR-3.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">VEGF-C and VEGF-D exist as homodimers, and it has been suggested that they may exist as VEGF-C-VEGF-D heterodimers. In addition to lymphatic vessels, VEGFR-3 is also expressed on blood vessel endothelial cells during development, thereby accounting for the severe vasculogenic and angiogenic defects observed during early embryogenesis in models comprising inactive VEGFR-3 signaling. The lymphatic system possesses almost exclusive expression of VEGFR-3 in healthy tissues in adulthood, because VEGFR-3 expression in blood vessels declines following birth and during adolescence. Thus, only lymphangiogenesis is inhibited in adults by inhibition of the VEGF-C-VEGF-D-VEGFR-3 signaling axis.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Lymphatic vessels express neuropilin-2 (NRP-2), which can bind VEGF-C or VEGF-D. In lymphangiogenesis, NRP-2 is thought to act as a co-receptor to increase the binding affinity of VEGF-C or VEGF-D to VEGFR-3. NRP-2 is required for lymphangiogenesis. Proliferation of lymphatic vessel endothelial cells was reduced and lymphatic vessels and capillaries failed to develop in Nrp2 knockout mice in which NRP-2 is absent. Similarly, NRP-1 is capable of binding VEGF-C and VEGF-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Defective lymphatic capillaries are the underlying cause of Milroy disease and other rare hereditary forms of lymphedema in humans. Tyrosine kinase-inactivating point mutations of the VEGFR-3 gene have been identified as a major cause of Milroy disease, and VEGF-C and VEGF-D therapy has shown promising efficacy in preclinical animal models. However, previous work has only demonstrated lymphatic capillary reconstitution, whereas effects on the collecting lymphatic vessels that are more commonly damaged in lymphedema have not been addressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Lymphatic vessel growth in adult tissues can be induced by Angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1) through its binding to the tunica interna endothelial cell kinase receptor 2 (TIE-2 or TEK). Lymphatic vessel sprouting that was induced by ANG-1 was inhibited by an inhibitor of VEGFR-3. Furthermore, VEGFR-3 was up-regulated by ANG-1 binding to TIE-2. TIE-2 expressed on lymphatic vascular endothelial cells may also be agonized by ANG-2 and ANG-3.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">VEGF-C and VEGF-D may act as ligands for integrins. Specifically, VEGF-C and VEGF-D have been shown to act as ligands for integrin Î±9Î²1. Cell adherence and cell migration were promoted by each of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in cells expressing integrin â¡9â¡1. The effect could be blocked by an anti-integrin Î±9Î²1 antibody or siRNA directed to integrin Î±9Î²1.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Thus, in lymphangiogenesis, VEGFR-3 appears to be central. VEGFR-3 specifically binds and is activated by ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D. VEGF-C and VEGF-D are synthesized as prepro-polypeptides and are activated by proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases. VEGF-C and VEGF-D also bind specifically to NRP-2, which is thought to be a co-receptor for VEGFR-3. Both lymphangiogenesis and VEGFR-3 are up-regulated when ANG-1 specifically binds to TIE-2. It is thought that binding of VEGF-C or VEGF-D to integrins, particularly integrin Î±9Î²1, also performs a role in lymphangiogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Lymphangiogenesis is mediated primarily by the interaction of growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D on VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3, and in particular VEGFR-3. VEGF-A also contributes, albeit indirectly, to lymphangiogenesis by recruiting VEGF-C and VEGF-D secreting macrophages. Inhibition of VEGF-C and VEGF-D signaling pathways would thus constitute a new approach to the treatment of DED. The invention is however not restricted to the inhibition of VEGF-C and VEGF-D signaling pathways and according to the present invention, other anti-lymphangiogenic agents can be used to reduce the signs and symptoms of DED.</p>

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Persons skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing that inhibition of lymphangiogenesis can occur at a variety of biological points comprising any one or more of the interactions described. For example, inhibition may occur by targeting VEGF-D, VEGF-C or VEGFR-3.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">An âanti-lymphangiogenic agentâ is any substance that partially or fully blocks, neutralizes, reduces, inhibits or antagonizes a biological activity of a molecular component of signaling mediated by VEGFR-3 or lymphangiogenesis. Alternatively, an anti-lymphangiogenic agent is any substance that partially or fully blocks, neutralizes, reduces, inhibits or antagonizes a VEGF-C or VEGF-D biological activity. Thus, âinhibitionâ is the corresponding state elicited by an inhibitor. A molecular component of signaling mediated by VEGFR-3 or lymphangiogenesis includes VEGFR-3, VEGFR-2, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, proprotein convertases, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), neuropilin-2 (NRP-2), angiopoietin-1 (ANG-1), tunica interna endothelial cell kinase receptor (TIE-2) or integrin Î±9Î²1.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">It is envisaged that practice of the invention extends to any inhibitor known now or in the future.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Suitable classes of inhibitor molecules that target VEGF-C or VEGF-D or signaling mediated by VEGFR-3, or lymphangiogenesis include antibodies, polypeptides, peptides, peptide mimetics, nucleic acid molecules, and small molecules. Such classes of inhibitor molecules are suitable also for inhibiting binding of ligands, for example VEGF-C or VEGF-D, to integrins, particularly integrin Î±9Î²1.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Suitable VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis antibody inhibitors include antagonist and neutralizing antibodies or antibody fragments.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Polypeptide, peptide, or peptide mimetic VEGF-C or VEGF-D inhibitors, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling inhibitors or lymphangiogenesis inhibitors include fragments or amino acid sequence variants of native polypeptide or peptide components of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Nucleic acid molecule inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis include antisense molecules, nucleic acids in triple-helix formation, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and ribozymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Small molecule inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis include organic and inorganic molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis according to the present invention may exert their effects by interacting with any one or more of VEGFR-3, VEGFR-2, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, proprotein convertases, NRP-1, NRP-2, ANG-1, TIE-2 or integrins, particularly integrin a9131, in their DNA, RNA or polypeptide forms.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Inhibition of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis according to the present invention may occur via inhibition of ligand availability for receptor binding, inhibition of receptor availability for ligand binding, inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase activity, or inhibition of co-receptor interaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">As used herein, âavailabilityâ refers to the potential or actual amount of a molecule that performs some function in VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis and is present in a biological system. Availability may be relative or absolute. For example, if all copies of a gene encoding a polypeptide involved in lymphangiogenesis were rendered non-functional by genetic mutation and no functioning polypeptide was synthesized, then there would be no availability of the polypeptide in an absolute sense. Alternatively, if the same gene was present with one functioning copy and 50% of the polypeptide was synthesized, there would be reduced or inhibited availability in a relative sense. Similarly, other mechanisms may be envisaged where availability is affected. Receptors may be transcribed or translated to a lesser degree when compared with a control, or the receptor may be targeted by an antibody that binds specifically to the ligand binding site, thereby reducing or inhibiting receptor availability for ligand binding. Analogously, if ligand synthesis is targeted by an antisense inhibitor, or if an antibody inhibitor or soluble receptor inhibitor specifically binds to the ligand, then there will be reduction or inhibition of ligand availability for receptor binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The term âspecific bindingâ or âspecifically bindsâ or âspecific forâ refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. Such binding is measurably different from a non-specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule, which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. As used herein, specific binding is used in relation to the interaction between the molecular components of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. Specific binding is also used in relation to the interaction between the molecular components of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis and agents that partially or fully block, neutralize, reduce or antagonize a biological activity of a molecule that facilitates VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. Specific binding also applies to the interaction between the molecular components of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity and agents that partially or fully block, neutralize, reduce or antagonize VEGF-C or VEGF-D biological activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In particular, specific binding refers to a molecule having a K<sub>d </sub>at least 2-fold less for the particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide than it does for a non-specific target. Preferably, specific binding refers to a molecule having a Kd at least 4-fold, 6-fold, 8-fold or 10-foldless for the particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide than it does for a non-specific target. Alternatively, specific binding can be expressed as a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10<sup>â4 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â5 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>'6 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â7 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â8 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â9 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â10 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â11 </sup>M, alternatively at least about 10<sup>â12 </sup>M, or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The person skilled in the art will appreciate that there exist many mechanisms for inhibiting VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. The principal aim is to reduce receptor signaling. Some examples will be described below, but such a list is not intended to be limiting.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Antibody Inhibitors</heading>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The term âantibodyâ is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (including antagonist and neutralizing antibodies), antibody compositions with polyepitopic specificity, single chain antibodies, and fragments of antibodies, provided that they exhibit the desired biological or immunological activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">An âantibody inhibitorâ will specifically bind to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. Such binding will partially or fully block, neutralize, reduce or antagonize VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity or a biological activity of a molecule that facilitates VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. Such target molecules include VEGFR-3, VEGFR-2, VEGF-C and VEGF-D, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">An âisolated antibodyâ is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or non-proteinaceous solutes. Generally, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. An isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Where antibody fragments are used, the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Polyclonal Antibodies</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen (especially when synthetic peptides are used) to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example, the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor, using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, e.g., maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R<sup>1</sup>NâCâNR, where R and R<sup>1 </sup>are different alkyl groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In one protocol for generating polyclonal antibodies, animals are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugate, or derivative, by combining the antigen, conjugate or derivative with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later, the animals are boosted with â to 1/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Monoclonal Antibodies</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier âmonoclonalâ is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method in which a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization, lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium, which preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells (also referred to as fusion partner).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity are identified, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g., by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as, for example, affinity chromatography (e.g., using protein A or protein G-Sepharose) or ion-exchange chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, or dialysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures. The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into host cells such as E. coli cells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein, to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries. High affinity (nM range) human antibodies can be generated by chain shuffling, as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries. Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides. The monoclonal antibodies used herein include âchimericâ antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Human and Humanized Antibodies</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The anti-VEGF-C, anti-VEGF-D, anti-VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or anti-lymphangiogenesis antibodies used in the invention may comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Generally, a âhumanized antibodyâ is an antibody of non-human origin that has been modified using recombinant DNA techniques to circumvent the problem of a human's immune system reacting to an antibody as a foreign antigen. The standard procedure of producing monoclonal antibodies produces mouse antibodies. Although murine antibodies are very similar to human ones, there are differences. Consequently, the human immune system recognizes mouse antibodies as foreign, rapidly removing them from circulation and causing systemic inflammatory effects. âHumanizedâ forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain a reduced percentage of sequence derived from the non-human antibody. Various forms of humanized anti-VEGF-C, anti-VEGF-D, anti-VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or anti-lymphangiogenesis antibodies are contemplated. Humanized antibodies may be intact antibodies, such as intact IgG<sub>1 </sub>antibodies, antibody chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies). Humanized antibodies include human antibodies (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework residues of the human antibody are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human antibody and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human antibody consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an antibody constant region (Fc), typically that of a human antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Various humanization strategies have been described in the prior art and it is envisaged that practice of the invention extends to the use of both known humanization strategies and any new strategies to be developed in the future. Examples of known humanization strategies include those described by Studnicka (U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,619) and Padlan (1991, Molec. Immunol., 28, 489-498), Winter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,539) and Jones et al (1986, Nature, 321, 522-525), Queen et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761) and Foote (U.S. Pat. No. 6,881,557).</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated. For example, it is now possible to produce transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable, upon immunization, of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats. Several sources of V-gene segments can be used for phage display.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Antibody Fragments</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">âAntibody fragmentsâ comprise a portion of an antibody, preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. . Antibody fragments of particular interest are fragments that retain antigen-binding properties of the whole antibody, and are useful as inhibitors for practicing the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments, called âFabâ fragments, and a residual âFcâ fragment, a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen binding activity and is still capable of cross linking antigen. Fabâ² fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional residues at the carboxy terminus of the C<sub>H</sub>1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fabâ²-SH is the designation herein for Fabâ² in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fabâ² fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">âFvâ is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable region domain in tight, non covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">âSingle chain Fvâ abbreviated as âscFvâ are antibody fragments that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments, rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance from the circulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies. However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab, Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from E. coli, thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries. Alternatively, Fabâ²-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragments. According to another approach, F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>fragment with increased in vivo half-life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues also may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. The antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment (scFv). Fv and scFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions; thus, they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. The antibody fragment may also be a âlinear antibodyâ, which may be monospecific or bispecific. The inhibitor also maybe a polypeptide or protein comprising an antibody or antibody fragment linked to another entity to form a fusion protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Bispecific Antibodies</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., F(abâ²)<sub>2 </sub>bispecific antibodies).</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificity (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Bispecific antibodies include cross-linked or âheteroconjugateâ antibodies. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry, including those involving crosslinking agents. For example, one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin, the other to biotin. Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross-linking methods. Suitable cross-linking agents and cross-linking techniques are well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fabâ²-SH fragments from E. coli, which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The term âdiabodiesâ refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing scFv fragments with short linkers (about 5 to 10 residues) between the VH and VL domains such that inter chain but not intra chain pairing of the V domains is achieved, resulting in a bivalent fragment, i.e., fragment having two antigen binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two âcrossoverâ scFv fragments in which the VH and VL domains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">According to an alternative âdiabodyâ technology for making bispecific antibody fragments, the fragments comprise a VH connected to a VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly, the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment, thereby forming two antigen-binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single-chain Fv (scFv) dimers has also been reported.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated for use in the invention. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared.</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">A multivalent antibody may be internalized (and/or catabolized) faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. Antibodies that may be used in the present invention can be multivalent antibodies (which are other than of the IgM class) with three or more antigen binding sites (e.g. tetravalent antibodies), which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. A preferred dimerization domain comprises an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario, the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino-terminal to the Fc region. A preferred multivalent antibody comprises three to about eight, but preferably four, antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain (and preferably two polypeptide chains), wherein the polypeptide chain(s) comprise two or more variable domains. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise VD1-(X<sub>1</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-VD2-(X<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-Fc, wherein VD 1 is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region, X<sub>i </sub>and X<sub>2 </sub>represent an amino acid or polypeptide, and n is 0 or 1. For instance, the polypeptide chain(s) may comprise: V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-flexible linker-V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-Fc region chain; or V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-V<sub>H</sub>-C<sub>H</sub>1-Fc region chain. A multivalent antibody preferably further comprises at least two (and preferably four) light chain variable domain polypeptides. A multivalent antibody may, for instance, comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and, optionally, further comprise a CL domain.</p>

      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">As used herein, âpeptide mimeticâ and âpeptidomimeticâ are used interchangeably.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">A peptide inhibitor is a peptide that binds specifically to a component of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis and inhibits or neutralizes the function of that component in the process of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. Peptide inhibitors may be chemically synthesized using known peptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. The preferred length of peptide inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis is from about 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 amino acid residues to about 100 amino acid residues. It is contemplated that longer peptides may prove useful. Peptide inhibitors may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard, it is noted that techniques for screening peptide libraries for peptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art.</p>

For example, in one variation, the peptide comprises a pair of cysteine residues, such as amino-and carboxy-terminal cysteines, and the intramolecular bond comprises a disulfide bond between the cysteines. However, organic chemists and peptide chemists are capable of synthesizing intramolecular bonds between a wide variety of amino acids using conventional techniques.</p>

The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to reduce or block expression of a component of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-ediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis, and thus VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis. Such oligonucleotides can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of components of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis.</p>

      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Sequence of Anti-VEGF-C Antibody Light Chain</heading>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0164">Another example of an anti-VEGF-C antibody is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF-C antibody 69D09 produced by hybridoma ATCC PTA-4095 or a monoclonal antibody having the heavy and light chain amino acid sequences shown above. In one embodiment, the anti-VEGF-C antibody is a fully-human anti-VEGF-C monoclonal antibody, including but not limited to 69D09 antibody or fragment thereof. The anti-VEGF-C antibody may be a humanized antibody.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0165">Preferably, the anti-VEGF-C antibody is a human antibody produced by deposited hybridoma ATC PTA-4095 (also referred to herein as âVGX-100â) or having the heavy and light chain amino acid sequences shown above.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0166">Alternatively, antibodies may bind proprotein convertases, enzymes responsible for processing VEGF-C and VEGF-D from their prepro-forms to their activated forms, and reduce, inhibit or neutralize such activity thereby limiting the amount of proteolytically processed ligand available for binding to VEGFR-3. Again, antibodies corresponding with anti-VEGFR-3 antibodies described above are envisaged. Such antibodies are disclosed in WO05/112971 and include neutralizing antibodies to inhibit the biological action of proprotein convertases.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0167">Peptide Inhibitors</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0168">Inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis as used in the present invention include inhibitors of proprotein convertases. As noted, one class of inhibitor of proprotein convertases comprises antibodies. Another class of inhibitor of proprotein convertases includes peptide inhibitors.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0169">Peptide inhibitors of proprotein convertases are disclosed in WO05/112971 and include prosegments of proprotein convertases, inhibitory variants of anti-trypsin and peptidyl haloalkylketone inhibitors.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0170">Representative inhibitory prosegments of proprotein convertases include the inhibitory prosegments of PC5A (also known as PC6A), PC5B (also known as PC6B), PACE4, PC1 (also known as PC3), PC2, PC4, PC7 and Furin. A representative inhibitory variant of anti-trypsin is a-1 antitrypsin Portland, an engineered variant of naturally occurring antitrypsin that inhibits multiple proprotein convertases. Representative peptidyl halomethyl ketone inhibitors include decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-RVKR-CMK), decanoyl-Phe-Ala-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-FAKR-CMK), decanoyl-Arg-Glu-Ile-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-REIR-CMK), and decanoyl-Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg-chloromethylketone (Dec-REKR-CMK). These inhibitors of proprotein convertases, such as Dec-RVKR-CMK or the inhibitory prosegments of proprotein convertases, can be used to block the activation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D and thereby inhibit VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis induced by partially processed or fully processed VEGF-C or VEGF-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0171">Soluble Receptors</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0172">According to another embodiment, VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis can be inhibited using soluble receptors that bind VEGFR-3 ligands. Soluble receptors capable of binding VEGF-C and VEGF-D, thereby inhibiting VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity or signaling via VEGFR-3, are disclosed in WO2000/023565, WO2000/021560 and WO2002/060950. Such inhibitors of VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis inhibitors include soluble VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, NRP-1, and NRP-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0173">Nucleic Acid Inhibitors</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0174">In another embodiment of the invention, antisense oligonucleotides are used as inhibitors of proprotein convertases. The antisense oligonucleotides preferably inhibit expression of proprotein convertases by inhibiting transcription or translation of proprotein convertases. In a further embodiment, the antagonizing agent is small interfering RNAs (siRNA, also known as RNAi, RNA interference nucleic acids). Also contemplated are methods of inhibiting the target gene expression or target protein function utilizing ribozymes and triplex-forming nucleic acid molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0175">Similarly, in a related embodiment, antisense, siRNA and ribozyme inhibitors directed to VEGF-C and/or VEGF-D are included as inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis exerting their effects by reducing transcription and/or translation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0176">Peptide and Peptide Mimetic Inhibitors</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0177">According to one embodiment, the inhibitor to be used in the invention comprises a peptide that reduces the availability of ligand to bind to VEGFR-3. Such a peptide can be generated by random peptide synthesis, by recombinant means from random oligonucleotides, or a peptide may be selected from a phage display library by methods standard in the art. In a particular embodiment, the peptide will be derived from VEGFR-3 or VEGFR-2 and will bind specifically to VEGF-C or VEGF-D such that the ligand available for binding to native VEGFR-3 is reduced. Such a peptide may be identified with the aid of the VEGF-C or VEGF-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0178">Small Molecule Inhibitors</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0179">In one embodiment, the small molecule inhibitor is a small molecule inhibitor of a proprotein convertase. In a particular embodiment, the proprotein convertase is furin and the small molecule comprises B3 (CCG8294, naphthofluorescein disodium) or a derivative of 2,5-dideoxystreptamine.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0180">Antibody Inhibitors Affecting LigandâReceptor Complex</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0181">In one embodiment, the invention includes use of bispecific antibodies, as described above, as inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis, specifically inhibiting ligand-receptor complexes.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0182">Suitable antibodies and their means for production are disclosed in WO2000/021560 and include a bispecific antibody that binds specifically to an epitope or epitopes derived from a VEGFR-3-(VEGFR-3 ligand) complex (receptor-ligand complex) and blocks VEGFR-3 signaling.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0183">Inhibition of Co-Receptor Interaction</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0184">Antibody Inhibitors Affecting Co-Receptors of VEGFR-3</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0185">In a further embodiment, inhibitors of VEGF-C or VEGF-D activity, VEGFR-3-mediated signaling or lymphangiogenesis include antibodies, as described above, that bind specifically to and reduce, inhibit or neutralize co-receptor binding to VEGFR-3. Such antibodies may be directed to a co-receptor, a ligand-co-receptor binary complex, a co-receptor-receptor binary complex, or a ligand-co-receptor-receptor ternary complex. Co-receptors include NRP-1 and NRP-2. The person skilled in the art will understand that monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind NRP-1 or NRP-2 and may be used according to the invention include antibodies 1B3, 3G6-2C5, AD5-17F6, 446915, 446921, 130603, 130604, 96009, 3B8, 54, 257103, 257107, A-12, and C-9. Alternatively, a bispecific antibody which specifically binds to NRP-2 receptor and a VEGF-C polypeptide, as disclosed in WO2003/029814, may be used according to the invention.</p>

To determine the molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis in DED, expression of different vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors were quantified at indicated time points in the cornea using real time PCR.

      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0214">Dry eye disease (DED) once thought to be solely due to deficiency of tears, is increasingly being recognized as an immune-mediated disorder) DED affects many millions of people with a wide spectrum of seminal features ranging from mild ocular discomfort to sight-threatening corneal complications such as persistent epithelial defects and sterile stromal ulceration) In the United States alone, more than 3.2 million women and 1.6 million men above the age of 50 years are affected by this potentially disabling disease adversely impacting the vision-related quality of life.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0215">Clinically significant DED is associated with ocular surface inflammation, although the precise immunopathogenesis is not known. There is strong evidence regarding T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of DED in both animal models and humans. Recently, we illustrated T cell activation in the regional lymph nodes of dry eye mice, coincident with acquisition of specific chemokine markers which help in the homing of T cells to the inflamed ocular surface. Further we demonstrated induction of autoimmunity in the draining lymph nodes of dry eye mice due to impaired Treg function and generation of pathogenic Th17 cells. These Th17 cells were found to be resistant to Treg mediated suppression, leading to unrestrained generation ofpathogenic T cells and sustained ocular surface inflammation. Accordingly, much of the work to date has focused on understanding immunological phenomena occurring in the lymphoid compartment and the effector responses thereby generated, leaving unanswered the question as to how naive T cells in the draining lymph nodes get primed to the ocular surface antigen(s) that drive immunity in DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0216">The draining lymph nodes are critical sites for induction of immunity and their role in generation of alloimmunity has been well established in corneal transplantation. The enhanced survival rate of corneal transplants in mice with excised cervical lymph nodes implicates the importance of functional flow of antigen presenting cells (APCs) from the ocular surface to the to the draining lymphoid tissue as a necessary component of alloimmunity and graft rejection. However, little is known about the pathway that allows trafficking of corneal APCs to the draining lymph nodes where they prime naive T cells to corneal antigens and generate autoimmune responses in dry eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0217">Emphasis is now being given to the importance of pathological angiogenesis (hem- and lymphangiogenesis) in various corneal diseases such as different forms of keratitis, chemical burns, graft vs host disease etc., but to date there is no data regarding corneal angiogenesis in DED. A plausible reason could be that most of the above mentioned conditions except DED are accompanied by in-growth of clinically visible blood vessels into the cornea. Traditionally it has been thought that lymphatics and blood vessels which serve as afferent and efferent arms of the immune response respectively are always coexistent in pathological states. The present work provides the first evidence for selective lymphangiogenesis occurring in DED cornea using a murine model. Herein, we attempt to determine the growth of lymphatic vessels into the cornea with the progression ofDED, discuss the pathophysiologic implications of corneal lymphangiogenesis in dry eye and the potential of antilymphangiogenic therapy for ameliorating DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0218">Discussion</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0219">Lymphangiogenesis in the postnatal period is primarily a response to inflammation and is seen in various pathological states as diverse as tumor metastasis, wound healing and transplantation. Lymphatics play an important role in generating immuno-inflammatory responses by directing the antigen bearing immunocytes (e.g. dendritic cells) from the periphery to the draining lymph nodes where T cells are primed and expanded. The normal human cornea is avascular, thus suppressing the afferent lymphatic and efferent vascular arms of the immune cycle. Inflammation however negates this âimmuneâ and âangiogenicâ privileged state of the cornea and gives it the potential to mount an immune response.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0220">Angiogenesis in the cornea is now extensively being studied in various pathological models such as transplantation. Whereas corneal blood vessels have long been thought to be an important risk factor for immune rejection in corneal transplantation, it is only recently after unveiling of new lymphatic specific markers, that the significance of lymphangiogenesis in corneal alloimmunity has been characterized. Despite recognizing the role of inflammatory angiogenesis in the eye, little has hitherto been studied regarding angiogenic mechanisms in DED. Desiccating stress in DED initiates an immune-based inflammatory response that is sustained by the ongoing interplay between the ocular surface and various pathogenic immune cells, primarily the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the conjunctiva and CDI1bÃ·monocytic cells in the cornea. Desiccating stress induces secretion of inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor-a, and IL-6 by ocular surface tissues, which facilitate the activation and migration of resident APCs toward the regional draining LN. Our data on frequencies of mature APC in the LN also suggest increased trafficking of mature APC in</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0221">the LN of DED mice (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). In the LN, these APCs stimulate naive T cells, leading to the</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0222">expansion ofIL-17 secreting Th17 cells and interferon (IFN)-y-secreting Th1 cells. Once these effectors are generated in the LN, they migrate to the ocular surface and secrete effector cytokines. Recent work has provided evidence for the induction of T cell mediated autoimmune responses in the regional lymph nodes of DED mice. But what has remained unanswered is how corneal APCs can traffic to the draining lymphoid compartment in order to initiate the immune cycle in DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0223">Interestingly, to date there has been no published data on this important facet of immunity in DED. The data presented herein clearly demonstrates the development of lymphatic vessels in the setting of the dry eye state. These lymphatic vessels increase both in caliber and area while advancing toward the corneal center with progression of dry eye. Remarkably, these lymphatic vessels are not accompanied by growth of blood vessels. Various spatio-temporal studies examining relation between new blood and lymphatic vessels have led to the belief that a preexisting blood vascular bed is necessary to guide lymphangiogenesis. The current study refutes the general perception of wound healing models in skin where growth of lymphatic vessels follows that of blood vessels by several days. This is also in contrast to other robust models of corneal inflammation where there is either parallel outgrowth of blood and lymphatic vessels or the blood vessels are precedent over the lymphatics. This provides the first evidence of selective ânaturalâ (non pharmacologically induced) lymphangiogeneis in a disease model that is dissociated from hemangiogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0224">Lymphangiogenesis is mediated primarily by the interaction of growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D on VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGF-A also contributes, albeit indirectly, to lymphangiogenesis by recruiting VEGF-C and VEGF-D secreting macrophages. In the present study, dry eye induction led to the up-regulation of all the VEGF growth factors and their receptors. Though the rise in levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C and VEGFR-2 occurred at later time points (day 14), it is noteworthy, that VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 (which are both largely specific to lymphangiogenesis) increased as early as day 6 of disease. The functional relevance of the early rise of VEGF-D is highlighted in a recent study where VEGF-D, via its action on VEGFR-3, was shown to be a critical modifier of VEGF-C driven early sprouting and migration of lymphatic endothelial cells. Macrophages also seem to play a crucial role in lymphangiogenesis. Under normal physiological conditions, all ocular tissues except the central cornea are rich in bone marrow derived LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages which may serve as precursor cells for de novo formation of lymphatics. In the present study, we noticed significantly increased number of CD11b<sup>+</sup>/LYVE-1<sup>+</sup> cells in the peripheral corneas after exposure to desiccating stress, suggesting that either these cells infiltrate into or multiply from pre-exisiting CD1 1137 LYVE-1+ cells in the cornea, and contribute to lymphangiogenesis. Alternatively, there is a possibility of upregulation of LYVE-1 in the previous CD11b<sup>+</sup>/LYVE-1<sup>â</sup> cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0225">In summary, presented herein is novel evidence for the selective growth of lymphatic (but not blood) vessels in dry eye disease providing new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease. The findings suggest that these newly formed corneal lymphatics may serve as potential conduits for migration of corneal APCs to lymphoid tissues where they generate autoreactive Th17 and Th1 cells in DED. This study not only provides a link between ocular surface inflammation and the generation of T cell mediated immunity in the lymphoid compartment, but also offers an example of how lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis can be ânaturallyâ dissociated in a pathological state. The severing of the âeye-lymphatic axisâ in other immune-mediated conditions, such as transplant rejection, has been shown to hold promise as a strategy of suppressing alloimmunity without inhibiting needed innate host defense mechanisms. Similarly, a strategy targeting prolymphangiogenic factors such as VEGF-C or VEGF-D may prove effective in ameliorating dry eye disease.</p>

Data shows a significant increase in both caliber and extent of lymphatics in DED corneas which was also confirmed using real-time PCR by showing a highly significant over-expression of lymphangiogenic receptor VEGFR-3 (in contrast to a non-statistically significant increase in hemangiogenic receptor VEGFR-2 expression). This study not only provides a link between ocular surface inflammation and the generation of T-cell mediated immunity in the lymphoid compartment, but also offers an example of how lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis can be ânaturallyâ dissociated in a pathological state. Data suggests that these corneal lymphatics may serve as conduits for migration of corneal APCs to lymphoid tissues where they activate autoreactive T cells in DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0227">Immunopathogenesis of DED: The pathogenesis is not fully understood. Ocular surface inflammation sustained by ongoing activation and infiltration of pathogenic immune cells. Strong evidence of T cell involvement. Recent work draining lymphoid tissue primary site for activation and generation of auto reactive effector T cells in DED (Chauhan et al; Role ofcTh17 cells in the immunopathogenesis of dry eye disease. Mucosal Immunol. 2009; 2(4):375-376.).</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0228">Expression levels of VEGF's and VEGFR's in DE corneas using RT PCR has demonstrated an increased transcript expression of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGFR-3. Thus, targeting pro-lymphangiogenic VEGF-C/D has therapeutic implications in DED.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0229">Corneal lymphatics play an important role in mediating the corneal inflammation in dry eyes. Experiments: To validate this, inhibition of corneal neolymphangiogenesis was performed in a well characterized mouse model of DED described above. To see if inhibition of corneal neolymphangiogenesis could decrease ocular surface inflammation, anti-VEGF-C antibodies were administered i.p. daily from day â1 to day 10 to DED mice and assessed clinically using corneal fluorescein staining.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0230">Methods (as described previously): Induction of Dry Eye Disease. Experimental Dry Eye Murine Model. Assessment of Corneal Surface: Corneal Fluorescein Staining. Immunohistochemistry: Monocyte/macrophage markerâCD11b; Pan-endothelial markerâCD31; Lymphatic endothelial markerâLYVE-1; Blood vessels: CD31<sup>hi</sup>/LYVE-1; Lymph vessels: CD31<sup>lo</sup>/LYVE-1<sup>hi</sup>. Morphometry of Lymphangiogenesis: Automated image analysis program written using Mat lab. Lymphatic Area (LA)âtotal surface area of the lymphatic vessels when projected into the plane of the image. Lymphatic Caliber (LC)âmeasure of the diameters of the lymphatic vessels.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0231">Anti-VEGF-C antibody and treatment regimen. Experimental design: Three groups: Normal, DE group treated with IP normal Saline (Untreated) and DE group treated with anti-VEGF-C antibody (VGX-100; a gift from Vegenics, Australia). Daily IP application of anti-VEGF-C antibody /Normal saline from day -1 to day 13. Dose: 400 pg (20mg/kg) in 100 pl of Normal Saline.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0232">The results are presented in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. Results: The data clearly shows a significant decrease in disease severity in anti-VEGF-C-treated group compared to the untreated group. In conclusion, suppression of lymphatic growth with VEGF-C blockade led to significant improvement in DED reflected by decrease in: corneal epitheliopathy; corneal infiltration of CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells; expression of pro-lymphangiogenic growth factors and receptors (VEGF-C, -D, R3) in DE corneas; and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the conjunctiva.</p>
