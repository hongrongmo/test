      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing sebacic acid. In particular, this invention relates to the chemo-enzymatic production of sebacic acid starting from linoleic acid which is hydroxylated to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid and further transformed to sebacic acid.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="2">Step (i)</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">The process according to the invention starts with the conversion of linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. For step (i) of the inventive process chemically pure linoleic acid can be used as well as substrates which contain linoleic acid as a main component, preferably more than 60%, more preferred more than 70% or 80% by weight of the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0016">Such substrates can be prepared from oil having a high linoleic acid content in form of glycerol esters by hydrolyzing the glycerol ester and recovering the linoleic acid in form of the free acid or its salts. Such oils are for example safflower oil (78% linoleic acid), grape seed oil (73% linoleic acid), poppy seed oil (70% linoleic acid) or mostly preferred sunflower oil (68% linoleic acid).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">If linoleic acid is produced from a complex oil such as sunflower oil, the fatty acid preparation may contain in addition to linoleic acid other fatty acids which can be present when performing step (i) of the inventive reaction. These other fatty acids can be eliminated from the reaction at later reaction steps, preferably after step (ii).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0018">As enzymes suitable for step (i) there are numerous oleate-hydratases in the prior art as described above e.g. from the organisms <i>Pseudomonas, Rhodoccocus, Flavobacterium, Enterococcus, Lysinibacillus, Lactobacillus, Stenotrophomonas, Elizabethkingia. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0019">These enzymes are known in the art to convert linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. In addition to those enzymes other oleate-hydratases can be easily found by the skilled person by screening microorganisms using as a model reaction the conversion of oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid or the targeted reaction linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. This reaction can be performed in test tube assays and so simultaneously thousands of microorganisms can be screened in short time.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0020">As the sequence of some oleate-hydratases is known it is also possible to screen in silico genomes of microorganisms for other oleate-hydratases and test the positive populations for the conversion of oleic acid to 10-hydroxystearic acid or the targeted reaction linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0021">Another way is the genetic engineering of known oleate hydratases in order come to enzymes with improved activity or better temperature or solvent resistance by comparing the sequences from known oleate hydratases in order to detect conserved or homologous regions and to find starting points for a directed gene mutagenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0022">A preferred enzyme is the oleate hydratase according to EC 4.2.1.53. A representative of this class of enzymes is the enzyme from Elizabethkingia miningoseptica (Bevers et al (2009) J. Bacteriol. 191, 5010-5012). The nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence are disclosed as SEQ ID NO:1 and 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0023">A preferred enzyme is one having SEQ ID NO: 2, or a fragment of said polypeptide sequence, wherein said fragment is sufficient for a protein having the enzymatic activity of an oleate hydratase, or nucleic acid sequences comprising a nucleotide sequence which codes for an oleate hydratase and which hybridizes to a complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence coding for SEQ ID NO:2 under stringent conditions, or comprising a fragment of said nucleotide sequence, wherein the fragment is sufficient to code for a protein having the enzymatic activity of an oleate-hydratase.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0024">The invention further relates to an enzyme having the enzymatic activity of an oleate-hydratase and the amino acid sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO: 2 or an amino acid sequence which is at least 75% or 80%, preferably at least 85%, 90% or 95%, more preferably at least 95% or 97% and most preferably at least 98% or 99% identical to the amino acid sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO:2.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0025">To improve enzyme solubility and expression level, such enzymes can be recombinantely expressed with N- (or C)-terminal fusion partners (protein or peptide). Typical proteins or tags used as fusion partners for improved solubility and/or expression levels are: maltose binding protein, thioredoxin, green fluorescence protein, glutathione-S-transferase, disulfide oxidoreductase/isomerase, T7 tag, SET tag, Nus A, Mistic and SUMO.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0026">In the context of this invention the term âhybridization under stringent conditionsâ means that the hybridization is performed in vitro under conditions stringent enough to ensure a specific hybridization. Stringent in vitro hybridization conditions are known to the person skilled in the art, and can be found in the literature (e.g. Sambrook and Rus-sell (2001) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd edition, Cold Spring Har-bour Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbour, N.Y.). The term âspecific hybridizationâ refers to the fact that a molecule preferably binds to a certain nucleic acid sequence, the target sequence, under stringent conditions, if the target sequence is part of a complex mixture of, for example, DNA or RNA molecules, but does not bind, or at least to a considerably lesser degree, to other sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0027">Stringent conditions depend on the circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. In general, stringent conditions are selected so that the hybridization temperature is approximately 5Â° C. below the melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and a defined pH value. Tm is the temperature (at a defined pH value, a defined ionic strength and a defined nucleic acid concentration) at which 50% of the molecules complementary to the target sequence hybridize to the target sequence in the equilibrium state. Typically, stringent conditions are those in which the salt concentration is at least about 0.01 to 1.0 M of sodium ion concentration (or the concentration of another salt) at a pH of between 7.0 and 8.3 and the temperature is at least 30Â° C. for short molecules (i.e. for example 10 to 50 nucleotides). Furthermore, stringent conditions can comprise the addition of agents, such as formamide, which destabilize the hybrids. In hybridization under stringent conditions as used herein, nucleotide sequences which are at least 60% homologous to each other usually remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the stringent conditions are selected in such a way that sequences which are homologous to each other by at least about 65%, prefer-ably at least about 70%, and especially preferably at least about 75%, or more, usually remain hybridized to each other. A preferred, non-limiting example for stringent hybridization conditions are hybridizations in 6Ã sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45Â° C., followed by one or more washing steps in 0.2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 to 65Â° C. The temperature ranges, for example, under standard hybridization conditions depending on the type of nucleic acid, between 42Â° C. and 58Â° C. in an aqueous buffer at a concentration of 0.1 to 5ÃSSC (pH 7.2).</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0028">If an organic solvent, e.g. 50% formamide, is present in the above-mentioned buffer, the temperature under standard conditions is about 42Â° C. Preferably, the hybridization conditions for DNA:DNA hybrids are for example 0.1ÃSSC and 20Â° C. to 45Â° C., preferably 30Â° C. to 45Â° C. Preferably, the hybridization conditions for DNA:RNA hybrids are for example 0.1ÃSSC and 30Â° C. to 55Â° C., preferably between 45Â° C. to 55Â° C. The hybridization temperatures mentioned above are determined for example for a nucleic acid having a length of about 100 base pairs and a G/C content of 50% in the absence of formamide. The person skilled in the art knows how the required hybridization conditions can be determined using the above mentioned, or the following, textbooks: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N. Y. (1989), Hames and Higgins (publisher) 1985, Nucleic Acids Hybridization: A Practical Approach, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brown (publisher) 1991, Essential Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach, IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0029">The stereospecificity of the enzymatic hydration is not critical for the inventive process. Consequently either the 10(R) or the 10(S)-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid or mixtures (racemates) produced in step (i) can be used in the following step (ii).</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0030">Enzymatic conversion of linoleic acid to 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid can be performed in a reaction medium which contains the linoleic acid and water. If the linoleic acid is used in form of the free acid (the oil phase) the water or a buffered water containing solution with the enzyme forms a second liquid phase (the water phase). The two liquid phase should be mixed thoroughly in order to form an emulsion for a quick reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0031">However, step (ii) can also be performed with immobilized enzymes, which can easily be removed from the reaction medium and be recycled. Enzymes can be generally immobilized by different methods such as adsorption, covalent binding, membrane encapsulation, gel encapsulation and cross-linking. The properties of the carrier material for immobilization shall be optimized in order to avoid enzyme inactivation. Typical carriers can be either organic (natural and non-natural) or inorganic materials. Inorganic materials usually have good tolerance against pressure, while organic materials show good chemical stability. Inorganic carriers are typically porous materials based on silicon- or aluminum oxides, or mixtures thereof. Natural organic carriers are for example polysaccharides like cellulose, starch, dextran, agar or chitin. Proteins like collagen, gelatin or albumin can also be used. Synthetic organic carriers include poly(meth)acrylates, polyacrylamide, vinyl- and allylpolymers, polyesters, polyamides.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0032">Step (i) can be performed in a 2-phase system, where the enzyme preparation (aqueous phase) is added to the organic phase containing linoleic acid. The ratio aqueous phase/linoleic acid phase can be varied in a broad range.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">The reaction can be performed with or without additional solvents. With regard to the selection of the solvent, the person skilled in the art is guided by the product yield, reaction rate, manageability of the suspensions formed and the cost of the solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">Advantageous solvents are those which can be mixed with the linoleic acid, are chemically inert, i.e. do not react with the enzyme or inhibit the enzymatic activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">Typical organic solvents in biocatalytic processes are: hexane, heptane, dodecane, hexadecane, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone. The reaction temperature for step (i) depends from the thermal stability of the enzyme used and is usually between 10 and 50Â° C., preferred between 20 and 40Â° C. However, if an enzyme with a high thermal stability is used also reaction temperatures of above 50Â° C. are possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">The formed 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid can be recovered from reaction medium by conventional processes such as crystallization or extraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">For the next step of the inventive reaction, i.e. step (ii), the 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid can be used in the form of the free acid or in the form of an ester, preferred a lower alkyl ester such as methyl or ethyl ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">If an ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid shall be used in the reaction, the 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid recovered from step (i) can be esterified by chemical or enzymatic methods before the pyrolysis of step (ii). A preferred way for esterification is the enzymatic conversion by a lipase.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">Step (ii)</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">For the description of this step (ii) the term â10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acidâ shall mean either the free acid 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid or an ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid, for example a methyl or ethyl ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">The pyrolysis of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid to 10-oxo-decanoic acid is a retro-ene-type reaction. In order to select for the retro-ene rearrangement and to suppress the competing dehydration reaction it is best to have a fast vaporization of the 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">The reaction can be performed at temperatures from above 400 up to 800Â° C., preferred from 500 to 600Â° C. The optimum temperature range depends on the residence time of the substrate as well as on the nature of the substrate. If a methyl ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid is used the best results have been achieved with temperatures of 600Â° C. and a residence time of 1-2 seconds in a microreactor. If the free acid 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid is used instead of the ester a complete conversion of the 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid could be detected lower temperatures such as 575Â° C. However, the selectivity for the retro-ene reaction over the dehydration is less with the free acid 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid than with the methylester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid. For details compare the working examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">The reaction can be performed in a milli- or microreactor, e.g. a capillary with a diameter of 0.1 to 3 mm. Crucial aspects are a high heating rate and a fast vaporization in a milli- or microevaporator with residence times of &lt;10 seconds, preferably &lt;1 second. In order to maintain these characteristics, milli- or microstructured apparatus known to those skilled in the art are suitable. The reaction can be performed with or without a solvent. If a solvent is used the solvent can be added in up to 99% (w/w). The solvent used should not react or decompose at the temperatures and conditions used during the pyrolysis. A preferred solvent is chosen from the group of stable ethers, such as THF or dioxane. THF is the most preferred solvent for step (ii).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Water can also be added to the reaction mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">The 10-oxo-decanoic acid formed in step (ii) can be dependent on the starting material 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid either the free acid 10-oxo-decanoic acid or the corresponding ester of 10-oxo-decanoic acid. For the description of this step (ii) the term â10-oxo-decanoic acidâ shall mean the free acid as well as the ester of 10-oxo-decanoic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">The 10-oxo-decanoic acid can be separated from the second product of the retro-ene rearrangement (1-octene) by conventional methods such as distillation or extraction. In the case of a non pure linoleic acid as starting material, f.ex. sunflower oil hydrolysates, the non-transformed fatty acids (f.ex. stearic acid or 10-hydroxostearic acid) can be removed by conventional methods such as distillation, crystallisaion or extraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">For the next step, the oxidation of 10-oxo-decanoic acid to sebacic acid, the product mixture of step (ii), consisting of 10-oxo-decanoic acid, 1-octene and possibly other fatty acids, can in general be taken without in between purification or the 10-oxo-decanoic acid can be purified by the above mentioned methods. Both, the methyl ester or the free fatty acid can be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0047">For step (iii) the recovered 10-oxo-decanoic acid can be used in the form of the free acid or the ester.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0048">The oxidation of the aldehyde function in 10-oxo-decanoic acid to the dicarbonic acid sebacic acid can be performed according to well-known procedures, as for example in the oxidation of oxo-aldehydes to oxo carbonic acids, by using mild oxidizing agents like oxygen or air at up to 100Â° C. and up to 7 bar, either without catalyst or homogenously catalyzed by redox active metals as for example Cu, Fe, Co, Mn, etc. (Industrial Organic Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, H.-J. Arpe (publisher), 2007, pp. 149).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0049">Depending on the purity of the starting material used as linoleic acid source in step (i) and depending on the application of the sebacic acid it could be necessary to have additional purification and recovery steps in the process according to the invention which are well known per se for the person skilled in the art. When using the ester of 10-oxo-decanoic acid in step (iii), hydrolysis of the ester will lead to the free sebacic acid.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0051">For recombinant enzyme production, the gene was cloned into the pBAD(HisA) vector (Invitrogen), which allows induction of expression with arabinose. <i>E. coli </i>TOP10 one shot (Invitrogen) was transformed with pBAD(HisA)-OH and plated on LB-Agar-Amp plates (o/n at 37Â° C.). A single colony was inoculated in 2xYT-Amp and cultured for additional 5 h at 37Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0052">Induction of protein expression was achieved by adding 5 mL of this culture to 500 mL 2xYT-Amp supplemented with 0.2% arabinose and by incubation at 37Â° for additional 18 h. After induction cells were collected by centrifugation (20â², 4000 rpm, 4Â° C.) and resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0053">The cell suspension was sonicated (3â², 15â³ on/off cycles, 80% amplitude at 4Â° C.) and the clear supernatant was used in most of the biocatalytic conversions described in this report (typically 40 mg/mL total protein; â13% oleate hydratase based on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer). The enzyme has also been further purified by Ni-affinity-chromatography (His-tag purification). In this case the induced cells were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM imidazole. The washing buffer during purification contained 20 mM imidazole and protein elution was achieved with 500 mM in the same buffer. The fractions containing oleate hydratase were collected and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2. The enzyme stock solution (5.8 mg/mL) was stored at 4Â° C.</p>

The feed is dosed into the reactor using a Bischoff HPLC pump. The reactor is a steel tube with an inner diameter of 1/16â³ immersed in a solid copper block that can be heated up to 800Â° C. After passing a cooler (aluminium block at room temperature), the product mixture is collected in a flask. With this setup, residence times&lt;1 second are possible.

      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0067">In the first microreactor experiments, the methyl ester of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid was chosen as reactant in order to have an easier handling (i.e. better vaporization properties). MTBE and THF were tested as solvents. In the case of MTBE, a large amount of dimethylated 10-oxo-decanoic acid (acetal formation w/methanol) was observed, leading to the conclusion that the solvent is cleaved during the reaction. Therefore, THF was chosen for further experiments (no cleavage products observed). Different temperatures and residence times were evaluated, as well as the effect of water addition (almost equimolar amount of water dissolved in reactant solution). The results are summarized in Table 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0068">As seen in Table 2, the temperature has the largest effect on the conversion of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, whereas the residence time variation has only a small influence (a greater variation of residence time was not feasible due to the reactor setup but would probably have a larger impact on conversion and selectivity). At 500Â° C., only around 25% of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester are converted (entry 1 and 2), at 550Â° C. it's already around 40% (entries 3-6) and at 600Â° C. we can have full conversion (entry 7 and 8). Addition of water seems to have a beneficial effect on selectivity. The best results were obtained at 600Â° C. and a residence time of r=1.3 sec with complete conversion of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, around 75% selectivity towards the retro-ene product and only 6.5% selectivity towards the dehydration products (linoleic acid methyl ester and isomers, entry 8).</p>

      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0069">b. Pyrolysis of 10-hydroxyoctadec-12-enoic acid (10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid)</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0070">As the use of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester as reactant would mean one more step in the overall scheme from linoleic acid to sebacic acid the successful microreactor setup was also tested using the free acid 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (as 10 wt % solution in THF). In comparison to the pyrolysis of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, full conversion of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid is already obtained at lower temperatures (575Â° C., entry 5 in Table 3). As in the case of 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, the residence time does not influence the reaction to a large extent. Nevertheless, the selectivity towards 10-oxo-decanoic acid is significantly lower (48 vs. 74%, compare entry 8 in Table 2). More dehydration as side reaction is observed, which could be due to the poor vaporization behaviour of the free fatty acid compared to its methyl ester.</p>
