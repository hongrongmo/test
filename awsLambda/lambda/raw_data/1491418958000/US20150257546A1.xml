      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to displaying products on a shelf. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to storing and/or displaying products to provide for the space-efficient presentation of groups of products within a given or fixed display area, and/or allowing for convenient and orderly presentation, dispensing, stocking, and storage of products.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Various types of product merchandisers are commonly used in retail environments to display different types of products. As opposed to simply positioning products on shelves, product displays are commonly used to position products on a shelf in manner which automatically advances (e.g., via gravity or a pusher) a trailing or distal product (i.e., a product that is behind a lead or proximal-most product) closer to a user once the lead product has been removed from the shelf. As can be appreciated, such product displays facilitate the arrangement and upkeep of products, as the trailing products don't have to be manually moved towards the front of the shelf, for instance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to a merchandising system for a displaying a plurality of products. The system comprises a base and a pusher member. The base includes a product-supporting surface and a track disposed beneath the product-supporting surface. The base defines a longitudinal axis. The pusher member is disposed in mechanical cooperation with the base and is configured to slide longitudinally with respect to the base. The pusher member includes a base-contacting surface and a plurality of legs downwardly depending from the base-contacting surface. Each of the plurality of legs is configured to mechanically engage the track. The track includes a discontinuity to enable the legs of the pusher member to selectively mechanically engage the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In disclosed embodiments, the discontinuity in the track is between a proximal-most end of the track and a distal-most end of the track. Here, it is disclosed that the track extends proximally of the discontinuity and the track extends distally of the discontinuity.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In disclosed embodiments, the track includes a plurality of spaced-apart tabs.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In disclosed embodiments, the plurality of legs includes a first leg disposed on a first lateral side of the pusher member and a second leg disposed on a second lateral side of the pusher member. Here, it is disclosed that each of the first leg and the second leg includes a vertical portion disposed in contact with the base-contacting surface of the pusher member and a horizontal portion that extends from the vertical portion toward the second leg. The horizontal portion of the second leg extends from the vertical portion toward the first leg. Here, it is disclosed that each of the first leg and the second leg includes a substantially L-shaped cross-section</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In disclosed embodiments, at least one of the plurality of legs includes a substantially L-shaped cross-section.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In disclosed embodiments, the base includes a lower surface and a gap. The gap is defined between the lower surface and the product-supporting surface. Here, it is disclosed that the track is disposed at least partially within the gap. It is further disclosed that the track is entirely disposed within the gap. Here, it is disclosed that the track includes a plurality of spaced-apart tabs. It is further disclosed that a plurality of the spaced-apart tabs define a first distance between adjacent tabs, the discontinuity includes a space between adjacent tabs defining a second distance, and the second distance is greater than the first distance.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In disclosed embodiments, a distal section of the base is configured to be removed to effectively shorten the length of the merchandising system. Here, it is disclosed that the system further comprises a distal portion disposed distally of the distal section of the base. The distal portion is selectively removable from the distal section of the base, and the distal portion is re-installable with another section of the base after the distal section of the base has been removed. It is further disclosed that the distal portion includes a portion of the track. Here, it is disclosed that the pusher member is configured to slide along the entirety of the track both before the distal portion has been removed, and following removal of the distal section of the base and the re-installation of the distal portion. It is further disclosed that the distal portion includes a proximally-extending finger configured to mechanically engage a cut-out of the base.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In disclosed embodiments, a plurality of distal sections of the base are configured to be individually removed to effectively shorten the length of the merchandising system. Here, the merchandising system further comprises a distal portion disposed distally of the distal section of the base. The distal portion is selectively removable from a distal-most section of the base, and the distal portion is re-installable with another section of the base after any number of the plurality of distal sections of the base have been removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In disclosed embodiments, the system further comprises a proximal member disposed adjacent a proximal end of the base, and a biasing member mechanically coupled to both the pusher member and the proximal member. The biasing member is configured to proximally bias the pusher member.</p>

      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Embodiments of the presently disclosed merchandising system are described in detail with reference to the drawings wherein like numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. As is common in the art, the term “proximal” refers to that part or component closer to the user, e.g., customer, while the term “distal” refers to that part or component farther away from the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Generally, with particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a merchandising system <b>10</b> is disclosed that includes a plurality of guide assemblies <b>100</b>. Each guide assembly <b>100</b> includes a base <b>200</b>, a pusher assembly <b>300</b>, a pair of lateral guides <b>400</b>, a distal section <b>450</b>, and a proximal member <b>500</b>. The base <b>200</b>, which is designed to be placed on a horizontal or included store shelf, is configured to support a plurality of products “P” thereon. The pusher assembly <b>300</b> is configured to urge product(s) “P” on the base <b>200</b> toward the proximal member <b>500</b>. The lateral guides <b>400</b> are disposed in mechanical cooperation with base <b>200</b> (e.g., are integrally formed therewith, connectable thereto, etc.) and help maintain the products “P” on the base <b>200</b>. A distal rail <b>452</b> of the distal section <b>450</b> and the proximal member <b>500</b> are also configured to help maintain the products “P” on the base <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">One merchandising system <b>10</b> includes a plurality guide assemblies <b>100</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, merchandising system <b>10</b> includes five guide assemblies <b>100</b>, which, as shown, includes six lateral guides <b>400</b>. In disclosed embodiments, merchandising system <b>10</b> includes more or fewer than five guide assemblies <b>100</b> and that the number of lateral guides <b>400</b> equals one more than the number of guide assemblies <b>100</b>. As can be appreciated, several merchandising systems <b>10</b> are able to be positioned adjacent one another on a shelf.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 4-9</figref>, the base <b>200</b> includes a product-supporting surface <b>210</b>, a lower surface <b>220</b>, a gap <b>230</b>, a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs <b>240</b>, and a track <b>250</b>. The product-supporting surface <b>210</b> is the portion of the base on which products “P” are positioned. The lower surface <b>220</b> is the underside of the base <b>200</b>. The gap <b>230</b> is the space between the product-supporting surface <b>210</b> and the lower surface <b>220</b>. The ribs <b>240</b> extend along at least a portion of the base <b>200</b> between a proximal end <b>202</b> of the base <b>200</b> and a distal end <b>204</b> of the base <b>200</b> (see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), and are configured to provide stability to base <b>200</b> and to reduce friction when a product “P” slides along the product-supporting surface <b>210</b>, for example. The track <b>250</b> includes a plurality of spaced-apart tabs <b>252</b> that are positioned within the gap <b>230</b>. The track <b>250</b> is configured to guide legs <b>340</b> of the pusher assembly <b>300</b> (as discussed in further detail below).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 3-13</figref>, the pusher assembly <b>300</b> includes a pusher member <b>310</b> and a biasing member <b>360</b> (e.g., a coiled spring). Pusher member <b>310</b> includes a horizontal member <b>320</b> and a substantially vertical member <b>321</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the vertical member <b>321</b> has an arcuate shape, which is configured to correspond to the contour of the product “P” (e.g., bottle) supported thereagainst. The horizontal member <b>320</b> includes an upper surface <b>322</b> (e.g., for supporting a product “P”), and a lower surface (or base-contacting surface) <b>324</b> that is configured to longitudinally slide along the product-supporting surface <b>210</b> of the base <b>200</b>. The horizontal member <b>320</b> also includes a proximal portion <b>326</b>, and a distal portion <b>328</b>. The proximal portion <b>326</b> is configured to support a distal-most product “P” thereon, and the distal portion <b>328</b> supports at least a portion of the biasing member <b>360</b> thereon (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). The horizontal member <b>320</b> also includes a track <b>330</b> (<figref>FIGS. 5 and 11</figref>) within its lower surface <b>324</b>, and an opening <b>332</b> (<figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>) extending between the upper surface <b>322</b> and the lower surface <b>324</b>. A portion of the biasing member <b>360</b> extends through the opening <b>332</b> and along the track <b>330</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The pusher member <b>310</b> also includes a plurality of legs <b>340</b> (<figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>13</b>) that extend below the lower surface <b>324</b> of the horizontal member <b>320</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the pusher assembly <b>300</b> includes a first leg <b>340</b><i>a</i>, a second leg <b>340</b><i>b</i>, a third leg <b>340</b><i>c </i>and a fourth leg <b>340</b><i>d</i>. In the illustrated embodiments, each leg <b>340</b> includes a vertical portion <b>342</b>, and a horizontal portion <b>344</b> (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>) extending inwardly from the vertical portion <b>342</b>, such that each leg <b>340</b> includes a substantially L-shaped cross-section. When the pusher assembly <b>300</b> is engaged with the base <b>200</b>, the legs <b>340</b> of the pusher assembly <b>300</b> extend below the product-supporting surface <b>210</b> of the base <b>200</b> and mechanically engage the tabs <b>252</b> of the track <b>250</b>, and are longitudinally slidable along the track <b>250</b>. More particularly, and with particular reference to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, when the pusher assembly <b>300</b> and the base <b>200</b> are mechanically engaged, the vertical portion <b>342</b> of each leg <b>340</b> abuts or is adjacent a lateral wall <b>254</b> of the tab <b>252</b>, and the horizontal portion <b>344</b> of each leg <b>340</b> abuts or is adjacent a lower wall <b>256</b> of the tab <b>252</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">This engagement between the legs <b>340</b> of the pusher member <b>310</b> and the track <b>250</b> of the base <b>200</b> helps ensure the pusher member <b>310</b> remains on the base <b>200</b> during use of the merchandising system <b>10</b>. More particularly, when torque is applied to the merchandising system (e.g., during loading of the merchandising system <b>10</b> with products “P,” when a consumer's shopping cart bumps into the merchandising system <b>10</b> or the shelf that the merchandising system <b>10</b> is positioned on, etc.) the engagement between the pusher member <b>310</b> (e.g., the legs <b>340</b>) and the base <b>200</b> (e.g., the track <b>250</b>) helps prevent the pusher member <b>310</b> from toppling over. For instance, when a downward force is applied to right side of the pusher member <b>310</b> (e.g., during torquing of the merchandising system <b>10</b>), the legs <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b </i>on the left side of the pusher member <b>310</b> are forced upward. There engagement between the horizontal portions <b>344</b> of these legs <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b </i>and the lower wall <b>256</b> (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>) of a tab <b>252</b> of the track <b>250</b> helps prevent the pusher member <b>310</b> from becoming separated from the base <b>200</b> at that location. Additionally, the engagement between the legs <b>340</b> and the track <b>250</b> helps prevent the pusher member <b>310</b> from intentionally being separated from the base <b>200</b> (e.g., by vandals).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, to install the pusher member <b>310</b> onto the base <b>200</b>, a user positions each leg <b>340</b> adjacent a shortened tab <b>253</b> (i.e., a discontinuity in the track <b>250</b>), and moves the pusher member <b>310</b> proximally or distally such that the horizontal portion <b>344</b> of each leg is under a tab <b>252</b> or a shortened tab <b>253</b> of the track <b>250</b>. It is envisioned that in lieu of, or in addition to shortened tabs <b>253</b>, track <b>250</b> includes a space between adjacent tabs <b>252</b> that is large enough to accommodate the legs <b>340</b> of the pusher member <b>310</b>. It is further envisioned that shortened tabs <b>253</b> (and/or the large space) are located at one or a plurality of locations between the proximal end <b>202</b> and the distal end <b>204</b> of the base <b>200</b> (e.g., not the proximal-most portion of the base <b>200</b> and not the distal-most portion of the base <b>200</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">With reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the proximal member <b>500</b> of the merchandising system <b>10</b> is configured to attach to a proximal end of the base <b>200</b> via a snap-fit connection, for example. It is envisioned that at least a portion of the proximal member <b>500</b> is transparent or translucent to allow a consumer to view a portion of the proximal-most product “P<b>1</b>” on the merchandising system <b>10</b> therethrough. Additionally, in the illustrated embodiment, the proximal member <b>500</b> has an arcuate shape, which is configured to correspond to the contour of the product “P” (e.g., bottle) supported thereagainst. It is also envisioned that the proximal member <b>500</b> includes a scooped portion <b>510</b>. The scooped portion <b>510</b> allows the proximal-most product “P<b>1</b>” to be better viewed by a consumer, allows the proximal-most product “P<b>1</b>” to be tipped down by a consumer to facilitate shopping of the products “P,” and/or facilitates the loading of the products “P” onto the merchandising system <b>10</b>, e.g., by a store employee.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">With particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a lower surface <b>522</b> of a base <b>520</b> of the proximal member <b>500</b> includes a pin <b>530</b> extending downwardly therefrom. The pin <b>530</b> is configured to mechanically engage a hole <b>362</b> disposed on a proximal portion <b>364</b> of the biasing member <b>360</b> (see also <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). Therefore, when the hole <b>362</b> is engaged with the pin <b>530</b> (<figref>FIG. 7B</figref>), the biasing member <b>360</b>, and thus the pusher assembly <b>300</b>, is mechanically coupled to the proximal member <b>500</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Additionally, the merchandising system <b>10</b> is configured to be used on shelves of various depths (i.e., the distance the shelf extends from the wall/support). Specifically, portions of the guide assemblies <b>100</b> are able to be broken-off or otherwise removed to effectively shorten the length of the guide assemblies <b>100</b>. More particularly, and with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B, the base <b>200</b> includes breakaway features <b>260</b>, and the lateral guides <b>400</b> include breakaway features <b>410</b>, that each allow for selective removal of portions of the base <b>200</b> and the lateral guides <b>400</b> to shorten the length of the guide assemblies <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, the distal section <b>450</b> includes the distal rail <b>452</b>, a distal base <b>460</b>, and distal lateral walls <b>470</b>. The distal base <b>460</b> includes a proximally-extending finger <b>462</b> that is configured to engage and interlock with a corresponding cut-out <b>262</b> disposed at a distal end of the base <b>200</b>. Accordingly, the distal section <b>450</b> is able to be removed (<figref>FIG. 14A</figref>), and re-installed (<figref>FIG. 14B</figref>) after one or more portions of the base <b>200</b> and lateral guides <b>400</b> have been removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Further, the pusher assembly <b>300</b> of the merchandising system <b>10</b> is still able to properly function across the breakaway features <b>260</b> and <b>410</b>, the proximally-extending finger <b>462</b> and the cut-out <b>262</b>, after some or all of the portions of the base <b>200</b> and the lateral guides <b>400</b> have been removed, and after the distal section <b>450</b> has been removed and re-installed.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The present disclosure also includes a method of displaying items using the merchandising system <b>10</b> described above, and a method of engaging the pusher assembly <b>300</b> with the base <b>200</b>, as discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">While several embodiments of the disclosure have been shown in the figures, it is not intended that the disclosure be limited thereto, as it is intended that the disclosure be as broad in scope as the art will allow and that the specification be read likewise. Therefore, the above description should not be construed as limiting, but merely as exemplifications of various embodiments.
