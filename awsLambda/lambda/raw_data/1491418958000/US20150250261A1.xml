      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an article of footwear, and in particular to an article of footwear with a cavity viewing system.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Nakano (U.S. patent application publication number 2008/0263894 A1) teaches a footwear sole that includes a shock absorbing device having an upper plate, a lower plate and a plurality of shock absorbing elements that extend from the plates. The lower plate includes an upper surface, a peripheral edge and a peripheral wall that extends upwardly from the peripheral edge to form a shell. The peripheral wall may be integrally formed with the lower plate and both may be molded from plastic, such as TPU, and formed from a transparent material. The plates and the wall of the device are positioned between the upper and the outsole of the shoe and are retained in the heel region of a top surface of the outsole between an upwardly extending rear wall and a front wall. The surface may alternatively include a midsole or other component between the upper and the outsole. When the device is positioned in the heel region of the outsole, the shock absorbing elements are visible through the peripheral wall and/or the lower plate. Likewise, the plate is exposed, in part, through a cutout portion disposed in the heel region of the outsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Wakley (U.S. patent application publication 2007/0113425 A1) teaches a midsole for footwear that includes solid or hollow cushioning tubes. Each tube is the exact width of the midsole so that the tubes are visible from the exterior of the shoe on both of its sides. Both a lower midsole portion and an upper midsole portion have cavities molded in the exact shape of the tubes. The tubes can be open ended at the edge of the midsole or may be enclosed inside a transparent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Weiss (U.S. patent application publication 2006/0179683) teaches a pair of inserts for footwear that may be inserted into any portion of the sole but which are preferably inserted into a heel portion. The inserts each have a compressible core and a transparent and flexible casing for surrounding at least a portion of the cores. The cores may include decorative patterns or ribs which are visible through the transparent casing. A portion of the inserts are exposed at any surface, including the bottom, sides and rear of the shoe so that they may be touched. Moreover, the decorative core is visible through the transparent casing from the exterior of the shoe wherever the insert is exposed. The pair of inserts may alternatively be a single larger insert.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The related art lack provisions for providing a low cost alternative to the shock absorbing devices used in a shoe. There is a need for articles that address the limitations of the related art.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">
        <figref>FIGS. 1 through 9</figref> illustrate views of an exemplary embodiment of article of footwear <b>100</b>. For clarity, the following detailed description discusses an exemplary embodiment, in the form of a sports shoe, but it should be noted that the present invention could take the form of any article of footwear including, but not limited to: hiking boots, soccer shoes, football shoes, sneakers, rugby shoes, basketball shoes, baseball shoes as well as other kinds of shoes. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 through 9</figref>, article of footwear <b>100</b>, also referred to simply as article <b>100</b>, is intended to be used with a right foot; however, it should be understood that the following discussion may equally apply to a mirror image of article of footwear <b>100</b> that is intended for use with a left foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, for purposes of reference, article <b>100</b> may be divided into forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b>. Forefoot portion <b>10</b> may be generally associated with the toes and joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot portion <b>12</b> may be generally associated with the arch of a foot. Likewise, heel portion <b>14</b> may be generally associated with the heel of a foot, including the calcaneus bone. In addition, article <b>100</b> may include lateral side <b>16</b> and medial side <b>18</b>. In particular, lateral side <b>16</b> and medial side <b>18</b> may be opposing sides of article <b>100</b>. Furthermore, both lateral side <b>16</b> and medial side <b>18</b> may extend through forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">It will be understood that forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b> are only intended for purposes of description and are not intended to demarcate precise regions of article <b>100</b>. Likewise, lateral side <b>16</b> and medial side <b>18</b> are intended to represent generally two sides of an article, rather than precisely demarcating article <b>100</b> into two halves. In addition, forefoot portion <b>10</b>, midfoot portion <b>12</b> and heel portion <b>14</b>, as well as lateral side <b>16</b> and medial side <b>18</b>, can also be applied to individual components of an article, such as a sole structure and/or an upper.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">For consistency and convenience, directional adjectives are employed throughout this detailed description corresponding to the illustrated embodiments. The term “longitudinal” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a length of an article. In some cases, the longitudinal direction may extend from a forefoot portion to a heel portion of the article. Also, the term “lateral” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction extending a width of an article. In other words, the lateral direction may extend between a medial side and a lateral side of an article. Furthermore, the term “vertical” as used throughout this detailed description and in the claims refers to a direction generally perpendicular to a lateral and longitudinal direction. For example, in cases where an article is planted flat on a ground surface, the vertical direction may extend from the ground surface upward. It will be understood that each of these directional adjectives may be applied to individual components of an article, such as an upper and/or a sole structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Article <b>100</b> can include upper <b>102</b> and sole structure <b>110</b>. Generally, upper <b>102</b> may be any type of upper.

For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, which is a cross sectional view of article of footwear <b>100</b>, transparent member <b>300</b> may be configured to cover lateral opening <b>204</b>, medial opening <b>206</b>, and lower opening <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In other embodiments, a transparent member may be configured to cover only a portion of a cavity. For example, transparent members may be configured to cover a medial opening and a lateral opening, but not a lower opening. In some embodiments, either a medial opening or a lateral opening may be covered, rather than both. For example, it may be desirable to include a transparent member only on a lateral side of an article of footwear. An exemplary situation in which this may be desirable could be for an article of footwear that is anticipated to be used in harsh environments. In such a case, it may not be desirable to include a transparent member on a medial or lower side, as it could be subjected to much higher levels of abuse than a lateral side of the article of footwear. Such abuse could leave significant markings on a transparent member, which may not be desirable. Different activities may be harsher on other portions of the article of footwear and, therefore, other configurations for transparent members may be implemented in view of the environment and activity for which the article of footwear will be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In addition, it may be desirable to include only one transparent member (e.g., lateral or medial) based on anticipated stresses the shoe will be likely to undergo during use. In some embodiments, the placement of a lateral transparent member that wraps around a lower lateral edge of a sole structure, may provide increased stability to the lateral side of the article of footwear. This may be applicable, for example, to reduce the likelihood of sprained ankles. Similarly, it may be desirable to implement a transparent member on a medial side to provide additional support, for example, to reduce the likelihood of pronation. For such embodiments where lateral and/or medial transparent members are implemented as a stabilizing element, materials may be selected for the transparent members that are suitable for such applications. For example, such suitable materials may be resistant to stretching and/or other modes of deformation.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> illustrate alternative embodiments having transparent members that cover various portions of a cavity. For example, <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional view of an exemplary article of footwear <b>900</b>. Article of footwear <b>900</b> may include many of the same or similar components as article of footwear <b>100</b>. For example, article <b>900</b> may include an upper <b>902</b>, a midsole <b>920</b>, and an outsole <b>922</b>. Article <b>900</b> may also include a cavity <b>950</b> defined by midsole <b>920</b>. For example, midsole <b>920</b> may at least partially define an upper surface of cavity <b>950</b>. In some embodiments, cavity <b>950</b> may include a lateral opening <b>952</b>, a medial opening <b>954</b>, and a lower opening <b>956</b>. Within cavity <b>950</b>, may be disposed elements of an energy return system (or elements having the appearance of an energy return system). For example, one or more protruding portions <b>931</b> may be disposed within cavity <b>950</b>. Although article <b>900</b> may include any suitable number of protruding portions <b>931</b>, <figref>FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> only show a lateral protruding portion <b>932</b> and a medial protruding portion <b>933</b>. These elements may have properties and configurations that are the same or substantially similar to corresponding components of article <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As further shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, article <b>900</b> may include dual transparent members <b>902</b>. For example, article <b>900</b> may include a lateral transparent member <b>910</b> and a medial transparent member <b>912</b>. In some embodiments, one or both of transparent members <b>902</b> may be approximately L-shaped, for example as shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. Transparent members <b>902</b> may be configured to at least partially enclose cavity <b>950</b> by covering lateral opening <b>952</b> and medial opening <b>954</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. As further shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, lower opening <b>956</b> may be covered by outsole <b>922</b>, and thus, in some embodiments, cavity <b>950</b> of article <b>900</b> may not be visible from below article <b>900</b>. Transparent members <b>902</b> may wrap around lower lateral and lower medial portions of cavity <b>950</b>, and extend partially inward (i.e., laterally or medially), along a bottom portion of cavity <b>950</b>, toward a centerline of article <b>900</b>. For example, transparent members <b>902</b> may be disposed at least partially between outsole <b>922</b> and cavity <b>950</b>. In some embodiments, inner end portions <b>904</b> of transparent members <b>902</b> may extend inwardly to a central part of protruding portions <b>931</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. In other embodiments, inner end portions <b>904</b> may extend more inward or less inward.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Outsole <b>922</b> may be associated with the lower portion of cavity <b>950</b>. In some embodiments, outsole <b>922</b> may include an aperture (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). In some embodiments, the aperture may be disposed on at least one of transparent members <b>902</b>. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the interior of cavity <b>950</b> may be visible through the aperture in outsole <b>922</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In some embodiments, ends of protruding portions <b>931</b> may contact either or both of transparent members <b>902</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the end of the protruding portion <b>931</b> may extend to lower opening <b>956</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>. Therefore, in some embodiments, protruding portions <b>931</b> can be viewed through either or both of transparent members <b>902</b>. For example, protruding portions <b>931</b> may be viewed through lateral opening <b>952</b>, medial opening <b>954</b>, and/or lower opening <b>956</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>, in some embodiments, article <b>900</b> may be provided with a transparent member on a medial side of article <b>900</b> but not a lateral side. For example, a medial transparent member <b>960</b> may at least partially enclose cavity <b>950</b> by covering medial opening <b>954</b>. In some embodiments, medial transparent member <b>960</b> may be approximately L-shaped, for example as shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>. In some embodiments, medial transparent member <b>960</b> may extend laterally, along the bottom portion of cavity <b>950</b>, far enough to cover all or part of lower opening <b>956</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">As in other embodiments, outsole <b>922</b> may include an aperture (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). In some embodiments, the aperture may be disposed on medial transparent member <b>960</b>. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the interior of cavity <b>950</b> may be visible through the aperture in outsole <b>922</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, ends of protruding portions <b>931</b> may contact medial transparent member <b>960</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the end of the protruding portion <b>931</b> may extend to lower opening <b>956</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>. Therefore, in some embodiments, protruding portions <b>931</b> can be viewed through medial transparent member <b>960</b>. For example, protruding portions <b>931</b> may be viewed through lateral opening <b>952</b>, medial opening <b>954</b>, and/or lower opening <b>956</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As shown in <figref>FIG. 9C</figref>, in some embodiments, article <b>900</b> may be provided with a transparent member on only a lateral side of article <b>900</b>, but not a medial side. For example, a lateral transparent member <b>970</b> may at least partially enclose cavity <b>950</b> by covering lateral opening <b>952</b>. In some embodiments, medial transparent member <b>960</b> may be approximately L-shaped, for example as shown in <figref>FIG. 9C</figref>. In some embodiments, lateral transparent member <b>970</b> may extend medially, along the bottom portion of cavity <b>950</b>, far enough to cover all or part of lower opening <b>956</b>. In other embodiments, lateral transparent member <b>970</b> may not extend as far medially, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As in other embodiments, outsole <b>922</b> may include an aperture (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). In some embodiments, the aperture may be disposed on lateral transparent member <b>970</b>. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the interior of cavity <b>950</b> may be visible through the aperture in outsole <b>922</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In some embodiments, ends of protruding portions <b>931</b> may contact lateral transparent member <b>970</b>. In some embodiments, the end of the protruding portion <b>931</b> may extend to lower opening <b>956</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9C</figref>. Therefore, in some embodiments, protruding portions <b>931</b> can be viewed through lateral transparent member <b>970</b>. For example, protruding portions <b>931</b> may be viewed through lateral opening <b>952</b>, medial opening <b>954</b>, and/or lower opening <b>956</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">As discussed above with respect to transparent members <b>902</b>, lateral transparent member <b>970</b> may extend medially any suitable distance. Therefore, lateral transparent member <b>970</b> may or may not be contacted by protruding portions <b>931</b>. Further, the aperture in outsole <b>922</b> may or may not be disposed on lateral transparent member <b>970</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">It should be noted that any of the configurations discussed with respect to <figref>FIGS. 9A-9C</figref> may be combined in any suitable way. For example, medial transparent member <b>960</b> could be employed in the same embodiment as lateral transparent member <b>970</b>. If medial transparent member <b>960</b> and lateral transparent member <b>970</b> are configured as shown in <figref>FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>, combining these two transparent members would leave only a small gap between the lower portion of these transparent members. Such a configuration is among many envisaged combinations. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize suitable configurations and combinations of the disclosed transparent members.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">A midsole can include provisions for receiving a transparent member in a manner that provides for a generally smooth outer surface on the sole structure. In some embodiments, a ledge of a peripheral portion can be shaped to receive a peripheral portion of a transparent member. In an exemplary embodiment, a ledge may be configured with a depth that is substantially similar to the thickness of the transparent member in order to provide a generally flush arrangement on an outer surface of the midsole. In other embodiments, however, a midsole may not include a ledge and instead a transparent member may have a tapered peripheral portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In this embodiment, midsole <b>120</b> can include provisions for receiving transparent member <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> may be shaped to receive second peripheral portion <b>310</b> of transparent member <b>300</b>. In some cases, lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> may be configured to receive transparent member <b>300</b> in a manner so that transparent member <b>300</b> is substantially flush with lower portion <b>132</b>, lateral portion <b>134</b> and medial portion <b>136</b>. For example, in one embodiment, depth D<b>1</b> of lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> may be substantially similar to thickness T<b>1</b> of second peripheral portion <b>310</b>. This arrangement can be seen in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, which is a cross sectional view of article of footwear <b>100</b>. With this arrangement, transparent member <b>300</b> may be substantially flush with an outer surface <b>150</b> of midsole <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, depth D<b>1</b> could be substantially larger than thickness T<b>1</b> so that transparent member <b>300</b> is recessed with respect to outer surface <b>150</b>. In still other embodiments, depth D<b>1</b> could be substantially less than thickness T<b>1</b> so that transparent member <b>300</b> is raised with respect to outer surface <b>150</b> of midsole <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">As discussed above, in different embodiments, depth D<b>1</b> of lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> can vary. In some cases, the value of depth D<b>1</b> can be selected according to the thickness of transparent member <b>300</b>. For example, in one embodiment, if the value of thickness T<b>1</b> of second peripheral portion <b>310</b> of transparent member <b>300</b> is known, the value of depth D<b>1</b> can be selected to accommodate thickness T<b>1</b>. In other cases, wherein the value of depth D<b>1</b> is known, the value of thickness T<b>1</b> can be selected to accommodate the value of depth D<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 6 through 9</figref>, in some embodiments, outsole <b>122</b> may be configured to cover lower portion <b>132</b> of midsole <b>120</b>. Furthermore, heel portion <b>14</b> of outsole <b>122</b> may cover a portion of transparent member <b>300</b>. In particular, outsole <b>122</b> may be configured to cover intermediate portion <b>306</b> of transparent member <b>300</b>. In contrast, first end portion <b>302</b> and second end portion <b>304</b> of transparent member <b>300</b> may be visible on lateral portion <b>134</b> and medial portion <b>136</b>, respectively, of midsole <b>120</b>, since outsole <b>122</b> does not extend to lateral portion <b>134</b> or medial portion <b>136</b> of midsole <b>120</b>. With this arrangement, protruding portion set <b>230</b> may be substantially visible through transparent member <b>300</b> on medial portion <b>136</b> and lateral portion <b>134</b>. This configuration may allow article <b>100</b> to provide the appearance of an energy return system used in some types of footwear at a substantially reduced cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In some embodiments, one or more protruding portions of protruding portion set <b>230</b> may be configured to extend to transparent member <b>300</b>. For example, in one embodiment, second end <b>244</b> of first protruding portion <b>231</b> may be configured to contact intermediate portion <b>306</b> of transparent member <b>300</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. In a similar manner, the ends of second protruding portion <b>232</b>, third protruding portion <b>233</b> and fourth protruding portion <b>234</b> may be configured to contact transparent member <b>300</b>. With this arrangement, protruding portion set <b>230</b> may be configured to transmit vertical forces within midsole <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, however, one or more protruding portions of protruding portion set <b>230</b> may be spaced apart from transparent member <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">An article including a transparent member can include provisions for preventing portions of an outsole from covering the transparent member on a lower portion of the midsole. In some cases, an outsole can be provided with an aperture or hole for viewing the transparent member on the lower portion of the midsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of article <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, outsole <b>122</b> is provided with aperture <b>600</b>. Aperture <b>600</b> may be configured to extend through the entire depth of outsole <b>122</b>. In particular, aperture <b>600</b> may be configured so that intermediate portion <b>306</b> of transparent member <b>300</b> may be visible through aperture <b>600</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In different embodiments, the geometry of aperture <b>600</b> can vary. In some cases, aperture <b>600</b> can have a square like geometry. In other cases, aperture <b>600</b> can have a rectangular geometry. In still other cases, aperture <b>600</b> can have a rounded geometry. In still other cases, aperture <b>600</b> can have any other type of geometry including regular polygonal geometries, symmetric geometries, irregular geometries and asymmetric geometries. In an exemplary embodiment, aperture <b>600</b> can have a substantially rectangular shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In different embodiments, the size of aperture <b>600</b> can vary. For example, in some cases, the size of aperture <b>600</b> can be selected so that aperture <b>600</b> has an approximately similar size to intermediate portion <b>306</b> of transparent member <b>300</b>. In other cases, the size of aperture <b>600</b> can be selected so that aperture <b>600</b> is substantially larger than intermediate portion <b>306</b>. In still other cases, the size of aperture <b>600</b> can be selected so that aperture <b>600</b> has a substantially smaller size than intermediate portion <b>306</b>. In still another embodiment, aperture <b>600</b> can have a size that is slightly smaller than intermediate portion <b>306</b>. In particular, for example, the size of aperture <b>600</b> can be selected so that a lowered peripheral ledge is not substantially visible through aperture <b>600</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Although a single aperture is used in the current embodiment, other embodiments can include two or more apertures. In some cases, multiple apertures can be arranged in a pattern on outsole <b>122</b> adjacent to intermediate portion <b>306</b> to increase the visibility of intermediate portion <b>306</b> through outsole <b>122</b>. In addition, in some cases, any number of apertures can be applied to other portions of outsole <b>122</b> to reveal the lower portion of midsole <b>120</b> as well as transparent member <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">
        <figref>FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> may be generally illustrative of a method of making article of footwear <b>100</b>. The following discussion includes steps for one method of making article of footwear <b>100</b>, but it should be understood that in other embodiments different steps may be used. In some cases, one or more of the steps discussed below may be optional. In other cases, additional steps could be provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Referring back to <figref>FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, during a first step of making article of footwear <b>100</b>, midsole <b>120</b> can be formed with cavity <b>200</b> on lower portion <b>132</b>, lateral portion <b>134</b> and medial portion <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, cavity <b>200</b> can be formed on midsole <b>120</b> by using a molding technique for forming midsole <b>120</b> that is configured to form cavity <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the molding technique can be configured to form protruding portion set <b>230</b> simultaneously with cavity <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, cavity <b>200</b> can be cut from midsole <b>120</b> after midsole <b>120</b> has been formed. In such embodiments, cavity <b>200</b> can be cut out in a manner that leaves protruding portion set <b>230</b> formed within cavity <b>200</b>. In still other embodiments, other techniques known in the art for forming cavities in any portion of a sole structure can be used for forming cavity <b>200</b> and protruding portion set <b>230</b>. It will also be understood that in embodiments not including a protruding portion, the method can include steps for forming a cavity in a midsole without forming any protruding portions.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In some embodiments, lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> can also be formed on first peripheral portion <b>240</b> of cavity <b>200</b>. In embodiments where midsole <b>120</b> is molded, the mold can include features to form lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b>. In other embodiments, lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> can be cut from midsole <b>120</b> after midsole <b>120</b> has been formed. In still other embodiments, lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> could be formed in any other manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Once midsole <b>120</b> has been formed with cavity <b>200</b> and including protruding portion set <b>230</b>, midsole <b>120</b> can be associated with transparent member <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, transparent member <b>300</b> can have an initially flat shape. During the step of associating transparent member <b>300</b> with cavity <b>200</b>, transparent member <b>300</b> can be bent in a manner so that the geometry of transparent member <b>300</b> conforms to the geometry of lower opening <b>202</b>, lateral opening <b>204</b> and medial opening <b>206</b> of cavity <b>200</b>. In particular, first end portion <b>302</b> may be bent with respect to intermediate portion <b>306</b> to form first bend <b>320</b>. Likewise, second end portion <b>304</b> may be bent with respect to intermediate portion <b>306</b> to form second bend <b>322</b>. With this arrangement, transparent member <b>300</b> may be formed into an approximate U shape. In other embodiments, however, transparent member <b>300</b> may be pre-formed with a bent geometry.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Next, transparent member <b>300</b> may be applied to midsole <b>120</b> in a manner that covers cavity <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, second peripheral portion <b>310</b> may be applied to first peripheral portion <b>240</b>. In particular, second peripheral portion <b>310</b> can be disposed against lowered peripheral ledge <b>242</b> to provide a substantially flush outer surface <b>150</b> for midsole <b>120</b>. Furthermore, first end portion <b>302</b> may be applied in a manner that covers lateral opening <b>204</b>. Also, second end portion <b>304</b> may be applied in a manner that covers medial opening <b>206</b>. In addition, intermediate portion <b>306</b> may be applied in a manner that covers lower opening <b>202</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, an adhesive can be applied between first peripheral portion <b>240</b> and second peripheral portion <b>310</b>. This arrangement may provide a secure attachment of transparent member <b>300</b> to midsole <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In some embodiments, outsole <b>122</b> can be applied to lower portion <b>132</b> after transparent member <b>300</b> has been joined with midsole <b>120</b>. In embodiments where outsole <b>122</b> includes an aperture configured to provide a view of intermediate portion <b>306</b>, the aperture can be aligned with intermediate portion <b>306</b>. In other embodiments, however, an outsole may not be applied to lower portion <b>132</b>. Instead, lower portion <b>132</b> can be configured as a ground contacting surface for article of footwear <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Using this arrangement, an article of footwear can be made that allows an observer to view the interior of a cavity that is disposed internally to a sole structure. Furthermore, in embodiments where the cavity is filled with one or more structures, the structures can be easily viewed on lower, medial and/or lateral portions of the sole structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Although the embodiments discussed above illustrate a cavity associated with a lower portion of a midsole, in other embodiments a cavity could be associated with any other portion of a midsole. For example, in another embodiment, a cavity could be associated with an upper portion of a midsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">
        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another alternative embodiment of article of footwear <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, cavity <b>700</b> may be associated with upper portion <b>702</b>, lateral portion <b>134</b> and medial portion <b>136</b> of midsole <b>120</b>. In particular, the geometry of cavity <b>700</b> may be substantially similar to the geometry of cavity <b>200</b> of the previous embodiments. In contrast to the previous embodiments, however, cavity <b>700</b> may be disposed adjacent to upper <b>102</b> (shown in phantom), rather than outsole <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">Cavity <b>700</b> can include protruding portion set <b>730</b>. In some cases, protruding portion set <b>730</b> can be substantially similar to protruding portion <b>230</b> discussed in the previous embodiment. Furthermore, protruding portion set <b>730</b> may be associated with lower surface <b>720</b> of cavity <b>700</b>. In other words, protruding portion set <b>730</b> may extend upwards from lower surface <b>720</b> towards upper portion <b>702</b> of midsole <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In addition, article <b>100</b> includes transparent member <b>800</b> that is configured with a substantially similar shape to the shape of transparent member <b>300</b> discussed above. In particular, transparent member <b>800</b> is configured with a shape that covers the opening of cavity <b>700</b>. With this arrangement, cavity <b>700</b> is visible on medial portion <b>136</b> and lateral portion <b>134</b> of midsole <b>120</b>. However, using this arrangement, cavity <b>700</b> may not be visible on upper portion <b>702</b> of midsole <b>120</b>, since upper portion <b>702</b> is covered by upper <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In addition to providing visibility, transparent member <b>800</b> can be configured to provide enhanced cushioning for a foot disposed within upper <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments, transparent member <b>800</b> can be disposed below a heel of a foot. During use, as a heel is depressed downwards, transparent member <b>800</b> may deflect downwards towards protruding portion set <b>730</b>.
