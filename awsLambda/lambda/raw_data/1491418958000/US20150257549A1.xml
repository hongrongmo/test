      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to refrigeration systems and, more specifically, to a modular refrigeration system utilizing a low charge hydrocarbon refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A refrigerated merchandiser is generally known in the art. A refrigerated merchandiser is used by grocers, convenience stores, or other sellers of food items to store and display food items within a predetermined temperature range. Refrigerated merchandisers may employ different refrigerants to maintain the predetermined temperature range. Examples of refrigerants may include, but are not limited to, hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), HFC blends (including R-404A and R-407A), ammonia, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Unlike inert refrigerants, hydrocarbon refrigerants have additional government regulations due to flammability and/or toxicity. Typically, regulations focus on limiting the quantity of hydrocarbon refrigerant in a single refrigeration circuit. For example, propane is an approved hydrocarbon for use as a refrigerant in certain applications, including commercial refrigerated merchandisers. However, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the amount of propane which may be used to charge a single refrigeration circuit. For example, the EPA typically limits the refrigerant charge in a refrigeration circuit to 150 grams or less of propane refrigerant. This is for safety purposes in order to limit the potential for a dangerous ignition should the propane refrigerant leak from the refrigeration circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In order to meet commercial refrigeration demands while also complying with hydrocarbon charge regulations, a single commercially available refrigerated merchandiser will typically employ a plurality of refrigeration circuits that operate in parallel. Each refrigeration circuit will have a refrigeration charge of no more than 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant. The refrigeration circuits cooperatively operate to provide a desired amount of refrigeration.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, refrigerated merchandisers employing a plurality of refrigeration circuits have certain undesirable characteristics. For example, additional components are necessary to operate each of the separate refrigeration circuits. The additional components may include, but are not limited to, additional piping, compressors, condensers, and control technology to achieve a desired amount of refrigeration in the merchandiser. These additional components not only increase initial costs of constructing refrigerated merchandiser systems, but typically lead to higher maintenance costs to maintain the additional components over the life of the systems. Also, the parallel refrigeration circuits in commercially available merchandisers do not maximize cooling load. Instead, the total amount of hydrocarbon refrigerant associated with the merchandiser is increased. So while each refrigeration circuit complies with government regulations, the total amount of hydrocarbon refrigerant associated with the merchandiser exceeds 150 grams, and typically is between 150 and 600 grams.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The invention provides, in one aspect, a modular refrigeration system. The system includes a refrigeration loop having a compressor, a condenser, an expansion assembly, and a chiller interconnected by a first piping loop, the first piping loop cycles hydrocarbon refrigerant. A high side cooling loop includes a first heat exchanger and a first pump interconnected with the condenser by a second piping loop, the second piping loop cycles a cooling fluid, the cooling fluid exchanges heat with the hydrocarbon refrigerant at the condenser. A low side cooling loop includes a second heat exchanger and a second pump interconnected with the chiller by a third piping loop, the third piping loop cycles a chilled fluid, the chilled fluid exchanges heat with the hydrocarbon refrigerant at the chiller. A space supports the second heat exchanger and is configured to be maintained within a predetermined temperature range, wherein the total charge of hydrocarbon refrigerant associated with the space does not exceed 150 grams.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The invention provides, in another aspect, a refrigeration system. The system includes a refrigeration loop having a compressor, a first heat exchanger, and an expansion assembly, and a second heat exchanger interconnected by a first piping loop, the first piping loop circulating a hydrocarbon refrigerant. A cooling loop circulates a cooling fluid in heat exchange relationship with the hydrocarbon refrigerant within the second heat exchanger, the cooling loop including a pump interconnected with the second heat exchanger and a third heat exchanger by a second piping loop, wherein the third heat exchanger is in heat exchange relationship with an airflow passing through the third heat exchanger, and wherein the airflow is in communication with a space adapted to support product to be cooled.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The invention provides, in another aspect, a merchandiser having a case defining a product support area and a refrigeration loop. The refrigeration loop includes a compressor, a heat exchanger, an expansion assembly, and an evaporator fluidly interconnected with each other, the evaporator being disposed in the case, and the refrigeration loop circulating a hydrocarbon refrigerant in heat exchange relationship with an airflow within the case to condition the product support area, wherein the evaporator includes a single, continuous coil through which the hydrocarbon refrigerant is circulated.</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Before any embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail, it should be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details or construction and the arrangement of components as set forth in the following description or as illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. It should be understood that the description of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the disclosure from covering all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The invention illustrated in the Figures and disclosed herein is generally directed to a multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> for a merchandiser <b>10</b>. The system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> includes a charge of hydrocarbon refrigerant (e.g., propane) not only within regulatory requirements, the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> also includes a single refrigerant loop charged with hydrocarbon refrigerant. For example, the refrigerant charge of the total system does not exceed 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant. Thus, the merchandiser <b>10</b> will have a reduced total amount of hydrocarbon refrigerant over known merchandisers. By implementing the multi-stage system disclosed herein, a larger cooling load is placed upon the hydrocarbon refrigerant to provide fewer refrigeration circuits relative to known merchandisers.

        <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref> illustrate exemplary multi-stage modular refrigeration systems <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> for providing refrigeration to the merchandiser <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>100</b> includes circuits or fluid loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> arranged in heat transfer relationship to provide refrigeration to the merchandiser <b>10</b>. The illustrated refrigeration loop <b>110</b> circulates a hydrocarbon refrigerant (e.g., propane) and is defined as a vapor-compression refrigeration loop (referred to as the ârefrigeration loop <b>110</b>â for purposes of description only). More specifically, the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> includes a compressor <b>112</b>, a condenser <b>116</b>, an expansion assembly <b>118</b>, and a chiller <b>119</b>. The compressor <b>112</b> is in fluid connection with the condenser <b>116</b> via piping <b>114</b>, which also fluidly connects the condenser <b>116</b> to the expansion assembly <b>118</b>, the expansion assembly <b>118</b> to the chiller <b>119</b>, and the chiller <b>119</b> to the compressor <b>112</b> to form the refrigeration loop <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The compressor <b>112</b> may be any suitable mechanical assembly for increasing the pressure of the hydrocarbon refrigerant within refrigeration loop <b>110</b>. The condenser <b>116</b> may be any suitable heat exchanging assembly for condensing hydrocarbon refrigerant from a gaseous state to a liquid state, and transferring heat away from the hydrocarbon refrigerant. The expansion assembly <b>118</b> may be any suitable flow-restricting or metering assembly causing a reduction in pressure of the hydrocarbon refrigerant, including, but not limited to, an expansion valve that may be either internally equalized or externally equalized. The chiller <b>119</b> may be any suitable heat exchanging assembly for transferring heat from a chilled fluid to the hydrocarbon refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The refrigeration loop <b>110</b> may be hermetically sealed to avoid discharge or loss of the hydrocarbon refrigerant. The refrigeration loop <b>110</b> provides for cycling or circulation of hydrocarbon refrigerant within the loop from the compressor <b>112</b> to the condenser <b>116</b>, through the expansion assembly <b>118</b> to the chiller <b>119</b>, and return to the compressor <b>112</b>. Preferably, the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> will have a refrigeration charge of hydrocarbon refrigerant that does not exceed government limits for such refrigerants, and is within regulatory requirements. For example, the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> has a refrigerant charge limit of no more than 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant such as propane. It should be appreciated that the term âhydrocarbon refrigerantâ used herein may include other classifications of flammable or toxic refrigerants, including A2L rated refrigerants. Other refrigerants may have alternative refrigerant charge limit regulations. For example, an A2L rated refrigerant has a charge limit of 500 grams.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the refrigeration system <b>100</b> also includes a second circuit or fluid loop or low side loop <b>120</b> (referred to as the âlow side loop <b>120</b>â for purposes of description only). The low side loop <b>120</b> may be a low side chilled fluid loop that provides a chilled fluid to refrigerate or otherwise maintain a desired temperature of the merchandiser <b>10</b>. The chilled fluid can include hydrofluoroether (HFE), or another chilled fluid suitable for providing refrigeration to the merchandiser <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The low side loop <b>120</b> includes the chiller <b>119</b>, a pump <b>122</b>, and a heat exchanger <b>126</b>. The pump <b>122</b> is in fluid communication with the chiller <b>119</b> via loop piping <b>124</b>. The piping <b>124</b> also fluidly connects the chiller <b>119</b> to the heat exchanger <b>126</b>, and the heat exchanger <b>126</b> to the chiller <b>119</b> to form the loop <b>120</b>. As illustrated, the heat exchanger <b>126</b> defines an evaporator of the merchandiser <b>10</b> that conditions the product support area <b>60</b> via heat exchange with air that flows through the evaporator prior to being discharged into the product support area <b>60</b>. The piping <b>124</b> may be any suitable material or arrangement to provide a fluid connection within the loop <b>120</b> between the chiller <b>119</b>, the pump <b>122</b>, and the heat exchanger <b>126</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The low side loop <b>120</b> cycles or circulates the chilled liquid in heat exchange relationship with the hydrocarbon refrigerant in the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> within the chiller <b>119</b>. That is, heat absorbed by fluid circulating within the heat exchanger <b>126</b> (due to heat transfer with the air passing through the heat exchanger <b>126</b>) transfers to the hydrocarbon refrigerant circulating within the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> to cool the fluid in the loop <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the refrigeration system <b>100</b> also includes a third circuit or fluid loop or high side loop <b>130</b> (referred to as the âhigh side loop <b>130</b>â for purposes of description only). The high side loop <b>130</b> defines a high side cooling fluid loop that circulates a cooling fluid to the condenser <b>116</b> to absorb heat from the hydrocarbon refrigerant in the refrigeration loop <b>110</b>. The cooling fluid can be water or a mixture of water and ethylene glycol, or another suitable coolant.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The high side loop <b>130</b> includes the condenser <b>116</b>, a pump <b>132</b>, and a heat exchanger <b>136</b>. The pump <b>132</b> is fluidly connected to the condenser <b>116</b> by loop piping <b>134</b>. The piping <b>134</b> also fluidly connects the condenser <b>116</b> to the heat exchanger <b>136</b>, and the heat exchanger <b>136</b> to the condenser <b>116</b> to form the high side loop <b>130</b>. One or more fans <b>138</b> can be provided at the heat exchanger <b>136</b> to assist in discharging heat from the cooling fluid. The piping <b>134</b> may be any suitable material or arrangement to provide a fluid connection within the loop <b>130</b> between the condenser <b>116</b>, the pump <b>132</b>, and the heat exchanger <b>136</b>. The heat exchanger <b>136</b> may be any suitable assembly for transferring heat from the cooling fluid in the loop <b>130</b>. For example, the heat exchanger <b>136</b> may include, but is not limited to, an air-to-fluid or air-to-water heat exchanger.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The high side loop <b>130</b> is in heat exchange relationship with the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> within the condenser <b>116</b>. More specifically, heat in the hydrocarbon refrigerant is absorbed by the cooling fluid circulating through the high side loop <b>130</b> within the condenser <b>116</b> to cool the hydrocarbon refrigerant, which in turn absorbs heat from the low side loop <b>120</b> as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The components of the refrigeration, low side, and high side loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> may be positioned together at a single location such as at the merchandiser <b>10</b>. For example, one or more of the refrigeration, low side, and/or high side loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> may be provided on the canopy <b>30</b> and/or within the base <b>20</b> of merchandiser <b>10</b>. In another example, some or all of the components of the high side loop <b>130</b> may be positioned at a remote location from the refrigeration and/or low side loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. More specifically, the pump <b>132</b>, the heat exchanger <b>136</b>, and/or the fans <b>138</b> may be provided at a remote location away from the refrigeration and/or the low side loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. In addition, the low side and/or the high side loops <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> may be assembled as separate modules. The modular assembly will allow for an end user to optionally use existing equipment in place of one or more modules. For example, an end user may omit a module and instead use one or more existing pumps, piping, and/or heat exchangers in the loops <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In operation of the refrigeration system <b>100</b>, hydrocarbon refrigerant is cycled through refrigeration loop <b>110</b>. The hydrocarbon refrigerant flows from the chiller <b>119</b> to the compressor <b>112</b>, which compresses the hydrocarbon refrigerant in a gas phase. The compressor <b>112</b> also acts as the circulation device for the hydrocarbon refrigerant within the refrigeration loop <b>110</b>. Compressed hydrocarbon refrigerant exits the compressor <b>112</b> and travels to the condenser <b>116</b>. In the condenser <b>116</b>, heat from the gas phase hydrocarbon refrigerant transfers to the cooling fluid circulating through the high side loop <b>130</b>. Heat transfer within the condenser <b>116</b> condenses the hydrocarbon refrigerant from a gas to a gas-liquid mixture or liquid. The condensed hydrocarbon refrigerant exits the condenser <b>116</b> and travels to the expansion assembly <b>118</b>, which restricts the flow of hydrocarbon refrigerant traveling to the chiller <b>119</b>, causing a drop in pressure. The drop in pressure results in the hydrocarbon refrigerant changing phase to a gas. This direct expansion of the hydrocarbon refrigerant in the chiller <b>119</b> cools the fluid circulating through the low side loop <b>120</b>. More specifically, the hydrocarbon refrigerant absorbs heat from the fluid in the low side loop <b>120</b> within the chiller <b>119</b>. The heated hydrocarbon refrigerant exits the chiller <b>119</b> and returns to the compressor <b>112</b>, where the cycle repeats.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As hydrocarbon refrigerant cycles through the refrigeration loop <b>110</b>, fluid also cycles through the low side loop <b>120</b> and cooling fluid cycles through the high side loop <b>130</b>. In the low side loop <b>120</b>, the pump <b>122</b> acts as the circulation device for the fluid. The fluid exits the pump <b>122</b> and travels to the heat exchanger <b>126</b>, where the fluid is heated by heat exchange with warmer air flowing through the heat exchanger <b>126</b> to cool the air. The heated fluid then flows to the chiller <b>119</b>, where the fluid is cooled by heat exchange with the hydrocarbon refrigerant (by direct expansion of the hydrocarbon refrigerant). The chilled fluid exits the chiller <b>119</b> and returns to the pump <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the high side loop <b>130</b>, the pump <b>132</b> acts as the circulation device for the cooling fluid. The cooling fluid exits the pump <b>132</b> and travels to the heat exchanger <b>136</b>, where the temperature of the cooling fluid decreases due to rejection of heat to the surrounding environment. The lower temperature cooling fluid exits the heat exchanger <b>136</b> and flows to the condenser <b>116</b>. In the condenser <b>116</b>, the cooling fluid is heated via heat exchange with the hydrocarbon refrigerant (i.e. the cooling fluid absorbs heat from the hydrocarbon refrigerant). The higher temperature cooling fluid exits the condenser <b>116</b>, and travels to the pump <b>132</b>, where the cycle repeats.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another exemplary multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>200</b>. Except as described below, the multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>200</b> is the same as the refrigeration system <b>100</b> described with regard to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and common elements are given the same reference numerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the refrigeration system <b>200</b> includes the refrigeration loop <b>110</b> and the low side loop <b>120</b>. However, refrigeration system <b>200</b> does not include a high side loop, such as loop <b>130</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Instead, the system <b>200</b> includes one or more fans <b>138</b> that are positioned in communication with the condenser <b>116</b> to direct air through the condenser <b>116</b>. The air acts as a medium to cool the propane refrigerant within the condenser without an intermediate cooling fluid as described and illustrated with regard to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates yet another exemplary multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>300</b>. Except as described below, the multi-stage modular refrigeration system <b>200</b> is the same as the refrigeration system <b>100</b> described with regard to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and common elements are given the same reference numerals.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The refrigeration system <b>300</b> includes the high side loop <b>130</b> and a low side refrigeration loop <b>310</b>. As illustrated, the refrigeration loop <b>310</b> circulates a hydrocarbon refrigerant (e.g., propane) and includes an evaporator <b>319</b> that is positioned in the merchandiser <b>10</b> to condition the product support area <b>60</b> via heat exchange with air flowing through the evaporator <b>319</b>. The refrigeration loop <b>310</b> may be hermetically sealed to avoid discharge or loss of hydrocarbon refrigerant. The compressor <b>112</b> compresses hydrocarbon refrigerant and acts as the circulation device for the loop <b>310</b>. Accordingly, refrigerant flows from the compressor <b>112</b> to the condenser <b>116</b>, and then exits the condenser <b>116</b> and travels through the expansion assembly <b>118</b> to the evaporator <b>319</b> before returning to the compressor <b>112</b>. Refrigeration loop <b>310</b> has a refrigerant charge that is no more than 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In operation of the refrigeration system <b>300</b>, hydrocarbon refrigerant is circulated through the refrigeration loop <b>310</b> to cool air that is eventually directed to the product support area <b>60</b> to condition product supported therein. Heated hydrocarbon refrigerant from the evaporator <b>319</b> is compressed by the compressor <b>112</b> and then cooled via heat exchange with the cooling fluid in the high side loop <b>130</b> within the condenser <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">By utilizing fluid loops arranged in heat transfer relationship, the refrigeration system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> reduces the total hydrocarbon refrigerant needed to refrigerate the product support area <b>60</b> by increasing the cooling load on the hydrocarbon refrigerant. Unlike known systems, the series arrangement of fluid loops and use of hydrocarbon refrigerant provides a single hydrocarbon refrigerant loop that maintains the area <b>60</b> within the desired parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Further, the series arrangement of fluid loops eliminates or at least reduces duplicative refrigeration components (e.g., pumps, compressors, piping, etc.) within the system <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>. In addition, the modular assembly of multi-stage loops <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>310</b> allows an end user to optionally utilize existing equipment in place of one or more modules while still maximizing the use of hydrocarbon refrigerant. For example, an end user may omit a module and instead use one or more existing pumps, piping, and/or heat exchangers in place of the omitted module.</p>
