      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates to chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) process. More specifically, the present invention is directed to methods or processes of reducing (treating) trace metal contaminants and smaller or fine sized cerium oxide particles in cerium oxide particles or cerium oxide slurry and in STI polishing compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) compositions for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) generally contain abrasive such as cerium oxide particles or colloidal cerium oxide particles, and suitable dispersing agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,490 discloses the polishing compositions containing abrasive particles and exhibiting normal stress effects. The slurry further contains non-polishing particles resulting in reduced polishing rate at recesses, while the abrasive particles maintain high polish rates at elevations. This leads to improved planarization. More specifically, the slurry comprises cerium oxide particles and polymeric electrolyte, and can be used for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) polishing applications.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As another example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,964,923 teaches the polishing compositions containing cerium oxide particles and polymeric electrolyte for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) polishing applications. Polymeric electrolyte being used includes the salts of polyacrylic acid, similar as those in U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,490. Ceria, alumina, silica &amp; zirconia are used as abrasives. Molecular weight for such listed polyelectrolyte is from 300 to 20,000, but in overall, &lt;100,000.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, those Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) polishing compositions usually contain trace metal contaminants, that are known to cause defects in a STI CMP process. The trace metal contaminants include, but not limited, to Al, Zr, Fe, Ni, Mg and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In addition, very small and fine cerium or colloidal cerium oxide particles in the STI polishing compositions are also known to cause defects in a STI CMP process.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Thus, there is still a need for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) polishing compositions that provide reduced trace metal contaminants; and reduced very small and fine cerium oxide particles to achieve reduced defects in a STI chemical and mechanical polishing (CMP) process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Described herein are CMP polishing compositions for Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) process. The CMP polishing compositions provide reduced polishing defects due to the reduced trace metal contaminants and reduced smaller or fine sized cerium oxide particles. Described herein are also methods of reducing trace metal contaminants and smaller sized cerium oxide particles from cerium oxide slurries or Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) CMP polishing composition.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0025">Trace metal contaminants in polishing compositions include, but not limited, to Al, Zr, Fe, Ni, Mg and others. In general, trace metal contaminants and the smaller sized (&lt;10 nm) cerium oxide particles in polishing compositions are considered to be two root causes for the potentially increased nano-sized particle related defects. Trace metal ions and their related oxide particles can migrate or penetrate into the oxide film lattices, forming nano-sized residues on wafer surfaces in a STI CMP process.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0026">The present invention is directed to methods or processes of reducing trace metal contaminants and smaller or fine sized cerium oxide particles in cerium oxide particles or cerium oxide slurry or ceria abrasive. The present invention is also directed to methods or processes of reducing trace metal contaminants and smaller or fine sized cerium oxide particles in STI polishing compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0027">Removing or reducing trace metal contaminants and smaller sized cerium oxide particles in ceria abrasives or STI polishing compositions can reduce the defects that might be introduced from these trace metal contaminants or smaller sized cerium oxide particles in a STI CMP process.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0028">A number of treating methods or embodiments for reducing trace metal and smaller sized and fine cerium oxide particles are described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0029">Chemical Chelator Treatment</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0030">A chemic additive acting as chelator is added into the cerium oxide slurry or STI polishing compositions. The chemical chelator reacts with trace metal ions to form neutral, or charged metal ion-chelator complexes. The complexes can be removed more easily from wafer surface in a STI CMP process. Thus, the trace metal contaminants induced defects can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0031">Ion-Exchange Resin Treatment</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0032">An ion-exchange resin is used to treat cerium oxide slurry to remove or reduce trace metal ions from the cerium oxide slurry.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0033">Ultra Filtration Treatment</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0034">Ultra filtration is used to remove or reduce trace metal contaminants ions from the cerium oxide slurry.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0035">Deionized Water Washing and Centrifuge Treatment</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0036">To remove smaller fine sized cerium oxide particles, a cerium oxide slurry is rinsed with deionized water (DI water) and then centrifuged. The treated cerium oxide particles are used for the preparation of STI polishing compositions to reduce the defects caused by the smaller sized cerium oxide particles on the wafer surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0037">Chemical Additive Treatment</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0038">By adding suitable chemical additives into the cerium oxide slurry, the solution is treated either at room temperature or at elevated temperature with subsequent pH adjustment.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0039">In such treatment, the suitable chemical additives can react with various trace metal ions to form water soluble chemical additive-metal ion complexes so that such water soluble chemical additive-metal ion complexes can be removed from the supernatant solution phase after centrifuging the treated cerium oxide slurry.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0040">The cerium oxide slurry being treated by any one of the method described above, can be further treated by any other, or any combinations of other methods. For example, the cerium oxide slurry being treated by suitable chemical additives, can be further treated by any one, or combinations of, Chemical Chelator Treatment; ion exchange resin treatment, ultra filtration treatment, and deionized water washing and centrifuge treatment described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0041">Upon the reduction of trace metal contaminants in the cerium oxide slurry, the treated cerium oxide slurry is used to make STI polishing compositions. The defects, such as metal ion penetrating into silicon oxide films or forming nano-sized residues on wafer surfaces from a STI CMP process can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0042">In the following working examples, a STI polishing composition comprising 1.5 wt % cerium oxide with density larger than 6.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; 0.1 to 0.5 wt % an ammonium salt of polyacrylic acid; a biocide ranging from 0.0001% to 0.05%, and solvent being deionized water, was prepared. This STI polishing composition was used as a base/control reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0043">A cerium oxide slurry comprising 40 wt % cerium oxide particles, and solvent being deionized water was also prepared and used as a base/control reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Chemical Chelator Treatment</heading>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0044">By adding a chemical additive as chelator (or ligand) to a STI polishing composition or a cerium oxide slurry, the chelator reacts with trace metal ions to form Metal Ion-Chelator complexes.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0045">The metal-ion-chelator complexes can be in neutral form with no net charges on the whole complex molecules or can be the complexes either carrying positive charges or negative charges. The preferred form of the complexes is a non-charged neutral complex compound in aqueous solutions. The neutral complexes have less interactions with the silicon oxide films to be polished.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0046">The complexes are removed more easily from wafer surface in a STI CMP process to potentially reduce or prevent the adhesion and the penetration of trace metal ions onto or into the high density silicon dioxide films. Thus, the trace metal contaminants induced defects can be reduced to enhance polishing performance with reduced total defects.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0047">Examples of the chelators or ligands that can be used to form metal-ion-chelator complexes or metal-ion-ligand complexes include but not limited to: a). organic acids; b). amino acids; c). organic acid derivatives; d). amino acid derivatives; e). organic amine compounds; f). organic sulfuric acids; g). organic phosphoric acids; h). organic chelators containing multi-type function groups; i). pyridine and its derivatives; j). bipyridine and its derivatives; k). terpyridine and its derivatives; l). quinoline and its derivatives; m). hydroxyl quinoline and its derivatives; and n). the combinations of chelators or ligands as listed from a) to m).</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0048">Among above listed chelators or ligands, hydroxyl quinoline and its derivatives can form various complex compounds with different metal ions, such as aluminum, copper, nickel irons and others.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0049">The hydroxyl quinoline and its derivatives have the following two general molecular structures:</p>

The treatment can be performed either at room temperature or at elevated temperature with subsequent pH adjustment.

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0119">Further shown in Table 7, using the chemical additives to treat the cerium oxide particles in solution at different temperatures was an efficient approach to reduce the Al and Zr contents in cerium oxide particles. Such effective Al and Zr content reduction mainly due to that these chemical additives can react with Al or Zr contained on cerium particle surfaces to convert them to the soluble Al or Zr chemical additive complexes, after that, the cerium oxide particles can be separated from supernatant and re-dispersed for making STI slurry formulations with reduced Al and Zr contents.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0120">When the concentration of oxalic acid was changed from 0.01 M to 0.1 M, there was no impact observed on Al content (ppb) which indicated that 0.01 M of oxalic acid concentration was adequate for the efficient removal of some Al and Zr contents from cerium oxide particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0121">The cerium oxide slurry after chemical additive treatment can be used to prepare STI polishing compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0122">The different treatments, methods or embodiments for reducing trace metal and smaller sized and fine cerium oxide particles described above, can be combined in any orders. For example, the cerium oxide slurry being treated by any one of the method described above, can be further treated by any other, or any combinations of other methods. For example, the cerium oxide slurry being treated by suitable chemical additives, can be further treated by any one, or combinations of, chemical chelator treatment; ion exchange resin treatment, ultra filtration treatment, and deionized water washing and centrifuge treatment described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0123">Upon the reduction of trace metal contaminants in the cerium oxide slurry, the treated cerium oxide slurry is used to make STI polishing compositions. The defects, such as metal ion penetrating into silicon oxide films or forming nano-sized residues on wafer surfaces from a STI CMP process can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0124">The working examples and embodiments of this invention listed above, are exemplary of numerous embodiments that may be made of this invention. It is contemplated that numerous materials other than those specifically disclosed may be made. Numerous other configurations of the process may also be used, and the materials used in the process may be elected from numerous materials other than those specifically disclosed.</p>
