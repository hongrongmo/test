      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Metathesis is a catalytic reaction generally known in the art that involves the interchange of alkylidene units among compounds containing one or more double bonds (e.g., olefinic compounds) via the formation and cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bonds. Metathesis may occur between two like molecules (often referred to as self-metathesis) and/or it may occur between two different molecules (often referred to as cross-metathesis). Self-metathesis may be represented schematically as shown in Equation I.</p>

      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0006">In recent years, there has been an increased demand for environmentally friendly techniques for manufacturing materials typically derived from petroleum sources. For example, researchers have been studying the feasibility of manufacturing biofuels, waxes, plastics, and the like, using natural oil feedstocks, such as vegetable and seed-based oils. In one non-limiting example, metathesis catalysts are used to manufacture candle wax, as described in PCT/US2006/000822, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Metathesis reactions involving natural oil feedstocks offer promising solutions for today and for the future.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0007">Natural oil feedstocks of interest include non-limiting examples such as natural oils (e.g., vegetable oils, fish oil, animal fats) and derivatives of natural oils, such as fatty acids and fatty acid alkyl (e.g., methyl) esters. These feedstocks may be converted into industrially useful chemicals (e.g., waxes, plastics, cosmetics, biofuels, etc.) by any number of different metathesis reactions. Significant reaction classes include, as non-limiting examples, self-metathesis, cross-metathesis with olefins, and ring-opening metathesis reactions. Representative non-limiting examples of useful metathesis catalysts are provided below. Metathesis catalysts can be expensive and, therefore, it is desirable to improve the efficiency of the metathesis catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0008">In recent years, there has been an increased demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. Concerns exist that the world's petroleum production may not be able to keep up with demand. Additionally, the increased demand for petroleum-based fuels has resulted in a higher production of greenhouse gases. In particular, the airline industry accounts for greater than 10% of the greenhouse gases within the United States. Due to the increased demand for fuel and increased production of greenhouse gases, there is a need to explore methods of producing environmentally-friendly, alternative fuel sources. In particular, there is a need to explore methods of producing environmentally friendly fuel compositions and specialty chemicals from a natural feedstock, including monounsaturated olefin compounds.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0051">Typically, there are several choices of different and oftentimes complementary agents from which to choose when preparing to treat a contaminated feedstock prior to a metathesis reaction. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that the following non-exhaustive and non-limiting list of representative treatment methodologies can be useful in treating feedstocks that contain the specified contaminants (provided the agents are compatible with any functional groups on the feedstock and/or with the contaminants themselves, etc.): (a) a thermal treatmentâfor example, heating (and/or distilling) a feedstock (e.g., between about 100Â° C. and about 250Â° C., or around 200Â° C. in some embodimentsâdepending on the feedstock's boiling point, optionally with a purge of an inert gas such as N<sub>2 </sub>and/or the like) and/or treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina and the like) can be useful in decomposing peroxide contaminants and/or decomposition products thereof; (b) treatment with an acid anhydride (e.g., acetic anhydride, Ac<sub>2</sub>O) can be useful in removing moisture, active hydroxyl-containing materials (e.g., alcohols), and hydroperoxides (via acetylation); (c) treatment with a desiccant (e.g., silica gel, alumina, molecular sieves, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or an organometallic reagent (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or metal hydrides (e.g., CaH<sub>2 </sub>and the like) and/or acid anhydrides (e.g., acetic anhydride and the like) can be useful in removing moisture; (d) treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina, silica gel, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or an organometallic reagent (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or a metal amide (e.g., LDA, KHMDA, and the like) can be useful in removing protic materials; (e) treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina, silica gel, activated charcoal, and the like, and combinations thereof) can be useful in removing polar materials; (f) treatment with an organometallic reagent (e.g., (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) can be useful in removing Lewis basic catalyst poisons; etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, the first agent used to treat a feedstock prior to a metathesis reaction comprises an adsorbent which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of silica gel, alumina, bleaching clay, activated carbon, molecular sieves, zeolites, fuller's earth, diatomaceous earth, and the like, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the first agent is selected from the group consisting of optionally heat-treated molecular sieves, optionally heat-treated alumina, and a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the adsorbent comprises optionally heat-treated activated alumina which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of optionally heat-treated activated acidic alumina, optionally heat-treated activated neutral alumina, optionally heat-treated activated basic alumina, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the absorbent comprises optionally heat-treated activated neutral alumina, which can be useful in treating feedstocks (e.g., olefins) that are susceptible to acid-catalyzed isomerization and/or rearrangement.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0053">For embodiments in which the first agent, second agent, third agent, and/or any additional agents used in accordance with the present teachings comprises an adsorbent (e.g., molecular sieves, alumina, etc.), it is presently believed that the treating of the feedstock with the adsorbent is more effectively performed by flowing the feedstock through the first agent using a percolation- or flow-type system (e.g., chromatography column) as opposed to simply adding the adsorbent to the feedstock at the bottom of a container. In some embodiments, about 20 wt % of alumina is used in a column. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that treating a feedstock with alumina on about a 5-to-1 weight-to-weight basis is effective for some embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the amount of alumina used is not restricted and will be both feedstock- and impurity dependent in addition to being impacted by the form of the alumina, its activation process, and the precise treatment method (e.g., flow through a column vs. direct addition to container).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the first agent, second agent, third agent, and/or any additional agents used to treat a feedstock prior to a metathesis reaction comprises a trialkyl aluminum which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum and the like, and combinations thereof. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that in some cases the treatment of a feedstock with a trialkyl aluminum greatly improves feedstock conversions at low concentrations of metathesis catalyst but that in the presence of excess trialkyl aluminum, catalyst performance is adversely affected. Thus, in some embodiments (e.g., when a trialkyl aluminum is used as a first agent and/or an excess of trialkyl aluminum is used), a successive agent used to treat the feedstock can comprise an adsorbent which can remove excess trialkyl aluminum. In other embodiments, the amount of trialkyl aluminum used for treatment of the feedstock can be reduced by first treating the feedstock with a different agent of a type described herein (e.g., an adsorbent including but not limited to molecular sieves, alumina, and/or the like), and then introducing the trialkyl aluminum as a second (or subsequent) agent to remove residual contaminants. In any event, while neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that removal of excess trialkyl aluminum from organic products should be performed with great caution since use of the wrong adsorbent might lead to a highly exothermic reaction or a highly unstable species. In some embodiments, the trialkylaluminum is attached to a solid support to simplify its removal.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0055">In some embodiments, molecular sieves can be used as a first agent for bulk drying a feedstock, âhigh heat-treatedâ alumina can then be used as a second agent to remove additional moisture, and finally molecular sieves can be used at the end as a third agent for removing still further residual moisture. In other embodiments, molecular sieves can be used as a first agent for bulk drying a feedstock, âhigh heat-treatedâ alumina can then be used as a second agent to remove additional moisture, and finally a trialkyl aluminum (e.g., triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum and the like, and combinations thereof) can be used as a third agent for removing any further residual moisture.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0056">In one particular embodiment, activated copper powder is used alone or in combination with another treatment.

In another embodiment, activated magnesium tunings are used alone or in combination with another treatment. For example, in some embodiments, activated magnesium tunings are used in combination with heat (e.g., 200Â° C. for at least 2 hours under nitrogen gas), molecular sieves, and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0057">In another particular embodiment, acetic anhydride is used alone or in combination with another treatment/agent. For example, in some embodiments, acetic anhydride is used in combination with alumina (aluminum oxide) and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. In other embodiments, acetic anhydride is used in combination with alumina, distillation, molecular sieves, and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. Further, percolation on activated alumina or molecular sieves can be applied before or instead of the triaklyaluminum treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0058">In another embodiment, alumina is used alone or in combination with another treatment/agent. In one embodiment, alumina is used in combination with a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment.</p>

      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin may be self-metathesized to form a metathesized low-molecular-weight olefin or metathesized mid-weight olefin in order to adjust the properties of the olefin and the potential products following metathesis with the natural oil. In some embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin is self-metathesized in the presence of a rhenium oxide catalyst (e.g., rhenium oxide supported on alumina) or tungsten oxide catalyst (e.g., tungsten oxide supported on silica). This reaction may be conducted in a fixed bed reactor. In one embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin is 1-butene. The low-molecular-weight olefin may be self-metathesized over rhenium oxide catalyst in a fixed bed reactor to produce mainly 3-hexene and ethylene.

Unreacted low-molecular-weight olefin (e.g., 1-butene) may be recycled to the fixed bed reactor and the metathesized low-weight-olefin (e.g., 3-hexene) may be sent to the metathesis reactor for metathesis with the natural oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0061">In other embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin is isomerized prior to being metathesized with the natural oil.

In some embodiments, the isomerized or branched low-molecular-weight olefin is in the C4 to C10 range. In one embodiment, hexene is isomerized to form a branched low-molecular-weight olefin. Non-limiting examples of branched low-molecular-weight olefins include isobutene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-3-pentene, and 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentene.</p>

In certain embodiments, C11-C14 olefins may be targeted following metathesis and separation steps through isomerization of the low-molecular-weight olefin. In other embodiments, the branched low-molecular-weight olefins or branched mid-weight olefins may help target longer chain esters for use as detergents or cleaning compositions.

These heavier compounds are typically C3-C5 compounds carried overhead with the C2 or C2-C3 compounds. After separation in the overhead separation unit, the overhead C2 or C2-C3 stream may then be used as a fuel source. These hydrocarbons have their own value outside the scope of a fuel composition, and may be used or separated at this stage for other valued compositions and applications. In certain embodiments, the bottoms stream from the overhead separation unit containing mostly C3-C5 compounds is returned as a recycle stream to the metathesis reactor. In the flash vessel, the metathesized product <b>22</b> that does not flash overhead is sent downstream for separation in a separation unit <b>30</b>, such as a distillation column.</p>

In certain embodiments, the metathesized product <b>22</b> is introduced to an adsorbent or complexing agent to facilitate the separation of the metathesized product <b>22</b> from the metathesis catalyst. In one embodiment, the adsorbent or complexing agent is a clay bed. The clay bed will adsorb the metathesis catalyst, and after a filtration step, the metathesized product <b>22</b> can be sent to the separation unit <b>30</b> for further processing. In another embodiment, the adsorbent or complexing agent is a water soluble phosphine reagent such as tris hydroxymethyl phosphine (THMP).

In other embodiments, the polar solvent (e.g., water) is added to the metathesized product <b>22</b> at approximately the same time as the deactivation reagent (e.g., THMP). Near simultaneous addition of the deactivation reagent and polar solvent to the metathesized product can eliminate the need for an additional reaction/separation vessel, which may simply the process and potentially save capital.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0145">In certain embodiments, the isomerized fatty acid, isomerized fatty acid ester, dibasic acid, dibasic ester, isomerized dibasic acid, and/or isomerized dibasic ester is fully hydrogenated. Typical hydrogenation reaction conditions and catalysts are discussed above. In one particular embodiment, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted in the presence of a nickel based catalyst at approximately 150Â° C. and 150 psig. In another embodiment, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted in the presence of a nickel based catalyst at approximately 150Â° C. and 100 psig. In certain embodiments, these dibasic materials are selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of monounsaturated compounds.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0146">As noted, the self-metathesis of the natural oil, cross-metathesis between the natural oil and low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin, or cross-metathesis between a terminal olefin and internal olefin occurs in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. As stated previously, the term âmetathesis catalystâ includes any catalyst or catalyst system that catalyzes a metathesis reaction. Any known or future-developed metathesis catalyst may be used, individually or in combination with one or more additional catalysts. Non-limiting exemplary metathesis catalysts and process conditions are described in PCT/US2008/009635, pp. 18-47, incorporated by reference herein. A number of the metathesis catalysts as shown are manufactured by Materia, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0147">The metathesis process can be conducted under any conditions adequate to produce the desired metathesis products. For example, stoichiometry, atmosphere, solvent, temperature, and pressure can be selected by one skilled in the art to produce a desired product and to minimize undesirable byproducts. The metathesis process may be conducted under an inert atmosphere. Similarly, if a reagent is supplied as a gas, an inert gaseous diluent can be used. The inert atmosphere or inert gaseous diluent typically is an inert gas, meaning that the gas does not interact with the metathesis catalyst to substantially impede catalysis. For example, particular inert gases are selected from the group consisting of helium, neon, argon, nitrogen, individually or in combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0148">In certain embodiments, the metathesis catalyst is dissolved in a solvent prior to conducting the metathesis reaction. In certain embodiments, the solvent chosen may be selected to be substantially inert with respect to the metathesis catalyst. For example, substantially inert solvents include, without limitation, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc.; halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene; aliphatic solvents, including pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, etc.; and chlorinated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, etc. In one particular embodiment, the solvent comprises toluene.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0149">In other embodiments, the metathesis catalyst is not dissolved in a solvent prior to conducting the metathesis reaction. The catalyst, instead, may be slurried with the natural oil <b>12</b>, where the natural oil <b>12</b> is in a liquid state. Under these conditions, it is possible to eliminate the solvent (e.g., toluene) from the process and eliminate downstream olefin losses when separating the solvent. In other embodiments, the metathesis catalyst may be added in solid state form (and not slurried) to the natural oil <b>12</b> (e.g., as an auger feed).</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0150">The metathesis reaction temperature may be a rate-controlling variable where the temperature is selected to provide a desired product at an acceptable rate. In certain embodiments, the metathesis reaction temperature is greater than about â40Â° C., greater than about â20Â° C., greater than about 0Â° C., or greater than about 10Â° C. In certain embodiments, the metathesis reaction temperature is less than about 150Â° C., or less than about 120Â° C. In one embodiment, the metathesis reaction temperature is between about 10Â° C. and about 120Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0151">The metathesis reaction can be run under any desired pressure. Typically, it will be desirable to maintain a total pressure that is high enough to keep the cross-metathesis reagent in solution. Therefore, as the molecular weight of the cross-metathesis reagent increases, the lower pressure range typically decreases since the boiling point of the cross-metathesis reagent increases. The total pressure may be selected to be greater than about 0.1 atm (10 kPa), in some embodiments greater than about 0.3 atm (30 kPa), or greater than about 1 atm (100 kPa). Typically, the reaction pressure is no more than about 70 atm (7000 kPa), in some embodiments no more than about 30 atm (3000 kPa). A non-limiting exemplary pressure range for the metathesis reaction is from about 1 atm (100 kPa) to about 30 atm (3000 kPa).</p>
