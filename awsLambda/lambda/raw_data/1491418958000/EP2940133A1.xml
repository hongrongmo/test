    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a vaccine comprising as an active ingredient a chimeric protein of a peptide derived from human papilloma virus (Human papillomavirus: HPV) and a human hepatitis B virus surface protein (HBs protein).</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Human papilloma virus (Human papillomavirus: HPV) is a small circular double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the papilloma virus family. HPV has an icosahedral structure with a diameter of 50-55 nm wherein the virus genome is covered in an envelope protein (Capsid protein) but does not have a coat covering the capsid. A genome size, though varies depending on types, is approximately 8,000 bases where early proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) and late proteins (L1 and L2) are encoded. Capsid of HPV particles is formed with L1 and L2 in which L2 is supplementary in capsid formation.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A host range of HPV is strict and HPV does not infect non-human animals. HPV, being latent in the skin and mucous membranes after contact infection, infects through persistent infection and causes cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma) and their prodromal lesions [cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3], condylomata acuminata, and the like. In Japan, 19,000 people per year have developed cervical cancer, among which 5,600 people have died (cf. Non-Patent reference 5). According to the estimation by WHO, 13% of malignant tumors of women in all over the world (530,000 people) is associated with HPV infection and 300 million people is a carrier of HPV (cf. Non-Patent reference 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">With respect to the study in viral growth, HPV genome replicates during division of HPV-infected cells and is distributed to daughter cells. When the latent infection cells begin differentiation of epidermis formation, viral growth occurs at the end of the differentiation. However, HPV is rarely separated as a viral particle and only the genomic DNA has been cloned. Based on the homology of nucleotide sequences of the capsid protein (L1) gene, HPV has ever been classified into 100 or more genotypes. HPV may infect at different sites and cause different diseases depending on its genotype. HPV is broadly divided into those detected in skin lesions (epithelial type) and those detected in mucosal lesions (mucosal type). Mucosal type HPV is further classified into a high-risk type detected in a variety of cancers and a low-risk type causative of benign condylomata acuminata. A high-risk type HPV includes types 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73 and 82, detected in cervical cancer, perianal cancer and penile cancer whereas a low-risk type HPV includes types 6 and 11 (cf. Non-patent reference 1, Non-patent reference 2 and Non-patent reference 3).</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">With regard to a vaccine for prevention of HPV infection, "product name Gardasil (registered trademark)" developed by the US Merck &amp; Co., Inc., a vaccine of a mixture of virus-like particle (VLP) of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2006 and "product name Cervarix" developed by the UK GlaxoSmithKline, a vaccine of a mixture of VLP of HPV types 16 and 18, has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia in May 2007. In Japan, Cervarix has been approved in October 2009 and Gardasil in July 2011.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">These vaccines, to be called a first generation vaccine, are prepared by expressing a gene encoding L1 protein in yeast or insect cells to produce the VLP, to which adjuvant is added (cf. Non-patent reference 6). Both vaccines have been approved for cancers caused by a particular genotype and for protective effects against only a few types, i.e. types 6, 11, 16 and 18 for Gardasil and types 16 and 18 for Cervarix (Non-patent reference 12). Thus, in order to block HPV infection and suppress more effectively the development of cancer subsequently triggered, the development of a vaccine effective for any types of HPV infection is desired (cf. Non-patent reference 5 and Non-patent reference 6).</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">As such an attempt, there is a report by Kanda et al. They showed that a neutralizing epitope common among the high-risk HPVs is found in the amino acid sequence of L2 of HPV type 16 at positions 64-81 and 108-120 and that VLP of aggregate of chimeric proteins obtained by inserting a peptide derived from L2 of HPV type 16 into L1 of HPV type 16 blocked infection of HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 52 and 6 (cf. Patent reference 1 and Patent reference 2). In addition, they also reported the same results for VLP of chimeric proteins obtained by inserting L2 peptides at positions 18-38, 56-75 and 96-115 into L1 (cf. Non-patent reference 13). On the other hand, they also reported that the length of the inserted peptide may affect the presentation of the antigenic epitope portion (Patent reference 1).</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Other than L1 of HPV, research on particle formation and utility as a vaccine of chimeric proteins obtained by adding or inserting a foreign peptide into a protein having a variety of particle-forming ability has been reported. For example, it has been confirmed that mice were immunized with a chimeric protein wherein the surface proteins (HBs protein) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is added at its N-terminal or the C-terminal a peptide consisting of a part of L2 of HPV type 16 (50-220 amino acid region and 100-220 amino acid region from the N-terminal) to result in an increase in antibodies against L2 and HBs in ELISA (cf. Patent reference 7). There are other reports on VLP formation of a chimeric protein obtained by inserting a foreign gene into the hydrophilic region of HBs protein or the exposed portion of the outer loop of HBsAg-S (cf. Patent reference 3 and Patent reference 4) and of a chimeric protein wherein a foreign peptide is bound to the N-terminal of HBs protein (cf. Patent reference 5 and Patent reference 6).</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">HBs proteins have been proved to be highly effective as a vaccine and highly safe as they are used as an active ingredient of a recombinant precipitated hepatitis B vaccine derived from yeast (cf. Non-patent reference 7). However, VLP comprising a chimeric protein of a foreign peptide and the HBs protein, due to difference in the type and length of the foreign peptide to be inserted, which may affect the stability of VLP, the efficiency of expression from the cell and the structural change in what is expressed (cf. Patent reference 4), is not necessarily ensured for its usefulness as a vaccine. <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none" compact="compact"><li><u>Patent reference 1:</u><patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="WO2005097987A"><text>WO2005/097987</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 2:</u><patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="JP2007045746A"><text>JP Patent Publication No. 2007-45746</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 3:</u><patcit id="pcit-00003" dnum="JP8198897A"><text>JP-A-8-198897</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 4:</u><patcit id="pcit-00004" dnum="JP2004504067A"><text>JP Patent Publication No. 2004-504067</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 5:</u><patcit id="pcit-00005" dnum="JP2011115042A"><text>JP Patent Publication No. 2011-115042</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 6:</u><patcit id="pcit-00006" dnum="JP2007209343A"><text>JP Patent Publication No. 2007-209343</text></patcit></li><li><u>Patent reference 7:</u><patcit id="pcit-00007" dnum="WO2010001409A"><text>WO2010/001409</text></patcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 1:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00001" npl-type="s"><text>Virus Vol. 56, No. 2, pp219-230, 2006</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 2:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00002" npl-type="s"><text>Igaku-No-Ayumi Vol.224, No9: 669-680, 2008</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 3:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00003" npl-type="s"><text>Munoz, N. et al.: New Engl J Med, 348, 518-527, 2003</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 4:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00004" npl-type="s"><text>Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan MCIJ2007, March 2012</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 5:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00005" npl-type="s"><text>virus Vol. 58, No. 2, pp155-164, 2008</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 6</u>: <nplcit id="ncit-00006" npl-type="s"><text>Sanka-To-Fujinka 73(2): 217-225, 2006</text></nplcit></li><li><u>Non-patent reference 7:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00007" npl-type="b"><text>National Institute of Infectious Diseases, fact sheet on the hepatitis B vaccine (July 7, 2010 ed</text></nplcit>.)</li><li><u>Non-patent reference 8:</u><nplcit id="ncit-00008" npl-type="s"><text>Kawana.

    <heading id="h-00006-en">EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">As one aspect of the present invention, a chimeric protein of the peptide Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Leu with the HBs protein has an ability to produce antibodies against both the peptide and the HBs protein and thus can be a suitable material of a medicament for prophylaxis of HPV infection and/or hepatitis B. In particular, the chimeric protein is useful for increasing the productivity of a vaccine and for improving the quality of a vaccine in that, when the peptide is added to the C-terminal of the HBs protein, not only an increase in the expression level in the host but also an enhanced immune ability of the peptide (early antibody induction) were observed and also, when the peptide is inserted inside the HBs protein, it is possible to induce antibodies against at least the amino acid sequences at two sites in the peptide.</p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Moreover, the N-terminal 6-amino acid sequence of the peptide is well conserved among strains of HPV and is effective for many HPV types. In fact, as shown in the Examples, antibodies induced by the chimeric protein of the present invention react with many types of HPV. Therefore, according to the present invention, unlike the conventional type-specific vaccines, it is possible to provide a vaccine with a broader spectrum.</p>

    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The feature of the present invention is that a chimeric protein of a peptide derived from L2 protein of HPV, well conserved among HPV groups, with hepatitis B virus surface protein (HBs protein) is used as an active ingredient of a vaccine for preventing HPV infection and/or hepatitis B.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As described above, HPV, difficult to recover as viral particles, is determined for its genotypes based on the homology of the nucleotide sequence of the capsid (L1) gene, and more than 100 genotypes have been separated so far. For example, types 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73 and 82 of HPV are classified as high-risk HPV group whereas types 6 and 11 of HPV are classified as low-risk HPV group. In the L2 protein of HPV is present a region consisting of an amino acid sequence extremely well conserved among high-risk HPV group (hereinafter also referred to as "core sequence region") and the similar core sequence region is also present in low-risk HPV group. A peptides derived from HPV L2 protein consisting of the core sequence region (hereinafter also referred to as "HPV-L2 peptide") is used in the present invention. Such a core sequence region includes 20 amino acids at positions 56-75 for HPV types 16, 31 and 35; 20 amino acids at positions 55-74 for HPV types 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 66 and 6; 20 amino acids at positions 57-76 for HPV type 73; and 20 amino acids at positions 54-73 for HPV type 11. These 20-amino acid sequences can be shown by the formula: Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly-Xlaa-Gly-X2aa-Gly-X3aa-Gly-Gly-Arg-X4aa-Gly-Tyr-X5aa-Pro-X6aa (SEQ ID NO: 3) wherein X1aa, X2aa, X3aa, X4aa, X5aa and X6aa may be an arbitrary amino acid. The arbitrary amino acids in the formula are a site where mutation is observed among the types of HPV strains and are selected as follows: <ol><li>(1) X1aa is Thr or Ser;</li><li>(2) X2aa is Ser, Thr or Ala;</li><li>(3) X3aa is Thr or Ser;</li><li>(4) X4aa is Ser, Thr or Ala;</li><li>(5) X5aa is Ile or Val; and</li><li>(6) X6aa is Leu or Ile.</li></ol></p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The antibody obtained by immunizing an animal with HPV-L2 peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence: Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 4) may react with peptides of the core sequence region having a mutation in part. Therefore, it would readily be seen that a common epitope is present in the 6-amino acid sequence (Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly) at the N-terminal where no mutation is observed among the types of HPV strains (cf. Example 6). Thus, the HPV-L2 peptide as used in the present invention, in addition to the peptide consisting of the core sequence region of 20 amino acids, also includes a peptide consisting of the 6 amino acids as well as a variety of peptides within the core sequence region wherein amino acids derived from HPV L2 protein are added at the N-terminal and/or the C-terminal of the peptide consisting of the 6 amino acids.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Furthermore, peptides wherein amino acids derived from HPV L2 protein are added at the N-terminal and/or the C-terminal of the core sequence region may also be used in the present invention. HPV-L2 peptides encompass those peptides. Preferably, a total number of amino acids of the HPV-L2 peptide is 70 or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Any of HPV-L2 peptides consisting of the core sequence region having the common epitope can be used in the present invention. However, peptides consisting of 20 amino acids having a homology of 50-100%, 70-100% or 80-100% to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 are preferably used. More preferably, the HPV-L2 peptide shown by the above formula (SEQ ID NO: 3) with amino acid substitutions are used. Most preferable is a HPV-L2 peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr-Gly-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Furthermore, HPV-12 peptide, as far as it satisfies the conditions described below (retention of the antigenic activity and particle morphology), may encompass the 6 amino acid peptide, 7 to 19 amino acid peptides wherein amino acids derived from HPV L2 protein are added at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal of the 6 amino acids, and peptides wherein amino acids derived from HPV L2 are added at the N-terminal or the C-terminal of the core sequence region consisting of 20 amino acids.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Apart from the above amino acid substitutions, HPV-L2 peptide variants wherein cysteine (Cys) is added to or inserted in HPV-L2 peptide are also one of embodiments of the present invention. In general, it is difficult to obtain a strong immune effect when animals are immunized with a peptide alone and thus a carrier (e.g. KLH) is bound to the peptide or an adjuvant (e.g. Freund's complete adjuvant) is added. Alternatively, addition or insertion of cysteine (Cys) at the N-terminal, the C-terminal, and/or inside of the peptide is carried out in order to improve the immunization ability of the peptide per se (cf. <patcit id="pcit-00008" dnum="WO2010044464A1"><text>WO 2010/044464 A1</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit-00009" dnum="WO2011024748A1"><text>WO 2011/024748 A1</text></patcit>). For example, it is reported that among the amino acid sequence of M2 of influenza virus type A, M2 peptide consisting of 23 amino acids of positions 2-24 wherein a cysteine residue is inserted has a higher immunogenicity (twice to 20-fold) than that of M2 peptide with no modification (cf. <patcit id="pcit-00010" dnum="WO2011024748A1"><text>WO 2011/024748 A1</text></patcit>). If the same effect can be expected by substitution or addition of Cys, one to several amino acids of HPV-L2 peptide of the present invention may be substituted with Cys or Cys may be added provided that the common epitope among HPV groups is conserved. Specifically, since HPV-L2 peptides have exactly the same sequence for the N-terminal 6 amino acids among HPV group, it is preferable to add or insert Cys at any sites other than said amino acid sequence. Hereinafter, if distinction is not necessary between modified and unmodified peptides, these are also simply referred to as HPV-L2 peptide comprehensively.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The sites of addition or insertion of HPV-L2 peptide into the HBs protein may be any sites as far as the immunogenicity against HPV-L2 peptide and HBs protein is retained. Preferably, the chimeric protein of HPV-L2 peptide and HBs protein forms particles and HPV-L2 peptide is located on the surface of the particles. Such a candidate includes the N-terminal, the C-terminal, and a specific site (positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) inside the HBs protein. Preferably, HPV-L2 peptide is added at the C-terminal of the HBs protein and/or inserted at the specific site (positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) inside the HBs protein.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">By adding the peptide at the C-terminal of HBs protein, it is possible to induce antibodies against the peptide early and to retain a higher antibody titer against HBs (Examples 1 and 7). Also, by insertion at a specific site (positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) inside the HBs protein, though the antibody induction against HBs decreases, antibodies recognizing amino acid sequences at two sites in the peptide (two epitopes) are induced. This means that antibodies with a broader spectrum for a variety of HPV strains are induced (Example 8). Therefore, in order to induce antibodies against HPV more effectively, HPV-L2 peptide is added at the C-terminal of the HBs protein and is inserted at a specific site (positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) inside the HBs protein. The similar effects may be obtained by using a mixture of a chimeric protein obtained by adding HPV-L2 peptide at the C-terminal of HBs protein and a chimeric protein obtained by inserting the peptide at a specific site (positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) inside the HBs protein as an immunogen. In this case, induction of a higher antibody titer against the HBs protein is expected. A ratio of the two chimeric proteins for optimal effect may suitably be adjusted by conventional methods.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">When adding a foreign peptide at the N-terminal of the HBs protein, it is preferred that the peptide consists of 20 to 70 amino acids. A larger size than this would affect particle formation and a smaller size than this would possibly reduce the antigenic activity. Therefore, HPV-L2 peptide can be used in combination in the present invention as far as the antigenic activity and particle morphology are maintained. In case of HPV-L2 peptide comprising the core sequence region (20 amino acids), two or three peptides connected to each other can be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As mentioned above, a peptide consisting of 21 to 70 amino acids in a total length can be used in the present invention that is obtained by adding amino acids from the HPV L2 protein at the N-terminal or the C-terminal of HPV-L2 peptide consisting of the core sequence region. In case of a peptide consisting of 21 to 35 amino acids, two such HPV-L2 peptides can be coupled to each other.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Furthermore, in the case of a peptide consisting of the common epitope sequence (Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly-Ile-Gly) within the core sequence region and peptides consisting of 6-19 amino acids with the common epitope sequence, 2 to 11 of HPV-L2 peptides can be coupled to each other so that the total number of amino acids is 20 to 70 depending on the size of the respective peptides.</p>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Also, as far as the size of peptides added or inserted is in the range of up to 70 amino acids, other peptides in addition to HPV-L2 peptide may be added or inserted. For example, the aforementioned M2 peptide may be added or inserted to prepare a trivalent vaccine effective for HPV infection, hepatitis B and influenza.</p>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A chimeric protein of HPV-L2 peptide and HBs protein of the present invention may be obtained by the following method. First, a gene encoding the HBs protein (HBs gene) is prepared as a basis of a chimeric protein. The nucleotide sequence of the HBs gene has hitherto been disclosed in a number of patent documents, non-patent documents and databases (cf. e.g. Non-Patent reference 10 and Non-Patent reference 11). Therefore, based on the nucleotide sequence of the HBs gene, the gene can easily be obtained by using the common genetic recombination techniques as taught by <nplcit id="ncit-00014" npl-type="b"><text>Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY, 1989</text></nplcit>). For the HBs antigen, any of large, middle and small ones may be used.</p>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Next, a DNA fragment encoding a chimeric protein of HPV-L2 peptide and HBs protein (hereinafter also referred to as "chimeric protein DNA fragment") is prepared by PCR and DNA synthesis. For example, when preparing the chimeric protein DNA fragment wherein HPV-L2 peptide is added at the N-terminal or the C-terminal of the HBs protein by PCR, a primer consisting of a part of the nucleotide sequence encoding HPV-L2 peptide and the HBs gene and the other primer of the HBs gene are used (the direction of the primers is determined based on which primer is at the N-terminal). The similar procedures may be performed when preparing the chimeric protein DNA fragments wherein HPV-L2 peptide is added inside the HBs protein.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">PCR primers designed based on the nucleotide sequence encoding HPV-L2 peptide and the nucleotide sequence of the HBs gene are readily available by requesting DNA synthesis trustees (e.g. QIAGEN, Inc.) wherein KOZAK sequence (<nplcit id="ncit-00015" npl-type="s"><text>Kozak M, J.Mol.Biol., 196, 947 (1987</text></nplcit>)) is added at the 5'-terminal and the nucleotide sequence of appropriate restriction enzyme recognition sites are added at the 5'-terminal and the 3'-terminal depending on the purpose. The DNA fragments amplified by PCR are cloned into cloning vectors such as, for example, pUC119 (TAKARA BIO Inc.), pBlueScript (Agilent Technologies) or pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced with a DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 377 Applied Biosystems). Confirmation of the chimeric protein DNA fragment of interest is performed by comparing the result of the obtained nucleotide sequence with the sequences of the designed PCR primers and the nucleotide sequence of the existing HBs gene.</p>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The thus obtained chimeric protein DNA fragment of the present invention is incorporated into an appropriate expression vector. The expression vector is introduced into a host for expression of the chimeric protein DNA fragments. For the expression vector, a plasmid, a viral vector and the like can be used. A promoter contained in the expression vector may be selected from promoters such as Lac, tac, pho5, adh, SV40 early, SV40 late, and Î²-actin, in view of a combination with microorganisms or animal cells to be used as a host. For a host, bacteria, yeast, animal cells, plant cells and insect cells are commonly used and may be selected to suit the intended use. When transforming host cells, known methods may be used. For example, calcium phosphate, DEAE dextran, a method using lipofectin liposome, protoplast polyethylene glycol fusion, electroporation, and the like may be used and appropriately selected so as to suit the host cell used.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In accordance with the present invention, the chimeric protein gene of interest, i.e. the chimeric protein DNA fragments wherein HPV-L2 peptide (20 amino acids at positions 56-75 of SEQ ID NO: 1) is added or inserted at either the N-terminal, the C-terminal or inside (between positions 127-128 of SEQ ID NO: 2) of the HBs protein, was obtained by cleaving the recombinant baculovirus vector (cf. Preparation Example) distributed from National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Dr. Kanda and Dr. Mori) with restriction enzymes. Next, the respective chimeric protein DNA fragments were incorporated into the expression plasmid for animal cell pCAGG-S1(Sal).dhfr.neo (cf. <patcit id="pcit-00011" dnum="WO2003004641A"><text>WO2003/004641</text></patcit>) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were subject to transformation with the resulting expression plasmid by the modified method of calcium phosphate.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Transformed cells expressing the chimeric protein of the present invention are screened in the following two step process. First, the cells subjected to transformation are cultured in a medium containing 10 to 1,000 nmol of L-methotrexate (MTX) and 100 to 1,000 Âµg/mL of geneticin (Geneticin G418 sulfate) for a given period of time to select and grow the cells that survive so as to select the transformed cells. Then, the cells expressing the chimeric protein are selected among the transformed cells. Specifically, the chimeric proteins of the present invention is confirmed by performing ELISA and WB using the antibody that specifically binds to HPV-L2 peptide or HBs protein on the culture supernatant and cell debris.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">For culture of the transformed cells, the conditions as used for culture of normal cells may be used. Thus, T7m medium, Ex-cell SP2/0 medium, YMM-01B medium, YMM-01C medium, OptiCHO medium, Ex-cell 302 medium, or a mixed medium thereof may be used. The medium may be supplemented with fetal calf serum, calcium, magnesium, amino acids, vitamins, and the like. The culture temperature is 32Â°C to 38Â°C and the culture period is 2-20 days. In the stage of manufacture of a medicament, it is preferable to maintain the cells expressing the chimeric protein in a serum-free medium.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Purification of the chimeric proteins of the present invention may be achieved by appropriately combining the methods commonly used in protein chemistry such as, for example, centrifugation, salting out, ultrafiltration, isoelectric precipitation, electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. The amount of the resulting chimeric protein may be measured using BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc), a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Japan, Inc.), and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The chimeric protein of the present invention may be those obtained by expressing or chemically synthesizing HPV-L2 peptide and HBs protein separately and then chemically conjugating the peptide and the protein. For separate expression, it is possible to conduct amplification by the known gene amplification method using as a template the chemically synthesized DNA sequence or the DNA sequence inserted into a plasmid and to construct the respective expression plasmids by the method described above. The expression plasmid may be introduced into a host as described above to obtain a peptide or a protein of interest.</p>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">For chemical conjugation, a method using a crosslinker is exemplified. In that case, an amino group, a thiol group (SH group) and an aldehyde group of a sugar chain present in a protein and a peptide may be used for the conjugation but there is no limitation in the functional groups to be used. Besides, chemical conjugation utilizing the binding with the interaction of biomolecules such as biotin and avidin is also exemplified.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Evaluation of the chimeric protein of the present invention as a vaccine is carried out by immunizing small animals such as chicken, mouse, rat, guinea pig, dog, or monkey with the antigen and then, in <u>in vitro</u> system, after blood collection from the immunized animals, separating the serum and measuring an antibody titer against the chimeric protein of the present invention and a neutralizing antibody titer against HPV and the hepatitis B virus in the serum whereas, in <u>in vivo</u> systems, by administering a pseudo-HPV in the immunized animals and observing survival and the condition. In general, ELISA, PHA and plaque assay are commonly used for the measurement of antibodies in <u>in vitro</u> system. More specifically, a neutralizing antibody against hepatitis B virus may be measured by measuring HBs antibody whereas a neutralizing antibody against HPV may be measured by measuring the binding ability with a virus like particle (VLP) or infectious pseudovirus (<nplcit id="ncit-00016" npl-type="s"><text>Buck CB etc., Efficient intracellular assembly of papillomaviral vectors J Virol 78:. 751-757, 2004</text></nplcit>).</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">For immunization procedures (e.g. the site of administration such as subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, nasal, oral, and sublingual, and immunization period, etc.), general immunization technique commonly used when examining the immunogenicity of the vaccine may be used. To the antigen used for immunization may be added any adjuvant usable for human for enhancing the immunity, for example, aluminum hydroxide gel, aluminum phosphate gel, CpG oligonucleotides, MDP, QS21, MPL+TDM emulsion, and the like. In addition, various additives acceptable as pharmaceutical applications may also be added for retaining stability and the form of an antigen. Such additives include a stabilizer (arginine, polysorbate 80, macrogol 4000, etc.), an excipient (mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose, and lactose), a buffer (sodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, etc.), a tonicity agent (sodium chloride, etc.), a preservative (thimerosal, phenoxyethanol, etc.), an inactivating agent (formalin, Î²-propiolactone, etc.), and the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The thus obtained chimeric protein of the present invention, having an ability to produce an antibody effective for prevention of HPV infection and growth of hepatitis B, may be used as a material for prophylaxis of HPV infection and hepatitis B or as a material for constructing a detection system of HPV and Hepatitis B virus (e.g. a detection system with antibody measurement such as ELISA, western blotting, and dot blot).</p>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Furthermore, an expression vector wherein the DNA fragment encoding the chimeric protein can express the chimeric protein when administered <u>in vivo</u> may also be used as a DNA vaccine. Such an expression vector includes a plasmid derived from <u>E. coli.</u> For expression of a gene in mammalian cells, the plasmid may include a strong promoter in eukaryotic organisms upstream the gene such as, for example, IE (immediate-early) promoter of cytomegalovirus, Î²-actin promoter and CAG promoter. Furthermore, by introducing the DNA fragment into viruses and bacteria, a live vaccine may be obtained. Such an expression vector includes viruses (vaccinia virus vector, herpes virus vector, adenovirus vector, Sendai virus vector, measles virus vector, etc.), bacteria (Salmonella vector, etc.), protozoa (malaria vectors, etc.), and the like. For example, when a vaccinia virus vector (LC16m8 strain) in which the DNA fragment encoding the chimeric protein of the present invention is incorporated is used, not only the function as an attenuated live vaccine but also the effect as a smallpox vaccine can be expected. An attenuated live vaccine allows for simplification of a purification process of vaccine material, leading to reduction in cost for the manufacture. A recombinant vaccinia virus in which HBs protein is incorporated expresses particles consisting of only HBs protein (<nplcit id="ncit-00017" npl-type="s"><text>Vaccine 1987 Mar; 5(1) : 65-70</text></nplcit>). Thus, recombinant vaccinia virus (LC16m8 strain) in which the chimeric protein DNA fragment of the present invention is incorporated is expected to form the particles in the same way and to be an attenuated live vaccine with strong immunogenicity of HPV-L2 peptide being retained.</p>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A vaccine comprising the chimeric protein of the present invention as an active ingredient may be used alone as a bivalent vaccine for preventing HPV infection and hepatitis B or alternatively may be used as a multivalent combined vaccine by combining with at least one vaccine selected from the group consisting of vaccines against infectious diseases of other viruses (e.g. influenza virus, hepatitis A virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, etc.), bacteria (e.g. <u>Haemophilus influenzae, Clostridium tetani, Corynebacterium diphtheria</u>, etc.) and protozoa (e.g. malaria, etc.).</p>
