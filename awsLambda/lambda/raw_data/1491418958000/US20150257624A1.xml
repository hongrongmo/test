    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present subject matter relates generally to dishwasher appliances and methods for operating dishwasher appliances with steps for reducing or preventing clogging of filter assemblies within the dishwasher appliances.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">During wash and rinse cycles, dishwasher appliances generally circulate a fluid through a wash chamber over articles, such as pots, pans, silverware, etc. The fluid can be, e.g., various combinations of water and detergent during the wash cycle or water (which may include additives) during the rinse cycle. Typically, the fluid is circulated during a given cycle using a pump. Fluid is collected at or near the bottom of the wash chamber and pumped back into the wash chamber through, e.g., nozzles in spray arms and other openings that direct the fluid against the articles to be cleaned or rinsed.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Depending upon the level of soil on the articles, fluids used during wash and rinse cycles will become contaminated with soils in the form of debris or particles that are carried with the fluid. In order to protect the pump and recirculate the fluid through the wash chamber, it is beneficial to filter the fluid so that relatively clean fluid is applied to the articles in the wash chamber and materials are removed or reduced from the fluid supplied to the pump.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For mechanical filtration, the selectivity of the filter to remove soil particles of different sizes is typically determined by providing fluid paths (such as pores or apertures) through filter media that are smaller than the particles for which filtration is desired. Particles having a dimension larger than the width of the fluid paths will be trapped or prevented from passing through the filter media while particles smaller than the width of the fluid path will generally pass through. Certain particle sizes and/or types may be not harmful to the pump or spray assemblies and, therefore, can be allowed to pass into the pump inlet. However, while some smaller particles may not be harmful to the pump, leaving such particles in the wash or rinse fluid may not be acceptable as these particles may become deposited on the articles being washed/rinsed and thereby affect the user's perception of the cleanliness and/or appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">While larger particles can generally be readily removed from the fluid circulated through the wash chamber, challenges are presented in removing smaller particles—particularly as the particle size targeted for removal decreases. For example, if a dishwashing appliance is provided with a fine particle filter—such as one for removing particles 200 microns or larger—the filter can be prone to clogging particularly during the early stages of the cleaning process. During a pre-wash cycle or early stage of a wash cycle, a greater amount of larger food particles may be present on the articles placed in the wash chamber. A fine particle filter—such as one for removing particles 200 microns are larger—may become substantially clogged.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To unclog the filter, a conventional approach has been to drain the dirty fluid from the wash chamber to remove the particles clogging the filter. New—i.e. clean fluid—is then reintroduced for cycling again. Depending on the level of soil still present on the articles, yet another cycle of draining and refilling may have to be repeated. Unfortunately, this run, drain, and refill approach for unclogging a filter is inefficient as it requires the use of additional fluid (i.e. water). Of course, a filter media can be selected that only captures larger particles so that it clogs less, such as e.g., 0.030″ or larger, but this comes at the expense of losing the ability to remove smaller particles from the fluid and an associated effect on the resulting cleanliness of the articles.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Another challenge with filtration of the wash fluid is servicing of the filter and, more particularly, the filter media. Sometimes, for example, food particles can become lodged in the filter requiring that the filter be removed and either manually cleaned or replaced. Certain conventional dishwashing appliances do not have a filter that is readily accessible to the user and/or otherwise readily cleanable or serviceable.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Accordingly, a dishwasher appliance having filtering system for the removal of particles from the wash fluid would be useful. More particularly, a method for operating a dishwasher appliance with steps for reducing or preventing clogging of a filtering system would be useful.</p>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">
        <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict a dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter. As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> includes a cabinet <b>102</b>. Cabinet <b>102</b> has a tub <b>104</b> therein that defines a wash compartment <b>106</b>. The tub <b>104</b> also defines a front opening (not shown). Dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> includes a door <b>120</b> hinged at a bottom <b>122</b> of door <b>120</b> for movement between a normally closed, vertical position (shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), wherein wash compartment <b>106</b> is sealed shut for washing operation, and a horizontal, open position for loading and unloading of articles from dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Latch <b>123</b> is used to lock and unlock door <b>120</b> for access to wash compartment <b>106</b>. Tub <b>104</b> also includes a sump assembly <b>170</b> positioned adjacent a bottom portion <b>112</b> of tub <b>104</b> and configured for receipt of a liquid wash fluid (e.g., water, detergent, wash fluid, and/or any other suitable fluid) during operation of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">A spout <b>160</b> is positioned adjacent sump assembly <b>170</b> of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Spout <b>160</b> is configured for directing liquid into sump assembly <b>170</b>. Spout <b>160</b> may receive liquid from, e.g., a water supply (not shown) or any other suitable source. In alternative embodiments, spout <b>160</b> may be positioned at any suitable location within dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, e.g, such that spout <b>160</b> directs liquid into tub <b>104</b>. Spout <b>160</b> may include a valve (not shown) such that liquid may be selectively directed into tub <b>104</b>. Thus, for example, during the cycles described below, spout <b>160</b> may selectively direct water and/or wash fluid into sump assembly <b>170</b> as required by the current cycle of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> are slidably mounted within wash compartment <b>106</b>. Each of the rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> is fabricated into lattice structures including a plurality of elongated members <b>134</b>. Each rack of the rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> is adapted for movement between an extended loading position (not shown) in which the rack is substantially positioned outside the wash compartment <b>106</b>, and a retracted position (shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) in which the rack is located inside the wash compartment <b>106</b>. A silverware basket (not shown) may be removably attached to rack assembly <b>132</b> for placement of silverware, utensils, and the like, that are otherwise too small to be accommodated by the racks <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> further includes a lower spray assembly <b>144</b> that is rotatably mounted within a lower region <b>146</b> of the wash compartment <b>106</b> and above sump assembly <b>170</b> so as to rotate in relatively close proximity to rack assembly <b>132</b>. A mid-level spray assembly <b>148</b> is located in an upper region of the wash compartment <b>106</b> and may be located in close proximity to upper rack <b>130</b>. Additionally, an upper spray assembly <b>150</b> may be located above the upper rack <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The lower and mid-level spray assemblies <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> and the upper spray assembly <b>150</b> are fed by a fluid circulation assembly <b>152</b> for circulating water and dishwasher fluid in the tub <b>104</b>. Fluid circulation assembly <b>152</b> may include a wash or recirculation pump <b>154</b> and a cross-flow/drain pump <b>156</b> located in a machinery compartment <b>140</b> located below sump assembly <b>170</b> of the tub <b>104</b>, as generally recognized in the art. Cross-flow/drain pump <b>156</b> is configured for urging wash fluid within sump assembly <b>170</b> out of tub <b>104</b> and dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> to a drain <b>158</b>. Recirculation assembly <b>154</b> is configured for supplying a flow of wash fluid from sump assembly <b>170</b> to spray assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Each spray assembly <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> includes an arrangement of discharge ports or orifices for directing wash fluid onto dishes or other articles located in rack assemblies <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>. The arrangement of the discharge ports in spray assemblies <b>144</b> and <b>148</b> provides a rotational force by virtue of wash fluid flowing through the discharge ports. The resultant rotation of the lower spray assembly <b>144</b> provides coverage of dishes and other dishwasher contents with a spray of wash fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> is further equipped with a controller <b>137</b> to regulate operation of the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Controller <b>137</b> may include a memory and microprocessor, such as a general or special purpose microprocessor operable to execute programming instructions or micro-control code associated with a cleaning cycle. The memory may represent random access memory such as DRAM, or read only memory such as ROM or FLASH. In one embodiment, the processor executes programming instructions stored in memory. The memory may be a separate component from the processor or may be included onboard within the processor. Alternatively, controller <b>137</b> may be constructed without using a microprocessor, e.g., using a combination of discrete analog and/or digital logic circuitry (such as switches, amplifiers, integrators, comparators, flip-flops, AND gates, and the like) to perform control functionality instead of relying upon software.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Controller <b>137</b> may be positioned in a variety of locations throughout dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, controller <b>137</b> may be located within a control panel area <b>121</b> of door <b>120</b> as shown. In such an embodiment, input/output (“I/O”) signals may be routed between the control system and various operational components of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> along wiring harnesses that may be routed through the bottom <b>122</b> of door <b>120</b>. Typically, controller <b>137</b> includes a user interface panel <b>136</b> through which a user may select various operational features and modes and monitor progress of the dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, user interface <b>136</b> may represent a general purpose I/O (“GPIO”) device or functional block. In one embodiment, user interface <b>136</b> may include input components, such as one or more of a variety of electrical, mechanical or electro-mechanical input devices including rotary dials, push buttons, and touch pads. User interface <b>136</b> may include a display component, such as a digital or analog display device designed to provide operational feedback to a user. User interface <b>136</b> may be in communication with controller <b>137</b> via one or more signal lines or shared communication busses.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">It should be appreciated that the subject matter disclosed herein is not limited to any particular style, model or configuration of dishwasher appliance, and that the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is for illustrative purposes only. For example, instead of the racks <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> may be of a known configuration that utilizes drawers that pull out from the cabinet and are accessible from the top for loading and unloading of articles.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> provide schematic views of a sump <b>200</b> and a filter assembly <b>210</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter. Sump <b>200</b> and filter assembly <b>210</b> may be used in any suitable appliance. For example, sump <b>200</b> and filter assembly <b>210</b> may be used in dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>), e.g., as sump assembly <b>170</b>. In dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, filter assembly <b>210</b> filters liquid passing therethrough and supplies filtered liquid to at least one of spray assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>. Filtering liquid supplied to spray assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b> can assist with limiting or preventing clogging of spray assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As may be seen in <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, filter assembly <b>210</b> includes filter media <b>212</b> and defines an unfiltered volume <b>214</b> and a filtered volume <b>220</b>. Filter media <b>212</b> are disposed between filtered volume <b>220</b> and unfiltered volume <b>214</b>. As used herein, the term “unfiltered” describes a volume that is not filtered relative to filter media <b>212</b> and the term “filtered” describes a volume that is filtered relative to filter media <b>212</b>. However, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, filter assembly <b>210</b> may include additional filters that filter liquid entering unfiltered volume <b>214</b>. Thus, unfiltered volume <b>214</b> may be filtered relative to other filters, such as a coarse filter, but not filter media <b>212</b>. During operation filter assembly <b>210</b>, filter media <b>212</b> may be fixed or static within filter assembly <b>210</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Unfiltered volume <b>214</b> has at least one entrance <b>216</b> and at least one exit <b>218</b>. Entrance <b>216</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> is in fluid communication with sump <b>200</b>. Thus, unfiltered volume <b>214</b> is configured for receipt of liquid from sump <b>200</b>, and liquid in sump <b>200</b> flows into unfiltered volume <b>214</b> via entrance <b>216</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b>. As discussed in greater detail below, liquid in unfiltered volume <b>214</b> passes or flows through filter media <b>212</b> into filtered volume <b>220</b>. Filter media <b>212</b> removes debris or particles P from liquid passing through filtering media <b>212</b> from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to filtered volume <b>220</b>. Thus, unfiltered liquid passes through filter media <b>212</b> to remove debris or particles P and exits filter media <b>212</b> into filtered volume <b>220</b> as filtered liquid. Filtered volume <b>220</b> also includes an exit <b>222</b>. Filtered liquid within filtered volume <b>220</b> then exits filtered volume <b>220</b> via exit <b>222</b> of filtered volume <b>220</b>. In such a manner, unfiltered liquid follows a path through filter assembly <b>210</b>. In particular, unfiltered liquid passes through filter media <b>212</b>, and filtered liquid exits filter assembly <b>210</b>. Such filtering can assist with limiting or preventing clogs in associated spray assemblies of an appliance.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Liquid in unfiltered volume <b>214</b> can also pass or flow out of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> via exit <b>218</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b>. Thus, rather than flowing through filter media <b>212</b> into filtered volume <b>220</b> as described above, liquid in unfiltered volume <b>214</b> also passes or flows out of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> via exit <b>218</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b>. The bypassed liquid flows back into sump <b>200</b> without being filtered by or with filter media <b>212</b>. Thus, filter assembly <b>210</b> generates a cross flow across filter media <b>212</b>. Such cross flow can assist with limiting or preventing clogging or saturation of filter media <b>212</b> with debris or particles P.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Filter assembly <b>210</b> includes a first pump <b>240</b>, a second pump <b>242</b>, an exit conduit <b>230</b> and a recirculation conduit <b>232</b>. Exit conduit <b>230</b> extends from exit <b>218</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to first pump <b>240</b>. First pump <b>240</b> is operable to draw liquid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to or towards first pump <b>240</b> via exit conduit <b>230</b>. First pump <b>240</b> may be any suitable pump. For example, when used in dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), first pump <b>240</b> may be cross-flow/drain pump <b>156</b>. Exit conduit <b>230</b> may also extend from exit <b>218</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to sump <b>200</b>. Thus, exit conduit <b>230</b> may be arranged or configured for directing liquid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to sump <b>200</b>, e.g., during operation of first pump <b>240</b>. When used in dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, exit conduit <b>230</b> may be arranged or configured for directing liquid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to wash compartment <b>106</b> of tub <b>104</b>, e.g., during operation of cross-flow/drain pump <b>156</b>. Thus, exit conduit <b>230</b> may extend from exit <b>218</b> of unfiltered volume <b>214</b> to tub <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In addition, a valve <b>260</b> is coupled to exit conduit <b>230</b>. Valve <b>260</b> is operable to regulate a flow of liquid through exit conduit <b>230</b>. In particular, valve <b>260</b> is selectively adjustable between a cross-flow or first configuration and a drain or second configuration. In the first configuration, valve <b>260</b> may permit liquid in exit conduit <b>230</b> to flow through valve <b>260</b> to sump <b>200</b>, e.g., as described above. Conversely, valve <b>260</b> may direct liquid in exit conduit <b>230</b> to a drain <b>262</b> in the second configuration. Fluid in drain <b>262</b> may be directed out of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, e.g., to an associated sewer or septic system. Thus, valve <b>260</b> may direct liquid flowing through exit conduit <b>230</b> to sump <b>200</b> or drain <b>262</b> depending upon the configuration or position of valve <b>260</b>. Valve <b>260</b> may be any suitable valve. For example, valve <b>260</b> may be a solenoid valve in certain exemplary embodiments. Controller <b>137</b> may be in operative communication with valve <b>260</b> such that controller <b>137</b> may actuate valve <b>260</b> between the first and second configurations.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Recirculation conduit <b>232</b> extends from exit <b>222</b> of filtered volume <b>220</b> to second pump <b>242</b>. Second pump <b>242</b> is operable to draw liquid from filtered volume <b>220</b> to or towards second pump <b>242</b> via recirculation conduit <b>232</b>. Second pump <b>242</b> may be any suitable pump. For example, when used in dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), second pump <b>242</b> may be recirculation pump <b>154</b>. Recirculation conduit <b>232</b> may also extend from exit <b>222</b> of filtered volume <b>220</b> to a spray assembly <b>250</b>. Thus, recirculation conduit <b>232</b> may be arranged or configured for directing liquid from filtered volume <b>220</b> to the spray assembly <b>250</b>, e.g., during operation of second pump <b>242</b>. When used in dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, recirculation conduit <b>232</b> may be arranged or configured for directing liquid from filtered volume <b>220</b> to at least one of spray assemblies <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>150</b>, e.g., during operation of recirculation pump <b>154</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Filter media <b>212</b> may be configured for fine filtration—e.g. filtering of relatively small particles. Accordingly, in one exemplary aspect of the present subject matter, filter media <b>212</b> may be configured (e.g., define holes or apertures) for removing particles in the size range of about fifty microns to about four hundred microns. For example, filter media <b>212</b> may be a screen or mesh having holes in the size range of about fifty microns to about four hundred microns. In another exemplary aspect of the present subject matter, filter media <b>212</b> may be configured (e.g., define holes or apertures) for removing particles in the size range of about three hundred microns to about six hundred microns. For example, filter media <b>212</b> may be a screen or mesh having holes in the size range of about three hundred microns to about six hundred microns. These size ranges are provided by way of example only. Other ranges may be used in certain exemplary embodiments of the present subject matter as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate a method <b>600</b> for operating a dishwasher appliance according to an exemplary embodiment of the present subject matter. Method <b>600</b> may be used to operate any suitable dishwasher appliance. For example, method <b>600</b> may be used to operate dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In particular, controller <b>137</b> may be configured or programmed to implement method <b>600</b>. Utilizing method <b>600</b>, clogging of a filter assembly, such as filter assembly <b>210</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>), may be reduced or prevented as discussed in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, at step <b>610</b>, wash fluid, such as a mixture of water, detergent, etc., is directing into tub <b>104</b>. As an example, tub <b>104</b> may be filled with wash fluid at step <b>610</b> until sump assembly <b>170</b> of tub <b>104</b> is filled with wash fluid. In particular, controller <b>137</b> may actuate a valve (not shown) coupled to spout <b>160</b> in order to direct wash fluid into tub <b>104</b> and fill tub <b>104</b> at step <b>610</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">At step <b>615</b>, a wash cycle of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> is initiated. Turing back to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a flow of wash fluid is drawn from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> during the wash cycle at step <b>615</b>. For example, controller <b>137</b> may operate second pump <b>242</b> in order to draw the flow of wash fluid from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> at step <b>615</b>. In addition, a flow of wash fluid is directed from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to wash compartment <b>106</b> of tub <b>104</b> during the wash cycle at step <b>615</b>. For example, controller <b>137</b> may operate first pump <b>240</b> in order to direct the flow of wash fluid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to wash compartment <b>106</b> of tub <b>104</b> at step <b>615</b>. Thus, valve <b>260</b> is in the first configuration during the wash cycle at step <b>615</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the flow of wash fluid from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> may be drawn, e.g., by second pump <b>242</b>, at the same time as the flow of wash fluid is directed from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to wash compartment <b>106</b> of tub <b>104</b>, e.g., by first pump <b>240</b>, during the wash cycle. In such a manner, the cross-flow across filter media <b>212</b> can be generated, and clogging of filter media <b>212</b> can be limited or reduced by such cross-flow during the wash cycle. To assist the cross-flow with limiting or reducing clogging of filter media <b>212</b>, a velocity of wash fluid within filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> during step <b>615</b> may be less than a velocity of wash fluid within unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> during step <b>615</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Wash fluid exiting spray assembly <b>250</b> during the wash cycle also assists with removing particles P from articles within wash compartment <b>106</b> of tub <b>104</b> during the wash cycle at step <b>620</b>. The wash cycle may have any suitable duration. For example, the wash cycle may be between about two minutes and about forty minutes. Thus, at step <b>625</b>, the wash cycle is continued and particles P are removed from articles in wash compartment <b>106</b> until a wash cycle time interval elapses.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Particles P can accumulate within or in sump <b>200</b> and/or filter assembly <b>210</b> over time during the wash cycle. Thus, method <b>600</b> includes steps for collecting particles P within filter assembly <b>210</b>, e.g., after the wash cycle is complete. In particular, a particle or soil collection cycle of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> is started at step <b>630</b>. Turing now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a flow of wash fluid is drawn from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> during the soil collection cycle at step <b>630</b>. For example, controller <b>137</b> may operate second pump <b>242</b> in order to draw the flow of wash fluid from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> at step <b>630</b>. In addition, first pump <b>240</b> is deactivated during the soil collection cycle at step <b>630</b>. Valve <b>260</b> may be in either of the first or second configurations during the soil collection cycle at step <b>630</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the flow of wash fluid from filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b> to spray assembly <b>250</b> may be drawn, e.g., by second pump <b>242</b>, while first pump <b>240</b> is deactivated during the soil collection cycle. Thus, the cross-flow across filter media <b>212</b> described above may not be generated during the soil collection cycle, and filter assembly <b>210</b> may act as a dead-end filtration system. In such a manner, particles P accumulate on filter media <b>212</b> of filter assembly <b>210</b>, e.g., due to the lack of cross-flow within filter assembly <b>210</b>, during the soil collecting cycle at step <b>635</b>. The soil collection cycle may have any suitable duration. For example, the soil collection cycle may be between about two seconds and about ten seconds. As another example, the duration of the soil collection cycle may be selected such that second pump <b>242</b> does not starve during the soil collection cycle. Thus, at step <b>640</b>, the soil collection cycle is continued and particles P are collected in filter assembly <b>210</b> until a soil collection cycle time interval elapses.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As discussed above, particles P collect within filter assembly <b>210</b> during the soil collection cycle. To hinder or prevent such particles P from affecting operation of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>, method <b>600</b> includes steps for flushing particles P from filter assembly <b>210</b>, e.g., after the soil collection cycle is complete. In particular, a drain cycle of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> is commenced at step <b>645</b>. Turing now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a flow of wash fluid is directed from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to drain <b>262</b> during the drain cycle at step <b>645</b>. For example, controller <b>137</b> may operate first pump <b>240</b> in order to direct the flow of wash fluid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to drain <b>262</b> at step <b>645</b>. Thus, valve <b>260</b> is in the second configuration during the drain cycle at step <b>645</b>. In addition, second pump <b>242</b> is deactivated during the drain cycle at step <b>645</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the flow of wash fluid from unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> to drain <b>262</b> may be drawn, e.g., by first pump <b>240</b>, while second pump <b>242</b> is deactivated during the drain cycle. Thus, wash fluid within unfiltered volume <b>214</b> of sump <b>200</b> is not urged through filter media <b>212</b> towards filtered volume <b>220</b> of sump <b>200</b>. In particular, particles P on filter media <b>212</b> of filter assembly <b>210</b> may be flushed from filter media <b>212</b>, e.g., due to a flow of wash fluid from filtered volume <b>220</b> to unfiltered volume <b>214</b> through filter media <b>212</b>, and particles P are also directed out of filter assembly <b>210</b> to drain <b>262</b>, e.g., due to operation of first pump <b>240</b>, during the drain cycle at step <b>650</b>. The drain cycle may have any suitable duration. For example, the drain cycle may be between about one minute and about two minutes. Thus, the drain cycle is continued and particles P are flushed from filter assembly <b>210</b> until a drain cycle time interval elapses at step <b>655</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">It should be understood that steps <b>610</b>-<b>655</b> may be repeated as need during operation of dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. Thus, the wash cycle, the soil collection cycle and the drain cycle may be repeated as necessary to properly clean articles within dishwasher appliance <b>100</b>. At step <b>660</b>, any remaining wash fluid within tub <b>104</b> may be removed, e.g., when articles within dishwasher appliance <b>100</b> are suitably clean.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As may be seen in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, method <b>600</b> may also include an overlap or transition cycle between the soil collection cycle and the drain cycle. During the transition cycle, first and second pumps <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> are activated and operated. In addition, valve <b>260</b> is in the second configuration. The transition cycle may assist with flushing particles P from filter assembly <b>210</b> to drain <b>262</b>, e.g., prior to the drain cycle. The transition cycle may have any suitable duration. For example, the transition cycle may be about two seconds.</p>
