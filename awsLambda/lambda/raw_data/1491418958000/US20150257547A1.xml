    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention generally relates to retail merchandise displays, and more particularly to pusher assemblies for biasing retail merchandise forward to front face the same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Pusher assemblies are well known in the art and provide for the automatic biasing or âfront-facingâ of retail merchandise towards a front edge of the assembly which is closest to the consumer. Such assemblies are readily recognized as reducing labor costs and providing an appealing look to the arrangement of retail merchandise in a retail merchandise display.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Unfortunately, certain types of retail merchandise are not readily usable in pusher assemblies due to their size and/or shape. One example of such an item of retail merchandise is the frozen pizza. As is well known, frozen pizza is typically packaged with an outer wrapper and a cardboard backing This packaging generally has a circular outer periphery, which approximates the circular shape of the pizza carried therein. A typical pusher assembly often times incorporates upright divider walls on either side of the pusher assembly to contain the retail merchandise in a neat row. However, the Applicants have discovered that such upright divider walls make only minimal contact with objects having a circular outer periphery, and as a result, tend to not neatly contain such objects.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Furthermore, conventional pusher assemblies typically have a pusher with a front wall that is perpendicular to the retail merchandise support surface of the pusher assembly upon which the retail merchandise rests on. The Applicants herein have discovered that this perpendicular wall has a tendency to cause relatively larger and thinner items, e.g. frozen pizzas, to lean forward in a displeasing manner, and in some extreme cases, tip entirely forward. The Applicants have determined that this leaning or tipping is a caused primarily by the perpendicular orientation of the front wall of the pusher, which has a tendency to place a biasing force relatively high along the back surface of the retail merchandise creating a moment arm about the bottom edge of the retail merchandise, thereby causing it to rotate generally at this bottom edge to produce the aforementioned lean or tipping.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a pusher assembly that advantageously accommodates retail merchandise having a circular outer periphery, and biases the same with the aforementioned displeasing forward lean or tipping.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The invention provides such a pusher assembly. These and other advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In one aspect, embodiments of the invention provide a pusher tray which advantageously accepts and front faces retail merchandise having a circular outer periphery in a neat and orderly fashion. A pusher tray according to this aspect includes a base structure that defines a retail merchandise support surface. A pusher is slideably retained on the base structure and is configured to bias retail merchandise toward a front stop of the pusher tray. A pair of dividers are slideably mounted to the base structure. Each of the pair of dividers includes an arcuate frame portion having a radius of curvature. The arcuate frame portion is configured to approximate a circular outer periphery of an item of retail merchandise carried by the pusher tray.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide a pusher tray that advantageously avoids the above described forward lean or tippage of retail merchandise caused by conventional pusher trays. Such a pusher tray includes a base structure defining a retail merchandise support surface. A pusher is slideably retained on the base structure and is configured to bias retail merchandise toward a front stop of the pusher tray. The pusher has a floor and a front wall extending upwardly from the floor such that the front wall is oriented at an acute angle relative to the retail support surface. A pair of dividers are slideably mounted to the base structure. Each of the pair of dividers includes a frame portion and pair of support elements supporting the frame portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In yet another aspect, embodiments of the present invention provide a pusher tray that accommodates a variety of retail merchandise independently of its overall shape. Such a pusher tray includes a base structure defining a retail merchandise support surface. A pusher is slideably retained on the base structure and is configured to bias retail merchandise toward a front stop of the pusher tray. The pusher has a floor and a front wall extending upwardly from the floor such that the front wall is oriented at an acute angle relative to the retail support surface. A pair of dividers are slideably mounted to the base structure. Each of the pair of dividers includes an arcuate frame portion and a pair of support elements supporting the arcuate frame portion such that a portion of each support element is tangent to a radius of curvature defined by each arcuate frame portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the base structure includes a pair of opposed support members and a wire frame supported by the support members. Each support member includes at front and rear ends thereof a relief notch. The wire support frame is mounted to the support members in the relief notches.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In certain embodiments each one of the pair of dividers includes a pair of support elements. The arcuate frame portion is supported by the pair of support elements such that the pair of support elements extend from the arcuate frame portion such that terminal ends of the support elements are received in the base structure. The arcuate frame portion has a first length. The pair of support elements are spaced apart a second length. The first length is greater than the second length. Each support element includes a straight portion and an angled portion. The angled portion is approximately tangent to a radius of curvature defined by the arcuate frame portion. In certain embodiments, the radius of curvature is between about three inches and about twelve inches.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Other aspects, objectives and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">While the invention will be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments, there is no intent to limit it to those embodiments. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Turning now to the drawings, the same illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a pusher tray <b>20</b> according to the teachings of the present invention. With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, pusher tray <b>20</b> is shown situated on a retail shelf <b>22</b>. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that there are various known mounting configurations for mounting pusher tray <b>20</b> in a fixed manner to retail shelf <b>22</b>, and as such, for purposes of brevity, the particulars of such mounting configurations are not shown. Pusher tray <b>20</b> is shown carrying a plurality of items of retail merchandise <b>24</b> which as schematically shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are circular in shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">An example of such an item of retail merchandise is frozen pizza. As is generally understood in the art relative to pusher assemblies, retail merchandise <b>24</b> is arranged in a linear row and is biased forward by pusher tray <b>20</b> in a direction which is parallel to axis <b>26</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> towards a front stop of pusher tray <b>20</b>. As will be explained in greater detail below, pusher tray <b>20</b> overcomes the existing problems in the art by providing a new and improved divider arrangement which is specifically adapted to the circular outer periphery of retail merchandise <b>24</b>, while also exerting a biasing force at an appropriate point on the rearmost item of retail merchandise <b>24</b> to prevent the above-referenced unacceptable forward lean or tipping of the retail merchandise <b>24</b> caused by conventional pusher systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Pusher tray <b>20</b> includes a base structure <b>34</b> which supports the previously referenced front stop <b>28</b> as well as a pusher <b>36</b>, and a pair of moveable dividers <b>38</b> which are adjustable relative to base structure <b>34</b> in directions which are parallel to axis <b>40</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, pusher tray <b>20</b> is illustrated in an exploded view for purposes of elaborating upon the construction thereof. Base structure <b>34</b> includes a pair of opposed support members <b>42</b> which in the illustrated embodiment take the form of elongated bar like members. Support members <b>42</b> support a retail merchandise support floor in the form of a wire structure <b>44</b> as illustrated. Wire structure <b>44</b> includes a plurality of longitudinal members <b>46</b> arranged parallel to one another. The outermost ones of these longitudinal members <b>46</b> include upturned ends <b>48</b> for the connection and support of front stop <b>28</b> that optionally may also include a label holder <b>30</b> mounted thereto. Additionally, wire structure <b>44</b> also includes a pair of lateral support members <b>50</b> which are positioned below longitudinal members <b>46</b> and support the same. These elements may be welded together to form a generally rigid structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As can be seen from inspection of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, each of longitudinal and lateral members <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> of wire elements having a circular cross section. The upper surfaces of longitudinal members <b>46</b> lie in and define a plane also referred to herein as a retail merchandise support surface. This plane may be considered to be the plane within which the uppermost point of the circular cross section of each support member <b>46</b> lies with. The foregoing of course does not include the upturned ends <b>48</b> of the outermost longitudinal members <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Base structure <b>34</b> also includes a pair of support blocks <b>52</b> which mount within apertures formed in support members <b>42</b> as described below. Additionally, a plurality of mounting clips <b>54</b> are mounted at the interface of each support block <b>52</b> within support members <b>42</b>. Mounting clips <b>54</b> also provide pad like surfaces on their undersides for purposes of mounting pusher tray <b>20</b> to retail shelf <b>22</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Each divider <b>38</b> includes an arcuate frame section <b>60</b> supported by two frame elements <b>62</b> which are welded to arcuate frame portion <b>60</b>. Each support element includes a straight portion <b>64</b> and an angled portion <b>66</b> which extends in an upwardly angled manner from straight portion <b>64</b> at an angle which is greater than ninety degrees but less than one hundred and eighty degrees. As can be seen from inspection of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, straight portion <b>64</b> of each support element <b>62</b> is parallel to the previously described retail merchandise support plane or surface. Angled portions <b>66</b> extend relative to the aforementioned plane at a non-perpendicular angle.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, dividers <b>38</b> will be described in even greater detail. Dividers <b>38</b> are identical, and as such, the following description applies to both. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, angled portions <b>66</b> form an angle Î with straight portion <b>64</b> which as described above is greater than ninety degrees but less than one hundred and eighty degrees. As can also be seen in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, angled portions <b>66</b> are approximately tangent to a radius of curvature R formed by arcuate frame portion <b>60</b>. This radius of curvature R of arcuate frame portion <b>60</b> approximates the outer diameter of the retail merchandise intended to be carried by pusher tray <b>20</b>. As such, in the illustrated embodiment radius of curvature R may be approximately six inches so as to accommodate a twelve inch diameter article of retail merchandise, e.g. a frozen pizza. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize, however, that radius of curvature R may be modified to approximate the radius of curvature of an outer periphery of the retail merchandise carried by pusher tray <b>20</b>. As one non-limiting example, radius of curvature R may be between about three inches and about twelve inches. However, the specific dimensions of the radius of curvature R provided should be taken by way of example only.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, one of the two dividers <b>38</b> is shown in side view. As can be seen in this view, arcuate frame portion <b>60</b> has an overall length of W<sub>1</sub>. The associated support elements <b>62</b> of this divider <b>38</b> are spaced apart at a distance of W<sub>2</sub>. W1 is greater than W<sub>2</sub>. This allows the mounting locations of each divider <b>38</b> relative to base structure <b>34</b> to be spaced inwardly from the opposed ends of base structure <b>34</b> but still allows for the containment of retail merchandise <b>24</b> along the full length of base structure <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the straight portion <b>64</b> of each support element <b>62</b> is received through apertures <b>74</b> formed in each support member <b>42</b>. It will be recognized from inspection of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> that the straight portion <b>64</b> of the forwardmost support element <b>62</b> of the rightmost divider <b>38</b> (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) overlaps the straight portion <b>64</b> of the forwardmost support element <b>62</b> of the leftmost divider <b>38</b> (See <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). It will also be recognized that the above-described construction of apertures <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> relative to the rightmost support member <b>42</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is identical to the aperture configuration for receiving straight portions <b>64</b> in the leftmost support member <b>42</b> (See <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) proximal the front end of pusher tray <b>20</b>. Straight portions <b>64</b> are entirely removable from base structure <b>34</b> such that other dividers may be utilized having a different shape. For example, in the case of rectangular retail merchandise, e.g. boxed frozen pizza, upright dividers may be utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As can also be seen in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, each support member <b>42</b> includes a relief notch <b>82</b> which is recessed from an upper edge <b>84</b> of the support member <b>42</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. This relief notch <b>82</b> is formed proximal the front end of support member <b>42</b>. Relief notch <b>82</b> also includes a seat <b>86</b> for receiving the circular outer periphery of the frontmost lateral member <b>50</b> of wire structure <b>44</b>. As can be seen from inspection of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the foregoing construction of relief notch <b>82</b> allows for the retail merchandise support plane or surface described above to be in close proximity to upper edge <b>84</b> of support member <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In the case of heavier merchandise, some flexure of longitudinal members <b>46</b> may occur. However, as this flexure continues, eventually the retail merchandise will contact the upper edge <b>84</b> of the support member <b>42</b> so as to limit further flexure of longitudinal members <b>46</b>. The foregoing description of relief notch <b>82</b> and its associated functionality for support member <b>42</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is identical to the other support member <b>42</b>. Furthermore, an identical configuration of apertures for receiving straight portions <b>64</b> of support elements <b>62</b> and relief notches exist on the base structure <b>34</b> proximal the rear end of base structure <b>34</b> as can readily been seen from inspection of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Accordingly, additional description of these identical elements has been dispensed with for purposes of brevity.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, support blocks <b>52</b> will be described in greater detail. The frontmost support block <b>52</b> of pusher tray <b>20</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. The following description applies equally well to the rearmost support block <b>52</b> (See <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). For purposes of brevity, a redundant description of the rearmost support block <b>52</b> is omitted. Each support block <b>52</b> includes a pair of parallel passageways <b>88</b>. These passageways <b>88</b> receive straight portions <b>64</b> of support elements <b>62</b>. Additionally, each support block <b>52</b> includes a pair of rotatable clips <b>90</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, a portion of each clip <b>90</b> extends through an aperture formed in each passageway <b>88</b> to apply a frictional force against straight portion <b>64</b> to block straight portion <b>64</b> within passageway <b>88</b>. Indeed, in normal operation straight portions <b>64</b> are slideable within passageways <b>88</b> to vary the overall width or spacing of the opposed dividers <b>38</b> (See <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). This allows for the accommodation of retail merchandise of differing widths.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Once a particular width has been selected, however, it is undesirable for any unintended movement of dividers <b>38</b> to occur. As a result, clips <b>90</b> lock dividers <b>38</b> in place. The foregoing construction can also be seen from inspection of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a cross section taken through support block <b>52</b> to expose the interior of passageways <b>88</b> and the corresponding receipt of straight portion <b>64</b> therein. As can also be seen in this view, a contact portion <b>92</b> extends into a corresponding aperture <b>94</b>, forms in each passageway <b>88</b>. As can also be seen in this view, flanges <b>96</b> extend from the opposed sides of support block <b>52</b>. The flanges <b>96</b> extend into the above-described apertures <b>74</b> formed in each side member <b>42</b>. This configuration permits for the snapped mounting of each support block <b>52</b> to support members <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, pusher <b>36</b> will be described in greater detail. Pusher <b>36</b> includes a base, <b>102</b>. Base <b>102</b> is parallel to the above-described retail merchandise plane or support surface. Pusher <b>36</b> also includes a front wall <b>104</b> which extends from floor <b>102</b> at an angle Î± of less than ninety degrees. As will be described in greater detail below, the non-perpendicular construction of the front wall <b>104</b> allows for the area of the front wall <b>104</b> proximal the bottom thereof adjacent floor <b>102</b> to make first contact with retail merchandise. In the context of circular retail merchandise, e.g. frozen pizzas, the applicants have discovered that this configuration advantageously prevents the above-described forward lean or tipping caused by pusher structures which had a front wall generally perpendicular to the retail merchandise support surface. Indeed, unlike those configurations described above which contact the merchandise at a height which is relatively far away from the bottom of the retail merchandise, the tendency for the merchandise to lean forward or tip is significantly reduced or entirely prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As can also be seen in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a plurality of support ribs <b>106</b> are formed on a back surface of front wall <b>104</b> and are joined with floor <b>102</b> to reinforce pusher <b>36</b>. Additionally, one or more biasing elements, which in the exemplary embodiment are coil springs <b>108</b>, are carried by pusher <b>36</b> and between adjacent ribs <b>106</b>. As is generally known in the art, a terminal end of each coil spring <b>108</b> extends through an opening formed in pusher <b>36</b> and connects to a front end of pusher tray <b>20</b> to provide a biasing force to move pusher <b>36</b> toward front stop <b>28</b>. Additionally, and with momentary reference back to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, pusher <b>36</b> also includes wire receiving elements <b>110</b> extending from floor <b>102</b> which receive select ones of longitudinal members <b>46</b> of wire structure <b>34</b> to slideably retain pusher <b>36</b> on wire structure <b>44</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">With reference now to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the foregoing advantages of the angled front wall <b>104</b> of pusher <b>36</b> are illustrated. As can be seen in this view, due to the acute angle Î± formed by front wall <b>104</b> with floor <b>102</b> of pusher <b>36</b>, retail merchandise <b>24</b> is maintained generally vertical or perpendicular relative to the above-described retail support plane or surface. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, upper edges of retail merchandise <b>24</b> are generally in a cascaded or stepped configuration due to a slight rearward lean of merchandise <b>24</b>. This configuration advantageously allows for the easy gripping of the front-most one of retail merchandise <b>24</b> as this upper-most edge is easily in view and differentiated from adjacent merchandise <b>24</b>. Contrast the foregoing with a non-cascaded arrangement. In such a configuration, there is a tendency for consumers to accidently grab not only the frontmost item of retail merchandise, but also subsequent items of retail merchandise located by the tray. In such circumstances, customers oftentimes place the additional items on the floor or in other areas other than the tray itself which results in spoilage, as well as the attendant cleanup and restocking</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Turning now to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, and alternate embodiment of pusher tray <b>20</b> is illustrated. This embodiment differs from the above described embodiment only to the extent that it is configured to mount on a retail merchandise support bar <b>144</b> as shown, as opposed to a retail shelf. In this embodiment, each support member <b>42</b> includes hook portions <b>142</b> to facilitate such mounting. These hook portions <b>142</b> may be unitary with the remainder support member <b>42</b>, or may be additional plate elements which are welded to support member <b>42</b>. In such a welded up embodiment, the hook portions <b>142</b> may include an elongate portion which overlaps a portion of support member <b>42</b>, such that the combined bending resistance of this region of overlap is greater than a bending resistance of the remainder of each support member <b>42</b> not so overlapped. It will also be appreciated that such elongate portions will also include apertures which align with existing apertures <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to allow for passage of horizontal portions <b>64</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Although not illustrated, pusher <b>36</b> may also include a locking arm such as the locking arm described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/288,058, filed on Nov. 3, 2011, titled, âMerchandise Pusher Tray With Adjustable Side Barriersâ, which is assigned to the instant assignee, and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety by reference thereto. Such a locking arm advantageously allows pusher <b>36</b> to be locked in a position proximal the rear of pusher tray <b>30</b> so that merchandise <b>24</b> may be readily loaded into pusher tray without having to keep a hand on pusher <b>36</b> to force it to the rear of tray <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As described herein, the embodiments of the instant invention advantageously overcomes existing problems in the art with pusher trays by readily accommodating items of retail merchandise having a circular outer periphery, e.g. frozen pizzas, while also preventing the heretofore unacceptable forward lean or tipping of such items of retail merchandise caused by conventional pusher trays.</p>
