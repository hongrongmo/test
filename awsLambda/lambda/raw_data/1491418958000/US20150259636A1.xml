    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to a biogas plant according to the preamble of claim <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Biogas plants having a fermenter tank, in which an assembly carrier is mounted, preferably oriented vertically, are generally known. An assembly, in particular a submersible motor-driven agitator, is usually held on the assembly carrier in a height-adjustable manner by means of a height adjustment device.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A height adjustment device for a submersible motor-driven agitator is already known from EP 0 894 525 B1, the height adjustment device being designed here as a rope winch which has a rope drum connected firmly to the assembly carrier and having a horizontal rope drum shaft. Further, a rope which, on the one hand, is connected to the assembly and, on the other hand, can be wound onto the rope drum is provided, the rope drum being arranged inside the fermenter tank, so that there is no need for a gastight rope leadthrough through a tank wall. The rope drum is assigned a rope drum drive which can be actuated by means of an actuation device arranged outside the tank.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A rope winch of this type as a height adjustment device has a series of disadvantages: thus, on the one hand, the disadvantage that the rope is guided and accommodated in the fermenter tank containing substances and liquids to be fermented and also gases which constitute a highly corrosive medium for the rope which is usually produced as a steel rope. Moreover, the risk of corrosion is further increased in that, when the rope is wound onto the rope drum, a plurality of rope plies are pressed closely one against the other and are wound up under the action of the force exerted by the assembly suspended on the rope, this, on the one hand, leading to pronounced mechanical rope stress, for example to rope tears caused by chafing, etc. and moreover also appreciably increasing the risk of corrosion for the individual rope regions lying one against the other. This mechanical stress and corrosion of the rope which progress in course of time ultimately lead to rope breakages regularly occurring, the result of this being that the assembly held on it then slumps downward in an undesirable way onto the bottom of the fermenter tank. The ultimate consequence of this is that the operation of the fermenter tank and therefore of the entire biogas plant has to be stopped and the assembly has to be recovered in a complicated way. This may take place, for example, using divers, but this is highly questionable for safety reasons. In practice, therefore, if such an accident occurs, the fermenter tank is normally emptied and subsequently cleaned because sediments or settling layers are deposited on the fermenter bottom. Moreover, before this work, the tank has to be ventilated in order to remove the biogas still produced, so that this is not harmful to the workers. When such an accident occurs, therefore, a considerable production outage has to be expected, since, after the damage has been rectified, the overall biology has to be reestablished and started again. This usually means, in the event of an accident, a shutdown of the plant of two or three months, which for a biogas plant sometimes may even mean financial failure.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Further, the rope has the disadvantage that it has to be wound up and therefore, in the case of long rope lengths, a relatively large rope drum is also required which usually does not fit through standard servicing orifices or standard servicing shafts.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Furthermore, contaminants, such as, for example, long-fiber material, etc., are also drawn up on the rope and are wound around the rope drum. This then leads to blockages and possibly even to the loss of height adjustment.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A further substantial disadvantage of such a rope winch as a height adjustment device is that the rope is a flexurally slack component which is not dimensionally stable and which is incapable of making the desired guidance stability available when the assembly is being lowered and raised, as a result of which, particularly when the floating layers or foam layers of the fermenter tank are being punctured, lowering problems regularly arise, since these floating or foam layers are often so dense that there is the risk that the assembly itself âfloatsâ to some extent and therefore cannot be lowered quickly and in a functionally reliable manner in the desired way.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Moreover, since the rope is relatively âlightâ, there is the risk that it is sucked up by the blade due to the pull occurring behind the agitator. Consequently, in the event of uncontrolled lowering, in which the assembly remains stuck, for example, in a floating layer, the rope runs the risk of being sucked up and of becoming caught in the blade. As a result of this, not only may the rope tear (thus leading to the disadvantages already described above), but the assembly itself may also be damaged, in that, for example, the blade or blades breaks off or break off at the front; or else the assembly is drawn forward at the top and knocks against its own mast.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">If the assembly breaks off and slumps or falls downward, there is also the risk that it penetrates into any heating pipes present, or knocks against the wall and/or other installation parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Furthermore, a flexurally slack rope of this type does not enable complete full mixing of the tank to take place.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Clearly, therefore, designing a height adjustment device as a rope winch with rope plies subjected to high mechanical stress, in which the rope drum and the rope capable of being wound on it are also arranged in the fermenter tank inner space and are consequently exposed permanently to a corrosive medium or a corrosive atmosphere, constitutes a considerable potential risk for the permanent functionally reliable operation of the height adjustment device and therefore of the fermenter tank and therefore, in turn, of the entire biogas plant. This risk can be counteracted only by the traction rope being regularly exchanged in the context of servicing work, this obviously entailing an extremely high outlay for the biogas plant operator.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The object of the present invention, therefore, is to make available a biogas plant with a fermenter tank, by means of which assembly adjustment along an assembly carrier in the fermenter tank can be implemented in a simple and functionally reliable way, even over a lengthy period of time.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">This object is achieved by means of the features of patent claim <b>1</b>. Advantageous refinements of this are the subject matter of the subclaims referring back to it.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to patent claim <b>1</b>, a biogas plant is proposed, with a fermenter tank in which an assembly carrier is mounted, preferably oriented vertically, an assembly, in particular a submersible motor-driven agitator, being held on the assembly carrier in a height-adjustable manner by means of a height adjustment device. According to the invention, the height adjustment device is formed by a wrap-around drive, the traction means of which is guided around at least two deflection elements spaced apart from one another in the assembly carrier longitudinal direction, at least one of the deflection elements being drivable in rotation by means of a drive device, and the assembly being coupled to the traction means in such a way that it is raised upon rotary actuation of the deflection element in a first direction and lowered upon rotary actuation of the deflection element in a second, opposite direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The tie-up of the traction means may take place, in principle, at the same tie-up point on the assembly; however, it is especially preferable to have a tie-up of the two free end regions of the traction means at assembly-side tie-up points spaced apart from one another, for example at assembly-side tie-up points lying more or less opposite one another, as seen in the adjustment direction. Offset tie-up, for example, is also possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The particular advantage of this solution according to the invention is that, by means of a wrap-around drive of this type, it can be ensured in a particularly simple way, for example during lowering, that the assembly can be drawn through the fermenter tank-side floating or foam layers, since, by means of such a wrap-around drive, it is ensured in a simple way that, during lowering, a correspondingly downwardly directed tractive force component acts upon the assembly. Moreover, such a wrap-around drive reliably prevents the situation where the traction means can be sucked up by the blade due to the pull which occurs behind an agitator or such like assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Moreover, by means of a set-up of this type, the risk of breakage in respect of the traction means can advantageously be markedly reduced, since a traction means used in this way according to the invention, for example in the form of a traction chain, can be designed to be sufficiently stable so that the traction means, even in a slightly corroded state, still has such sufficient strength to be able to raise and lower an assembly in the medium of the fermenter tank in a functionally reliable and dependable way.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Furthermore, such a traction means does not need to be wound onto a rope drum, and therefore, overall, there is a compact type of construction and the traction means has no regions which are subjected to force and are therefore pressed closely together and one against the other and which are subjected to high mechanical stress. Moreover, because there is no winding of the traction means onto a rope drum, very large height adjustments of an assembly of, for example, well above 6 m can also be implemented in a simple way.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The traction means may, in principle, be designed in various ways, such as, for example, in the manner of a profile belt or toothed belt, if appropriate even as a rope (for example, in conjunction with short maintenance and exchange intervals or times of the rope). Especially preferably, however, the traction means is formed by a stable traction chain, preferably by a multidimensionally movable chain, in particular a link chain or round link chain, or alternatively by a merely one-dimensionally movable articulated chain. A merely one-dimensionally movable articulated chain of this type may be formed, in turn, by a roller chain or a bush chain or bolt chain or such like articulated chains. When a traction chain is used, the rotationally drivable deflection element is then preferably formed by at least one rotatably mounted chain wheel, such as, for example, a chain sprocket, which is in positive engagement with the traction chain. A further essential advantage of such a design of the traction means as a traction chain, particularly as a one-dimensionally movable articulated chain designed, for example, in the manner of a bicycle chain, is that it is heavier than a traction rope and, if appropriate, is dimensionally stable in defined directions and therefore, contrary to a flexurally slack rope, makes available a certain guidance stability which, in conjunction particularly with the lowering of an assembly, is advantageous, since the floating or foam layers which may be formed in the fermenter tank can consequently be punctured more simply and drifting of the assembly can be reliably avoided. Overall, therefore, such a traction chain, particularly in the form of a one-dimensionally movable articulated chain, gives the set-up overall a higher stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Thus, by means of the solution according to the invention, a concept, entirely novel in respect of EP 0 894 525 B1 and based on a different functional and operative principle, of a height adjustment device, in conjunction with fermenter tanks of biogas plants, is made available.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">It should be expressly mentioned at this juncture that the term âfermenter tankâ stands as a generic term for all the tanks of a biogas plant in which an assembly can be mounted in a height-adjustable manner; the term âfermenter tankâ is to that extent to be interpreted broadly and comprehensively here.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to an especially preferred concrete refinement of the idea of the present invention, it is proposed that the individual axes of articulation of the articulated chain are designed to be essentially axially parallel to the axis of rotation of the chain wheel, so that the articulated chain has in the desired way, in the other two directions, a certain dimensional stability and rigidity which contribute to improving the guidance stability of the height adjustment device during the lowering and raising of the assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">According to a concrete embodiment according to the invention, it is proposed that the traction means be guided from a tie-up point on the assembly upward in the direction of the vertical axis around a preferably rotationally drivable deflection element and from there downward to at least one lower deflection element, from where the traction means is guided upward again back to the assembly and is tied up there. This ensures that the upper, easily accessible deflection element forms the rotationally driven deflection element and is therefore also easily accessible for servicing and repair work. The lower deflection element may be arranged indirectly or directly on the assembly carrier and may also be formed, for example, by a guide rail or the like. However, a refinement is especially preferred in which the lower deflection element is likewise mounted rotatably, for example is designed as a guide wheel. A refinement is most especially preferred in which, in the event of the traction means being formed by a traction chain, the lower deflection element is also formed by a chain wheel which, similarly to the above-described chain wheel, is in engagement with the traction chain, thus ensuring in a simple way that the traction chain is guided and held positively in a dependable and functionally reliable way along the entire wrap-around drive. Particularly in conjunction with a wrap-around drive of this type, the refinement of the traction means as a one-dimensionally movable articulated chain is also especially advantageous, since this ensures in a simple way that the articulated chain as traction means cannot buckle in the direction of the axis of articulation of the articulated chain, thus ensuring in a simple way that the articulated chain as traction means is held in the wrap-around drive plane provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">It will be appreciated that the wrap-around drive itself may also have further additional deflection elements or rotatable or non-rotatable deflection elements, such as, for example, chain wheels, this also depending, for example, on the length of the traction means. By means of additional deflection elements of this type, the functional reliability and operating reliability of the wrap-around drive can be ensured in a simple way. Moreover, a tension element formed, for example, by such a deflection element may also be provided, by means of which, for example, the chain tension can be set, this likewise contributing to ensuring the operating reliability of the wrap-around drive and consequently of the height adjustment device.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">A wrap-around drive of this type is preferably arranged in the tank inner space of the fermenter tank, the rotationally drivable deflection element or a drive device operatively connected to the latter being actuable from outside the fermenter tank by means of an actuation device. An arrangement of this type in the tank inner space expressly comprises tank configurations in which the height adjustment device according to the invention is arranged in a dome-like region of a servicing shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The deflection elements of the wrap-around drive are secured, spaced apart from one another, to the assembly carrier indirectly or directly, for example via holding and mounting plates and angle pieces, thus ensuring that the wrap-around drive is mounted and arranged in a simple way.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The at least one deflection element of the wrap-around drive may be assigned at least one one-part or multipart guide and/or lead element, for example a lead plate or the like, in such a way that the traction means, in particular a traction chain, such as, for example, a link chain or an articulated chain, is held permanently in engagement with the assigned deflection element, preferably a chain wheel. For this purpose, the at least one one-part or multipart guide and/or lead element is preferably guided around with a defined gap clearance over at least a subregion of the respective deflection element. A guide and/or lead element of this type may, in principle, be designed in various ways. For example, a guide and/or lead element which is upper in the direction of the vertical axis may be designed, in particular designed in multipart form, such that it provides for drawn-up solids an outlet orifice or outlet gap, via which the drawn-up impurities, such as, for example, fibrous substances, can emerge from the region of the wrap-around drive and be separated off. In any event, a refinement is also preferred in which the lead element covers the deflection element, for example a chain wheel, essentially over a large part or else over the entire deflection or engagement region, in order to ensure that, to name only one example, the, for example, desired number of teeth of a chain wheel are also always in engagement with the assigned engagement region of the traction chain or articulated chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">What all the embodiments have in common is that the rotationally drivable deflection element may be assigned a preferably electrically, hydraulically, pneumatically or manually operable drive device, by means of which the deflection element can be driven in rotation indirectly or directly in a simple way. According to an embodiment which is especially preferred in this respect, there is provision whereby the deflection element is an integral part of a drive shaft which, furthermore, has a drive pinion which cooperates with a gear which drives the drive pinion and therefore the deflection element. Such a set-up makes it possible to have many structural freedoms and, moreover, is highly functionally reliable in daily practice and in attendance. This applies, above all, to the especially preferred case where the gear is an integral part of a hollow shaft arrangement, in which, in a hollow shaft forming, if appropriate, a ceiling wall rotary bearing and/or forming, if appropriate, an integral part of the assembly carrier, a drive shaft is mounted rotatably, which has an engagement region meshing indirectly or directly with the drive pinion. Moreover, this drive shaft is preferably led with a free end out of the fermenter tank. The latter case, above all, makes it possible especially simply and reliably in terms of attendance to provide a drive motor which drives the drive shaft and which can be actuated by an actuation device. In principle, a gear of this type may be designed in many different ways. However, there is especially preferably provision whereby the gear is a worm drive with a worm shaft as drive shaft, the engagement region of which is formed by a worm thread. A worm drive of this type is especially robust and has advantageous self-locking which ensures that set height positions of the assembly can be held in a functionally reliable way.</p>

      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In a servicing situation, the assembly <b>10</b>, which is mounted in a height-adjustable manner on the assembly carrier <b>2</b> and is formed here, for example, by a submersible motor-driven agitator, can then, by the assembly carrier <b>2</b> being pivoted about its longitudinal axis, be pivoted to the left through 180Â° out of the right-hand position shown in the image plane of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and subsequently, by actuation of the height adjustment device <b>11</b>, explained in more detail below, can be raised upwardly to an extent such that the assembly <b>10</b> is accessible via the servicing orifice <b>6</b> or can be displaced outside the fermenter tank <b>1</b> through the servicing orifice <b>6</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Instead of an L-type servicing shaft <b>5</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a box-shaped servicing shaft <b>12</b> may also be provided, as is depicted merely by dashes in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, into which the assembly <b>10</b> can be moved for servicing and repair work and which is accessible, for example, via an access door or access flap.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The height adjustment device <b>11</b> is formed here by a wrap-around drive, in which an articulated chain <b>13</b>, movable here, for example, only one-dimensionally, as a traction means or traction chain is guided from a first tie-up point <b>14</b> on the assembly <b>10</b> upward in the direction z of the vertical axis around a chain wheel <b>15</b> and from there downward to a here, for example, lower chain wheel <b>38</b> as a lower deflection element which is mounted rotatably on the assembly carrier <b>2</b>. As may be gathered particularly from <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment the two chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b> may be fastened indirectly or, as shown here, directly to the assembly carrier <b>2</b> via mounting trestles or mounting plates <b>39</b>, for example by means of a plurality of screw connections <b>40</b>. For this purpose, the mounting trestles or mounting plates <b>39</b> may preferably be designed to be angled such that the planes of rotation of the chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b> lie approximately in the longitudinal mid-plane of the assembly carrier <b>2</b>, so that the assembly <b>10</b> itself, oriented approximately centrally, is height-adjustable along the assembly carrier <b>2</b>. It will be appreciated that the arrangement of the assembly <b>10</b> offset with respect to the longitudinal mid-plane of the assembly carrier <b>2</b> is, of course, also possible in principle.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The articulated chain <b>13</b> is then guided from the lower chain wheel <b>38</b> upward again back to the assembly <b>10</b> and is tied there with its second free end region to a second tie-up point <b>41</b> which here, merely by way of example, lies so as to be spaced apart from and below the first tie-up point <b>14</b> of the first free articulated chain end region.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Thus, by means of a set-up of this type, a wrap-around drive is formed, into which the assembly <b>10</b> is incorporated in such a way that the assembly <b>10</b> can be raised upon rotary actuation of the chain wheel <b>15</b> via an electric, pneumatic or hydraulic drive motor <b>19</b>, flanged, for example, to the upper mounting plane <b>19</b> and/or to the assembly carrier <b>2</b>, in a first direction and can be lowered upon rotary actuation of the chain wheel <b>15</b> in a second, opposite direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The drive motor <b>19</b> is here coupled or operatively connected via piping, hosing or cabling <b>21</b> to an actuation device <b>20</b> arranged outside the fermenter tank <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As is evident particularly from <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the free chain region <b>42</b> of the articulated chain <b>13</b>, that is to say that chain subregion, into which the assembly <b>10</b> is not incorporated, between the two chain wheels <b>15</b> and <b>38</b>, is guided here, free of obstruction, for example, through a leadthrough <b>43</b> formed on the assembly side. This assembly-side leadthrough <b>43</b> may be designed, for example, as a slot, gap or such like recess, moreover with or without a guide element, such as, for example, a guide roller or the like. Alternatively to this, however, the chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b> could also be offset with respect to the longitudinal center of the assembly carrier <b>2</b> such that, for example in the case of chain wheel diameters designed to be correspondingly large, the free movement of the free chain region <b>42</b> is ensured via the arrangement and/or dimensioning of the chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b>. Alternatively, also, if appropriate, the arrangement of the chain wheels <b>15</b> and <b>38</b> could also be such that the free chain region <b>42</b> runs inside the assembly carrier <b>2</b> which is preferably designed as a hollow profile carrier. Furthermore, further deflection elements or tension elements could also be provided, which, for example, supplement and extend the wrap-around drive, shown here, in such a way that chain guidance is designed in the manner of a block and tackle and it is ensured that the free chain region <b>42</b> always lies outside the range of movement of the assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Moreover, by means of a tension element, the chain tension can be maintained in the desired way, in order to prevent the chain from jumping out. Alternatively or additionally to this, in connection with both chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b>, as illustrated diagrammatically in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, there may also be provision, in turn, for providing there lead elements <b>25</b> which have a gap clearance with respect to the chain wheel such that the articulated chain <b>13</b> is held permanently in engagement connection with the in each case assigned chain wheel <b>15</b> or <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">If, then, as illustrated diagrammatically in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the assembly <b>10</b> is to be lowered out of the raised position, shown by unbroken lines, downward into the fermenter tank <b>1</b>, the drive motor <b>19</b> is activated by the actuation device <b>20</b> for a predetermined time duration such that said drive motor rotates the chain wheel <b>15</b> clockwise until the assembly <b>10</b> is lowered into the desired lowered position <b>26</b>, illustrated here, for example, by dashed lines. When the desired position is reached, the drive motor <b>19</b> is stopped and consequently the chain wheel <b>15</b> is halted, with the result that the assembly <b>10</b> is held reliably in the desired lowered position <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">It will be appreciated that both the length of the articulated chain <b>13</b> and the distance between the two chain wheels <b>15</b>, <b>38</b> are, of course, stipulated such that all the desired height positions of the assembly <b>10</b> in the fermenter tank <b>1</b> can consequently be assumed.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">If the assembly <b>10</b> is then to be raised again from the lowered position <b>26</b>, illustrated by dashes in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, into the higher position, illustrated by unbroken lines, once more the drive motor <b>19</b> is activated via the actuation device <b>20</b>, specifically, this time, such that the chain wheel <b>15</b> is rotated counterclockwise, as a result of which, in turn, that region of the articulated chain <b>13</b> which is tied to the assembly <b>10</b> at the first tie-up point <b>14</b> and therefore the assembly <b>10</b> are drawn upward.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">It will be appreciated, further, that the solution according to the invention can, of course, be used with any type of tank or fermenter tank, that is to say, in particular, also with fermenter tanks having a fixed horizontal ceiling wall and with fermenter tanks having a sheet roof or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Provided in each case above the upper rotationally drivable chain wheel <b>15</b> and below the lower chain wheel <b>38</b> in the direction z of the vertical axis is a lead element <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>which has a defined gap clearance in relation to the respective chain wheel <b>15</b>, <b>38</b>, in such a way that the articulated chain <b>13</b> is held permanently in engagement connection with the chain wheel <b>15</b>. The lower lead element <b>25</b><i>b </i>is designed here, for example, to be arcuately curved and is guided, for example, in the form of a lead plate or the like around a large part of the engagement region of the lower chain wheel <b>38</b>. By contrast, the upper lead element <b>25</b><i>a </i>is formed here, for example, in two parts by lead jaws <b>25</b><i>d</i>, <b>25</b><i>e </i>which are spaced apart from one another and between them form an outlet orifice <b>25</b><i>c </i>and which here are set obliquely, for example, in a roof-shaped manner, thus ensuring that solids drawn up by the articulated chain <b>13</b> can be discharged in a functionally reliable manner via the outlet orifice <b>25</b><i>c </i>and consequently the risk of blockage in the region of the upper chain wheel <b>15</b> is avoided. Such lead elements <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>thus ensure a functionally reliable engagement connection between the articulated chain <b>13</b> and the respective chain wheel <b>15</b>, <b>38</b> and therefore, in particular, help to prevent the articulated chain <b>13</b> from jumping out of the engagement connection with the chain wheel <b>15</b> or <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As may be gathered particularly from <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, the traction chain is formed here, for example, by a one-dimensionally movable articulated chain <b>13</b>, the axes of articulation <b>32</b> of which are oriented essentially axially parallel to the axis of rotation of the chain wheel <b>15</b>, with the result that reliable guidance of the assembly <b>10</b> both during raising and during lowering is achieved. In particular, an articulated chain <b>13</b> of this type ensures that floating or foam layers <b>27</b> possibly present, which are illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> only extremely diagrammatically and by way of example, can be punctured reliably when the assembly <b>10</b> is being lowered, since, contrary to an overall flexurally slack rope, the articulated chain <b>13</b> does not permit any major shifting movements of the assembly and therefore the puncturing of the floating layer <b>27</b> can take place in a more controlled way.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Moreover, such an articulated chain <b>13</b> as traction chain makes it possible to stabilize the assembly <b>10</b> when the latter is in operation, this having an advantageous effect, for example, upon the agitation result.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the articulated chain is formed here, for example, by outer link plates <b>28</b> which are connected to one another via bolts <b>30</b> and are spaced apart from one another. Inner link plates <b>29</b> are mounted pivotably on the bolts <b>30</b>, in each case rollers <b>31</b> being mounted rotatably on the bolts <b>30</b> between the two inner link plates. By means of such an exemplary set-up of an articulated chain <b>13</b>, advantageous flexural rigidity in the direction of the axes of articulation <b>32</b> and to some extent also in the chain longitudinal direction is thus achieved. Articulation is provided to the desired extent around the axes of articulation <b>32</b> only.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">By means of such an articulated chain <b>13</b> as traction chain of a height adjustment device, therefore, desired transverse stabilization and guidance stabilization of an assembly during its height adjustment are made possible, this having a positive effect both on the lowering operation and on the raising operation and, moreover, also resulting in positive effects upon the agitation result by means of the assembly <b>10</b> designed, for example, as a submersible motor-driven agitator.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Although the above exemplary embodiments were described in terms of the use of an articulated chain, a multidimensionally, in particular two-dimensionally movable traction chain, for example a link chain, such as, for example, a round link chain, may, of course, be employed and used instead of an articulated chain of this type.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Moreover, <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows a refinement, alternative to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in which the chain wheel <b>15</b> arranged at the top is an integral part of a drive shaft <b>17</b>, on which, furthermore, is mounted (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>) a drive pinion <b>17</b><i>a </i>which cooperates with a worm drive <b>17</b><i>b </i>which drives the drive pinion <b>17</b><i>a </i>and consequently the chain wheel <b>15</b>. The worm drive <b>17</b><i>b </i>is an integral part of a hollow shaft arrangement, in which, in a hollow shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>forming the ceiling wall rotary bearing <b>3</b> and forming an integral part of the assembly carrier <b>2</b>, a worm shaft <b>17</b><i>c </i>is mounted rotatably, which has a worm thread <b>17</b><i>d </i>meshing here directly with the drive pinion <b>17</b><i>a </i>(the interposition of one or more gear wheels would, of course, also be possible) and which is guided with a free end <b>17</b><i>e </i>out of the fermenter tank <b>1</b>, illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, for example, by a ceiling wall <b>5</b><i>a</i>, depicted by dashes, of the servicing shaft <b>5</b>. Provided there is a drive motor <b>19</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>) which drives the worm shaft <b>17</b><i>c </i>and which is illustrated here only extremely diagrammatically and by way of example. This drive motor <b>19</b> can be actuated by an actuation device <b>20</b> which is likewise arranged outside the fermenter tank <b>1</b>, for which purpose the drive motor <b>19</b> is connected by means of a signal line <b>20</b><i>a</i>, illustrated by dashes here. It will be appreciated that the drive motor <b>19</b>, together with the worm shaft <b>17</b><i>c</i>, is designed such that the worm shaft <b>17</b><i>c </i>and consequently the drive pinion <b>17</b><i>a </i>and the chain wheel <b>15</b> can be driven in rotation both in one direction and in the other direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Furthermore, outside the fermenter tank <b>1</b> a further drive motor <b>21</b> is arranged (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>), by means of which the hollow shaft <b>3</b><i>a </i>connected firmly to the assembly carrier <b>2</b> and, consequently, the assembly carrier <b>2</b> can be pivoted via a gear arrangement <b>21</b><i>a</i>, not illustrated any further here. The activation of the drive motor <b>21</b> likewise takes place via the actuation device <b>20</b> by means of a signal line <b>20</b><i>b</i>. It should be expressly mentioned at this juncture that the pivoting of the assembly carrier <b>2</b> may alternatively also take place manually, for example via a pivoting lever, although this is not illustrated here. The worm shaft <b>17</b><i>c </i>could likewise also be driven manually, for example by means of a crank handle, although this is not illustrated here.</p>
