No. 61/675,357, filed Jul. 25, 2012, and European Patent Application 12177761.9, filed Jul. 25, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporate herein by reference in their entireties.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to coating material compositions comprising at least one polyhydroxyl group-containing compound (A), at least one polyisocyanate group-containing compound (B), and as catalyst (D) at least one amine-blocked phosphoric acid compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention additionally provides multistage coating methods using these coating material compositions, and also the use of the coating material compositions as clearcoat material and/or pigmented coating material, and use of the coating method for automotive refinish and/or for the coating of parts for installation in or on automobiles, of plastics substrates and/or of utility vehicles.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Polyurethane coating materials typically comprise a catalyst, and in this context not only acidic compounds but also, in particular, tertiary amines and/or metallic compounds, such as various tin compounds, for example, more particularly dibutyltin dilaurate and dibutyltin oxide, are employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The employment of tin-containing catalysts is to be avoided in coating materials, as elsewhere, because of the toxicity inherent in many tin compounds. The EU Commission's Working Group on Classification and Labellingâ have categorized dibutyltin oxide (DBTO) and dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">WO04/029121 describes polyurethane compositions which are stabilized in terms of the reactivity of the composition by addition of acids with a pKa range between 2.8 and 4.5, these acids being able to be utilized at the same time as catalyst. Acids used in this context and with a pKa range between 2.8 and 4.5 include, for example, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, salicylic acid, phthalic acid, and so on. The compositions preferably comprise no further catalyst, although in addition it is also possible to use the typical known polyurethane catalysts, such as tertiary amines or amidines or organometallic compounds, such as tin compounds more particularly. Where amines are used as catalyst, it is necessary to employ great care in the selection of the type of amine and its amount, since the aminic catalysts are able in part to eliminate the stabilizing action of the organic acids added.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Further, EP-A-1 273 640 describes 2-component coating materials comprising a polyol component and a crosslinker component, consisting of aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic polyisocyanates or the polyisocyanates derived from them by polymerization, allophanatization, biuretization or urethaneization, where 0.1 to 95 mol % of the originally free isocyanate groups present have reacted with bisalkoxysilylamine. These coating materials can be used for OEM finishing and, following their complete curing, exhibit good scratch resistance in conjunction with high resistance towards environmental influences. Nevertheless, these coating materials have a particularly strong propensity towards ongoing crosslinking, which means that the scratch resistance of the coatingsâdirectly after thermal curing to completionâis no more than inadequate. In addition, the severe ongoing crosslinking has adverse consequences for the weathering stability, since the risk of stress cracks is increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Furthermore, WO 2001/98393, WO08/74491, WO 08/74490, WO 08/74489, WO09/077181 and WO 10/149236 disclose coating material compositions which comprise at least one hydroxyl-containing compound (A), at least one compound (B) containing isocyanate groups and silane groups, and a catalyst suitable for the crosslinking of the silane groups. Catalysts used are phosphorus-containing catalysts, more particularly phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing catalysts. These coating material compositions have the advantage over conventional polyurethane coating materials of a significantly enhanced scratch resistance in conjunction with good weathering stability. In need of improvement, however, is the curing of the coating material compositions at low cure temperatures, of the kind generally employed for automotive refinishing and/or for the coating of plastics substrates and/or utility vehicles.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">WO09/077180, moreover, describes coating material compositions of the aforementioned kind that comprise the at least one hydroxyl-containing compound (A), at least one compound (B) comprising isocyanate groups and silane groups, and, as catalyst (D), at least one phosphoric acid compound blocked with an amine, the amine used comprising more particularly bicyclic amines, preferably diazabicyclooctane; this does improve the curing at low cure temperatures, in relation to the coating materials of WO 2001/98393, WO08/74491, WO 08/74490, WO 08/74489, WO09/077181 and WO 10/149236, but even faster curing under the conditions of refinishing and the finishing of utility vehicles is desirable, and so the coatings after curing at 60Â° C. for just 30 minutes should exhibit a level of curing such that initial assembly operations or demasking can be performed without damage to the coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Finally, PCT patent applications PCT/EP2012/052284, PCT/EP2012/051444, PCT/EP2012/051574, PCT/EP2012/054546, not yet laid open, and European patent application No. 12152406.0, not yet laid open, describe coating material compositions which as well as at least one polyhydroxyl group-containing compound (A), at least one polyisocyanate group-containing compound (B) and at least one catalyst (D) based on a zinc-amidine complex, also comprise at least one monomeric aromatic, optionally substituted carboxylic acid (S), whose carboxyl group is conjugated with a Ï-electron system.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Provided, therefore, are coating material compositions, more particularly for automotive refinish and for the coating of utility vehicles, that ensure good assembly strength after just a very short time, meaning that they ensure rapid curing even under the conditions of refinish and of the finishing of utility vehicles, in other words, after curing at 60Â° C. for 30 minutes, already have undergone curing to an extent such that initial assembly operations or demasking operations can be carried out without damage to the coating. At the same time, however, the coating material compositions, at room temperature and after mixing of the binder component with the isocyanate component, have a good potlife of at least 2 hours. As used herein, the term âPotlifeâ refers to the period of time within which the coating material composition has attained twice its initial viscosity. Moreover, in one or more embodiments, the coating material compositions lead to coatings exhibiting good through-curing and sufficient ultimate hardness. Furthermore, these coating materials do not to show any color changes before and after curing. High demands are placed on the intrinsic color of the systems, particularly in the field of clearcoat materials in the automobile industry. Thus the catalyst of one or more embodiments neither must exhibit any intrinsic color and nor must it lead to discoloring at mixing or during curing of the coating material when the catalyst is mixed with the typical components of a coating material.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, the catalyst is able to be added to the binder component of the coating material composition from the outset. However, this admixing of the catalyst to the binder component from the outset does not to cause any adverse effect on the shelflife thereof. Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, the catalyst is insensitive to hydrolysis, since even in systems in organic solution, the typically high concentration of hydroxyl groups can result in a reduction in catalyst activity over the storage period. Especially in the automotive refinish segment, an extremely long shelflife even at relatively high temperatures is an advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Moreover, in one or more embodiments, the coating material compositions lead to coatings which have a high degree of scratch resistance and more particularly a high gloss retention after scratch exposure, and lead to a highly weathering-stable network, while at the same time ensuring high acid resistance. Moreover, the coatings and paint systems, especially the clearcoat systems, are able to be produced even in film thicknesses &gt;40 Î¼m without stress cracks appearing. Furthermore, a good overall visual appearance, as it is known, is ensured.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Lastly, the new coating materials of one or more embodiments are able to be prepared simply and with very good reproducibility, and do not cause any environmental problems during application.</p>

The pigments and/or fillers that are used for these purposes are known to the skilled person. The pigments are typically used in an amount such that the pigment-to-binder ratio is between 0.05:1 and 1.5:1, based in each case on the binder content of the coating material composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0116">Since the coatings of the invention produced from the coating materials of the invention also adhere outstandingly to already-cured electrocoat finishes, surfacer finishes, basecoat finishes or customary and known clearcoat finishes, they are outstandingly suitable not only for use in automotive OEM (production-line) finishing but also for automotive refinish and/or for the coating of parts for installation in or on automobiles and/or for the coating of utility vehicles.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0117">The coating material compositions of the invention may be applied by all of the customary application methods, such as spraying, knifecoating, spreading, pouring, dipping, impregnating, trickling or rolling, for example. In the course of such application, the substrate to be coated may itself be at rest, with the application equipment or system being moved. Alternatively, the substrate to be coated, more particularly a coil, may be moved, with the application system being at rest relative to the substrate or being moved appropriately.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0118">Preference is given to employing spray application methods, such as, for example, compressed-air spraying, airless spraying, high-speed rotation, electrostatic spray application (ESTA), alone or in conjunction with hot spray application such as, for example, hot-air spraying.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0119">The applied coating materials of the invention can be cured after a certain rest time. The rest time serves, for example, for the flow and devolatization of the coating films or for the evaporation of volatile constituents such as solvents. The rest time may be assisted and/or shortened by use of elevated temperatures and/or by a reduced atmospheric humidity, provided that this does not entail any damage to or change in the coating films, such as premature complete crosslinking, for instance.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0120">There are no peculiarities of method as far as the thermal curing of the coating materials is concerned; this curing instead takes place in accordance with the customary and known methods such as heating in a forced-air oven or irradiation with IR lamps. Thermal curing here may also take place in stages. Another preferred method of curing is that using near infrared (NIR radiation).</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0121">Thermal curing takes place advantageously at a temperature of 20 to 200Â° C. for a time of 1 minute up to 10 hours, and even longer cure times may be employed at low temperatures. For automotive refinish and for the painting of plastics parts, and also for the finishing of utility vehicles, it is usual to employ relatively low temperatures, which are preferably between 20 and 80Â° C., more particularly between 20 and 60Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0122">The coating material compositions of the invention are outstandingly suitable for use as decorative, protective and/or effect coatings and finishes on bodywork of means of transport (more particularly motor vehicles, such as cycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks or automobiles) or of parts thereof; of the interior and exterior of edifices; of furniture, windows, and doors; of plastics moldings, more particularly CDs and windows; of small industrial parts, of coils, containers, and packaging; of white goods; of films; of optical, electrical, and mechanical components; and also of hollow glassware and articles of everyday use.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0123">Consequently, the coating material compositions of the invention can be applied, for example, to an uncoated or precoated substrate, the coating materials of the invention being either pigmented or unpigmented. The coating material compositions and finishes of the invention, more particularly the clearcoat finishes, are employed more particularly in the technologically and esthetically particularly demanding field of automotive OEM finishing and for the coating of plastics parts for installation in or on automobile bodies, more particularly for top-class automobile bodies, such as, for example, for producing roofs, tailgates, engine cowlings, fenders, bumpers, spoilers, sills, protective strips, side trim, and so on, and also for automotive refinish and for the finishing of utility vehicles, such as, for example, of trucks, chain-driven construction vehicles, such as crane vehicles, wheel loaders, and concrete mixers, buses, rail vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and also agricultural equipment such as tractors and combines, and parts thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0124">The plastics parts are typically composed of ASA, polycarbonates, blends of ASA and polycarbonates, polypropylene, polymethyl methacrylates or impact-modified polymethyl methacrylates, more particularly of blends of ASA and polycarbonates, specifically used with a polycarbonate fraction &gt;40%, more particularly &gt;50%.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0125">ASA refers generally to impact-modified styrene-acrylonitrile polymers wherein graft copolymers of vinylaromatic compounds, more particularly styrene, and of vinyl cyanides, more particularly acrylonitrile, are present on polyalkyl acrylate rubbers in a copolymer matrix of, in particular, styrene and acrylonitrile.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0126">In one or more embodiments, the coating material compositions of the invention are used in multistage coating methods, more particularly in methods which involve applying, to an uncoated or precoated substrate, first a pigmented basecoat film and thereafter a coat with the coating material composition of the invention. The invention accordingly also provides multicoat effect and/or color coating systems comprising at least one pigmented basecoat film and, disposed thereon, at least one clearcoat film, wherein the clearcoat film has been produced from the coating material composition of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0127">Not only water-thinnable basecoats but also basecoats based on organic solvents may be used. Suitable basecoats are described in, for example, EP-A-0 692 007 and the documents cited therein at column 3, lines 50 et seq. Preferably, the applied basecoat is first dried, which means that, in an evaporation phase, at least some of the organic solvent and/or the water is removed from the basecoat film. Drying takes place preferably at temperatures from room temperature to 80Â° C. After drying has taken place, the coating material composition of the invention is applied. The two-coat finish is then preferably baked, under conditions employed in automotive OEM finishing, at temperatures from 20 to 200Â° C. for a time from 1 minute up to 10 hours, and even longer curing times may be employed in the case of the temperatures employed for automotive refinish, which are generally between 20 and 80Â° C., more particularly between 20 and 60Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0128">In another specific embodiment of the invention, the coating material composition of the invention is used as a transparent clearcoat for the coating of plastics substrates, more particularly of plastics parts for installation in or on other articles. These plastics parts are preferably likewise coated in a multistage coating method, which involves applying, to an uncoated or precoated substrate or to a substrate which has been pretreated for improved adhesion of the subsequent coatings (for example, by flaming, corona treatment or plasma treatment of the substrate), first a pigmented basecoat film and thereafter a coat with the coating material composition of the invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0133">An aluminum strip with a thickness of 0.5 mm, a width of 2.5 cm, and a length of 11 cm is bent at an angle of 110Â° to give a surface measuring 2.5Ã2.5 cm. The long side of the metal plate is bent, after a further 2.5 cm, by about 15Â°, so that the plate is just held in balance by a weight (5 g) placed in the center of the square area. For the measurement of the ZTT tack-free state, the bent plate is placed on the coating film and weighed down with a 100 g weight for 30 seconds. Following removal of the weight, the coating is considered tack-free if the metal angle falls over within 5 s. The test is repeated at intervals of 15 minutes. Before the test is deployed, the tackiness of the coating film is assessed qualitatively by touch. In the case of tests at elevated temperature, the test panels are stored at room temperature for 10 minutes for cooling before the test is commenced. Freedom from tack was measured with the Zapon tack test by curing the coating for 30 min at 60Â° C. and beginning the test after storing the panels for 10 minutes at room temperature, and freedom from tack was measured with the Zapon tack test while keeping the coating at room temperature.</p>

      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0134">The coating film is drawn down using a 100 micrometer applicator onto a glass plate. After drying at 60Â° C. for 15 minutes or drying at 60Â° C. for 30 min, the glass plate, within a period of 10 minutes following removal from the oven, is placed on a commercial laboratory balance. Using thumb pressure, the film is then loaded with a weight of 2 kg for 20 seconds. This test is repeated every 10 minutes. In the case of a coating film which is obviously still soft or tacky, the coating film is first left until it has reached a sufficient freedom from tack, and a sufficient hardness. The tests are evaluated after a storage time of 24 hours. For the evaluation, the surface of the coating is washed off with aqueous surfactant solution (commercial washing-up detergent) and a soft cloth, in order to remove grease marks. Measurement is always against a standard. The coating is considered satisfactory if there is no visible thumb imprint on the coating film. This test is a measure of the assembly strength of refinishesâthe earlier that the coating film has attained its assembly strength after forced drying, the earlier that assembly operations (or disassembly operations to remove adhesive masking) may be commenced on the refinished bodywork.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0135">In each case, the time in minutes is given after which the imprint in the print test after drying at 60Â° C. for 15 min or drying at 60Â° C. for 30 min and subsequent storage of the panels for 10 minutes at room temperature is no longer visible.</p>

Inventive examples B3 and B4 and comparative examples C3 and C4 differ from inventive example B2 and from comparative example C2, respectively, in higher amounts of phosphoric acid-based catalyst. The composition of these coating materials of inventive examples 2 to 4 and of comparative examples C2 to C4, and also the test results of the resultant coatings, are set out in Table 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0151">The test results show that amine-blocked phosphoric acid compounds, especially in conjunction with substituted carboxylic acids whose carboxyl group is in conjugation with a Ï-electron system, such as benzoic acid, are able to accelerate not only 2-component PU curing but also the crosslinking via the condensation of the siloxanes. The examples given also show clearly that in particular the time for sufficient assembly strength of the coating film can be shortened significantly through the addition of substituted carboxylic acids whose carboxyl group is in conjugation with Ï-electron system, such as benzoic acid.</p>
