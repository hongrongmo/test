      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a substance delivery carrier targeted to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and a composition for treating renal fibrosis and a method for treating renal fibrosis utilizing the above carrier.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In recent years, due to great changes in lifestyle, mainly with respect to eating habits, the prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes has increased, and accompanying this the risk of renal disease, and consequently renal failure, has been increasing.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The kidney is an important organ for maintaining homeostasis of the internal environment by means of excretion of waste products or regulation of bodily fluids/electrolytes/acid-base balance, etc. The kidney controls the concentrations of various compounds in the blood, such as those of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, and silicon, and excretes waste products in the form of urine. Any deterioration of renal function gives rise to the possibility of interference with the body's ability to sufficiently remove metabolites from the blood and also the possibility of destruction of the body's electrolyte balance. In its most serious form, deterioration or failure of renal function can be fatal.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Furthermore, other than the above-mentioned functions, the kidney has functions such as cell mediated immunity, endocrine secretion, and metabolism. The kidney as an endocrine organ carries out the production of erythropoietin, which regulates the production of red blood cells or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which is an active form of vitamin D3, the secretion of renin and erythropoietin, which are blood pressure regulation factors, and the secretion of kinin, kallikrein, prostaglandin, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Chronic renal failure means a state in which the above renal functions gradually deteriorate irreversibly and homeostasis of a living body cannot be maintained. It is known that chronic renal failure is caused by diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritis, malignant nephrosclerosis, polycystic kidney disease, etc. All of the renal diseases are accompanied by fibrosis of the kidney and eventually lead to terminal renal failure. In particular, since chronic deterioration of renal function depends heavily on the progress of fibrosis of the kidney, it is thought that inhibiting the progress of fibrosis can result in suppression of the progress of chronic renal failure.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In general, renal fibrosis is accompanied by an inflammatory response due to endothelial cell dysfunction, and the extracellular matrix that is eventually produced in excess causes fibrosis. For example, in glomerulosclerosis, due to glomerular endothelial cell dysfunction, a cytokine such as a chemokine or a growth factor is secreted, and monocytes or macrophages migrate so as to make an inflammatory response progress. Subsequently, activation, proliferation, and transformation of mesangial cells occur, an excess amount of extracellular matrix is produced from extracellular matrix-producing cells such as mesangial cells, fibrosis occurs, and this leads to glomerulosclerosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In particular, diabetic nephropathy is the biggest factor leading to chronic renal failure, and one of the complications of diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by hyperplasia and enlargement of the glomerular mesangium, and this is mainly due to an increase in accumulation of an ECM protein such as type I or type IV collagen, fibronectin, or laminin.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Once a serious degree of chronic renal failure occurs, recovery is impossible, and uremia will occur unless a treatment such as dialysis is carried out. As a therapy for chronic renal failure, a diet such as a low-protein diet or a salt-restricted diet, administration of an antihypertensive drug in order to alleviate the burden on the glomerulus, etc. is carried out.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Furthermore, for chronic renal failure, as necessary, a treatment for supplementing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or erythropoietin, which are secreted by the kidney, or a treatment for appropriately maintaining blood pressure regulation, which is an important function of the kidney, is carried out.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">As a chemotherapy, in order to suppress the progress of renal failure, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist is used. It is surmised that they have a renal protective effect per se in addition to suppressing the progress of renal failure by decreasing glomerular blood pressure. However, it is necessary to take care in administration since when the glomerular blood pressure is decreased too much the amount of glomerular blood flow instead decreases and prerenal renal failure occurs.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">As the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, there are captoril, enalapril, delapril, imidapril, quinapril, temocapril, perindopril erbumine, lisinopril, etc., and as the angiotensin II receptor antagonist there are losartan, valsartan, candesartan cilexetil, telmisartan, olmesartan medoxomil, irbesartan, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Other than the above, in order to improve the symptoms of uremia and delay the start of dialysis a little, Kremezin is used as an adsorptive carbon that adsorbs harmful substances in the intestine. Furthermore, in order to prevent breathlessness, numbness in the limbs, arrhythmia, etc. due to an increase in potassium in the blood, calcium polystyrene sulfonate is used as an ion-exchange resin that adsorbs potassium in the intestine and is excreted in the feces.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">When the concentration in serum of creatinine, which is a skeletal muscle-derived metabolite, exceeds 5 to 7 mg/dL, an artificial dialysis therapy such as peritoneal dialysis, hemofiltration, or blood dialysis, or a kidney transplant, can be considered. However, blood dialysis imposes a large burden on a person's life due to having to visit a hospital three times a week and being confined there for 4 to 5 hours per treatment, and with regard to a kidney transplant, since there are few kidney donors, among patients who desire one only a very small number can receive a kidney transplant. Furthermore, the average life expectancy of renal failure patients after starting dialysis is only about half that of the normal population.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In these circumstances, a great deal of research effort has been put into the development of an agent for treating renal fibrosis. As a result, it has been reported that, for example, a medicinal agent acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, an AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist, an aldosterone antagonist, or a renin inhibitor, a medicinal agent acting on the nitric oxide system such as an endothelin receptor antagonist, an Î± blocker, a Î² blocker, an immunosuppressive agent, an extracellular matrix metabolism inhibitor, a complement system inhibitor, a chemokine inhibitor, or a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, and a medicinal agent such as an NFÎºB inhibitor, a Rho inhibitor, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, a PI3KÎ³ inhibitor, a vascular endothelium cell growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, kallikrein, relaxin, an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, bone morphogenetic factor 7 (BMP-7), antitumor necrosis factor Î± antibody (Anti-TNFÎ± antibody), or anti-platelet-derived growth factor D antibody (Anti-PDGF-D antibody) have a certain degree of success with a renal fibrosis model animal or in a clinical trial (Non-Patent Document 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Furthermore, there have been many patent applications and, for example, patents relating to an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (Patent Document 1), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (Patent Document 2), a transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) inhibitor (Patent Document 3), a plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) production inhibitor (Patent Document 4), a prostaglandin receptor 4 selective agonist (Patent Document 5), a type I collagen synthesis inhibitor (Patent Document 6), a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan sulfotransferase inhibitor (Patent Document 7), a vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor (Patent Document 8), a glycation end product formation inhibitor (Patent Document 9), an A2A adenosine receptor 2A agonist (Patent Document 10), an endothelin receptor antagonist (Patent Document 11), a VEGF inhibitor (Patent Document 12), etc. have been applied for as drugs for treating renal fibrosis. However, none of these medicinal agents are satisfactory, and further development of agents for treating renal fibrosis is needed.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0032">It is an object of the present invention to provide a carrier that can specifically deliver a substance such as a drug to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and an agent for treating renal fibrosis and a method for treating renal fibrosis utilizing the carrier.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0033">The inventors have discovered, during an investigation into a novel agent for treating renal fibrosis, that renal fibrosis could be treated effectively by administering a composition in which an extracellular matrix production inhibitor is carried by a carrier that includes a retinoid as a targeting agent, thereby completing the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0034">It is known that a carrier that includes vitamin A can deliver a drug to stellate cells that store vitamin A (Patent Document 13), and that a composition in which siRNA for HSP47 is supported on the above carrier can improve hepatic fibrosis (Patent Document 13), pulmonary fibrosis (Patent Document 14), and myelofibrosis (Patent Document 15), but any relationship to renal fibrosis, renal interstitial tissue, or the mesangium is so far completely unknown.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0035">That is, the present invention relates to the following.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0036">(1) A carrier for delivering a substance to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, the carrier including a retinoid as a targeting agent for extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0037">(2) The carrier according to (1) above, wherein the retinoid includes retinol.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0038">(3) The carrier according to (1) or (2) above, wherein the carrier has the form of a liposome, and the molar ratio of retinoid and lipid contained in the liposome is 8:1 to 1:4.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0039">(4) A pharmaceutical composition for treating renal fibrosis, the composition including the carrier according to any one of (1) to (3) above and a drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0040">(5) The pharmaceutical composition according to (4) above, wherein the drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney is selected from the group consisting of an inhibitor of PAI-1 activity or production, a cell activity inhibitor, a growth inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer, and an RNAi molecule, ribozyme, antisense nucleic acid, or DNA/RNA chimeric polynucleotide that target at least one of the extracellular matrix constituent molecules or molecules involved in the production or secretion of the extracellular matrix constituent molecules or a vector expressing same.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0041">(6) The pharmaceutical composition according to (4) above, wherein the drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells is an HSP47 inhibitor.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0042">(7) The pharmaceutical composition according to any one of (4) to (6) above, wherein the drug and the carrier are mixed at a place of medical treatment or in its vicinity.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0043">(8) A kit for preparing the pharmaceutical composition according to any one of (4) to (7) above, the kit including one or more containers that contain either singly or in combination the drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, the retinoid and, as necessary, a carrier constituent substance other than the retinoid.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0044">(9) A process for producing a carrier for delivering a substance to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, the process including a step of formulating a retinoid as a targeting agent for extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0045">(10) A process for producing a pharmaceutical composition for treating renal fibrosis, the process including a step of formulating a retinoid as a targeting agent for extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and a drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney as an active ingredient.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0046">While the exact mode of action of the composition for treating renal fibrosis of the present invention has not yet been completely clarified, it is believed that the retinoid functions as an agent that targets extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney such as fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, and delivers an active ingredient such as a drug that controls the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney to such cells, thereby exhibiting an effect against renal fibrosis.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0047">Therefore, since an active ingredient can be efficiently delivered to the site of action and, further, to target cells, by using the carrier of the present invention, the treatment, suppression of progression, and prevention of onset of renal fibrosis, etc., in particular diabetic nephritis, the treatment of which has been difficult to date, are made possible, and the present carrier thus contributes significantly to human medicine and veterinary medicine.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0048">Moreover, the carrier of the present invention can be combined with any pharmaceutical agent (for example, an existing therapeutic agent for renal fibrosis) to increase its efficiency of action; it is therefore also advantageous for its broad range of application in terms of formulation, enabling the production of effective therapeutic agents to be facilitated.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0052">In the present invention, the extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney are not particularly limited as long as they are cells present in the kidney having the ability to produce extracellular matrix, and examples thereof present in the kidney include mesangial cells, tubulointerstitial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, which are precursor cells for fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts. The matrix-producing cells present in the kidney can include not only those derived from cells present in the kidney but also those derived from fibrocytes in circulating blood and those transformed from endothelial cells by endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. Myofibroblasts are characterized by the expression of Î±-SMA (alpha-smooth muscle actin). The myofibroblasts in the present invention are ones identified by for example immunostaining using detectably-labeled anti-Î±-SMA antibodies. Furthermore, since fibroblasts express vimentin, which is characteristic of mesenchymal cells, but do not express Î±SMA, they may be identified by double staining of vimentin and Î±SMA, etc. Moreover, the extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney may be obtained by treating renal tissue with collagenase and protease and then carrying out isolation by density-gradient centrifugation (e.g. in NycodenzÂ® having a final concentration of 8%).</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0053">The retinoid of the present invention functions as a targeting agent (targeting agent) to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and promotes the specific delivery of a substance to these cells. The mechanism of the promotion of substance delivery by the retinoid has not yet been completely clarified; however, for example, it is thought that a retinoid that has specifically bound to a retinol-binding protein (RBP) is taken into an extracellular matrix-producing cell in the kidney through a certain receptor present on the surface of said cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0054">A retinoid is a member of a class of compounds having a skeleton in which four isoprenoid units are bonded in a head-to-tail manner (see G. P. Moss, âBiochemical Nomenclature and Related Documentsâ, 2nd Ed. Portland Press, pp. 247-251 (1992)). Vitamin A is a generic descriptor for a retinoid that qualitatively shows the biological activity of retinol. The retinoid that can be used in the present invention is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include retinol (including all-trans-retinol), retinal, retinoic acid (including tretinoin), retinoid derivatives such as an ester of retinol and a fatty acid, an ester of an aliphatic alcohol and retinoic acid, etretinate, isotretinoin, adapalene, acitretine, tazarotene, and retinyl palmitate, and vitamin A analogues such as fenretinide (4-HPR) and bexarotene.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0055">Of these, retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, an ester of retinol and a fatty acid (such as retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate, retinyl stearate, and retinyl laurate) and an ester of an aliphatic alcohol and retinoic acid (such as ethyl retinoate) are preferable from the viewpoint of efficiency of specific delivery of a substance to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0056">All retinoid isomers including cis-trans isomers are included in the scope of the present invention. The retinoid may be substituted with one or more substituents. The retinoid in the present invention includes a retinoid in an isolated form as well as in a form of a solution or mixture with a medium that can dissolve or retain the retinoid.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0057">The carrier of the present invention may be constituted from the retinoid on its own or may be constituted by binding the retinoid to a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid, or by enclosing it therein. Therefore, the carrier of the present invention may include a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid. Such a component is not particularly limited, and any component known in the medicinal and pharmaceutical fields may be used, but those that can enclose the retinoid or can bind to the retinoid are preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0058">Examples of such a component include a lipid, for example, a phospholipid such as glycerophospholipid, a sphingolipid such as sphingomyelin, a sterol such as cholesterol, a vegetable oil such as soybean oil or poppy seed oil, a mineral oil, a lecithin such as egg-yolk lecithin, and a polymer, but the examples are not limited thereto. Among them, those that can form a liposome, for example, a natural phospholipid such as lecithin, a semisynthetic phospholipid such as dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), or distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), cholesterol, etc. are preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0059">A particularly preferred component is a component that can avoid capture by the reticuloendothelial system, examples thereof including cationic lipids such as N-(Î±-trimethylammonioacetyl)-didodecyl-D-glutamate chloride (TMAG), N,Nâ²,Nâ³,Nâ²â³-tetramethyl-N,Nâ²,Nâ³,Nâ²â³-tetrapalmitylspermine (TMTPS), 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate (DOSPA), N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), didodecylammonium bromide (DDAB), 1,2-dioleyloxy-3-trimethylammoniopropane (DOTAP), 3Î²-[Nâ(Nâ²,Nâ²-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol), 1,2-dimyristoyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethylammonium (DMRIE), and O,Oâ²-ditetradecanoyl-N-(Î±-trimethylammonioacetyl)diethanolamine chloride (DC-6-14).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0060">The carrier in the present invention may have a specific three-dimensional structure. Such a structure is not limited, and examples thereof include a straight-chained or branched linear structure, a film-form structure, and a spherical structure. Therefore, the carrier may have, without limitation, any three-dimensional form such as a micelle, a liposome, an emulsion, a microsphere, or a nanosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0061">The binding of the retinoid to the carrier of the present invention or the enclosing of it therein is also made possible by binding the retinoid to or enclosing it in a carrier constituent other than the retinoid by a chemical and/or physical method. Alternatively, the retinoid can be bound to or enclosed in the carrier of the present invention by mixing the retinoid and the carrier constituents other than the retinoid during the preparation of the carrier. The amount of the retinoid in the carrier of the present invention may be for example 0.01 to 1000 nmol/Î¼L, and is preferably 0.1 to 100 nmol/Î¼L. The retinoid may be bound to or enclosed in the carrier before supporting a drug on the carrier; or the carrier, retinoid and drug may be mixed simultaneously; or the retinoid may be admixed with the carrier already supporting the drug, etc. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a process for producing a formulation specific to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, the process including a step of binding a retinoid to any existing drug-binding carrier or drug-encapsulating carrier, for example, a liposomal formulation such as DaunoXomeÂ®, Doxil, CaelyxÂ®, or MyocetÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0062">The carrier of the present invention may be in any form as long as a desired substance or object can be transported to target extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and examples thereof include, but are not limited to, a macromolecular micelle, a liposome, an emulsion, microspheres, and nanospheres. In the present invention, a liposomal form is preferable among these from the viewpoint of high delivery efficiency, wide selection of substances to be delivered, and ease of formulation, etc., and a cationic liposome containing a cationic lipid is particularly preferable. In the case where the carrier is in the form of a liposome, the molar ratio of the retinoid to other constituents of the liposome is preferably 8:1 to 1:4, and more preferably 4:1 to 1:2, from the viewpoint of the efficiency of binding the retinoid to the carrier or enclosing it therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0063">The carrier of the present invention may contain a substance to be transported within its interior, it may be attached to the exterior of a substance to be transported, or it may be mixed with a substance to be transported, as long as it contains a retinoid in a form such that the retinoid is able to function as a targeting agent. âFunction as a targeting agentâ herein means that the carrier that includes a retinoid reaches and/or is taken up by the target cells, i.e., extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, more rapidly and/or in a larger quantity than with a carrier not including the retinoid, and this may easily be confirmed by, for example, adding a labeled carrier or label-containing carrier to a culture of target cells and analyzing the distribution of the label after a predetermined period of time. Structurally, this requirement can be satisfied, for example, if a retinoid is at least partially exposed to the exterior of the formulation containing the carrier at the latest by the time it reaches the target cells. The âformulationâ referred to here is a concept that includes the composition of the present invention, which is described later, and that further has a form. Whether or not the retinoid is exposed at the exterior of a formulation can be evaluated by contacting the formulation with a substance that specifically binds to a retinoid, such as for example a retinol-binding protein (RBP), and examining its binding to the formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0064">Exposing a retinoid at least partially to the exterior of the formulation at the latest by the time it reaches the target cells may be achieved for example by adjusting the compounding ratio of the retinoid and carrier constituent components other than the retinoid. Furthermore, when the carrier has the form of a lipid structure such as a liposome, when for example forming a complex from a retinoid and a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid, a method in which first a lipid structure formed from the carrier constituent component other than the retinoid is diluted in an aqueous solution, and this is then contacted and mixed with the retinoid, etc. may be used. In this case, the retinoid may be in a state in which it is dissolved in a solvent, for example, an organic solvent such as DMSO. The lipid structure referred to here means a structure containing a lipid as a constituent component and having any three-dimensional structure, for example, a shape such as a linear form, a film form, or a spherical form, and examples thereof include, but are not limited to, a liposome, a micelle, a lipid microsphere, a lipid nanosphere, and a lipid emulsion. Application to another drug carrier of the same targeting agent as one used with a liposome in targeting is described in for example Zhao and Lee, Adv Drug Deliv Rev. 2004; 56(8): 1193-204, Temming et al., Drug Resist Updat. 2005; 8(6): 381-402, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0065">The lipid structure may be stabilized by for example adjusting the osmotic pressure by the use of an osmotic pressure-adjusting agent such as a salt, a saccharide such as sucrose, glucose, or maltose, or a polyhydric alcohol such as glycerol or propylene glycol, and preferably sucrose or glucose. Furthermore, the pH may be adjusted by adding an appropriate amount of an adjusting agent such as a salt or a buffer. It is therefore possible to carry out production, storage, etc. of a lipid structure in a medium containing the above substances. In this case, the concentration of the osmotic pressure-adjusting agent is preferably adjusted so as to be isotonic with blood. For example, in the case of sucrose the concentration thereof in a medium is, although not limited to, 3 to 15 wt %, preferably 5 to 12 wt %, more preferably 8 to 10 wt %, and particularly 9 wt %, and in the case of glucose the concentration thereof in a medium is, although not limited to, 1 to 10 wt %, preferably 3 to 8 wt %, more preferably 4 to 6 wt %, and particularly 5 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0066">The present invention also relates to a process for producing a carrier for delivering a substance to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, the process including a step of formulating a retinoid as a targeting agent to extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney. The method of formulating the retinoid is not particularly limited as long as, in the carrier in which it is formulated, the retinoid can function as an agent targeting extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and for example various methods described in the present specification may be used. Therefore, formulation of the retinoid may be carried out by binding the retinoid to or enclosing it in another constituent component of the carrier by a chemical and/or physical method or by mixing the retinoid with another carrier constituent component when preparing the carrier. The amount of retinoid formulated, etc. is as described above with respect to the carrier of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0067">The substance or object that is delivered by the present carrier is not particularly limited, and it preferably has a size such that it can physically move within the body of an organism from the site of administration to the site of a lesion where the target cells are present. Therefore, the carrier of the present invention can transport not only a substance such as an atom, a molecule, a compound, a protein, or a nucleic acid, but also an object such as a vector, a virus particle, a cell, a drug-releasing system that includes one or more elements, or a micromachine. The substance or object preferably has the property of having some effect on the target cells, and examples include those labeling the target cells or controlling (e.g. increasing or suppressing) the activity or growth of the target cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0068">Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention, it is âa drug for controlling the activity or growth of extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidneyâ that is delivered by the carrier. The activity of the extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney herein refers to various activities such as secretion, uptake, or migration exhibited by extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, and in the present invention, in particular, among these, it typically means an activity involved in the onset, progression, and/or recurrence of renal fibrosis. Examples of such activity include, but are not limited to, the production/secretion of a biologically active substance such as PAI-1, and of an extracellular matrix component such as collagen, proteoglycan, tenascin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, osteopontin, osteonectin, or elastin, and the suppression of decomposition activity of these extracellular matrix components.</p>

The method for formulating the retinoid is not particularly limited as long as the retinoid can function as a targeting agent for extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney in the composition in which it is formulated, and for example various methods described in the present specification may be used. Furthermore, the method for formulating the active ingredient is not particularly limited as long as the active ingredient can exhibit a predetermined effect, and any known method may be used. Formulation of the active ingredient may be carried out at the same time as formulation of the retinoid or may be carried out before or after formulating the retinoid. For example, when the composition contains a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid, formulation of the active ingredient may be carried out by mixing the active ingredient with a carrier in which the retinoid has already been formulated as the targeting agent, it may be carried out by mixing the retinoid, a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid, and the active ingredient at the same time, or it may be carried out by formulating the active ingredient with a carrier constituent component other than the retinoid and then mixing this with the retinoid.</p>

Examples of a model animal with renal fibrosis include one described in JP, A, 2009-178143. The amount of active ingredient formulated can vary according to the form of administration of the composition. For example, when a plurality of units of the composition are used in one administration, the amount of active ingredient formulated in one unit of the composition may be one obtained by dividing the amount of active ingredient required for one administration by the number of units. Such adjustment of the amount formulated may be carried out appropriately by a person skilled in the art.</p>

      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0102">The removed kidneys were fixed using a 4% paraformaldehyde-phosphoric acid buffer and embedded in paraffin, and thin section samples were prepared. In order to examine a therapeutic effect on renal fibrosis, Sirius red staining (fiber staining that specifically stains collagen red) was carried out, and an image was taken using a BZ-9000 all-in-one fluorescence microscope (Keyence Corporation) at 80Ã. Analysis was carried out by randomly taking images of 20 fields of view in the renal cortex region, and quantified using analysis software that came with the BZ-9000.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0103">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a representative microscopic image of the glomerulus of the renal cortex region in each treated group. Sirius red staining is collagen-specific fiber staining, and a fibrosis site is stained with red to pink. From the microscopy results, no differences were seen between any of the groups with respect to thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, the degree of fibrosis in the mesangial region (stroma) and the surroundings of tubule cells was slight for the VL-Hsp47C treated group compared with the other three groups, and there was improvement in renal fibrosis (enlargement of mesangial region shown by arrow). Furthermore, 20 fields of view were randomly taken in the renal cortex region per individual mouse, and the proportion of the fibrotic region was calculated. From the results shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in the VL-Hsp47C treated group, the proportion of a Sirius red positive region was significantly lower than in the NT-STAM and Vehicle groups, and there was an improvement in renal fibrosis. Evaluation of statistically significant difference was carried out by use of the t-test.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0104">From the result above, a tendency for the improvement of fibrosis in the VL-Hsp47C treated group was observed. Considering that siRNA basically acts within the cytoplasm, this result suggests that the retinoid functions as an agent targeting extracellular matrix-producing cells in the kidney, efficiently delivers a drug to same cells, and thus can suppress the progress of renal fibrosis.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0107">A mouse (Male C57BL6/J, 20 to 30 g, 6 to 8 weeks old) was anesthetized, the abdominal area was shaved and an incision was made along the midline, and the kidneys were taken out. The kidneys thus taken out were washed with 30 mL of EGTA solution three times, thus removing blood. The kidneys were placed in 5 mL of EGTA solution, and finely cut using scissors. EGTA solution was added to the cut kidneys to make the total volume 30 mL, and centrifugation was carried out at 1300 rpm for 5 minutes. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, 30 mL of 0.02% Collagenase+0.1% Protease solution was added, and the mixture was transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and stirred at 37Â° C. for 20 minutes. The stirred solution was filtered using a Cell Strainer (Falcon 352360), and the filtrate was centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 minutes. The sediment was suspended in Hanks' solution, and 10% NycodenzÂ® solution was mixed with the Hanks' solution so as to give a final concentration of 8% NycodenzÂ®. The solution mixture was centrifuged at 1400Ãg for 20 minutes. The supernatant was collected and further centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, the sample was resuspended in 10% FBS DMEM (Sigma D6546), and seeded on a T-75 flask (BD 353136).</p>

      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0109">As the siRNA, one having the following sequence was used. Sequence name: Hsp47-C</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0000">5â²-GGACAGGCCUGUACAACUA-dTdT-3â²(sense, SEQ ID NO: 1) <br /> 5â²-UAGUUGUACAGGCCUGUCC-dTdT-3â²(antisense, SEQ ID NO: 2) </p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0110">As solutions prior to mixing, 10 mM vitamin A (R7632, retinol, Sigma; hereinafter abbreviated to VA, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide), 1 mM Lipotrust SR (N301, Hokkaido System Science Co., Ltd.; hereinafter also called a liposome or a liposome-constituting lipid, dissolved in nuclease-free water), and 10 mg/mL siRNA (Hsp47-C dissolved in nuclease-free water) were prepared. Subsequently, VA dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the Lipotrust SR dissolved in nuclease-free water prepared above at a ratio of 1:1 (mol:mol), and the mixture was then stirred by means of a vortex for 15 seconds and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes in a light-shielded state, thus forming a complex. This complex was mixed with 10 mg/mL siRNA, thus giving VA Liposome-siRNA Hsp47C. When no VA was used, an equal amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was added instead of VA. Preparation was carried out such that when transfected to cells the final concentration of Lipotrust SR/VA was 7.7 Î¼M and that of siRNA was 869 nM.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0111">As cells for the experiment, the extracellular matrix-producing cells collected from mouse kidneys in the above-mentioned collection method were seeded in advance on a 6 well plate with 0.2Ã10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well and cultured in 10% FBS DMEM at 37Â° C. for 2 days.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0112">After 2 days of culturing, all of the 10% FBS DMEM of each well was removed prior to transfection, 900 Î¼L of fresh 10% FBS DMEM was added, and culturing was carried out at 37Â° C. for about 15 minutes.</p>

After 2 days RNA was isolated from the cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN 74104), and RT-PCR was carried out by means of a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems 4390779), thus giving cDNA. Quantitative PCR was carried out by means of a Power SYBRÂ® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems 4368708) using the cDNA thus obtained, and the effect in gene silencing was examined. The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0114">The above results show that the siRNA for the HSP47 gene used in Example 2 suppresses the expression of the HSP47 gene in extracellular matrix-producing cells of the kidney, suggesting that the siRNA contained in the treatment agent of the present invention is specifically incorporated into the extracellular matrix-producing cells of the kidney and suppresses the expression of the target gene within the cells, thus suppressing the progress of renal fibrosis.</p>
