      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The principles of the present invention relate generally to the field of beverage fermentation. In particular, composition and methods for naturally producing vitamins in beverages, thus improving the nutritional value, are provided by the principles of the present invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Vitamins are essential for normal growth and development and for the healthy maintenance of cells, tissues, and organs. Not surprisingly, vitamin deficiency is correlated with numerous physiological disorders. Dietary supplements are often used to ensure adequate amounts of these essential nutrients are obtained on a daily basis. New and improved formulations of beverages are desirable to meet changing market demands. In particular, there is considerable market demand for beverages having naturally-derived alternative nutritional characteristics, such as, for example, increased vitamin content. Therefore, development of new beverage formulations with satisfactory nutritional characteristics and flavor profiles represents an ongoing challenge for the beverage industry.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In one aspect, the principles of the present invention provide a fermented beverage composition. In one embodiment, the fermented beverage includes increased vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin relative to an unfermented equivalent beverage. In yet another embodiment, no exogenous vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, or biotin is added to the fermented beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In certain embodiments, the fermented beverage includes from about 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI) of vitamins B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin. In some embodiments any combination of the vitamins can be increased by any of the above amounts. At least each of the 4 vitamins is increased a detectable amount when compared to an unfermented counterpart beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In yet another embodiment, the fermented beverage is a fruit juice.

    <detailed-desc>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The principles of the present invention are based at least in part on the surprising discovery that fermenting beverages with vitamin-producing microorganisms can naturally, and significantly, increase the concentration of vitamins. As a result, beverages are greatly enriched with vitamins and exhibit little flavor changes and at least partial maintenance of sweetness and mouth feel. Accordingly, the principles of the present invention provide fermented beverage compositions with at least increased vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin content as compared to an unfermented equivalent beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As used herein, âfermented beverageâ is generally a solution or a dispersion derived from or produced from a solution or dispersion containing a sugar as a substrate to be used by a microorganism. A typical example of such a fermented beverage can be fruit juice. In alternative embodiments, the fermented beverage is selected from grapefruit juice, cherry juice, rhubarb juice, banana juice, passion fruit juice, lychee juice, grape juice, apple juice, orange juice, mango juice, plum juice, prune juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, peach juice, pear juice, apricot juice, blueberry juice, raspberry juice, strawberry juice, blackberry juice, huckleberry juice, boysenberry juice, mulberry juice, gooseberry juice, prairie berry juice, elderberry juice, loganberry juice, dewberry juice, pomegranate juice, papaya juice, lemon juice, lime juice, tangerine juice, passion fruit juice, kiwi juice, persimmon juice, currant juice, quince juice, and guava juice, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As appreciated by one of skill in the art, water is a basic ingredient in the beverages disclosed here, typically being the primary liquid portion in which the remaining ingredients are dissolved, emulsified, suspended or dispersed. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that, for convenience, some ingredients are described herein, in certain cases, by reference to the original form of the ingredient in which it is added to the beverage product formulation. Such original form may differ from the form in which the ingredient is found in the finished beverage product. For example, orange juice is generally made by extraction from the fresh fruit, by desiccation and subsequent reconstitution of dried juice, or by concentration of the juice and the subsequent addition of water to the concentrate. The beverage to be fermented, for instance, can be fresh, can be one containing pulp, or can be one from which pulp has been removed by centrifugation or filtration.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As used herein, a âvitaminâ refers to any of a group of organic compounds that are essential for normal growth and nutrition and are required in limited amounts in the diet. The term âvitaminâ does not include dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, or essential amino acids. As vitamins are classified by their biological activity and not their structure, each âvitaminâ is a generic descriptor and refers to a number of compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitamin. The generic descriptor âvitamin B12â includes, for example, the compounds cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, adenosylcobalamin, or methylcobalamin. The generic descriptor âvitamin Kâ includes 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives such as, for example, phylloquinone or menaquinones. The generic descriptor âfolateâ (also known as vitamin B9) includes a large number of folic acid derivatives that differ by their state of oxidation such as, for example, pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, pteroyl-L-glutamate, or pteroylmonoglutamic acid. As used herein, âbiotinâ (CAS Registry No. 58-85-5; also known as vitamin H, bioepiderm, and coenzyme R) refers to the generic descriptor vitamin B7, and is composed of a tetrahydroimidizalone ring fused with a tetrahydrothiophene ring.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">As used herein, âincreased vitaminsâ refers to a beverage having an augmentation in vitamins as compared to the same volume of the standard version, e.g. unfermented version, for instance the starting material prior to fermentation according to the methods. In some embodiments, the fermented beverage includes from about 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI) of vitamins. The vitamins can be increased by similar or different amounts relative to each other. At least each of the 4 vitamins is increased a detectable amount when compared to an unfermented counterpart beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In an embodiment, vitamin B12 is increased 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI), vitamin K is increased 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI), folate is increased 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI), and biotin is increased 1-fold, about 2-fold, about 3-fold, about 4-fold, about 5-fold, about 6-fold, about 7-fold, about 8-fold, about 9-fold, about 10-fold, about 15-fold, or to about 20-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI), or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As used herein, âunfermented equivalent beverageâ is a version of a beverage or a beverage that has not undergone the fermentation process in accordance with the principles of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As used herein, ârecommended daily intakeâ (RDI) refers to the daily intake level of a nutrient considered sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council to meet the requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group in the United States.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As used herein, âfermentationâ is the breakdown of organic substances by microorganisms to produce simpler organic compounds. While fermentation generally occurs under predominantly anaerobic conditions, it is not intended that the term be limited to strict anaerobic conditions, as fermentation also occurs in the presence of oxygen.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">âExogenousâ with reference to a vitamin refers to a vitamin that is added to a composition. A vitamin can be individually, selectively, and/or artificially supplemented to the composition. âEndogenousâ with reference to a vitamin refers to a vitamin that occurs naturally in a food or beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As used herein, a ânon-nutritive sweetenerâ is one that does not provide significant caloric content in typical usage amounts, i.e. is one which imparts less than 5 calories per 8 ounce serving of beverage to achieve the sweetness equivalent of 10 Brix of sugar. In various embodiments, the fermented beverage composition further includes a non-nutritive sweetener selected from Stevia rebaudiana extract, stevioside, aspartame, saccharine, and sucralose. In one embodiment the fermented beverage composition includes the non-nutritive sweetener rebaudioside A (Reb A).</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As used herein, a ânutritive sweetenerâ is one that can provide significant caloric content in typical usage amounts, i.e. is one which imparts greater than 5 calories per 8 ounce serving of beverage to achieve the sweetness equivalent of 10 Brix of sugar. In various embodiments, the fermented beverage composition further includes a nutritive sweetener selected from sucrose, fructose, glucose, and high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As used herein, degrees Brix (Â° Bx) is the sugar content of an aqueous solution. One degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as percentage by weight (% w/w).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">It should be understood that beverages and other beverage products can have any of numerous different specific formulations or constitutions. In general, a beverage typically comprises at least water, acidulant, and flavoring. The beverage products in accordance with the principles of the present invention include beverages, i.e. ready to drink formulations, beverage concentrates, and the like. Juices suitable for use in at least embodiments include, for example, fruit, vegetable, and berry juices. In beverages employing juice, juice may be used, for example, at a level from about 0.2%, about 0.5%, about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, to about 80% by weight of the beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Accordingly, the principles of the present invention provide a fermented beverage having at least increased vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin as compared to an unfermented equivalent beverage. Beverages, of which the taste profiles may be modified by the addition of sweeteners, can be provided. Various beverages, such as fruit juices, contain a limited number of vitamins and thus make it a less preferred choice amongst consumers looking to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">To prepare a fermented beverage composition of the present invention standard fermentation methods can be used. Examples of beverage fermentation can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,210,720, U.S. Pat. No. 4,544,633, U.S. Pat. No. 4,867,992; U.S. Pat. No. 7,427,397, U.S. Publication No. 20050180963, U.S. Publication No. 20090269438; EP 0089720, EP 0166238, EP 1625794, EP 1625795, International Publication No. WO2004001022, and International Publication No. WO2012/036575, each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. Since propagation of the fermenting microorganism can utilize aerobic conditions, sufficient oxygen can be made available to the microorganisms in the propagation vessel(s). Stirring and/or recirculation may suitably be employed to continuously introduce air or oxygen in the fermenting beverage formulation. Fermenting microorganisms can also be grown under anaerobic conditions whereby oxygen is depleted from the growth environment using known methodologies such as, for example, sparging with nitrogen gas. As such, the principles of the present invention provide a method of producing a fermented beverage comprising incubating a beverage with a microorganism, such as a bacterium, capable of producing vitamins to produce a fermented beverage having at least increased vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin as compared to an unfermented equivalent beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">At least one microorganism capable of producing vitamins can be used. Enrichment with single vitamins produced by fermentation is known in the art. However, to address the problem of using multiple organisms and multiple fermentation steps, the principles of the present invention make use of vitamin-producing microorganisms for naturally increasing the vitamin content in beverages, of at least four vitamins, by a single fermentation step with a single microorganism.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">There are many known vitamin-producing microorganisms that find use in accordance with the principles of the present invention, most of which are bacteria, such as, but not limited to, <i>Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, </i>and <i>Lactococcus. </i>In one embodiment, the vitamin producing organism is <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii. </i>In one embodiment the strain is <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii </i>CH15460 or mutants thereof. The strain was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen under accession no. DSM 26457.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the present context, the term âmutantâ should be understood as a strain derived, or a strain which can be derived from a strain of the invention (or the mother strain) by means of e.g. genetic engineering, radiation and/or chemical treatment. The mutant can also be a spontaneously occurring mutant. It is preferred that the mutant is a functionally equivalent mutant, e.g. a mutant that has substantially the same, or improved properties (e.g., regarding production of vitamins, such as B12, vitamin K, folate and biotin) as the mother strain. Such a mutant is a part of the present invention. Especially, the term âmutantâ refers to a spontaneously occurring mutant or to a strain obtained by subjecting a strain of the invention to any conventionally used mutagenization treatment including treatment with a chemical mutagen, such as ethane methane sulphonate (EMS) or N-methyl-Nâ²-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (NTG), or UV light. A mutant may have been subjected to several mutagenization treatments (a single treatment should be understood as one mutagenization step followed by a screening/selection step), but it is presently preferred that no more than 20, or no more than 10, or no more than 5, treatments (or screening/selection steps) are carried out. In a presently preferred mutant less than 1%, less than 0.1%, less than 0.01%, less than 0.001% or even less than 0.0001% of the nucleotides in the bacterial genome have been replaced with another nucleotide, or deleted, compared to the mother strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As is conventional in the art, fermentation is achieved when microorganisms, such as, but not limited to, the bacterium <i>P. freudenreichii </i>are added to a medium (e.g., an unfermented beverage such as fruit juice), whereby the microorganisms convert carbon sources to alcohols and other molecules. The production of vitamin B12 and folate in culture, as described herein, have been studied under aerobic conditions as, for example, discussed in Hugenschmidt et al. and Sybesma et al., respectively, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Bacteria capable of producing vitamins typically grow and ferment in a pH range of about 3.0 to 7.0. The fermentation can be allowed to proceed spontaneously, or can be started by inoculation with a culture that has been previously fermented, in which case the unfermented beverage may be inoculated with populations of bacteria as is known in the art and may include, for instance, about 10<sup>6 </sup>to about 10<sup>7 </sup>cfu/ml juice. Incubation can proceed with aeration to facilitate growth of the bacterial population. The temperature of fermentation is usually from 20Â° C. to 40Â° C., and the duration of the fermentation process may for example extend from a few hours to greater than 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or more days to a few weeks.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Thus, following fermentation, the principles of the present invention provide fermented beverage compositions with increased vitamin content of at least vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin, which provides for a nutritionally improved beverage while maintaining sweetness. For example, fruit juices having a vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, and biotin content of greater than 1-fold the recommended daily intake (RDI) can be provided. In alternative embodiments, principles of the present invention can be used to produce fermented beverages having naturally enriched concentrations of at least vitamin B12, vitamin K, folate, biotin, and in some embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or more additional vitamins. In some embodiments, principles of the present invention can be used to provide increased vitamin content in carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks, fountain beverages, frozen ready-to-drink beverages, coffee beverages, tea beverages, dairy beverages, powdered soft drinks, as well as liquid concentrates, flavored waters, enhanced waters, fruit juice and fruit juice-flavored drinks, sports drinks, and alcoholic products. As appreciated by one of skill in the art, any of these beverages can be the starting material to be fermented according to the methods herein, or are beverages to which fermented beverages can be added.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In one embodiment, the fermented beverage composition is a âraw fermented beverage.â As used herein, ârawâ means not processed or purified. Natural embodiments of the beverage products disclosed herein are natural in that they do not contain anything artificial or synthetic. Therefore, as used herein, ânaturalâ beverage composition is defined in accordance with the following guidelines: Raw materials for a natural ingredient exists or originates in nature. Biological synthesis involving fermentation and enzymes can be employed, but synthesis with chemical reagents is not utilized. Artificial colors, preservatives, and flavors are not considered natural ingredients.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Following fermentation one or more post-fermentation processing steps can be used such as pasteurization, filtration, centrifugation, or homogenization. For example, several pasteurization methods are commonly used (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,830,862 and 4,925,686, incorporated herein by reference). One common method passes juice through a tube next to a plate heat exchanger, so the juice is heated without direct contact with the heating surface. Another method uses hot, pasteurized juice to preheat incoming unpasteurized juice. The preheated juice is further heated with steam or hot water to the pasteurization temperature. Typically, reaching a temperature of 185 to 201.2Â° F. (85-94Â° C.) for about 30 seconds is adequate to reduce the microbe count and prepare the juice for filling individual containers. Alternatively, typically at least about 20% of the microorganisms present in the fermented beverage are removed using one or more separators. Examples of separators that may be employed to remove the microorganism-containing residue from the fermented beverage include sedimenters, decanters, centrifuges, hydrocyclones, sieves, filters, membranes and presses. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method includes a post-processing step of removing the microorganism capable of producing vitamins. In some embodiments, the microorganisms can be removed from the fermentation reaction during fermentation, while in other embodiments, the microorganisms are removed following the completion of fermentation.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Ingredients can be processed or purified through certain specified techniques including at least: physical processes, fermentation, and enzymolysis. Appropriate processes and purification techniques include at least: absorption, adsorption, agglomeration, centrifugation, chopping, cooking (baking, flying, boiling, roasting), cooling, cutting, chromatography, coating, crystallization, digestion, drying (spray, freeze drying, vacuum), evaporation, distillation, electrophoresis, emulsification, encapsulation, extraction, extrusion, filtration, fermentation, grinding, infusion, maceration, microbiological (rennet, enzymes), mixing, peeling, percolation, refrigeration/freezing, squeezing, steeping, washing, heating, mixing, ion exchange, lyophilization, osmose, precipitation, salting out, sublimation, ultrasonic treatment, concentration, flocculation, homogenization, reconstitution, enzymolysis (using enzymes found in nature). Processing aids (currently defined as substances used as manufacturing aids to enhance the appeal or utility of a food component, including clarifying agents, catalysts, flocculants, filter aids, and crystallization inhibitors, etc. (see 21 CFR Â§170.3(o)(24)) are incidental additives and can be used if removed appropriately.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Non-nutritive sweeteners, also called artificial sweeteners, or high-intensity sweeteners, are agents that exhibit a sweetness many times that of sucrose. Examples of high-intensity sweeteners include saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame, monatin, alitame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, thaumatin, stevioside, glycerrhizin, sucralose, and neotame. Therefore, beverages such as fruit juice, sports drinks, and soft drinks, are sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners that may not occur naturally in the source ingredients for the beverage and thus are generally regarded as undesirable by many consumers. By contrast, nutritive sweeteners generally refer to naturally occurring substances. Examples of nutritive sweeteners include glucose, fructose, maltose, galactose, maltodextrin, trehalose, fructo-oligosaccharides, and trioses. Due to the prevalence and popularity of non-nutritive sweeteners in beverages, several processes have been described for modifying the taste profile of beverages that contain these non-nutritive sweeteners.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As used herein, âadditiveâ means food additive, or a substance added to food to preserve flavor or enhance its taste and appearance. In some embodiments, the fermented beverage composition further includes an additive selected from salts, food-grade acids, coloring agents, preservatives, ascorbic acid, energy-boosting agents, and vitamins. Further, it will generally be an option to add other ingredients to the formulation of a particular beverage embodiment, including flavorings, electrolytes, tastents, masking agents, flavor enhancers, carbonation, or caffeine.</p>

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The culture used for the vitamin-enrichment fermentations was <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii </i>CH15460. This strain was selected from eight other Propionibacterium obtained from the Chr Hansen culture collection. The strain was deposited with the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen and Zellkulturen under accession no. DSM 26457. Mutants of the strain also find use in the methods disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Juice Fermentations</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Initial fruit juice fermentations were performed by inoculating fruit juice with either 1% or 10% (v/v) of a <i>Propionibacterium freudenreichii </i>culture grown on rich cultivation medium (MRS medium) as is known in the art. This culture was first centrifuged and resuspended in the respective juice to avoid take-over of the rich medium to the juice fermentation. Juice fermentations were incubated at 30Â° C. for 5-8 days and samples were collected regularly for analysis of vitamins. These samples were heated for 10 min at 80Â° C. to stop further growth of <i>Propionibacterium </i>and stored at 4Â° C. before analysis. All fruit juices were commercially available 100% pasteurized juice.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Analysis of Vitamins</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Vitamin B12, folate and biotin content was routinely measured using specific microbiological assays by the commercial laboratory of SGS Institut Fresenius in Berlin, Germany. Vitamin K2 content was analyzed by GC-MS.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Vitamin B12 production by fermentation with <i>P. freudenreichii </i>(strains CHCC15460 and strain PA) was assessed in orange juice (Table 1). At 5-8 days post-inoculation with a starter culture of bacteria, fermented orange juice samples were analyzed for vitamin content, pH, and flavor profile. Samples were cultured either aerobically or anaerobically. Aerobic cultures were either sparged with supplemental oxygen or were aerated under ambient conditions by shaking low-volume culture. Anaerobic cultures were either sparged with nitrogen gas or grown in full flasks with no shaking. Post-fermentation samples showed a significant increase in vitamin B12 content with little to no change in flavor and pH. Further, samples grown aerobically did not show significantly increased vitamin production.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Example 3</heading>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Vitamin B12 production by fermentation with <i>P. freudenreichii </i>(strains CHCC15460 and strain PA) was assessed in banana juice (Table 2). At 5-8 days post-inoculation with either a normal (1% v/v) or a heavy (10% v/v) volume of a starter culture of bacteria, fermented banana juice samples were analyzed for vitamin content, pH, and flavor profile. Samples were cultured either aerobically or anaerobically. Aerobic cultures were either sparged with supplemental oxygen or were aerated under ambient conditions by shaking low-volume culture. Anaerobic cultures were either sparged with nitrogen gas or grown in full flasks with no shaking. Strain CHCC15460 produced significantly more vitamin B12 than strain PA and caused little to no change in flavor or pH. Strain CHCC15460 showed a variable response to fermentation with or without oxygen and a 2- to 5-fold increase in vitamin B12 production when a heavy inoculum of starter culture was used for sample fermentation. By contrast, strain PA produced lower amounts of vitamin B12 overall and caused a slight decrease in pH. Further, strain PA showed a significant increase in vitamin B12 production when fermentation samples were cultured aerobically. However, unlike strain CHCC15460, samples fermented with a heavy inoculum of strain PA starter culture showed a undesired change in flavor profile.</p>

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Vitamin B12 production by fermentation with <i>P. freudenreichii </i>(strains CHCC15460 and strain PA) was assessed in tomato juice (Table 3). At 5-8 days post-inoculation with a starter culture of bacteria, fermented tomato juice samples were analyzed for vitamin content, pH, and flavor profile. Samples were cultured either aerobically or anaerobically. Aerobic cultures were either sparged with supplemental oxygen or were aerated under ambient conditions by shaking low-volume culture. Anaerobic cultures were either sparged with nitrogen gas or grown in full flasks with no shaking. Strain CHCC15460 produced significantly more vitamin B 12 than strain PA and caused little to no change in flavor and only a slight increase in pH. By contrast, strain PA produced significantly lower amounts of vitamin B12 overall and caused a slight decrease in pH. Further, while strain CHCC15460 produced more vitamin B12 when fermentation samples were cultured with oxygen, strain PA produced less vitamin B 12 under the same conditions. Finally, samples fermented with strain PA developed a sweet, pleasant flavor.</p>

      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Vitamin production by fermentation with <i>P. freudenreichii </i>(strain CHCC15460) was assessed in various fruit juices (Table 4). At 5-8 days post-inoculation with a starter culture of bacteria, fermented fruit juice samples were analyzed for vitamin content and pH. Duplicate samples of orange, banana, and tomato juice (where indicated) were cultured in a SARTORIUSÂ® fermentor. All samples showed significant levels of vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin K2, and biotin, where calculated. In addition, all samples showed either no change, or a slight increase, in pH.</p>

At 3, 5, and 6 days post-inoculation with a starter culture of bacteria, fermented fruit juice samples were analyzed for vitamin content. All samples showed a significant increase in vitamin B12 content after just 3 days post-inoculation. Both juices showed little to no change in vitamin B12 content at later time points. While mango juice samples showed no change in vitamin B6 content after fermentation, significant increases in vitamin K, folate, and biotin were detected. By contrast, orange juice showed no change in vitamin K levels following fermentation.</p>
