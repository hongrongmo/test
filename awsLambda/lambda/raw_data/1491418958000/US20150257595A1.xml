    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Cooking on barbeque grills over an open flame or smoldering charcoals is a popular method for preparing foods. Apparatus for such forms of cooking typically include a wire grate or metallic platform with a plurality of spaced-apart parallel bars or ridges upon which food is supported over the flame or charcoals. Other cooking apparatus, such as griddles, ovens and cooktops may employ similar cooking surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In order to prevent food from sticking to the grate during cooking and to clean the grate of residues from previous cooking sessions, the grate may be seasoned by applying a coating of one or more cooking oils. The oils may be applied by wiping the grate with a cloth or rag that is at least partially saturated with the oil. The wiping motion removes residues on the grate and applies the fresh coating of oil thereon. Application of the oil to the grate is often completed with the grate positioned over the heat source and after the grate has been at least partially preheated by the heat source. As such, the user risks burns and exposure to high heat emanating from the heat source when attempting to season the grate.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There is thus a need for a device that can apply one or more oils to a grill grate or cooking surface without exposing a user to burns. A device with interchangeable applicator pads and a self-contained oil reservoir would also be beneficial.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Embodiments of the invention are defined by the claims below, not this summary. A high-level overview of various aspects of the invention are provided here for that reason, to provide an overview of the disclosure, and to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described in the Detailed-Description section below. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. In brief, this disclosure describes, among other things, a grill-oiling apparatus for applying one or more oils or fluids to a cooking surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The grill oiling apparatus includes a handle having a reservoir for retaining one or more cooking oils therein. The handle is coupled to an elongate angled arm having a passageway extending therethrough and in fluid communication with the reservoir. An attachment flange is provided at a distal end of the arm and includes an applicator pad removeably coupled thereto. The passageway in the arm extends into fluid communication with the applicator pad to provide the oils thereto. A fluid distribution plate is positioned at a distal end of the passageway to evenly distribute the oils across the applicator pad. The handle includes a trigger or valve mechanism to selectively enable the oil in the reservoir to flow into the passageway and to the applicator pad. A heat shield or guard may be disposed beneath the handle and positioned between a user's hand grasping the handle and a heat source during application of the oil to the cooking surface. The applicator pad may be removed for washing and may be discarded or replaced by a clean applicator pad when soiled.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The subject matter of select embodiments of the invention is described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. But the description itself is not intended to necessarily limit the scope of claims. Rather, the claimed subject matter might be embodied in other ways to include different components, steps, or combinations thereof similar to the ones described in this document, in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Terms should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">With reference now to <figref>FIGS. 1-7</figref>, a grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> is described in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> is described herein with respect to preparation of a barbecue grill for cooking having a grate formed from wires or rods arranged in a spaced apart configuration and disposed over a heat source, such as smoldering charcoal briquettes or an open gas flame. However, such is not intended to limit embodiments of the invention to any particular use. It is to be understood that a variety of barbecue grill cooking surfaces as well as other forms of cooking surfaces that may benefit from application of cooking oils or greases are known in the art. Embodiments of the invention are useable and configurable for use with such other cooking surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> is described with respect to application of cooking oils. Such description is not intended to limit the apparatus <b>10</b> to a particular material or fluid to be applied thereby. For example, the grill oiling apparatus <b>10</b> can be employed for application of oils, greases, butters, or other cooking products or combinations thereof and can be used to apply non-cooking products, such as cleaners, abrasives, degreasing chemicals, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> includes a handle <b>12</b>, an arm <b>14</b> extending therefrom, and an attachment flange <b>16</b> disposed at a distal end of the arm <b>14</b>. The handle <b>12</b>, arm <b>14</b>, and attachment flange <b>16</b> may be formed as a single integrated component or may be assembled from one or more subcomponents. The handle <b>12</b> comprises a generally cylindrical body that is sized and configured for grasping by a hand of a user. Features, such as ribs, nubs, ridges, contours, and/or texturized areas may be provided on or formed on an exterior surface of the handle <b>12</b> to aid a user in gripping the handle <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A reservoir <b>20</b> for holding a cooking oil, cleaning fluid, or other liquid is formed by an interior surface of the handle <b>12</b>. The reservoir <b>20</b> might also be a separate component that is disposed in the handle <b>12</b> or formed integral with the interior of the handle <b>12</b>. The reservoir <b>20</b> is open at each end of the handle <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">A proximate end of the handle <b>12</b> is provided with a closure <b>22</b>, such as a threaded or snap-fit lid that seals and retains the cooking oil within the proximate end of the reservoir <b>20</b>. The closure <b>22</b> may be removable to enable filling of the reservoir <b>20</b> with oil. An opposite or distal end of the handle <b>12</b> couples to the arm <b>14</b> via, for example, a threaded coupling; other forms of couplings like snap-fit, friction-fit, bayonette-style, or the like can also be employed. The opposite end of the reservoir <b>20</b> is thus placed in fluid communication with a passageway <b>24</b> carried by the arm <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The arm <b>14</b> extends from the handle <b>12</b> a distance suitable to provide a desired separation distance between the handle <b>12</b> and a heat source during use of the grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> to apply oil to a cooking surface. In an embodiment, the arm <b>14</b> is approximately eighteen inches in length, but any desired length can be employed. The arm <b>14</b> is directed at a downward angle, e.g. approximately 45Â°, with respect to the handle <b>12</b>. The downward angle of the arm <b>14</b> may provide the handle <b>12</b> at a comfortable orientation for gripping by the user during use and may provide a sufficient vertical separation of the handle <b>12</b> and a user's hand from the heat source during use of the apparatus <b>10</b>. The arm <b>14</b> may be generally linear, or the arm <b>14</b> may be at least partially curvilinear or formed from a plurality of linear or curvilinear sections. In another embodiment, the arm <b>14</b> and the handle <b>12</b> are aligned to extend linearly. The arm <b>14</b> has sufficient strength to resist substantial bending when a force is applied between the handle <b>12</b> and the attachment flange <b>16</b>, such as when a user presses the attachment flange <b>16</b> onto a grill grate to apply oils thereon and/or to scrub the grill grate.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The arm <b>14</b> carries the passageway <b>24</b> interior to the arm <b>14</b>. As depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the passageway <b>24</b> is formed by an interior wall of the arm <b>14</b> but in some embodiments may comprise a tube or hose disposed within the arm <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the passageway <b>24</b> might be disposed exterior to the arm <b>14</b>, such as in a tube or hose extending alongside the arm <b>14</b>. The passageway <b>24</b> is configured to carry the oil from the reservoir <b>20</b> to the attachment flange <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A valve <b>26</b> is provided between the reservoir <b>20</b> and the passageway <b>24</b> to selectively restrict flow of the oil from the reservoir <b>20</b> to the passageway <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the valve <b>26</b> may be positioned along the length of the passageway <b>24</b>. The valve <b>26</b> is any form of valve or means for obstructing the flow of oil through the passageway <b>24</b>. As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the valve <b>26</b> comprises a two-way duckbill-style valve that allows oil to flow into the passageway <b>24</b> from the reservoir <b>20</b> when the reservoir is pressurized and allows air to flow from the passageway <b>24</b> into the reservoir <b>20</b> when the pressurization of the reservoir <b>20</b> is relieved. An endwall <b>40</b> of the reservoir <b>20</b> includes an aperture in which the valve <b>26</b> is disposed and a plurality of through-holes <b>42</b> surrounding the aperture. The valve <b>26</b> includes a wedge-shaped nipple <b>44</b> extending into the reservoir <b>20</b>. A central bore <b>43</b> extends through and is closed off at its terminal end by the nipple <b>44</b> within the reservoir <b>20</b> but is open to the passageway <b>24</b> at an opposite end. The valve <b>26</b> also includes a flange <b>46</b> positioned within the passageway <b>24</b> and that extends radially outward into overlapping relationship with the through-holes <b>42</b> in the endwall <b>40</b>. The valve <b>26</b> thus prevents oil from moving from the reservoir <b>20</b> into the passageway <b>24</b>; the nipple <b>44</b> closes off the central bore <b>43</b> and the flange <b>46</b> closes off the through-holes <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a trigger or a depressible button <b>28</b> is provided to enable a user to expel oil from the reservoir <b>20</b> through the valve <b>26</b>. The button <b>28</b> comprises a resilient or elastic member that can be depressed toward the interior of the reservoir <b>20</b> to increase the pressure within the reservoir <b>20</b>. When pressure within the reservoir <b>20</b> is increased, the flange <b>46</b> may be flexed away from the endwall <b>40</b> thereby opening the through-holes <b>42</b> to allow passage of oil therethrough. The pressurization may also seal or further seal the nipple <b>44</b> against passage of the oil through the central bore <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">When released, the button <b>28</b> returns to a normal position and thereby relieves pressure in the reservoir <b>20</b> and/or creates an at least partial negative pressure within the reservoir <b>20</b>. Upon relieving the pressure in the reservoir <b>20</b> the flange <b>46</b> returns to its normal position against the endwall <b>40</b> and closes off the through-holes <b>42</b>. Relieving the pressure and/or creating a negative pressure may also draw air through the central bore <b>43</b>; the nipple <b>44</b> opens, e.g. opposite sides thereof flex away from one another, to enable passage of the air through the central bore <b>43</b> and into the reservoir <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In other embodiments, the valve <b>26</b> may comprise, for example, a ball valve, stop-cock, needle valve, or the like. Or the valve <b>26</b> may be a compression valve that compresses the passageway <b>24</b> to block flow therethrough. In another embodiment, the valve <b>26</b> includes an actuator, such as a rotatable lever, knob, or trigger that is useable to open and close the valve <b>26</b> to allow oil to flow through the passageway <b>24</b>, such as by gravity or capillary action and/or to expel oil from the reservoir <b>20</b> under pressure.</p>

The applicator pad <b>36</b> may be configured as a disposable item that can be discarded when soiled and replaced with a new clean pad <b>36</b>. Or the applicator pad <b>36</b> may be washable to allow washing and reuse of the pad <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The applicator pad <b>36</b> includes a pair of wings <b>62</b> extending from opposite edges thereof that are configured to couple to the studs <b>34</b> on the attachment flange <b>16</b>. For example, the applicator pad <b>36</b> may be placed against a bottom surface of the attachment flange <b>16</b> and the wings <b>62</b> wrapped at least partially around the edges of the flange <b>16</b> and into engagement with the studs <b>34</b>. The wings <b>62</b> include coupling features, such as apertures <b>64</b> into which the studs <b>34</b> may be inserted. The studs <b>34</b> may include an enlarged head or other feature configured to resist disengagement of the studs <b>34</b> with the apertures <b>64</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The wings <b>62</b> extend from opposite edges of the applicator pad <b>36</b> and are preferably positioned substantially midway between a first and a second working surface <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> of the pad <b>36</b> or near the center of the pad <b>36</b> thickness. The wings <b>62</b> are pivotable about their connection with the applicator pad <b>36</b> to extend generally perpendicularly to the body or working surfaces <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> of the applicator pad <b>36</b>. The wings <b>62</b> may thus extend alongside respective longitudinal edges of the attachment flange <b>16</b> and wrap therearound to engage the studs <b>34</b>. The wings <b>62</b> may be pivoted toward either working surface <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> to enable selective use of both working surfaces <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> by flipping the applicator pad <b>36</b> over and pivoting the wings <b>62</b> in the opposite direction. The applicator pad <b>36</b> may be configured with differing materials on the opposing working surfaces <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> such that the pad <b>36</b> may be used for different purposes based on which working surface <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> is positioned to face away from the attachment flange <b>16</b>, e.g. the first working surface <b>66</b> may include scrubbing or cleaning materials while the opposite second working surface <b>68</b> may include a softer material for applying oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In operation, the grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> is useable to apply a layer of cooking oil to a grill grate or similar cooking surface. The cooking surface can be preheated or the oil can be applied prior to heating. The reservoir <b>20</b> is at least partially filled with the oil to be applied to the grill grate and the closure <b>22</b> coupled to the handle <b>12</b>. The applicator pad <b>36</b> is coupled to the attachment flange <b>16</b> by placing the second working surface <b>68</b> against the support surface <b>52</b> of the distribution plate <b>50</b>; pivoting the wings <b>62</b> toward the attachment flange <b>16</b>; and engaging the apertures <b>64</b> in the wings <b>62</b> with the studs <b>34</b>. The handle <b>12</b> is grasped by a user and the button <b>28</b> is depressed and released one or more times to expel oil from the reservoir <b>20</b>, through the valve <b>26</b>, and into the passageway <b>24</b>. The oil flows down the passageway <b>24</b> by gravity.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Upon reaching the distal end of the passageway <b>24</b>, the oil flows into and collects in the depression <b>58</b> in the distribution plate <b>50</b>. The oil may overfill the depression and thus overflow therefrom to run along the top surface <b>56</b> of the distribution plate <b>50</b> to the outlet holes <b>60</b>. Or the oil in the depression <b>58</b> may be jostled from the depression and onto the top surface <b>56</b> of the distribution plate <b>50</b> by movements of the grill-oiling apparatus <b>10</b> in a back-and-forth motion along a grill grate. The oil flows through the outlet holes <b>60</b> and into the applicator pad <b>36</b>, which becomes at least partially saturated.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Oil flowing along the top surface of the distribution plate <b>50</b> that passes between the outlet holes <b>60</b> is retained against flowing outward from between the applicator pad <b>36</b> and the attachment flange <b>16</b>. Oil flowing longitudinally along the top surface <b>56</b> and between the outlet holes <b>60</b> contacts the wings <b>62</b> which direct the oil toward and/or into longitudinal edges of the applicator pad <b>36</b>. Oil flowing laterally along the top surface <b>56</b> and between the outlet holes <b>60</b> collects in the troughs <b>61</b>, which extend in the longitudinal direction adjacent the lateral edges of the distribution plate <b>50</b>. The troughs <b>61</b> direct the oil into one or more outlet holes <b>60</b> that are intersected by the trough <b>61</b> or into contact with the wings <b>62</b> which intersect the terminal ends of the troughs <b>61</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The user places the working surface <b>66</b> of the applicator pad <b>36</b> into contact with the grill grate and moves the pad <b>36</b> along the grill grate. Gravity and/or pressure applied on the applicator pad <b>36</b> and against the grill grate causes at least a portion of the oil to be expelled from the pad <b>36</b> and onto the grill grate to at least partially coat the grate. In some embodiments, the user may also scrub the applicator pad <b>36</b> against the grill grate to apply the oil thereto and/or to remove residues and debris from the grill grate, such as debris left behind from previous uses of the grill.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The applicator pad <b>36</b> may be removed from the attachment flange <b>16</b> when soiled. The soiled pad <b>36</b> may be washed or replaced with a new applicator pad <b>36</b>. Or the applicator pad <b>36</b> may be flipped over to expose the second working surface <b>68</b> and reattached to the attachment flange <b>16</b> for further use. In one embodiment, a variety of applicator pads <b>36</b> are provided. For example, a first abrasive applicator pad <b>36</b> may be used to clean the grill grate. The first pad <b>36</b> can then be removed and replaced with a second softer applicator pad <b>36</b> for application of the oil to the grill grate. In another embodiment, the first working surface <b>66</b> of the applicator pad <b>36</b> is comprised of materials configured to aid cleaning of the grill grate and the second working surface <b>68</b> is comprised of materials that may be more suitable for applying oil to the grill grate. The applicator pad <b>36</b> may thus be installed with the first working surface <b>66</b> exposed for cleaning the grill grate and then removed and flipped over to expose the second working surface <b>68</b> for oiling the grill grate.</p>
