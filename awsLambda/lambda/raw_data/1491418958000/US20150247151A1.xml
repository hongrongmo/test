      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to cells and nucleic acids and also use thereof for producing rhamnolipids, and also methods for producing rhamnolipids.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Surfactants are nowadays produced essentially based on the basis of petrochemical raw materials. The use of surfactants based on renewable raw materials is a suitable alternative on account of the foreseeable shortage of petrochemical raw materials and increasing demand for products that are based on renewable raw materials or are biodegradable.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Rhamnolipids consist of one (monorhamnosyl lipids) or two rhamnose radicals (dirhamnosyl lipids) and one or two 3-hydroxy fatty acid residues (see <i>Handbook of Hydrocarbon and Lipid Microbiology</i>, 2010, pages 3037-51). They have surface-active properties, which are needed in all sorts of applications for use as a surfactant (see Leitermann et al., 2009).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">These lipids are nowadays produced using wild-type isolates of different human- and animal-pathogenic bacteria, in particular representatives of the genera <i>Pseudomonas </i>and <i>Burkholderia </i>(see <i>Handbook of Hydrocarbon and Lipid Microbiology</i>, 2010, pages 3037-51). The fact that these production organisms are able to cause diseases reduces the customer acceptance for the conventionally produced rhamnolipids very considerably. Moreover, higher safety requirements also have an effect on the production costs owing to increased capital expenditure and possibly additional working-up steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Although to some extent high product titers, and also space-time and/or carbon yields can be achieved with the aid of these production organisms, this requires the use of vegetable oils as the sole or co-substrate (see <i>Handbook of Hydrocarbon and Lipid Microbiology</i>, 2010, pages 3037-51). Vegetable oils, however, are comparatively expensive raw materials in comparison to other carbon sources, such as, for example, glucose, sucrose or polysaccharides such as, for example, starch, cellulose and hemicellulose, glycerol, CO, CO<sub>2 </sub>or CH<sub>4</sub>. Moreover, rhamnolipids distinguish themselves on account of their surfactant character in that they are susceptible to heavy foaming in fermentation processes. This is in particular the case if lipophilic substrates are employed. This problem is markedly reduced on use of water-soluble substrates such as, for example, glucose, sucrose, polysaccharides (starch, cellulose, hemicellulose) or glycerol. Finally, the properties of the rhamnolipids produced by the wild-type isolates can only be influenced to a restricted extent. Up to now, this takes place exclusively via the optimization of the process management (pH, oxygen supply, media composition, feeding strategies, nitrogen supply, temperature, choice of substrate, etc.). However, a very specific influence of certain product properties, such as, for example, the ratio of the various rhamnolipid species (number of rhamnose and 3-hydroxy fatty acid radicals) or chain length and degree of saturation of the 3-hydroxy fatty acid radicals would be desirable to be able to modulate the product properties relevant for the application.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Rhamnolipids, if they are to be employed in a large extent as surfactants in household, cleaning, cosmetic, food processing, pharmaceutical, plant protection and other applications, must appear to be in competition with the surfactants employed nowadays. These are high volume chemicals, which can be produced at very low costs, without obvious health risks for the customer and with clearly defined and modulatable product specifications. Therefore rhamnolipids must also be able to be produced at costs as low as possible, without health risks for the customer and with defined properties as far as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Although rhamnolipids have already been produced in GRAS organisms (generally regarded as save) based on convenient carbon sources, such as, for example, glucose or glycerol, these are in this case exclusively monorhamnosyl lipids (Ochsner et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995. 61(9):3503-3506).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Cha et al. in Bioresour Technol. 2008. 99(7):2192-9, on the other hand, describe the production of monorhamnosyl lipids from soybean oil in <i>P. putida </i>by introduction of the genes rhIA and rhIB from <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">There is therefore an increasing need for the inexpensive and, from the health point of view, safe production of mono- and dirhamnosyl lipids having defined and modulatable properties. This modulation can be carried out, for example, by means of a balanced supply of the individual enzyme activities, which reduces the enrichment of monorhamnosyl lipids. This modulation, however, can also be carried out, for example, by the use of enzymes having certain properties, e.g. with respect to substrate specificity and thus, for example, the chain length of the hydroxy fatty acids incorporated in rhamnolipids.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention therefore has the object of providing a possibility of producing rhamnolipids from readily accessible carbon sources using safe production hosts.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Surprisingly, it has been found that the cells and methods described below, in which these cells are employed, make a contribution to solving the stated object of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention therefore relates to cells, which are able to form rhamnolipids and compared to their wild-type have at least one increased activity of a gene product of homologs of the gene products rhIA, rhIB and rhIC.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The invention further relates to a method for producing rhamnolipids using the aforementioned cells as a biocatalyst and simple carbon sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">It is an advantage of the present invention that organisms can be employed that are non-pathogenic and simple to culture.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0020">âWild-typeâ of a cell herein designates a cell, the genome of which is present in a state as is formed naturally by evolution. The term is used both for the entire cell as well as for individual genes. The term âwild-typeâ therefore in particular does not include those cells or those genes, the gene sequences of which have been modified at least partially by man by means of recombinant methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0021">The term ârhamnolipidâ is understood in connection with the present invention as meaning a compound of the general formula (I) or its salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0022">It is obvious that the activities actually indicated above for the enzymes E<sub>1a </sub>to E<sub>3b </sub>is only a special exemplary choice of a broader activity spectrum of the aforementioned enzymes; the respective activity mentioned is that for which a reliable measuring method is available in the case of a given enzyme. Thus it is obvious that an enzyme which a substrate having an unbranched, saturated C<sub>10</sub>-alkyl radical likewiseâeven though optionally with decreased activityâwill convert those substrates that contain a C<sub>6</sub>- or C<sub>16</sub>-alkyl radical, which can optionally also be branched or unsaturated.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0023">The term âincreased activity of an enzymeâ is preferably to be understood as meaning increased intracellular activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0024">The embodiments now following for increasing the enzyme activity in cells apply both for the increase in the activity of the enzyme E<sub>1 </sub>to E<sub>3 </sub>as well as for all subsequently mentioned enzymes, the activity of which can optionally be increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0025">In principle, an increase in the enzymatic activity can be achieved by increasing the copy number of the gene sequence or the gene sequences which code for the enzyme, using a strong promoter or an improved ribosome binding site, attenuating a negative regulation of gene expression, for example by transcription regulators, or amplifying a positive regulation of gene expression, modifying the codon usage of the gene, in various ways increasing the half-life of the mRNA or of the enzyme, modifying the regulation of the expression of the gene or utilizing a gene or allele that codes for an appropriate enzyme having an increased activity and optionally combining these measures. According to the invention, genetically modified cells are produced, for example, by transformation, transduction, conjugation or a combination of these methods using a vector that contains the desired gene, an allele of this gene or parts thereof and optionally contains a promoter making possible the expression of the gene. Heterologous expression is in particular achieved by integration of the gene or the alleles in the chromosome of the cell or an extrachromosomally replicating vector.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0026">DE-A-100 31 999 gives a general survey of the possibilities for increasing the enzyme activity in cells as exemplified by pyruvate carboxylase, which is inserted hereby as a reference and whose disclosure content with respect to the possibilities for increasing the enzyme activity in cells forms a part of the disclosure of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0027">The expression of the above and all subsequently mentioned enzymes or genes is detectable with the aid of 1- and 2-dimensional protein gel separation and subsequent optical identification of the protein concentration in the gel using appropriate analytical software. If the increase in an enzyme activity is based exclusively on an increase in the expression of the corresponding gene, the quantification of the increase in the enzyme activity can be determined in a simple manner by a comparison of the 1- or 2-dimensional protein separations between wild-type and genetically modified cell. A customary method for the preparation of the protein gels in the case of <i>coryneforme </i>bacteria and for the identification of the proteins is the procedure described by Hermann et al. (Electrophoresis, 22: 1712.23 (2001)). The protein concentration can likewise be analyzed by Western Blot hybridization using an antibody specific for the protein to be detected (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. USA, 1989) and subsequent optical analysis using appropriate software for the concentration determination (Lohaus and Meyer (1989) Biospektrum, 5: 32-39; Lottspeich (1999) Angewandte Chemie 111: 2630-2647). The activity of DNA-binding proteins can be measured by means of DNA band shift assays (also called gel retardation) (Wilson et al. (2001) Journal of Bacteriology, 183: 2151-2155). The action of DNA-binding proteins on the expression of other genes can be detected by various well-described methods of the reporter gene assay (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. USA, 1989). The intracellular enzymatic activities can be determined according to various described methods (Donahue et al. (2000) Journal of Bacteriology 182 (19): 5624-5627; Ray et al. (2000) Journal of Bacteriology 182 (8): 2277-2284; Freedberg et al. (1973) Journal of Bacteriology 115 (3): 816-823). If in the following embodiments no practical methods are indicated for the determination of the activity of a certain enzyme, the determination of the increase in the enzyme activity and also the determination of the decrease of an enzyme activity preferably take place by means of the methods described in Hermann et al., Electophoresis, 22: 1712-23 (2001), Lohaus et al., Biospektrum 5 32-39 (1998), Lottspeich, Angewandte Chemie 111: 2630-2647 (1999) and Wilson et al., Journal of Bacteriology 183: 2151-2155 (2001).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0028">If the increase in the enzyme activity is accomplished by mutation of the endogenous gene, such mutations can be randomly produced either by conventional methods, such as, for example, by UV irradiation or by mutagenic chemicals, or selectively by means of genetic engineering methods such as deletion(s), insertion(s) and/or nucleotide exchange(s). Modified cells are obtained by these mutations. Particularly preferred mutants of enzymes are in particular also those enzymes that are no longer feedback-, product- or substrate-inhibitable or are so to a reduced degree at least in comparison to the wild-type enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0029">If the increase in the enzyme activity is accomplished by increase in the synthesis of an enzyme, the copy number of the corresponding genes is increased or the promoter and regulation region or the ribosome binding site, which is situated upstream of the structural gene, is mutated. Expression cassettes, which are incorporated upstream of the structural gene, act in the same manner. It is additionally possible, by means of inducible promoters, to increase the expression at any desired point in time. In addition, however, also âenhancersâ can be assigned to the enzyme gene as regulatory sequences, which likewise bring about increased gene expression by means of an improved interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA. As a result of measures for the prolongation of the lifetime of the mRNA, the expression is likewise improved. Furthermore, by prevention of the degradation of the enzyme protein the enzyme activity is likewise increased. The genes or gene constructs are present here either in plasmids having a different copy number or are integrated and amplified in the chromosome.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0030">Alternatively, an overexpression of the genes concerned can furthermore be achieved by modification of the media composition and culture management. The person skilled in the art finds directions for this, inter alia, in Martin et al. (Bio/Technology 5, 137-146 (1987)), in Guerrero et al. (Genes 138, 35-41 (1994)), Tsuchiya and Morinaga (Bio/Technology 6, 428-430 (1988)), in Eikmanns et al. (Genes 102, 93-98 (1991)), in EP-A-0 472 869, in U.S. Pat.

The measures described above likewise lead, like the mutations, to genetically modified cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0031">Episomal plasmids, for example, are employed for increasing the expression of the respective genes. Suitable plasmids or vectors are in principle all embodiments available for this purpose to the person skilled in the art. Such plasmids and vectors can be taken, for example, from the brochures of the companies Novagen, Promega, New England Biolabs, Clontech or Gibco BRL.

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0032">The plasmid vector, which contains the gene to be amplified, is then converted to the desired strain by conjugation or transformation. The method of conjugation is described, for example, in SchÃ¤fer et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60: 756-759 (1994). Methods for transformation are described, for example, in Thierbach et al., Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 29: 356-362 (1988), Dunican and Shivnan, Bio/Technology 7: 1067-1070 (1989) and Tauch et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters 123: 343-347 (1994). After homologous recombination by means of a âcross-overâ event, the resulting strain contains at least two copies of the gene concerned.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0033">Under the formulation used above and in the following embodiments âan activity of an enzyme E<sub>x </sub>increased in comparison to its wild-typeâ is preferably always to be understood as meaning an activity of the respective enzyme E<sub>x </sub>increased by a factor of at least 2, particularly preferably of at least 10, moreover preferably of at least 100, moreover still more preferably of at least 1,000 and most preferably of at least 10,000. Furthermore the cell according to the invention, which has âan increased activity of an enzyme E<sub>x </sub>compared to its wild-typeâ, in particular also comprises a cell, whose wild-type contains no or at least no detectable activity of this enzyme E<sub>x </sub>and which shows a detectable activity of this enzyme E<sub>x </sub>only after increasing the enzyme activity, for example by overexpression. In this connection, the term âoverexpressionâ or the formulation used in the following embodiments âincreasing the expressionâ also comprises the case where a starting cell, for example a wild-type cell, has no or at least no detectable expression and a detectable synthesis of the enzyme E<sub>x </sub>is induced only by recombinant methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0034">Changes of amino acid radicals of a given polypeptide sequence, which lead to no significant changes in the properties and function of the given polypeptide, are known to the person skilled in the art. Thus, for example, âconserved amino acidsâ can be mutually exchanged; examples of such suitable amino acid substitutions are: Ala for Ser; Arg for Lys; Asn for Gln or His; Asp for Glu; Cys for Ser; Gln for Asn; Glu for Asp; Gly for Pro; His for Asn or Gln; Ile for Leu or Val; Leu for Met or Val; Lys for Arg or Gln or Glu; Met for Leu or Ile; Phe for Met or Leu or Tyr; Ser for Thr; Thr for Ser; Trp for Tyr; Tyr for Trp or Phe; Val for Ile or Leu. It is likewise known that changes, particularly at the N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide, in the form of, for example, amino acid insertions or deletions often exert no significant influence on the function of the polypeptide.</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0124">For the investigation of the rhamnolipid production in the shaker flask a preculture was first prepared. For this, an inoculation loop of a strain freshly streaked on an LB agar plate was used and 10 ml of LB medium was inoculated into a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask. All recombinant <i>P. putida </i>strains were in the LB medium, to which 50 Î¼g/ml of kanamycin was added. The culturing of the strains took place overnight at 30Â° C. and 200 rpm.</p>

For this, the synthetic operon rhIAB-pa1131-rhIC (Seq ID No. 50) was synthesized by the company GeneArt AG (Regensburg) and intercloned in the commercial vector pMA (GeneArt AG). The basis for the synthesis was the already known genomic sequence of the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>DSM1707. Starting from the vector pMA::ABMC the synthetic operon was cleaved by means of BglII and XbaI from the vector and subsequently ligated into the expression vector pBBR1MCS-2 (Seq ID No. 49) cleaved with BamHI and XbaI (Kovach et al., 1995: Four new derivatives of the broad-host-range cloning vector pBBR1MCS carrying different antibiotic-resistance cassettes. Gene, 166:175-176). The resulting plasmid pBBR1MCS-2::ABMC (Seq ID No. 51) is 9663 base pairs in size. The ligation and the transformation of chemically competent <i>E. coli </i>DH5Î± cells (Gibco-BRL, Karlsruhe) took place in a manner known to the person skilled in the art.

This shows that the heterologous expression of rhIABC of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>DSM1707 leads to the formation of mono- and dirhamnosyl lipids in E. coll.

For this, the synthetic operon BTH_II1077, BT_II1080 and BT_II1081 (Seq ID No. 70) is synthesized by the company DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, Calif., USA) and intercloned in the commercial vector pJ294 (DNA 2.0; Menlo Park, Calif., USA). The basis for the synthesis is the genomic sequence of the strain <i>B. thailandensis </i>E264. Starting from the vector pJ294-BTH_II1077-II1080-II1081, the synthetic operon is cleaved from this vector by means of XbaI and subsequently ligated into the vector pBBR1MCS-2::ABC (Seq ID No. 40) likewise cleaved using XbaI. The target vector pBBR1MCS-2::ABC-BTH_II1077-II1080-II1081 (Seq ID No. 69) obtained has a size of 13768 base pairs. The insert of the vector is sequenced.

      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0169">For the production of the rhamnolipids, the medium designated in the following as M9 medium is used. This medium consists of 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.3% (w/v) KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.679% Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.05% (w/v) NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 0.049% (w/v) MgSO<sub>4</sub>Ã7 H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.1% (v/v) of a trace element solution. This consists of 1.78% (w/v) FeSO<sub>4</sub>Ã7 H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.191% (w/v) MnCl<sub>2</sub>Ã7 H<sub>2</sub>O, 3.65% (w/v) HCl, 0.187% (w/v) ZnSO<sub>4</sub>Ã7 H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.084% (v/v) Na EDTAÃ2 H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.03% (v/v) H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 0.025% (w/v) Na<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>Ã2 H<sub>2</sub>O and 0.47% (w/v) CaCl<sub>2</sub>Ã2 H<sub>2</sub>O. The pH of the medium is adjusted to 7.4 using NH<sub>4</sub>OH and the medium is subsequently sterilized by means of an autoclave (121Â° C., 20 min). An adjustment of the pH during the culturing is not necessary. For the investigation of the rhamnolipid production in the shaker flask, a preculture is first prepared. For this, an inoculation loop of a strain freshly streaked on LB agar plate is used and 10 ml of LB medium are inoculated into a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask. All recombinant <i>P. putida </i>strains are cultured in LB medium, to which 50 Î¼g/ml of kanamycin was added. The culturing of the <i>P. putida </i>strains takes place at 37Â° C. and 200 rpm overnight.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0170">The precultures are used to inoculate 50 ml of M9 medium (+50 Î¼g/ml of kanamycin) in the 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask (start OD<sub>600 </sub>0,1). The cultures are cultured at 200 rpm and 30Â° C. At intervals of 24 h, a sample of 1 ml of broth is removed from the culture flask. The sample preparation for the following chromatographic analyses and the chromatographic analyses themselves are carried out as described in Example 4.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0171">It is shown that the recombinant strains <i>P. putida </i>KT2440 pBBR1MCS-2::AB-BTH_II1077-II1080-II1081 and <i>P. putida </i>GPp104 pBBR1MCS-2::AB-BTH_II1077-II1080-II1081 form significantly more monorhamnosyl lipids than the strains <i>P. putida </i>KT2440 pBBR1MCS-2::AB and <i>P. putida </i>GPp104 pBBR1MCS-2::AB. This demonstrates that the amplification of BTH_II1077-II1080-II1081 from <i>B. thailandensis </i>E264 increases the formation of monorhamnosyl lipids in <i>P. putida </i>strains containing the <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>DSM1707 genes rhIAB.</p>
