      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized as soluble or membrane-integrated glycoproteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In mammalian cells mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) mediate the transport of the majority of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. Mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) terminal residues are recognized in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by two MPRs which mediate the sorting of lysosomal enzymes from the secretory pathway and deliver them to a prelysosomal compartment from where the receptors return to the TGN and the ligands are forwarded to dense lysosomes (reviewed in (Kornfeld, 1992; Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Ludwig et al., 1995)). The physiological importance of the MPR-dependent transport of lysosomal enzymes is illustrated by I-cell disease (ICD). In this disorder, the deficiency of the phosphotransferase responsible for catalyzing the addition of Man-6-P results in the synthesis of lysosomal enzymes that lack Man-6-P residues leading to a failure to bind to MPRs and a strongly increased secretion of most of the lysosomal enzymes (Neufeld, 1991). Although fibroblasts of these patients have a marked deficiency of lysosomal enzymes, liver, spleen, kidney and brain tissues have nearly normal levels of lysosomal hydrolases (Kornfeld, 1986; Kornfeld and Sly, 1985). It was therefore proposed that in addition to MPR-dependent mechanisms, MPR-independent mechanisms are likely to exist for the transport of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes (Ahn et al., 2002; Ginsel and Fransen, 1991; Glickman and Kornfeld, 1993; Rijnboutt et al., 1991; Tanaka et al., 2000). Also in MPR-deficient mice an ICD-like phenotype with increase of lysosomal enzymes in serum and normal activities in some tissues has been described (Dittmer et al., 1999).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In fibroblasts of ICD patients the lysosomal hydrolase Î²-glucocerebrosidase (Î²GC) has been shown to be intracellularly retained suggesting that signals other than Man-6-P are responsible for targeting this enzyme (Aerts et al., 1988; van Dongen et al., 1985). Mutations within the gene coding for human Î²GC are the cause of the most common lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher Disease, in which the defective enzyme leads to an accumulation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (Beutler, 1991, 2006). Although the clinical course of this disease has been well described and an efficient treatment option, enzyme replacement therapy, is available little is known about how GlcCer accumulation in lysosomes leads to cellular pathology. Also the mechanism by which Î²GC is targeted from its site of synthesis in the ER to lysosomes is not well understood.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Thus, a greater understanding of the mechanism by which Î²-GC is targeted from its site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes could lead to improved methods of treating lysosomal storage disorders such as Gaucher Disease.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Î²-glucocerebrosidase, the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease, is targeted to the lysosome independently of a mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The invention is based, in part, on the identification of a protein that interacts with Î²-glucocerebrosidase, which has elucidated the targeting pathway of Î²-glucocerebrosidase. Affinity chromatography experiments revealed that the lysosomal integral membrane protein LIMP-2 is a specific binding partner of Î²-glucocerebrosidase and that this interaction involves a coiled coil domain within the lumenal domain. Î²-glucocerebrosidase activity and protein levels were severely decreased in LIMP-2 knockout mouse tissues. Analysis of fibroblasts and macrophages isolated from these mice indicated that a majority of Î²-glucocerebrosidase was secreted or partially retained in the ER. Missorting of Î²-glucocerebrosidase was also evident in vivo since protein and activity levels were significantly higher in sera from LIMP-2-deficient mice compared to wild type. Reconstitution of LIMP-2 in LIMP-2-deficient fibroblasts led to a rescue of Î²-glucocerebrosidase levels and distribution. LIMP-2 expression also led to lysosomal transport of a Î²-glucocerebrosidase endoplasmic reticulum retention mutant. These data support a role for LIMP-2 as the mannose 6-phosphate-independent trafficking receptor for Î²-glucocerebrosidase.</p>

(<figref>FIG. 6A</figref>) Î²GC sorting in the presence of LIMP-2 and absence of MPRs. The preferential binding of Î²GC to LIMP-2 (binding complex highlighted in inset) at more neutral pH suggests these two proteins could associate in secretory compartments as early as the ER or Golgi apparatus from where they would then progress to distal, more acidic prelysosomal compartments (LE, late endosome) and eventually, to dense lysosomes (LYSO). At the lower pH of these late compartments Î²GC may dissociate from LIMP-2. Yellow arrows: LIMP-2 pathway. M6P-receptor pathway (white arrows) shown for comparison. Î²GC trafficking was unaffected by the absence of MPRs unlike other lysosomal enzymes which are consequently missorted. (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>) Î²GC missorted in the absence of LIMP-2. In contrast to the scenario seen when MPRs are absent or in I-cell disease in which a population of lysosomal enzymes other than Î²GC is mis-targeted, when LIMP-2 was absent Î²GC was mis-targeted. It is possible that the absence of LIMP-2 may also result in the destabilization and subsequent degradation of a percentage of the missorted Î²GC.</p>

(E) In an additional experiment LIMP-2 deficient MEF cells were either left untransfected, transfected with GC alone or transfected with Î²GC and LIMP-2 in different ratios. To determine the level of Î²GC remaining in the ER under each condition, a portion of each cell extract was incubated in the presence (+) or absence (â) of Endoglycosidase H (EndoH). In the upper panel it is revealed that when Î²GC is expressed alone almost all the protein is EndoH sensitive and therefore likely to reside in the ER. Transfection of Î²GC/LIMP-2 in a 1:1 ratio leads to a significant increase in Î²GC expression but also to an almost exclusive post-ER (lysosome) EndoH resistant form of Î²GC. Increasing the amount of LIMP-2 three fold did not further increase the Î²GC level or the Î²GC post-ER form. LIMP-2 expression is shown in the middle panel and a loading control is presented in the lower panel.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">As described herein, using pull-down experiments with purified Î²-GC the lysosomal integral membrane protein type-II (LIMP-2) has been identified as a specific binding partner for Î²-GC. In vitro and in vivo evidence showed that LIMP-2 acted as a receptor to bind Î²-GC, and that the Î²-GC-LIMP-2 complex was transported to the lysosomal compartment in an MPR-independent pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Specifically, fractionation of tissue homogenates by affinity chromatography and subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified LIMP-2 as a specific binding partner of Î²-GC. Biochemical characterization of the LIMP-2/Î²-GC interaction revealed the region in LIMP-2 involved in this association. Analysis and comparison of Î²-GC enzyme activity in tissues from wild type (WT) and LIMP-2 knockout mice indicated that that activity of the endogenous Î²-GC was decreased in the knockout mice and that this change directly correlated with a decrease in Î²-GC protein levels detected by immunoblot. Immunocytochemical staining of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from LIMP-2 knockout mice corroborated the data. It was found that although significantly less Î²-GC was detected in knockout versus WT tissue homogenates, Î²-GC protein levels were much higher in the sera from LIMP-2 knockout mice compared to WT, and Î²-GC activity levels in these samples were increased over WT indicating that Î²-GC was missorted from cells in the absence of LIMP-2. Introduction of WT LIMP-2 into LIMP-2 knockout MEFs resulted in the rescue of Î²-GC protein levels and the normal localization of Î²-GC in these cells. Since endogenous Î²-GC trafficks independently of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor the data showed a role for LIMP-2 as a mannose-6-phosphate independent trafficking receptor for Î²-GC.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The findings described herein, particularly those relating to the missorting of Î²-GC in the absence of LIMP-2, provide for methods of producing a polypeptide or a variant thereof, wherein the polypeptide or variant thereof is dependent on LIMP-2 for trafficking, localization, stabilization and/or sorting of the polypeptide in the cell. In general, the methods comprise culturing a lysosomal integral membrane protein II (LIMP-2) deficient cell which expresses the polypeptide or the variant thereof under conditions in which the polypeptide or the variant thereof is produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">As shown herein, expression of the polypeptide in a LIMP-2 deficient cell altered the localization (missorts) the polypeptide compared to the localization of the same polypeptide that was expressed in a normal or wild type cell. For example, the polypeptide can be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of the LIMP-2 deficient cell and/or secreted from the LIMP-2 deficient cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Therefore, in a particular embodiment, the invention provides methods of producing a polypeptide or variant thereof for secretion (a secreted polypeptide or a variant thereof), wherein the polypeptide or variant thereof is dependent on LIMP-2 for trafficking, localization, stabilization and/or sorting of the polypeptide in the cell. The method comprises culturing a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal (e.g., a LIMP-2 knockout animal) which expresses the polypeptide under conditions in which the polypeptide is secreted from the cell, or from the cells of the animal into the sera. Thus, in this embodiment, the method can be performed in vitro wherein the secreted protein can be obtained from the supernatant of a cell, or in vivo wherein the secreted protein can be obtained from the sera of a LIMP-2 deficient animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The method can be used for the production of any polypeptide (protein), referred to as a LIMP-2 ligand or LIMP-2 binding partner, that is dependent on LIMP-2 for trafficking, localization, stabilization, sorting or a combination thereof in a cell. The polypeptide can bind to all or a portion (e.g., a domain such as the lumenal domain) of LIMP-2. In another embodiment, the protein is Î²-glucocerebrosidase (Î²GC, Î²-GC, GC, acid Î²-glucocerebrosidase, acid Î²-glucosidase, glucosylceramidase, Î²-D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.45) or a variant thereof. Î²-GC is used to treat Gaucher Disease. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to a method of producing Î²-GC or a variant thereof, comprising culturing a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal (e.g., a LIMP-2 knockout animal) which expresses Î²-GC or the variant thereof under conditions in which Î²-GC or the variant thereof is produced, thereby producing Î²-GC or the variant thereof. In a particular embodiment, the method comprises culturing a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal which expresses Î²-GC under conditions in which the Î²-GC is secreted from the cell. In another embodiment, the method further comprises purifying the Î²-GC secreted from the cell (e.g. from the supernatant of the cell) or animal (e.g., from the sera of the animal).</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">A variant of Î²-GC includes a protein having an amino acid sequence that is at least 90% identical to an amino acid sequence of Î²-GC (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 11). In one embodiment, the variant of Î²-GC is imiglucerase (the active ingredient in CerezymeÂ®, Genzyme Corporation, Cambridge, Mass.). Imiglucerase is an oligosaccharide-modified human Î²-glucocerebrosidase made using recombinant cells and is used to treat patients with Gaucher disease, a rare and devastating genetic disorder caused by a deficiency or malfunction of the Î²-glucocerebrosidase (see, e.g., Furbish et al., Biochim.

It has been recently shown that over-expression of LIMP-2 caused an enlargement of early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes and an impairment of endocytotic membrane traffic out of the enlarged compartments (Kuronita, T., et al., <i>J Cell Sci </i>115, 4117-4131 (2002); Kuronita, T., et al., <i>Traffic </i>6, 895-906 (2005)). A deficiency of LIMP-2 in mice caused ureteric pelvic junction obstruction, deafness and peripheral neuropathy (Gamp, A., et al., <i>Hum Mol Genet </i>12, 631-646 (2003)) associated with an impaired vesicular trafficking and distribution of apically expressed proteins (Knipper, M., et al., <i>J Physiol </i>576, 73-86 (2006)).</p>

As described herein, the isolation and characterization of the hamster LIMP-2 nucleotide and amino acid sequences have now been provided. Thus, the invention is also directed to a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of hamster LIMP-2 (SEQ ID NO: 1).

Thus, the invention includes methods of producing hamster LIMP-2 comprising culturing a host cell comprising an isolated hamster LIMP-2 nucleic acid described herein under conditions in which the hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide is produced. The method can further comprise isolating the hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide from the cell. The present invention also relates to an isolated hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide produced by the method.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The availability of the hamster LIMP-2 nucleotide and amino acid sequences provides for methods of identifying an agent that alters (e g., inhibits, enhances) interaction of a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide with a LIMP-2 binding partner (e.g., Î²-GC). In one embodiment, the agent inhibits (e.g., partially, completely) the interaction of a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide with a binding partner. In another embodiment, the agent enhances the interaction of a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide with a binding partner. Such method can comprise, for example, contacting a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 2 with Î²-GC under conditions in which the hamster LIMP-2 interacts with the Î²-GC, with an agent to be assessed. The extent to which the hamster LIMP-2 interacts with the Î²-GC in the presence of the agent to be assessed is determined, wherein if the extent to which hamster LIMP-2 interacts with Î²-GC is altered in the presence of the agent compared to the extent to which hamster LIMP-2 interacts with Î²-GC in the absence of the agent, then the agent alters interaction of a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide with Î²-GC. Alternatively, the method can comprise contacting a host cell which comprises isolated nucleic acid that encodes a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide having an amino acid sequence comprising SEQ ID NO: 2 wherein the LIMP-2 polypeptide, when expressed, interacts with Î²-GC in the cell, with an agent to be assessed. The secretion of Î²-GC from the host cell can then be assessed, wherein an altered secretion of Î²-GC from the host cell compared to secretion of Î²-GC from a control cell indicates that the agent alters interaction of a hamster LIMP-2 polypeptide with Î²-GC.</p>

      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">As used herein a âLIMP-2 deficient cellâ or âLIMP-2 deficient animalâ includes a cell or animal in which the expression and/or function (activity) of LIMP-2 is completely or partially downregulated (blocked, inhibited, disrupted). Functions of LIMP-2 include the ability of LIMP-2 to associate with one or more of its ligands, such as Î²-GC. Whether LIMP-2 expression and/or function in a cell is deficient can be determined using a variety of techniques described herein and known in the art such as enzyme activity assays, gel electrophoresis, immunochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (e.g., detect mRNA levels) and mass spectrometry. The results can also be compared to the results obtained from a suitable control, e.g., a wild type cell of the same, or from a different species, as the LIMP-2 deficient cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Examples of methods for obtaining or producing a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal are described herein and are known in the art. For example, a LIMP-2 deficient cell can be obtained from a LIMP-2 deficient animal (Gamp, A., et al., <i>Hum Mol Genet </i>12, 631-646 (2003)). In addition, a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal can be produced by introducing one or more targeted mutations specific for LIMP-2 into a cell, or into the cells of an animal to produce a LIMP-2 knockout animal (Gamp, A., et al., <i>Hum Mol Genet </i>12, 631-646 (2003)). In one embodiment, the mutated LIMP-2 polypeptide comprises a motif that alters localization of LIMP-2. An examples of such a motif is an endoplasmic reticulum retention motif.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Alternatively, a dominant negative mutant can be introduced into a cell or animal to render the cell or animal LIMP-2 deficient. For example, a LIMP-2 mutant protein that competitively binds to a ligand of LIMP-2 (e.g., Î²-GC) can be introduced into a cell. The LIMP-2 mutant protein can have enhanced binding properties such that the LIMP-2 ligand(s) preferentially binds to the LIMP-2 mutant protein rather than to the wild type LIMP-2 present in the cell. In another embodiment, a LIMP-2 fragment (a LIMP-2 peptide) comprising, or consisting essentially of, a region of LIMP-2 that competitively binds to a LIMP-2 ligand, can be introduced into the cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Moreover, treatment of cells with one or more small molecule inhibitors or antibodies that disrupt the association of LIMP-2 and a LIMP-2 ligand can also be used to produce a LIMP-2 deficient cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Antisense nucleic acid molecules, that is, molecules which are complementary to a sense nucleic acid encoding a LIMP-2 polypeptide (e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded cDNA LIMP-2 molecule or complementary to an mRNA LIMP-2 sequence) can also be used to render a cell LIMP-2 deficient. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to an entire LIMP-2 coding strand, or to only a portion thereof, e.g., all or part of the protein coding region (or open reading frame). An antisense nucleic acid molecule can be antisense to a noncoding region of the coding strand of a nucleotide sequence encoding LIMP-2. The noncoding regions (5â² and 3â² untranslated regions) are the 5â² and 3â² sequences which flank the coding region and are not translated into amino acids. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can be complementary to the entire coding region of LIMP-2 mRNA, but more preferably is an oligonucleotide which is antisense to only a portion of the coding or noncoding region of LIMP-2 mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 nucleotides in length. An antisense nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using procedures known in the art (e.g., using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions).</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In a particular embodiment, RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to produce a LIMP-2 deficient cell or animal (e.g., using short interfering RNA (siRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)). As known in the art RNAi is a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene silencing directed by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Meister G, Tuschl T., <i>Nature. </i>431, 343-9, (2004)). Exogenous dsRNA molecules that have sufficient sequence complementarity to a particular mRNA sequence, are introduced into a cell to destroy a particular mRNA, thereby diminishing or abolishing expression of the mRNA sequence. The exogenous dsRNA molecules introduced into the cells are processed by the RNase III enzyme Dicer into duplexes of 21-25 nucleotides (nt) containing 5â² monophosphates and 2-nt 3â² overhangs referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Bernstein, E., et al., <i>Nature. </i>409, 363-6 (2001); Elbashir, S. M., et al., <i>Genes Dev. </i>15, 188-200 (2001)). The siRNAs are incorporated into a multi-protein RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that degrades RNAs with sequences complementary to the siRNA (Tomari, Y., Zamore, P. D., <i>Genes Dev. </i>19, 517-29 (2005)).</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Thus, one or more siRNA or shRNA that degrades a LIMP-2 RNA sequence can be introduced into a cell or animal to render the cell or animal LIMP-2 deficient. Algorithms for designing siRNA directed to a particular sequence and methods for producing such siRNA sequences are well known to those of skill in the art (e.g., Reynolds et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>22(3):326-330 (2004); Takasaki, S., et al., <i>Computational Biology and Chemistry, </i>30, 169-178 (2006)). In particular embodiments, the one or more siRNA or shRNA molecules are targeted to one or more domains of LIMP-2 (e.g., a transmembrane domain, a cytoplasmic domain, a lumenal domain). In a particular embodiment, the siRNA or shRNA is targeted to the lumenal domain of LIMP-2.</p>

In one embodiment, the one strand of the siRNA molecule has sufficient sequence complementarity to a LIMP-2 RNA sequence which encodes all or a portion of a lumenal domain of the hamster LIMP2 protein. In another embodiment, the LIMP-2 RNA sequence encodes all or a portion of amino acids 27-432 of SEQ ID NO: 2. In yet another embodiment, the one strand of the siRNA molecule comprises SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19 or a combination thereof.</p>

LIMP-2 is a heavily N-glycosylated 478 residue type-III transmembrane protein (Fujita et al., 1991) comprised of a Ë400 amino acid lumenal domain, two transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic domain of 20 amino acids. Based on homology, LIMP-2 has been defined as a member of the CD36 family of scavenger receptor proteins (Febbraio et al., 2001; Krieger, 2001). It was recently shown that over-expression of LIMP-2 caused an enlargement of early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes and an impairment of endocytotic membrane traffic out of the enlarged compartments (Kuronita et al., 2002; Kuronita et al., 2005).

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">The intracellular trafficking and enzymatic activity of Î²GC, unlike that of most lysosomal hydrolases, was unaffected in mouse embryonic fibroblasts doubly deficient for both MPRs (<figref>FIGS. 7A-7E</figref>). In an attempt to identify proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking of Î²GC an affinity chromatography approach was employed. A total detergent soluble extract of murine liver was passed over recombinant Î²GC affinity resin and, following extensive washing of the resin, bound proteins were eluted using pH 4.7 acetate buffer, collected and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>). A sample of the same extract was also passed over a control resin to which an equimolar amount of bovine serum albumin (BSA) had been coupled to monitor non-specific background binding of proteins to the resin. A careful comparison of the eluates from the two columns revealed that a polypeptide with an apparent mass of 75 kD was present in the fractions eluted from the Î²GC resin but not the control resin (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>). To further evaluate the specificity of this binding candidate for Î²GC a series of small-scale affinity binding reactions was run in the presence of excess soluble Î²GC or BSA. Competition with a four-fold molar excess of soluble Î²GC prevented binding of the 75 kD to the Î²GC resin (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>). Molar excess of BSA had no effect on 75 kD polypeptide binding. These results further substantiated that the 75 kD polypeptide was binding specifically to Î²GC. To determine the identity of this protein, fractions from the large-scale Î²GC affinity column enriched in the 75 kD polypeptide were resolved by SDS-PAGE and the band of interest excised, in-gel digested with trypsin and sequenced using nano-LC-MS/MS. Based on the amino acid sequences obtained the polypeptide was identified as the lysosomal integral membrane protein, LIMP-2. PNGase-F treatment resulted in a mobility shift of this polypeptide from 75 kD to 54 kD (<figref>FIG. 1C</figref>) which was the molecular mass calculated for de-glycosylated LIMP-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">The Lumenal Domain of LIMP-2 is Required for Association with Glucocerebrosidase</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">Î²GC resides in lysosomes as a protein associated with the lumenal membrane (Rijnboutt et al., 1991). Topologically, the lumenal portion of the LIMP-2 polypeptide was postulated to be in close proximity to this membrane (Okazaki et al., 1992). Therefore, whether this region in LIMP-2 might be responsible for the association with Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 1D</figref>) was investigated. Recombinant fusion-tagged LIMP-2 lumenal domain protein (L2LD) encompassing residues 27-432 was expressed as a soluble protein, purified and then used in an in vitro pull down assay with Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 1D</figref>). Î²GC bound specifically to L2LD indicating that the lumenal domain of LIMP-2 was sufficient for the interaction and that the binding between these two proteins was direct. When a similar in vitro pull down assay was performed using recombinant fusion-tagged LIMP-2 cytoplasmic domain protein or the isolated N- or C-terminal halves of the lumenal domain (residues 27-155 or 155-432) no binding of Î²GC was detected (data not shown). Also investigated was whether the corresponding lumenal region of CD36 (CD36LD) had the capacity to bind Î²GC in this assay since CD36 and LIMP-2 share Ë34% overall sequence identity, the majority of which is found across the lumenal domain (<figref>FIG. 1D</figref>). No binding of CD36LD was detected indicating that the interaction of Î²GC with LIMP-2 likely depends on features unique to the LIMP-2 lumenal domain. These data support a scenario in which domains of LIMP-2 and Î²GC interact within the lumen of some or all of the secretory compartments in which they co-exist.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">The efforts described herein to isolate and identify LIMP-2 from tissue extracts revealed that full length endogenous LIMP-2 could be released effectively from Î²GC affinity resin by elution with buffers at lysosomal pH. Î²GC passes through intracellular compartments of varying pH en route from its point of synthesis in the ER to its final destination in lysosomes. To determine compartments in which the association or dissociation of LIMP-2 and Î²GC may occur, the ability of Î²GC affinity resin to bind L2LD over a range of pH was tested via small-scale in vitro binding reactions (<figref>FIG. 1E</figref>). Binding of L2LD to the Î²GC resin was favored at neutral pH and attenuated as pH approached that typical of the lysosomal lumen. This indicated the most probable points of Î²GC and LIMP-2 association were pre-lysosomal, beginning in compartments as early as the ER or Golgi apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">Effects of LIMP-2 Deficiency on Î²-Glucocerebrosidase Activity, Levels, and Localization</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The in vitro binding data provided herein support a situation in which Î²GC and LIMP-2 interact directly within intracellular trafficking compartments of cells. The effects of LIMP-2 deficiency in the LIMP-2 knockout mouse were explored to determine whether there might be Î²GC-specific consequences. This was started by evaluating Î²GC activity levels in total tissue homogenates from wild type and LIMP-2 knockout mice (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>). The activity of another lysosomal hydrolase, Î±-galactosidase, which does not bind the lumenal domain of LIMP-2 in in vitro assays (data not shown), was also assayed for comparison (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>). Î²GC activity was significantly decreased in all of the knockout tissue samples relative to wild type; this difference was most notable in liver where the average decrease was greater than 75% (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>). In contrast, such a reduction was not seen when the activity of alpha-galactosidase was measured in the same samples. Immunoblotting revealed a very significant and consistent decrease in the levels of Î²GC protein in each of four knockout liver samples compared to wild type (<figref>FIG. 2C</figref>, right panel). Anti-Î²GC immunoblots of kidney homogenates prepared from these same animals yielded identical results (<figref>FIG. 2C</figref>, left panel). To determine if the reduced expression level was due to changes at the transcription level a Northern blot analysis of RNA derived from liver and kidney of wild type and LIMP-2 knockout mice was performed. The Î²GC transcript levels were not significantly different between the two genotypes (<figref>FIG. 2D</figref>) indicating that the decrease in Î²GC protein expression was due to post-transcriptional events.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">The differences in Î²GC enzyme activity detected between LIMP-2 wild type and knockout tissues were almost certainly a reflection of the drop in total Î²GC protein levels, a conclusion that was further substantiated by immunohistochemical staining (<figref>FIG. 2E</figref>). Spleen (not shown) and liver sections of WT and LIMP-2 KO mice were stained for LIMP-2 (<figref>FIG. 2E</figref> a,b), Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 2E</figref> c,d) and LAMP-1 (<figref>FIG. 2E</figref> e,f). In wild type tissues as exemplified by liver, LIMP-2 and Î²GC colocalized with LAMP-1 in lysosomes whereas in LIMP-2 KO tissue neither LIMP-2 nor Î²GC staining was visible. However, the levels and subcellular distribution of LAMP-1 in KO tissue appeared normal indicating that the integrity of the lysosomal compartment was maintained in LIMP-2-deficient tissue. In a wide spectrum of tissues a tight correlation between the relative levels of Î²GC and LIMP-2 protein was detected such that in samples in which LIMP-2 was absent Î²GC was deficient but in samples in which LIMP-2 was present Î²GC was readily detectable (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Reduction of lysosomal Î²GC levels has been found to correlate with an increase in the Î²GC substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer) in Gaucher disease (Brady et al., 1965; Nilsson et al., 1985; Nilsson and Svennerholm, 1982). Analysis of GlcCer levels in tissues isolated from wild type and LIMP-2 knockout mice revealed an almost two-fold increase of GlcCer in the liver and lung from LIMP-2-deficient animals (Table 1) compared to normal.</p>

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">To more precisely define the molecular events leading to the reduction in Î²GC activity levels in LIMP-2-deficient tissues we examined the status of Î²GC in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells derived from wild type and LIMP-2-deficient embryos. Both the activity (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>) and the level of Î²GC protein (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>) were dramatically reduced in the extracts from LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells. Immunostaining for Î²GC in the MEFs revealed that in WT cells Î²GC localized in LAMP-2 positive lysosomal compartments whereas in LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells (<figref>FIG. 3C</figref>) or Hela cells with an siRNA-mediated downregulation of LIMP-2 (<figref>FIGS. 9A-9H</figref>) almost no lysosomal Î²GC could be detected. Although in a minority of LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells a very weak lysosomal Î²GC staining was still detectable (not shown), in the majority of these cells it appeared that most if not all the Î²GC had been degraded and/or secreted. Overexpression of Î²GC in LIMP-2-deficient cells revealed that Î²GC was retained in the ER and unable to be delivered to the lysosomal compartment (<figref>FIGS. 10A-10I</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Given the dramatic effects of LIMP-2 deficiency on the status of Î²GC in cells whether LIMP-2 was directly required for the correct lysosomal localization of Î²GC was investigated. For this myc-tagged murine LIMP-2 was transfected into LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells and assessed whether LIMP-2 expression could rescue the mis-localization of Î²GC. Transfected cells were identified by staining with antibodies against the lumenal domain of LIMP-2 (not shown) or against the myc-epitope (<figref>FIG. 4A-C</figref>). In 95% of the LIMP-2 transfected cells, but not in LIMP-2 KO cells transfected with another lysosomal membrane protein (LAMP-2), the Î²GC expression levels were rescued to wild-type levels (see FIG. <b>3</b>Ca) and Î²GC colocalized with LIMP-2 in lysosomal compartments (<figref>FIG. 4C</figref>). The juxta-membrane localization of both LIMP-2 and Î²GC was demonstrated by their ring-like staining pattern in the intracellular vesicles. A triple staining with LIMP-2, Î²GC and LAMP-2 (<figref>FIGS. 4D-4G</figref>) confirmed the correct lysosomal sorting of Î²GC after LIMP-2 re-expression. The requirement of LIMP-2 for the lysosomal localization of Î²GC was also supported by an additional experiment where LIMP-2 and Î²GC were co-expressed in Cos7 cells. Whereas LIMP-2 expression allows Î²GC to be delivered efficiently to the lysosomal compartment, the fusion of LIMP-2 to a strong ER retention motif (Zerangue et al., 2000) prevented the transport of Î²GC out of the ER (<figref>FIGS. 11A-11F</figref>). Immunoblot analysis after transient transfection of LIMP-2 in KO MEF cells confirmed the microscopical results. Expression of LIMP-2 led to an increase in the general Î²GC level and in the mature, most likely lysosomal, form of Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 3H</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">The requirement of LIMP-2 for the lysosomal localization of Î²GC was also supported by an additional experiment in COS cells in which LIMP-2 expression enabled the efficient delivery of Î²GC to the lysosomal compartment, but the fusion of LIMP-2 to a strong ER retention motif (Zerangue et al., 2000) prevented the transport of Î²GC out of the ER (<figref>FIG. 24A-24F</figref>). Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the association of LIMP-2 and Î²GC as well as the association of the LIMP-2-ER retention mutant with Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 24G</figref> and <figref>FIG. 26A</figref>) again suggesting that binding of these proteins can occur in compartments as early as the endoplasmic reticulum. Also tested was the expression in COS cells of a truncated version of LIMP-2 (LIMP-2 (1d)) in which the lumenal domain was fused to the Î²GC signal peptide to target it to the extracellular space. LIMP-2 (1d) was found to be secreted. Coexpression of this LIMP-2 construct with Î²GC led to a dramatic increase in the amount of Î²GC secreted compared to that seen upon the expression of Î²GC on its own (<figref>FIG. 26B</figref>). Such an increase was not seen when wild type LIMP-2 was co-expressed with Î²GC. These data provided additional evidence for the association of these proteins.</p>

      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">The isolated halves of the LIMP-2 lumenal domain (residues 27-155 and 155-432) do not bind Î²GC (data not shown). This suggested to us that a region around amino acid residue 155 might be required for the Î²GC-LIMP-2 association. Exploring this hypothesis, a conserved coiled-coil domain LIMP-2 from amino acid residue 150-167 (<figref>FIG. 25A</figref>, <b>25</b>B) was discovered. When the putative coil-coiled domain was disrupted by deleting this region (LIMP-2Îcc) or by replacing a leucine to a proline at amino acid position 160 (LIMP-2-L160P), the resultant mutants failed to rescue lysosomal Î²GC expression in LIMP-2 deficient MEF cells despite the fact that both mutants were, like wildtype LIMP-2 (<figref>FIG. 25A</figref>), delivered normally to the lysosomal compartment (<figref>FIG. 25C</figref>, <b>25</b>D). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that the physical interaction between endogenous Î²GC and LIMP-2 was lost in the case of both mutants (<figref>FIG. 25E</figref>). In vitro pull down experiments using purified recombinant proteins further confirmed the lack of Î²GC binding to the LIMP-2 L160P mutant (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the LIMP-2 region from residues 150-167 is crucially involved in the binding of LIMP-2 to Î²GC.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">LIMP-2 Expression Leads to Lysosomal Localization of a Clinical Glucocerebrosidase Mutant Normally Retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">To analyze if any of the more common clinical mutations within Î²GC affected binding to LIMP-2, Î²GC N370S, G202R and L444P were expressed, and interaction of LIMP-2 and these mutant proteins were analyzed in an in vitro binding assay. None of these mutations in Î²GC abrogated the binding to LIMP-2 (<figref>FIG. 27A-27B</figref>). Interestingly however, it was observed that LIMP-2 expression led to transport of Î²GC L444P, a known ER retention mutant (Schmitz et al., 2005), to the lysosomal compartment (<figref>FIG. 25F</figref>) suggesting that LIMP-2 can bind Î²GC within the endoplasmic reticulum and that an increase in LIMP-2 expression may be sufficient to overcome the ER retention of specific Gaucher mutants. Interestingly, the ER localization of another clinical Î²GC mutant, P415R, was not altered after overexpression of LIMP-2 (<figref>FIG. 27B</figref>) suggesting a direct or indirect effect of this mutation on binding to LIMP-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">Î²-Glucocerebrosidase is Mis-Targeted In Vitro and In Vivo</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">Since MPR-deficient mice and I-cell disease patients show an increased level of several lysosomal enzymes in their serum, whether an analogous observation might be made for Î²GC in the serum of LIMP-2-deficient mice was examined. Sera from wild type and LIMP-2-deficient mice were collected and total normalized protein samples analyzed for Î²GC levels by immunoblot. Whereas no Î²GC was found in the sera of wild type mice a significant level of Î²GC was observed in the serum from LIMP-2-deficient mice (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>). This observation corresponded with an approximately 11 fold increase in Î²GC activity in the sera from LIMP-2-deficient animals (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>) compared to that in wild type mice. These results provided in vivo evidence that a lack of LIMP-2 led to the mis-targeting of Î²GC to the extracellular space. To investigate this mis-targeting in isolated LIMP-2 knockout cells wild type and LIMP-2-deficient macrophage preparations were incubated in serum free medium for 24 hours and analyzed Î²GC levels in cell extracts and culture supernatants (<figref>FIG. 5C</figref>). In agreement with the in vivo observations described herein, a significant increase in Î²GC protein levels in the culture supernatants of LIMP-2-deficient macrophages was observed. In wild type cells only about 5-7% of the total Î²GC was found to be secreted. In LIMP-2-deficient macrophages between 46-47% of total Î²GC was found in the medium (<figref>FIG. 5D</figref>). Similar findings were made in MEF cells which also showed a large increase in the secretion of Î²GC in the absence of LIMP-2 (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>). Using PNGase F digestion it was observed that the molecular weight of intracellular Î²GC was reduced from 54 kDa to about 50 kDa in both wild type and LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells (<figref>FIG. 5E</figref>). EndoH treatment, which does not affect glycosylated proteins that have passed the Golgi apparatus, revealed that in wild type MEF cells more than 90% of the Î²GC was EndoH resistant, indicating that it had left the ER. In contrast, the same EndoH treatment in LIMP-2-deficient MEF cells, despite a lower overall Î²GC protein level, led to a complete digestion of the Î²GC carbohydrates suggesting that residual Î²GC in the absence of LIMP-2 was trapped in the ER.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">Pulse-chase experiments in HeLa cells depleted of LIMP-2 using siRNA allowed examination of the fate of Î²GC under conditions of LIMP-2 deficiency over time. (<figref>FIG. 5</figref> F). Whereas in mock transfected cells Î²GC starts to become EndoH resistant after 30-60 min, and after 8 h almost all Î²GC was EndoH resistant, indicating it had left the ER, LIMP-2 siRNA treatment led to a partial ER retention (<figref>FIG. 13</figref>) until 120 min of chase and a dramatic reduction in intracellular Î²GC between 120 min and 480 min (<figref>FIG. 5F</figref> a, d). This drop was correlated with missorting of Î²GC into the cell culture supernatant between 120 min and 480 min was also seen at 24 hr (<figref>FIG. 5F</figref> b, d). In contrast, the processing and secretion of cathepsin D was not affected by the downregulation of LIMP-2 (data not shown). Proteasomal degradation of Î²GC in the absence or down-regulation of LIMP-2 was excluded since inhibition of the proteasome did not alter Î²GC protein levels (<figref>FIG. 28A-28C</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">Taken together, these experiments show that LIMP-2 was required for the intracellular retention of Î²GC and a failure to bind LIMP-2 led to mis-targeting and a marked increase in the secretion of Î²GC with residual intracellular Î²GC localized to the ER or degraded.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">Discussion</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">In the present study a novel role for LIMP-2 as a sorting receptor required for the delivery of glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes has been identified. The Man-6-P receptor pathway has been very well characterized as a major route for the sorting of lysosomal enzymes, however the mechanism for the intracellular targeting of Î²GC to lysosomes has been unclear until now.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">A role for LIMP-2 in the maintenance and biogenesis of lysosomes has been suggested based on overexpression studies in cultured cells (Kuronita et al., 2005) and on the phenotypic analysis of LIMP-2 knockout mice (Gamp et al., 2003; Knipper et al., 2006). Based on the data presented herein, a number of features and qualities of LIMP-2 can be seen in the context of its role as a M6P-independent trafficking receptor for Î²GC. Lysosomal membrane proteins such as LIMP-2, in contrast to soluble M6PR-binding lysosomal proteins, are directed from the Golgi to lysosomes in a manner unique from that of soluble proteins destined for this same compartment. Rather than relying on the M6PR for sorting and delivery they are incorporated into clathrin coated vesicles by virtue of the interaction of distinct targeting motifs in their cytoplasmic tails with multimeric adaptor proteins; in the case of LIMP-2 the tandem leu-ile residues in its cytoplasmic domain have been suggested to mediate such an association with AP-3 (Honing et al., 1998; Le Borgne et al., 1998; Ogata and Fukuda, 1994; Sandoval et al., 1994; Tabuchi et al., 2002; Vega et al., 1991b) and AP-1 (Fujita et al., 1999)) and affect its targeting. The present findings that Î²GC associates with LIMP-2, that these proteins co-localize in intracellular vesicular compartments, and that the activity, levels and localization of Î²GC exhibit a dramatic correlation with the presence or absence of LIMP-2 described herein, reveal that Î²GC independence of M6P-based sorting mechanisms is almost certainly a consequence of its routing through the lysosomal membrane protein delivery pathway. However, when the status of Î²GC and LIMP-2 in AP-3 deficient cells from the mocha mouse was explored, missorting or altered Î²GC localization was not observed, indicating that there may be other targeting motifs in LIMP-2 that do not involve interactions with AP-3 (data not shown). Additionally, the deletion of the cytoplasmic-tail of LIMP-2 did not result in an altered localization of this LIMP-2 (data not shown) indicating that additional sorting motifs exist within the transmembrane or lumenal domain of this membrane protein. The evidence that the association of Î²GC and LIMP-2 was sensitive to changes in the range of pH values found within the intracellular compartments through which these proteins pass is also consistent with a model for LIMP-2 based trafficking (<figref>FIGS. 6A-6B</figref>). Preliminary crosslink experiments with LIMP-2 and Î²GC co-expressed in COS cells suggest that the protein-protein complex is about 250 kDa in size which would fit with a 2:2 Î²GC/LIMP-2 stoichiometry (<figref>FIG. 6A-6B</figref>). These data support a scenario in which LIMP-2 and Î²GC would associate in the ER or Golgi at more neutral pH and subsequently dissociate in the lysosome at more acidic pH (<figref>FIG. 6A</figref>). In this way LIMP-2 could capture and deliver its cargo of Î²GC in a pH-dependent manner analogous to the transport of M6P-tagged enzymes by the M6PR. It is also interesting to note that the missorting of Î²GC and the normal delivery of other lysosomal proteins such as cathepsin-D in LIMP-2-deficient cells is the converse of the situation seen in cells doubly deficient for the MPRs or in I-cell disease (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>). An additional role for LIMP-2 in stabilizing Î²GC against proteolysis cannot be ruled out based on our current data.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">Such an early association is supported by our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, in particular after expression of a LIMP-2 ER retention mutant. Interestingly, also observed was that a clinical mutant of Î²GC, L444P, which is usually retained in the ER, can be shifted to the lysosomal compartment after co-expression of LIMP-2. These data not only suggest that an increase in LIMP-2 levels may be of some therapeutic interest for selected Î²GC mutations but also support the other data demonstrating that interaction can occur in the endoplasmic reticulum. When the fate of newly synthesized Î²GC was monitored in the absence of LIMP-2 it was observed that Î²GC release from the ER was retarded before Î²GC was missorted and secreted suggesting that LIMP-2 binding to Î²GC is needed for efficient ER exit towards the lysosomal compartment. Î²GC secretion in the absence of LIMP-2 is also substantiated by our experiments with proteasomal inhibitors which did not affect the rapid intracellular loss of Î²GC (<figref>FIG. 28A-28C</figref>). In contrast to lysosomal delivery of M6PR-targeted proteins or proteins like the major histocompatibility complex II through the binding of the invariant chain (Trombetta and Mellman, 2005), where diversion from the constitutive secretory pathway occurs after leaving the trans Golgi network (Kornfeld, 1992) (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>), it appears that lysosomal Î²GC trafficking requires LIMP-2 binding already taking place in the ER. The observations described herein that modulation of carbohydrates has no effect on the association of both proteins (data not shown) also substantiates association in the ER. It is also conceivable that the early association of both proteins generates a signal for sorting within the TGN.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">The in vitro binding studies described herein indicate that Î²GC interacts with the lumenal but not the cytoplasmic domain of LIMP-2. This region of LIMP-2 is in a context where it would encounter an intra-vesicular protein like Î²GC. Î²GC associates with membranes in a carbohydrate-independent manner (Aerts et al., 1988; Imai, 1988; Leonova and Grabowski, 2000) and this persists from the ER through lysosomes (Rijnboutt et al., 1991). Interestingly, it was found that overexpression of LIMP-2 in Cos7 cells significantly enhanced the membrane association of co-expressed Î²GC compared to the expression of Î²GC on its own (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>) further emphasizing the importance of the LIMP-2/Î²GC interaction in vesicular compartments. The data also revealed that the binding of LIMP-2 and GC appeared to be stable during transport through the Golgi apparatus since expression of a secreted LIMP-2 mutant also led to a significant missorting and consequent increase of secreted Î²GC. Moreover, it seems unlikely that a defect in endocytosis of Î²GC underlies the increased extracellular levels of the enzyme since uptake of iodinated Î²GC in LIMP-2 KO cells is unimpaired (data not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">It is still unclear whether LIMP-2 might, similarly to the M6PR, also recycle back from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus, and we can not completely rule out the possibility that other lysosomal proteins might also bind to LIMP-2 at this point. The results from our affinity chromatography experiments with mouse liver extract and the lack of LIMP-2 association with Î²-galactosidase and Î²-glucosidase (data not shown) however, highlight a rather specific nature for the LIMP-2/Î²GC interaction. LIMP-2 is homologous to CD36 and defines it as a member of the CD36-scavenger receptor-like protein family (Vega et al., 1991). Despite the fact that LIMP-2 and CD36 share Ë34% sequence identity over their lumenal domains we found that Î²GC did not bind to this region of CD36 under conditions in which it bound the corresponding region in LIMP-2. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), however, has been demonstrated to bind both CD36 and LIMP-2 (Asch et al., 1987; Crombie and Silverstein, 1998).</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">The lumenal domain of LIMP-2 is homologous to CD36 and defines it as a member of the CD36-scavenger receptor-like protein family (Vega et al., 1991a). Members of this family have been shown to function in receptor roles in various cellular contexts. For example, CD36 acts at the cell surface to bind different ligands such as long chain fatty acids, modified low-density lipoproteins, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>infected erythrocytes (Ge and Elghetany, 2005). Other members of this family such as CLA-1 and the <i>Drosophila </i>protein Croquemort function as a cell surface receptor for high density lipoproteins (Murao et al., 1997) and in embryogenesis as a monocyte receptor for apoptotic cells (Franc et al., 1996), respectively. Despite the fact that LIMP-2 and CD36 share Ë34% sequence identity over their lumenal domains it was found that Î²GC did not bind to this region of CD36 under conditions in which it bound the corresponding region in LIMP-2. TSP-1, however, has been demonstrated to bind both CD36 and LIMP-2 (Asch et al., 1987; Crombie and Silverstein, 1998). The differing ability of these two family members to bind Î²GC indicates that as a ligand Î²GC has an apparently higher level of specificity for LIMP-2 than does TSP-1. Since LIMP-2 is predominantly localized on intracellular membrane bound compartments (Vega et al., 1991a) and exhibits only low levels of cell surface expression (Maeda et al., 1999; Okazaki et al., 1992; Suarez-Quian, 1987, 1988) it is possible that the interaction between LIMP-2 and TSP-1 does not predominate in the physiological setting, particularly given that TSP-1 is found in the matricellular environment. It may be that there are two subtypes to the CD36 family: proteins like LIMP-2 which function intracellularly, and others like CD36, CLA-1 and Croquemort that preferentially act at the plasma membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">The binding studies indicate that Î²GC interacts with a coiled-coil domain in the lumenal domain of LIMP-2. The disruption of the coiled-coil domain abolished interaction with Î²GC yet allowed normal expression and lysosomal transport of these LIMP-2 mutants. Coiled-coil domains have been shown to be involved in protein-protein interaction (Lupas et al., 1991) and the experiments revealed a critical role of this domain in LIMP-2 for Î²GC binding. A more detailed structural analysis however, will be necessary to completely resolve the nature of the binding of both proteins.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">A large variety of mutations that occur in the gene encoding Î²GC result in the accumulation of its substrate glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and consequently lead to Gaucher disease in humans (for review see: (Sidransky, 2004)). Manifestation of this disease is typically due to a deficiency in enzyme activity, inappropriate Î²GC localization, decreased Î²GC stability, or a combination of these factors (Beutler and Kuhl, 1986; Liou et al., 2006; Schmitz et al., 2005; Zimmer et al., 1999). Given the significant decreases in Î²GC protein levels and activity that was detected in tissues of LIMP-2 knockout animals and that this was a consequence of the enzyme being mislocalized, LIMP-2 knockout mice were examined more closely for phenotypes that might correlate with Gaucher disease. It was found that the levels of GlcCer substrate were elevated in LIMP-2-deficient liver and lung but apparently unaffected in other tissues, namely, kidney, spleen and brain (data not shown). Such tissue-specific differences could result from differences in substrate availability or utilization in each tissue; alternatively they could be due to varying amounts of residual Î²GC activity still detectable in LIMP-2 deficient animal tissues which may be sufficient to prevent GlcCer accumulation to levels at which more significant Gaucher-like pathologies might be seen. Despite the absence of robust Gaucher-like phenotypes in LIMP-2 knockout mice it is nonetheless interesting to speculate that some of the diversity in Gaucher phenotypes observed in humans carrying identical Î²GC mutations might result from secondary mutations in the LIMP-2 pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">It was observed that in contrast to the more common Î²GC disease related mutant L444P which, like the N370S and G202R mutants, still bound to the LIMP-2 lumenal domain, the Î²GC mutant P415R could not be transported to lysosomes after co-expression with LIMP-2 suggesting that this mutation directly or indirectly affects the binding site for LIMP-2. Structural analyses of the LIMP-2/Î²GC complex will be required to evaluate the importance of this Î²GC region for LIMP-2 binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">In conclusion, a novel function for LIMP-2 as a Man-6-P-independent trafficking receptor for Î²GC has been identified. The discovery of this function helps link together many of the details from previous studies of both LIMP-2 and Î²GC biology and, importantly, it helps clarify the role proposed for LIMP-2 in the biogenesis and maintenance of lysosomes. The nature of how the interaction between these two proteins is mediated, whether there are additional cargoes for LIMP-2, and how this finding plays into the realm of LIMP-2 and Î²GC related pathologies will be the exciting subjects for future studies.</p>

Several forward and reverse PCR primers were designed based on the alignment of human, mouse, rat, and mucaca LIMP-2 cDNA sequences (<figref>FIGS. 15A</figref>, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B). Upon routine optimization of reaction conditions, high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to successfully PCR amplify the hamster LIMP2 open reading frame from the cDNA template. A PCR product of the predicted size (1600 bp), based on the location of the primer sites in the mouse and rat open reading frames, was synthesized. The PCR product was gel purified and ligated into a Topo-Blunt DNA vector (Invitrogen), and the ligation products were transformed into <i>E. coli</i>. Five <i>E. coli </i>clones containing TOPO-Blunt/haLIMP-2 plasmid DNA (identified by restriction digest screen) were sequenced (see SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2). Alignment of the five independent nucleotide sequences showed 100% consensus, as well as 88.5% homology with mouse LIMP-2 nucleotide sequence.</p>

Specifically: The haLIMP-2 open reading frame sequence was analyzed using a computer program written to evaluate 19 base pair sections for potential use in siRNA duplexes. The rules utilized by the program were adapted from an established, frequently cited publication (Reynolds et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>22(3):326-330 (2004)) and are summarized in Table 2. Note: the program did not predict hairpins, thus the third rule on the list was not incorporated.</p>

This scoring method was reported by Takasaki, S., et al., <i>Computational Biology and Chemistry, </i>30, 169-178 (2006)). Use of the two scoring methods provided five candidate siRNA duplex sequences. Two sequences, si976 and si1182, were the top scoring sequences from the first algorithm (Reynolds, A., et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology, </i>22(3), 326-330 (2004)). Sequence si376 received the top scoring from the second method (Takasaki, S., et al., <i>Computational Biology and Chemistry, </i>30, 169-178 (2006)), based on both the scoring table and GC content. The final two sequences, si202 and si1135, were selected based on combinatorial analysis of the two sets of results, described below. Sequence si1135 was also near the top of the Reynolds et al. scoring (tied with 6 other sequences for 3rd best score).</p>

For T25 transfections, all conditions (cell number, medium volume, siRNA concentration, and lipid concentration) were scaled according to the increase in surface area from the 6-well plate experiments, and as noted previously, cells were approximately 30% confluent at the time of transfection. Two control conditions were also consistently done: 1) cells that were transfected with a non-specific siRNA (designed from huLIMP-2 3â²UTR sequence that is not contained in the mouse, rat, and presumably, hamster sequence) and 2) untransfected cells. In one experiment, a lipid only control was also included (Lipofectamineâ¢ 2000 diluted in OptiMemÂ®). Total RNA was isolated from harvested cells using the illustra RNA Spin Mini kit (GE Healthcare), and cDNA was prepared from the RNA using the Ready-To-Goâ¢ You-Prime First Strand Beads kit (Amersham). The cDNA samples were analyzed by TaqMan in two separate plates, one using the haLIMP-2 primers and probe to determine the LIMP-2 RNA level in each sample, and the other using elongation factor 1 (EF1) primers and probe to determine the RNA level of an internal standard. To illustrate the degree of knockdown obtained with siRNA treatment, the haLIMP-2 value was normalized to the EF1 value in each sample and the normalized values were graphed as a percentage of the untransfected control sample values.</p>

Results (FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>B) demonstrate stable knockdown of LIMP-2 RNA levels through 96 hours post-transfection.
