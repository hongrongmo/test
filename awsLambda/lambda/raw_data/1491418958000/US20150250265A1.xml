      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It is often necessary to adjust, tighten, and untighten the shoelaces of a shoe. Unfortunately, currently available lace adjusters are typically drab or uninteresting in appearance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">As provided herein, the present invention is directed toward a device including a cover that can be selectively attached to and detached from an assembly without damaging the cover and/or the assembly. Moreover, the device can be designed such that multiple, alternative covers can also be selectively attached to and detached from the assembly without damaging the covers and/or the assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">More particularly, in certain embodiments, the present invention is directed toward a lace adjuster comprising an adjuster assembly; and a first cover that is selectively attachable to the adjuster assembly. The lace adjuster can further comprise a second cover that is alternatively, selectively attachable to the adjuster assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one embodiment, the lace adjuster further comprises a light assembly including one or more lights that are positioned substantially adjacent to the first cover. In such embodiment, power can be selectively provided to the light assembly so that at least one or more of the lights generates light that is directed away from the adjuster assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Additionally, in certain embodiments, the lace adjuster further comprises a cover attachment assembly that selectively attaches the first cover to the adjuster assembly. Further, in some such embodiments, the cover attachment assembly includes a first attachment member that is secured to the adjuster assembly and a second attachment member that is secured to the first cover. In such embodiments, the first attachment member engages the second attachment member when the first cover is in an attached position, and the first attachment member does not engage the second attachment member when the first cover is in a detached position. In one such embodiment, the cover attachment assembly includes a snap. In another such embodiment, the cover attachment assembly includes hook and loop material. Still alternatively, the cover attachment assembly can include a plurality of cover pins and a plurality of cover apertures that receive the plurality of cover pins. In one embodiment, the first cover includes the plurality of pins and the adjuster assembly includes the plurality of cover apertures.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Further, in one embodiment, the first cover includes a design that is positioned along a top surface of the cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention is further directed toward a shoe comprising a shoe body, a shoe lace that is coupled to the shoe body, and the lace adjuster as described above that selectively adjusts the shoe lace.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Additionally, the present invention is also directed toward a lace adjuster for use with a shoe lace of a shoe, the lace adjuster comprising an adjuster assembly that adjusts the shoe lace; and a first cover that is selectively movable between (i) an attached position, wherein the first cover is attached to the adjuster assembly, and (ii) a detached position, wherein the first cover is detached from the adjuster assembly. In one embodiment, the first cover is movable between the attached position and the detached position without damaging the first cover and the adjuster assembly.</p>

      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The attacher slots <b>233</b> extend through the outer frame base <b>228</b>B, and the attacher slots <b>233</b> form a portion of the attachment system <b>234</b>. As illustrated, the attacher slots <b>233</b> can be somewhat âLâ shaped, and the attacher slots <b>233</b> can be positioned substantially symmetrically within the outer frame base <b>228</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In certain embodiments, the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> are designed to move relative to each other between a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration. In the unlocked configuration, the inner frame apertures <b>227</b> are substantially aligned with and concentric with the outer frame apertures <b>231</b>. In the locked configuration, the inner frame <b>226</b> extends somewhat away from the outer frame <b>228</b>, and the inner frame apertures <b>227</b> are positioned so that they are not aligned with or concentric with the outer frame apertures <b>231</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The design of the resilient member <b>230</b> can be varied depending on the requirements of the adjuster assembly <b>216</b> and/or the lace adjuster <b>214</b>. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the resilient member <b>230</b> is a spring. Alternatively, the resilient member <b>230</b> can be another piece of resilient material. The resilient member <b>230</b> is secured to the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> and extends between the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b>.

Additionally, the resilient member <b>230</b> extends through the member aperture <b>229</b> in the inner frame bottom <b>226</b>B. In this embodiment, the resilient member <b>230</b> urges the inner frame <b>226</b> up and/or away relative to the outer frame <b>228</b>. Alternatively, the resilient member <b>230</b> can be designed to urge the inner frame <b>226</b> within the outer frame <b>228</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, the bracket <b>232</b> is secured to the outer frame <b>228</b>, and the bracket <b>232</b> is designed to move (e.g., slide) relative to the outer frame <b>228</b> between a closed configuration and an open configuration. The design and positioning of the bracket <b>232</b> can be varied depending on the requirements of the adjuster assembly <b>216</b> and/or the lace adjuster <b>214</b>. In this embodiment, the bracket <b>232</b> includes: (i) a front section <b>232</b>F; (ii) a pair of side sections <b>232</b>S; and (iii) a pair of attacher apertures <b>235</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">When the bracket <b>232</b> is in the closed configuration, the bracket <b>232</b> is positioned substantially directly beneath the outer frame <b>228</b>. Additionally, when the bracket <b>232</b> is in the open configuration, the bracket <b>232</b> is positioned somewhat beneath the outer frame <b>228</b>, but it also extends forward away from the outer frame <b>228</b>. The movement of the bracket <b>232</b> from the closed configuration to the open configuration is somewhat similar to the movement seen when a cash register drawer is opened.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The front section <b>232</b>F of the bracket <b>232</b> is substantially arc-shaped and is positioned somewhat between the pair of side sections <b>232</b>S and is connected to each of the side sections <b>232</b>S. The front section <b>232</b>F can be made from a relatively thin and flexible material that allows the side sections <b>232</b>S to flex toward each other when pressure is applied on the outer edges of the side sections <b>232</b>S. Additionally, the front section <b>232</b>F is slightly shorter than the side sections <b>232</b>S, so as to define a gap (not shown) between the bracket <b>232</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b>, which, in turn, enables a portion of the shoe lace <b>12</b> to be secured within the gap between the bracket <b>232</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> when the bracket <b>232</b> is in the closed configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In one embodiment, each side section <b>232</b>S includes one of the pair of attacher apertures <b>235</b>. The attacher apertures <b>235</b> form a portion of the attachment system <b>234</b>. The design and positioning of the attacher apertures <b>235</b> can be varied. As illustrated, the attacher apertures <b>235</b> are substantially circular and are adapted to be positioned beneath a portion of the attacher slots <b>233</b> on the outer frame base <b>228</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Additionally, in one embodiment, the attachment system <b>234</b> is designed to slidably attach the bracket <b>232</b> to the outer frame <b>228</b>. Alternatively, the attachment system <b>234</b> can be designed to slidably attach the bracket <b>232</b> to the inner frame <b>226</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In this embodiment, the attachment system <b>234</b> includes the attacher slots <b>233</b> that extend through the outer frame base <b>228</b>B, the attacher apertures <b>235</b> that extend through the side sections <b>232</b>S of the bracket <b>232</b>, and a pair of attachment pins <b>237</b> that extend through the attacher slots <b>233</b> and the attacher apertures <b>235</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As discussed above, in this embodiment, the outer frame base <b>228</b>B includes the pair of spaced apart, somewhat âLâ shaped attacher slots <b>233</b>, and the side sections <b>232</b>S of the bracket <b>232</b> include the pair of substantially circular shaped attacher apertures <b>235</b>, wherein each of the attacher apertures <b>235</b> correspond to one of the attacher slots <b>233</b>. Further, each of the pair of attachment pins <b>237</b> extend through a corresponding attacher aperture <b>235</b> in the bracket <b>232</b> and into one of the attacher slots <b>233</b> in the outer frame base <b>228</b>B. The attachment pins <b>237</b> are designed to fit snugly within the attacher apertures <b>235</b>, and the attachment pins <b>237</b> are designed to slide within the attacher slots <b>233</b>. With this design, the attachment pins <b>237</b> attach the bracket <b>232</b> to the outer frame <b>228</b>, and the attachment pins <b>237</b> and the bracket <b>232</b> can slide relative to the outer frame <b>228</b> along the attacher slots <b>233</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">While the bracket <b>232</b> is in the open configuration, a portion of the shoe lace <b>12</b> can easily be inserted into or removed from the gap between the bracket <b>232</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b>. Subsequently, while the bracket <b>232</b> is in the dosed configuration, a portion of the shoe lace <b>12</b> can be effectively clamped within the gap between the bracket <b>18</b> and the outer frame <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In summary, in this embodiment, (i) the inner frame <b>226</b> fits partly within and moves up and down relative to the outer frame <b>228</b> between the locked configuration and the unlocked configuration; (ii) the resilient member <b>230</b> extends between the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> and urges the inner frame <b>226</b> upward; (iii) the inner frame <b>226</b> includes the plurality of inner frame apertures <b>227</b>; (iv) the outer frame <b>228</b> includes the plurality of outer frame apertures <b>231</b>; (v) the inner frame apertures <b>227</b> are substantially aligned with and concentric with the outer frame apertures <b>231</b> when the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> are in the unlocked configuration, thereby allowing the shoe lace <b>12</b> to be threaded through the inner frame apertures <b>227</b> and the outer frame apertures <b>231</b>; (vi) the inner frame apertures <b>227</b> are not aligned with and concentric with the outer frame apertures <b>231</b> when the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> are in the locked configuration, thereby allowing the shoe lace <b>12</b> to be held securely between the inner frame <b>226</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b>; (vii) the bracket <b>232</b> is attached to and slides relative to the outer frame <b>228</b> via the attachment system <b>234</b> between the open configuration and the closed configuration; (viii) a portion of the shoe lace <b>12</b> can be easily inserted into and/or removed from the gap between the bracket <b>232</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> when the bracket <b>232</b> is in the open configuration; and (ix) a portion of the shoe lace <b>12</b> can be securely held within the gap between the bracket <b>232</b> and the outer frame <b>228</b> when the bracket <b>232</b> is in the closed configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As illustrated, the cover <b>218</b> can be substantially semi-circular disc shaped, and can be very similar to the shape of the top side of the inner frame <b>226</b>. Alternatively, the cover <b>218</b> can be designed with a different shape from that shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. For example, the cover <b>218</b> can be substantially circular disc shaped, substantially square disc shaped, substantially rectangular disc shaped, or another suitable shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Additionally, as provided above, the cover <b>218</b> can be selectively attached to and detached from the adjuster assembly <b>216</b>, e.g., attached to and detached from the inner frame <b>226</b> of the adjuster assembly <b>216</b> in this particular embodiment. More particularly, the lace adjuster <b>214</b> can include a cover attachment assembly <b>236</b> that enables the cover <b>218</b> to be selectively attached to and detached from the adjuster assembly <b>216</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The design of the cover attachment assembly <b>236</b> can be varied. Stated in another manner, in alternative embodiments, the cover <b>218</b> can be selectively attached to the adjuster assembly <b>216</b> in any suitable manner. In certain embodiments, the cover attachment assembly <b>236</b> can include a first attachment member <b>238</b>A (shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) that can be included with and/or coupled to a portion of the adjuster assembly <b>216</b>, e.g., to the inner frame <b>226</b>, and a second attachment member <b>238</b>B (shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>) that can be included with and/or coupled to the cover <b>218</b>. The first attachment member <b>238</b>A and the second attachment member <b>238</b>B can be designed to selectively engage one another when being moved from a detached position to an attached position. Stated in another manner, when the cover <b>218</b> is in the attached position, the first attachment member <b>238</b>A engages the second attachment member <b>238</b>B; and when the cover <b>218</b> is in the detached position, the first attachment member <b>238</b>A does not engage the second attachment member <b>238</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the cover attachment assembly <b>236</b> can comprise one or more snaps <b>238</b> (only one is shown in the Figures), with the first attachment member <b>238</b>A of the snap <b>238</b> being secured to the adjuster assembly <b>216</b>, e.g., to the inner frame <b>226</b> of the adjuster assembly <b>216</b>, and the second attachment member <b>238</b>B of the snap <b>238</b> being secured to the cover <b>218</b>, i.e. to a bottom surface <b>218</b>B of the cover <b>218</b>. As noted above, the first attachment member <b>238</b>A of the snap <b>238</b> and the second attachment member <b>238</b>B of the snap <b>238</b> can selectively engage one another when being moved from the detached position to the attached position. Alternatively, the cover <b>218</b> can be selectively attached to and detached from the adjuster assembly <b>216</b> in another manner, such as with hook and loop material (e.g., Velcro), pin/aperture combinations, magnets, two-sided tape, lip/groove combinations, bumps/indentations combinations, or any other suitable manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Additionally, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the cover <b>218</b> can include a design <b>220</b>, e.g., a sports logo as shown in this embodiment, on a top surface <b>218</b>T of the cover <b>218</b> that enables the lace adjuster <b>214</b> to have a more interesting appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Further, in some embodiments, the lace adjuster <b>214</b> can also include a light assembly <b>222</b> including one or more lights <b>224</b>, e.g., LED lights. In one embodiment, the lights <b>224</b> are secured to the cover <b>218</b> and are positioned about the design <b>220</b> to draw more attention to the design <b>220</b>. Alternatively, the lights <b>224</b> can be positioned on or within the lace adjuster <b>214</b> in a different manner, and/or the lights <b>224</b> can be positioned away from or without a corresponding design <b>220</b>. The light assembly <b>222</b> can selectively receive power e.g., from a power source, so that light from at least one of the one or more lights <b>224</b> is directed away from the lace adjuster <b>214</b>.</p>

In particular, in this embodiment, the first attachment member <b>438</b>A of the cover attachment assembly <b>436</b> includes a plurality of spaced apart cover apertures <b>444</b>, and the second attachment member <b>438</b>B includes a plurality of spaced apart cover pins <b>442</b>. Each of the cover apertures <b>444</b> is adapted to receive one of the cover pins <b>442</b> when the cover <b>418</b> is moved to the attached position. In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the second attachment member <b>438</b>B, i.e. the cover pins <b>442</b>, are secured to the bottom surface <b>418</b>B of the cover <b>418</b>, and the first attachment member <b>438</b>A, i.e. the cover apertures <b>444</b>, are formed into a top surface <b>416</b>T of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>, e.g., a top surface of the inner frame <b>426</b> of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As shown, the cover <b>418</b> includes three cover pins <b>442</b> that are substantially evenly spaced apart near a perimeter of the bottom surface <b>418</b>B of the cover <b>418</b>, and the adjuster assembly <b>416</b> includes three cover apertures <b>444</b> that are substantially evenly spaced apart near a perimeter of the top surface <b>416</b>T of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>, e.g., the top surface of the inner frame <b>426</b> of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>. The cover pins <b>442</b> and the cover apertures <b>444</b> are positioned to coincide with one another during attachment of the cover <b>418</b> to the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>, i.e. during movement of the cover <b>418</b> into the attached position. Alternatively, the cover <b>418</b> can include greater than three or less than three cover pins <b>442</b>, and the adjuster assembly <b>416</b> can include greater than three or less than three cover apertures <b>444</b>. Still alternatively, the cover <b>418</b> can be designed to include the plurality of cover apertures <b>444</b>, i.a the cover apertures <b>444</b> can be formed into the cover <b>418</b>, and the adjuster assembly <b>416</b> can be designed to include the plurality of cover pins <b>442</b>, i.e. the cover pins <b>442</b> can be secured to the top surface <b>416</b>T of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>. Yet alternatively, the cover pins <b>442</b> and/or the cover apertures <b>444</b> need not be evenly spaced apart and can be positioned other than near the perimeter of the bottom surface <b>418</b>B of the cover <b>418</b> and the top surface <b>416</b>T of the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">It should be noted that in certain embodiments, the cover <b>418</b> can be used for alternative purposes when not engaged with the adjuster assembly <b>416</b>. For example, in one non-exclusive alternative embodiment, the cover <b>418</b> may include only a single cover pin <b>442</b> (although multiple cover pins <b>442</b> are also possible), and the cover <b>418</b> may be used as a golf ball marker or for other suitable purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">While a number of exemplary aspects and embodiments of a lace adjuster <b>14</b> have been shown and disclosed herein above, those of skill in the art will recognize certain modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations thereof. It is therefore intended that the lace adjuster <b>14</b> shall be interpreted to include all such modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations as are within their true spirit and scope, and no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown.</p>
