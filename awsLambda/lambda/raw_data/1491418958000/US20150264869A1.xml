      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">For as long as humans have practiced the interment of their dead, the careful tending of a graveâdecorating it with flowers and plantsâhas been a fundamental ritual of remembrance. Today, however, cremation is an increasingly popular choice. In some areas more than half of all interments are of cremated remains. The sharp increase in cremations around the world in recent years is partly attributable to the significantly higher costs for a traditional interment in comparison with an urn grave. Aesthetic and hygienic considerations also play a role; a decaying corpse represents a genuine threat to the soil and groundwater. Coffins are also normally painted or lacquered and upholstered with synthetic materialsâan ecological problem which has only seeped into the consciousness of cemetery administrators over the past few years. Some people also consider cremation to be a âcleanerâ form of disposal in comparison to the decaying of their mortal remains underground, particular if the deceased was afflicted with a communicable disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The question of cremation arises not only upon the death of a relative, but also upon the death of a beloved pet. It is now common upon the death of an animal companion to have the remains cremated. However, in the case of cremation, the ritual of tending the graveâan important opportunity for dealing with grief and cultivating remembranceâis largely eliminated: the urn or ash capsule with the cremated remains of the deceased is rarely given its own grave. Ash capsules are normally integrated into plain or decorative urns and immured in columbariums or buried in a cremation burial plot. As such gravesites usually do not permit plantings to be made, the rituals of remembrance are often limited to the placing of cut flowers at the site. The comforting symbolism of growth and blooming available with the tending of traditional burial plots is lost entirely.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For this reason, the bereaved often prefer that the ash capsule or urn not be interred at a public cemetery, but kept at home. This is partly due to a wish to keep the departed close to them even after death, or to be able to bury the remains at a place that holds personal meaning. On the other hand, financial considerations may also play a role, when one considers that a cremation burial plot with a 20-year occupancy period can easily cost several hundred Euros.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Undertakers have noticed another trend in favor of cremation and the practice of keeping the departed's remains at home: as globalization advances, families today are often scattered across multiple countries or even continents. Cremation permits the ashes to be divided among several of the survivors.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In order to eliminate the drawback of the lack of opportunity to tend a gravesite in the case of cremations, it has been suggested in the prior art in US 2008/0083102 A1 that urns or ash capsules be set into the trunk of a tree or another plant (such as a cactus or a palm) such that the remains are gradually enclosed over time and integrated into the plant. In this way, the urn or ash capsule of the departed is âunitedâ with the plant. The disadvantage of this invention, however, is that a sufficiently large plant is required, and that the urn or ash capsule and the enclosed ash remain a foreign body in the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Also known from the prior art is U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,897. This relates to a cachepot for a plant pot which can be attached to an urn e.g. by means of a screw connection. However, this invention also does not provide a direction connection or operative connection. The connection between the urn and the cachepot is of a purely decorative nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">However, the survivors of the departed often wish that the urn with the cremated remains be not merely stored in or next to a plant for decorative purposes, but that the ashes form a physical union with a plant and thus that the departed âlive onâ in the form of the plant, or that the growing, flourishing plant symbolize the continuing life of the deceased. Observing the growth of such a plant also âkeeps aliveâ the memory of the departed.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">From a scientific perspective, this growth from the ashes of the deceased demonstrates the cycle of matter of life. In a theological sense, it illustrates the idea of âashes to ashes, dust to dustâ, or the principle of reincarnation. The cycle of matter of all life is found in every world religion. It offers a multitude of comforting metaphors for the vital process of coping with the grief and pain of loss.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">It is known from the prior art in this regard that ash, in particular ash from cremation, contain a high proportion of substances which can be used by plants as nutrients. In particular, cremation ash has a very high percentage of calcium phosphate, and is thus suited for use as a fertilizer, or as a nutrient additive for plants. Thus, e.g., US 2008/013 4575 A1 discloses the use of cremation ash for fertilizing plants. In it, however, the cremation ash is mixed with, e.g. potting soil.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a decorative urn that does not overstep the bounds of respectfulness and piety in which ashes are stored, in particular the cremated remains of humans or animals, and by means of which the nutrients in such ashes are supplied to a plant without the mixing of the ashes and the planting matrix (earth, granulate, etc.). Even during the planting or plant care process, no contact may occur with the solid ashes. The plant draws nutrients from the ashes inside the urn. Through this interaction, the cycle of matter of life is not hindered, as is the case with a standard ash capsule, but promoted.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In accordance with the invention, an urn is therefore provided, comprising at least two areas. The urn may be cylindrical, prismatic, or spherical, but could also have any other basic geometric form imaginable.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">It may also be desired that a single urn contain the ashes of several deceased humans or animals. For reasons of respect and piety, however, such a construction should make it possible to ensure that the ashes of multiple deceased persons or animals are not intermingled.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The urn may be made e.g. from ceramics, clay, sandstone, glass, porcelain, plastic, Corian, or any other conceivable material. The urn in accordance with the invention has at least two chambers separated from one another. At least one first chamber of the urn serves to contain ash, in particular cremation ashes. In accordance with the invention, the first chamber of the urn may also comprise several spatially separate partial chambers, so that the first chamber may serve as a receptacle for the ashes of one or more persons or animals. At least one second chamber of the urn may contain a planting matrix. This planting matrix may be any substance suited to providing a basis of existence for a plant. The planting matrix may thus comprise sand, earth, granulate, water, or any other material suitable for promoting the growth of plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In accordance with the invention, nutrients from the cremation ashes in at least one chamber of the urn are transported into at least one second chamber of the urn by means of at least one nutrient transmission element. This at least one nutrient transmission element may have any arbitrary shape, e.g. it may be disc-shaped, cylindrical, spherical, or conical. The nutrient transmission element may comprise any porous material capable of functioning as a membrane. The nutrient transmission element may be formed e.g. from clay, ceramic material, sandstone, glass, or plastic. The nutrient transmission element may be formed such that it separates the at least two separate chambers of the urn such that the ash does not come into contact with the planting matrix, or cannot be combined with it.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The nutrient transmission element can also be at least one wicking element or at least one irrigating element. The wicking element is formed such that it extends into the first chamber of the urn and is in physical contact with the cremation ashes contained therein. The wicking element may have any arbitrary form. The wicking element is preferably formed so as to be cylindrical and hollow, with the cylinder preferably open at the base. The wicking element can thus be more easily pressed into the ashes with the open-ended cylinder, and also offers a greater surface for nutrient transport. The wicking element may be formed such that it may be rigidly connected to at least one further nutrient transmission element.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The irrigating element comprises a connection between the area outside the urn and the first chamber of the urn, by means of which water (as from a watering can) for a plant may be conducted to at least one first chamber of the urn. The irrigating element may also be formed such that it can be rigidly connected to at least one further nutrient transmission element.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">It is also possible to provide an urn from a porous material than can function as a membrane. In this case, the entire urn functions as a nutrient transmission element.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In one embodiment of the invention, the urn comprises two chambers. Ash is placed in a first chamber of the urn. In a second chamber of the urn, the planting matrix (e.g. earth) and a plant (e.g. a flower) are placed. The two chambers are separated from one another by the nutrient transmission element. If the plant is watered, water or moisture can be slowly transported through the nutrient transmission element or the wicking element from the second chamber to the ashes in the first chamber, e.g. by the force of gravity or in some other way. The moisture penetrates the ashes and dissolves the nutrients therein. If the planting matrix dries out, osmosis and capillary action ensure that the moisture still present in the first chamber of the urn is conveyed into the second chamber via the nutrient transmission element. At the same time, the nutrients contained in the ashes are transported via the nutrient transmission element into the planting matrix in the second chamber of the urn, where they can be absorbed by a plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As the nutrient transmission element functions as a membrane, the selection of a specific pore size of the material makes it possible to determine which nutrients or molecules will be conveyed from the ashes to the planting matrix and in what quantity, and which molecules remain in the ashes. The pores are sized in accordance with the invention so as to be large enough to transport the important nutrients from the ash chamber to the potting soil, but small enough to prevent unwanted substances, such as bacteria, from moving from the potting soil in the second chamber into the first chamber. By selecting a particular size and the possible number of nutrient transmission elements, and the pore size of the nutrient transmission element and the wicking element, the quantity of nutrients transported into the planting matrix can also be specified.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">For plant species requiring only minimal quantities of nutrients, a material with very small pores is preferably selected, so that only small quantities of nutrients are transported out of the ashes. Furthermore, it is known that, the more nutrients that are transported, the higher the pH level in the planting matrix becomes. Through the selection of the pore size and the size of the nutrient transmission element, overfertilization or a change in the pH value can thus be prevented. For example, orchids require a low pH value, so the nutrient transmission element for such plants should be on the smaller side.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In the urn in accordance with the invention, the pore size of the nutrient transmission element is in the micrometer range. The solid ash thus cannot come into contact with the planting matrix. The respectful separation of ashes and planting matrix is thus at all times preserved. In accordance with the invention, the ashes can be placed into at least one first chamber of the urn directly in the crematorium.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The nutrient transmission element can furthermore be either rigidly connected to the urn, or can be inserted in the urn later.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">It is additionally possible to contain the ashes in a separate ash container which is placed in the first chamber of the urn. It can be assured by this means that, in the event of damage to or the shattering of the urn, the ash remains in the ash container, and is not scattered.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">It is also conceivable that the urn be provided with a removable glass cover. In this manner, the urn becomes a terrarium for plants. Through evaporation and condensation in the container, moisture thus circulates inside. This form of construction minimizes the amount of care and maintenance needed, and even more directly illustrates the way in which the cremation ashes can form a vital component of an ecosystem.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">It is also conceivable that at least one first chamber of the urn that serves as a receptacle for the ashes is located inside the nutrient transmission element. In this embodiment, the first chamber is delimited by the nutrient transmission element.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">A further advantageous embodiment of the urn in accordance with the invention provides for water, as from a watering can, to be placed directly in the first chamber of the urn. In it, the water is enriched with nutrients, which are transported via the nutrient transmission element into the planting matrix in the second chamber of the urn.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The invention is explained in greater detail below by means of various embodiments, and with the aid of illustrations.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an urn <b>1</b> in accordance with the invention with a cylindrical basic form. However, the urn in accordance with the invention is not limited to this basic form, but may have any other imaginable geometrical basic form. The urn and planter assembly <b>1</b> has a bottom wall <b>2</b> and an exterior wall <b>3</b>. The urn <b>1</b> has an interior space <b>4</b> which, in the embodiment depicted here, is delimited by the exterior wall <b>3</b> and the bottom wall <b>2</b>. Depending on the basic geometrical form of the urn, the interior space <b>4</b> can also be delimited only by the exterior wall <b>3</b>, as in the case e.g. of a spherical urn. It is also conceivable that the interior space <b>4</b> be delimited by a nutrient transmission element <b>5</b>. The interior space of the urn <b>4</b> has at least one first chamber <b>7</b> and a second chamber <b>8</b>. The first chamber <b>7</b> serves as a receptacle for ashes, in particular cremation ashes. The second chamber <b>8</b> serves to contain a planting medium and a plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref>
        <i>a </i>depicts an urn <b>1</b> and a nutrition transmission element <b>5</b>. The nutrition transmission element <b>5</b> is formed disc-shaped in the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. The nutrition transmission element <b>5</b> preferably has a diameter largely corresponding to the diameter of the interior space <b>4</b> of the urn <b>1</b>. In this way, it is ensured that the nutrition transmission element <b>5</b> can be inserted into the urn <b>1</b> so that it fits snugly against the inner side of the exterior wall <b>3</b> and thus creates two chambers inside the interior space <b>4</b> of the urn <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the entire surface of the nutrition transmission element <b>5</b> serves to convey nutrients between the at least two chambers of the urn <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the embodiment of the urn in accordance with the invention in accordance with <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, the nutrition transmission element <b>5</b> sits directly on top of the ash contained in the first chamber <b>7</b>. The planting matrix is then placed directly on the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b>. If the plant in this embodiment is watered, the water conveys the nutrients contained in the ashes through the disc-shaped nutrient transmission element into the planting matrix, from which they can be absorbed by the plant. The nutrient transmission element is formed such that only the nutrients are transported, but the ashes themselves do not come into contact with the planting matrix.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref>
        <i>b </i>depicts an especially advantageous embodiment of an urn in the embodiment in accordance with <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, a projection <b>6</b> extends radially along the inner side of the exterior wall of the urn <b>3</b> at a predetermined distance from the bottom wall <b>2</b> of the urn. The projection <b>6</b> serves to support and retain in place the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> when the latter is placed in the interior space <b>4</b> of the urn <b>1</b>. The presence of a projection <b>6</b> has the advantage that the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> can be fixed in place parallel to and at a predetermined distance from the bottom wall <b>2</b>. A further advantage of this embodiment is that the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> can have a slightly smaller diameter than the internal diameter of the urn, therefore simplifying the insertion of the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> into the interior space of the urn <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">One disadvantage of the embodiment in accordance with <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, however, is that the ash contained in the first chamber <b>7</b> may not reach the filling level of the projection <b>6</b>, and that an empty space could thus be created between the ashes and the nutrient transmission element resting on the projection <b>6</b>. In the event that such an empty space occurs, the transmission of nutrients between the ashes and the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> is hindered. This drawback can be eliminated by the addition of more water. However, certain plant species are sensitive to an increase in water supply, and may perish.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the urn in accordance with the invention in accordance with <figref>FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, at least one additional nutrient transmission element is therefore arranged on the nutrient transmission element <b>5</b> as a wicking element <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">
