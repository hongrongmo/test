      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field of the Disclosure</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present embodiment relates in general to portable containers such as purses and clutches to carry one or more items. More particularly, the present embodiment relates to a portable container with a plurality of lighting sources that flash in response to sound and/or movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Carrying devices such as purses and clutches are used to carry and store a variety of personal items such as make-up items, credit cards, cash, tissues, and glasses. Illuminated carry bags are widely used as an important fashion accessory for evening parties and outings to provide a particular aesthetic look. Such devices also allow one to locate items within the purse or clutch in the dark. Such devices with exterior lighting can also help locate the person holding the purse or clutch in a crowded club or party. Traditional devices for illuminating the interior or exterior of handbags, clutches, or suitcases have utilized individual light bulbs which illuminate only small portions of the handbag immediately adjacent to the light source. These illuminating devices do not disperse light throughout the bag, thereby limiting their usefulness.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Other prior art devices utilize a variety of light bulbs mounted in the various separate interior compartments within the interior of handbags. Such handbags are of complex construction due to the required wiring in each compartment. The bags with lighting units on the bottom side can create discomfort for the user while carrying the bag.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,912,611 issued to Lyle on Mar. 27, 1990 discloses a handbag battery-powered flashlight with a separate control switch that can be rapidly moved from handbag to handbag of either the rigid frame construction or the foldable fabric type. The control switch with actuating arms presses against the sides of the handbag closing the switch contacts whenever the handbag is opened. Both the light source and the control switch have VELCRO, or a similar material, for fastening to the interior surfaces of the handbag. A flexible electrical conductor connecting the light source to the control switch permits moving the light source to various locations for inspecting the external compartments of the handbag as well as illuminating the keyhole in a door or automobile ignition lock. However, the handbag requires the additional control switch to disperse the light to various locations of the handbag. Moreover, the handbag does not include any means to locate a person using the handbag from a distance.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another example includes U.S. Pat. No. 6,152,572 issued to Cutler on Nov. 28, 2000 describes a handbag interior illumination system for shining light on the contents therein. The handbag interior illumination system includes an elongate flexible tube with a pair of elongate flexible attachment strips coupled to opposite sides of the tube. A light source is disposed in the lumen of the tube. A battery is electrically connected to the light source. The tube is designed for positioning along an periphery of the mouth in a ring shaped configuration such that the proximal end of the tube is positioned adjacent the distal end of the tube. The attachment strips are designed for coupling to the compartment of the handbag. However, the handbag does not provide an even dispersion of light and does not project the light to the exterior. Moreover, the handbag does not provide an elegant or trendy appearance when using it at parties.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,499,857 issued to Lumley on Dec. 31, 2002 teaches lighting attached to a clothing accessory article such as a handbag or a high heeled shoe. The clothing accessory article has an exterior surface provided with a plurality of lights dispersed among gem-like members that are illuminated by the lights. The article includes a switch for on/off control of the lights and the switch is disguised as a decorative member on the article. Since the article includes the illumination system along the sides, the entire article is not illuminated evenly. In addition, the article does not include any means to disperse the light emitted by the light sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Likewise, U.S. Pat. No. 8,579,459 issued to Ma on Nov. 12, 2013 discloses an illuminated bucket. The illuminated bucket is a double-layered or walled carrier, with LED light, or other illuminated source, established between the layered inner and outer walls for the formed carrier. The circuitry for the LED lights includes a battery, and may further include a flasher that allows for blinking of the lights. However, the illuminated bucket does not include a sensor for detecting a sound and/or movement. Moreover, the bucket does not include any means to disperse the light evenly emitted by the light sources. In addition, the light sources do not flash in response to the sound and/or movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Therefore, there is a need for an improved portable container that would be rigid and easily customized to provide an aesthetic appearance. Such a needed portable container would provide a plurality of lighting sources in an enclosed space to radiate light on the interior and exterior panels. Such a container would include a sensor connected to the plurality of lighting sources to detect sound and/or movement and induce the plurality of lighting sources to flash in response to the sound and/or movement. Such a needed device would include a plurality of particles within the enclosed space and when the plurality of lighting sources flash, the plurality of particles is capable of effecting the dispersion of the light as the particles move within the enclosed space while still providing privacy by preventing anyone from having a clear view of the contents of the container as the particles shift in different directions. Such an improved container would be configured in such a way that the plurality of particles move within the enclosed space and the plurality of particles flow in different directions, depending on the orientation of the portable container. Finally, such a portable container would serve as a source of entertainment and a means to locate the user carrying the portable container from a distance. The present disclosure accomplishes these objectives.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention is directed to a portable container that is adaptable for carrying one or more items. The portable container comprising a first section hingedly connected to a second section, each section has a plurality of walls including a top wall, a pair of opposing end walls and a bottom wall. The plurality of walls define an interior compartment for storing personal items. At least a portion of the plurality of walls include an interior panel and an exterior panel spaced apart from each other with the interior panel and exterior panel connected to each other thereby defining an enclosed space between the interior panel and exterior panel. The top walls of the first section and the second section include a locking means to lock the portable container when not in use. The enclosed space is filled with a plurality of particles that can be selected from the group consisting of sand, beads, rocks, crystals, semi-precious and precision stones, balls or other small objects, or combinations thereof. The color of the particles should be selected to enhance the desired refraction of the light. The plurality of particles do not completely fill the enclosed space and the plurality of particles can roll or shift within the enclosed space. Thus, the plurality of particles flows in different directions depending upon the movement and orientation of the portable container. The movement of the plurality of particles, depending upon the particle type, can also create sound when a user carries the portable container.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The enclosed space includes a plurality of lighting sources to selectively illuminate the interior panel and the exterior panel. The same lighting sources that illuminate the interior of the container also illuminate the exterior of the container. The interior and exterior panels are constructed from transparent material such as acrylic sheets or other plastic resin material. An inner portion of the bottom wall of the portable container within the enclosed space is releasably connected with at least one rechargeable energy source. The at least one rechargeable energy source is operatively connected with the plurality of lighting sources within the enclosed space. The enclosed space further includes at least one sensor that is releasably attached to the inner portion of the bottom wall. The at least one sensor is operatively connected with the plurality of lighting sources within the enclosed space. The at least one sensor is configured to detect sound and/or movement and induce the plurality of lighting sources to flash in response to the sound and/or movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">When the lighting sources flash, the plurality of particles disposed within the enclosed space are adapted to effect the dispersion of the light as the plurality of particles move within the enclosed space. The light source is energy efficient because it serves the dual function of illuminating the interior of the container and the exterior of the container thereby eliminating the need for separate lighting sources for interior and exterior use. The lighting sources help locate articles within the container, act as a beacon when lighting up the exterior of the container to locate the person carrying the container or to locate the container itself, and serve as entertainment when flashing in response to movement and/or in response to the beat of music. Since the sensors respond to sound, loud clapping can also help locate the container when it has been misplaced by lighting it up.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The particles not only enhance the dispersion and color of the light, the particles also provide privacy by blocking the view of the interior of the container. A further feature to provide further privacy is the exterior panel includes a graphic design that partially blocks the view of the interior of the container while still allowing light to escape and the particles to be seen. A checker board is an effective graphic design for this purpose, but any graphic design that serves the same function will be effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">One objective of the invention is to provide a portable container that includes a plurality of lighting sources in an enclosed space to radiate light on the interior and exterior panels so that the same lighting source serves the dual function of illuminating the interior of the container and also illuminating the exterior of the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">A second objective of the invention is to provide a portable container that can be configured in such a way that a plurality of particles move within an enclosed space and a plurality of particles flow in different direction depending on the movement orientation of the portable container.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A third objective of the invention is to provide a portable container that can detect sound and/or movement and induce a plurality of lighting sources to flash in response to the sound and/or movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a portable container that serves as a storage container to store the personal items, a source of entertainment, lighting for the interior space, and a means to locate a user carrying the portable container from a distance.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a portable container having a means of dispersing the light emitted by the plurality of lighting sources.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a portable container having a means of dispersing the light emitted by the plurality of lighting sources wherein said means can also provide privacy by blocking the view of the interior of the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a portable container that is rigid and easily customized to provide an aesthetic appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">These and other advantages and features of the present invention are described with specificity so as to make the present invention understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
