      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to an acrylic resin film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Acrylic resin film obtained by processing and molding an acrylic resin composition containing a cross-linked elastomer is used in and developed for various applications for its transparency and hardness. Examples of the application of such acrylic resin film include alternatives to painting to be laminated on interior or exterior car parts, exterior materials for home appliances such as mobile phones and personal computers, and floor materials for buildings. As a method for decorating a plastic surface, there is a film in-mold molding method in which a film, such as an acrylic resin film, previously subjected to or not subjected to vacuum molding or the like is inserted into an injection mold and a base resin is injected into the mold.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Various acrylic films suitable for such an application have been proposed. For example, a method is known in which the reduced viscosity of a plastic polymer and the particle size and rubber content of a rubber-containing polymer are specified (Patent Document 1), and a method is known in which the reduced viscosity of an acrylic polymer and the amount of a multi-layer acrylic polymer contained are specified (Patent Documents 2 and 3). It is known that films obtained by these methods are excellent in surface hardness, transparency, and film moldability.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Further, a method has been proposed in which two kinds of rubbers are blended to obtain an acrylic resin film having excellent solvent resistance and transparency (Patent Document 5). Further, a method has been proposed in which two kinds of rubbers are blended to obtain an acrylic resin film that can maintain its excellent appearance without whitening even when heated during molding (Patent Document 6).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">When a film is laminated on a molded article having a complicated shape, there is a problem that the film is likely to whiten due to the concentration of stress on the corners or the like of the molded article (film whitening on bending), which significantly reduces the commercial value of the molded article. However, in the above Patent Documents, there is no description about the problem of film whitening on bending. Of course, there is no description about the balance of physical properties such as anti-whitening on bending, cracking resistance, and surface hardness, either.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As a method for forming a film having improved resistance to whitening on bending (hereinafter, also referred to as anti-whitening on bending), a method is known in which a relationship between the degree of cross-linking and particle size of a cross-linked elastomer is specified (Patent Document 4). However, a film formed by this method has a problem that its anti-whitening on bending is excellent but its balance of physical properties such as anti-whitening on bending, cracking resistance, and surface hardness is not optimized.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">PREFERRED MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A rubber-containing graft copolymer (B) used in the present invention is obtained by first polymerizing a monomer component (B-1) to obtain an innermost-layer polymer. The monomer component (B-1) used in the present invention comprises 40 to 100 wt % of an acrylate (b-1-1), 60 to 0 wt % of a monofunctional monomer (b-1-2) copolymerizable therewith, and 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of a polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) (with respect to 100 parts by weight of (b-1-1)+(b-1-2)). The polymerization of the monomer component (B-1) may be performed by using a mixture of all the monomers or may be performed in two or more stages by changing the composition of the monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The acrylate (b-1-1) used here is preferably an alkyl acrylate. From the viewpoint of polymerizability and cost, the alkyl acrylate is preferably one having a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples of such an alkyl acrylate include methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, t-butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, n-octyl acrylate, Î²-hydroxyethyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, acrylamide, and N-methylol acrylamide. These monomers may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them. The ratio of the amount of the acrylate (b-1-1) to the total amount of (b-1-1) and (b-1-2) is preferably 40 to 100 wt %, more preferably 50 to 100 wt %, most preferably 60 to 100 wt %. If the weight ratio of the acrylate (b-1-1) is less than 40 wt %, a resulting film is undesirably poor in cracking resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Further, if necessary, the acrylate (b-1-1) may be copolymerized with the monofunctional monomer (b-1-2) copolymerizable therewith. An ethylene-based unsaturated monomer copolymerizable with the acrylate (b-1-1) is, for example, a methacrylate, preferably an alkyl methacrylate. From the viewpoint of polymerizability and cost, the alkyl methacrylate is preferably one having a linear or branched alkyl group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples of such an alkyl methacrylate include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, methacrylamide, Î²-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, and glycidyl methacrylate. Other examples of the ethylene-based unsaturated monomer include: vinyl halides such as vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide; vinyl cyanides such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; vinyl esters such as vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, and vinyl propionate; aromatic vinyl derivatives such as styrene, vinyl toluene, and Î±-methylstyrene; vinylidene halides such as vinylidene chloride and vinylidene fluoride; acrylic acid and salts thereof such as acrylic acid, sodium acrylate, and calcium acrylate; and methacrylic acid and salts thereof such as methacrylic acid, sodium methacrylate, and calcium methacrylate. These monomers may be used in combination of two or more of them. The ratio of the amount of the monofunctional monomer (b-1-2) copolymerizable with the acrylate (b-1-1) to the total amount of (b-1-1) and (b-1-2) is preferably 0 to 60 wt %, more preferably 0 to 50 wt %, most preferably 0 to 40 wt %. If the weight ratio of the monofunctional monomer (b-1-2) exceeds 60 wt %, a resulting film is undesirably poor in cracking resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The monomer component (B-1) contains the polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) having two or more non-conjugated reactive double bonds per molecule, and therefore the obtained polymer is a cross-linked polymer. Examples of the polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) used here include allyl methacrylate, allyl acrylate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, diallyl phthalate, diallyl maleate, divinyl adipate, divinylbenzene ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, divinylbenzene ethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate, tetramethylol methane tetramethacrylate, tetramethylol methane tetraacrylate, dipropylene glycol dimethacrylate, and dipropylene glycol diacrylate. These monomers may be used in combination of two or more of them.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The amount of the polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) contained in the monomer component (B-1) is preferably 0.05 to parts by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of (b-1-1)+(b-1-2). If the polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) content is less than 0.05 part by weight, there is a tendency that a cross-linked polymer cannot be formed. If the polyfunctional monomer (b-1-3) content exceeds 10 parts by weight, a resulting film tends to have low cracking resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Then, a monomer component (B-2) was polymerized in the presence of the innermost-layer polymer (polymerization product of (B-1)). The monomer component (B-2) used in the present invention comprises 50 to 100 wt % of a methacrylate (b-2-1), 50 to 0 wt % of a monofunctional monomer (b-2-2) copolymerized therewith, and 0.05 to 10 parts by weight of a polyfunctional monomer (b-2-3) (with respect to 100 parts by weight of (b-2-1)+(b-2-2)). The polymerization of the monomer component (B-2) may be performed by using a mixture of all the monomers or may be performed in two or more stages by changing the composition of the monomers. The methacrylate (b-2-1) used here is preferably an alkyl methacrylate.

Specific examples of such an alkyl methacrylate include methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, octyl methacrylate, methacrylamide, Î²-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, and glycidyl methacrylate.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The ratio of the amount of the methacrylate (b-2-1) to the total amount of (b-2-1) and (b-2-2) is preferably 50 to 100 wt %, more preferably 60 to 100 wt %, most preferably 70 to 100 wt %. If the weight ratio of the methacrylate (b-2-1) is less than 50 wt %, a resulting film undesirably has low surface hardness.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Further, if necessary, the methacrylate (b-2-1) may be copolymerized with the monofunctional monomer (b-2-2) copolymerizable therewith.

The ratio of the amount of the monofunctional monomer (b-2-2) copolymerizable with the methacrylate (b-2-1) to the total amount of (b-2-1) and (b-2-2) is preferably 0 to 50 wt %, more preferably 0 to 40 wt %, most preferably 0 to 30 wt %. If the weight ratio of the monofunctional monomer (b-2-2) exceeds 50 wt %, a resulting film undesirably has low surface hardness.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The monomer component (B-2) contains the polyfunctional monomer (b-2-3) having two or more non-conjugated reactive double bonds per molecule, and therefore a cross-linked polymer is obtained.

Further, when the acrylic resin composition (D) is molded into a film, if necessary, both the surfaces of the film may be brought into contact with (inserted between) rolls or metallic belts at the same time, especially with rolls or metallic belts heated to a temperature equal to or higher than the glass transition temperature of the film so that the film can have better surface properties. Further, depending on the intended use, the film may be subjected to lamination molding or modified by uniaxial stretching or biaxial stretching.</p>

      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">An acrylic resin film according to the present invention may be an unstretched film not subjected to stretching or a stretched film. When the acrylic resin film according to the present invention is a stretched film, the stretched film (uniaxially-stretched film or biaxially-stretched film) can be produced by once molding the acrylic resin composition (D) used in the present invention into an unstretched film and then subjecting the unstretched film to uniaxial stretching or biaxial stretching.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In this specification, a film obtained by molding the acrylic resin composition (D) used in the present invention but not yet subjected to stretching, that is, an unstretched film is referred to as âraw filmâ for convenience.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">When a raw film is stretched, stretching may be continuously performed immediately after the raw film is obtained by molding, or may be performed after the raw film obtained by molding is once stored or moved. It is to be noted that when a raw film is stretched immediately after obtained by molding, stretching may be performed very shortly (in some cases, instantly) after the raw film is obtained by molding in a film production process, or stretching may be performed after a lapse of a certain time after the raw film is once produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">When the acrylic resin film according to the present invention is produced as a stretched film, the raw film does not have to be completely in a film state as long as the raw film is in a film state to the extent that it can be stretched.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">A method for stretching the raw film is not particularly limited, and may be any conventionally-known stretching method. Specific examples of such a method include transverse stretching with a tenter, longitudinal stretching with rolls, and successive biaxial stretching in which the transverse stretching and longitudinal stretching are successively performed in combination. Alternatively, a simultaneous biaxial stretching method may be used in which transverse stretching and longitudinal stretching are performed at the same time, or a method may be used in which longitudinal stretching with rolls is performed and then transverse stretching with a tenter is performed. The raw film may be previously heated before stretching. In this case, the temperature at which the raw film is heated may be appropriately set.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The temperature at which the raw film is stretched is not particularly limited, and may be changed depending on mechanical strength, surface properties, thickness accuracy, etc. required of a stretched film to be produced. Generally, the stretching temperature is preferably in the range of (Tgâ30Â° C.) to (Tg+30Â° C.), more preferably in the range of (Tg) to (Tg+20Â° C.), wherein Tg is the glass transition temperature of the raw film determined by a DSC method. When the stretching temperature is within the above range, a resulting stretched film has a smaller thickness variation and further has excellent mechanical properties such as elongation, tear propagation strength, and folding endurance. Further, the occurrence of trouble, such as sticking of the film to rolls, can be prevented. On the other hand, if the stretching temperature is higher than the above temperature range, a resulting stretched film tends to have a large thickness variation, and its mechanical properties, such as elongation, tear propagation strength, and folding endurance, tend not to be sufficiently improved. Further, trouble such as sticking of the film to rolls is likely to occur. On the other hand, if the stretching temperature is lower than the above temperature range, a resulting stretched film tends to have a high haze, and in an extreme case, a production problem such as tear or breakage of the film tends to occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">When the raw film is stretched, the stretching ratio of the film is not particularly limited, either, and may be determined depending on mechanical strength, surface properties, thickness accuracy, etc. required of a stretched film to be produced. Depending on the stretching temperature, the stretching ratio is generally preferably selected from the range of 1.1 to 3, more preferably 1.3 to 2.5, even more preferably 1.5 to 2.3. When the stretching ratio is within the above range, it is possible to significantly improve the mechanical properties of the film, such as elongation, tear propagation strength, and folding endurance. Therefore, it is possible to produce a stretched film that has a thickness variation of 5 Î¼m or less, has a birefringence of substantially zero, and further has a haze of 5% or less.</p>

However, a coating layer is preferably provided which contains at least one selected from the group consisting of a urethane acrylate-based resin, an acrylate-based resin, an epoxy acrylate-based resin, and a silicone-based resin.

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0087">The solvent is preferably a volatile solvent that can dissolve or uniformly disperse the resin used as a coating agent, has no significant adverse effect on the physical properties (e.g., mechanical strength, transparency) of the acrylic resin film from a practical point of view, and has a boiling point that is not 80Â° C. or more higher, preferably not 30Â° C. or more higher than the glass transition temperature of the acrylic resin film.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0088">Examples of the solvent include various known solvents such as alcohol-based solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butanol, and ethylene glycol; aromatic solvents such as xylene, toluene, and benzene; aliphatic hydrocarbon-based solvents such as hexane and pentane; halogenated hydrocarbon-based solvents such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride; phenol-based solvents such as phenol and cresol; ketone-based solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, acetone, and cyclohexanone; ether-based solvents such as diethyl ether, methoxytoluene, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-dibutoxyethane, 1,1-dimethoxymethane, 1,1-dimethoxyethane, 1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofurane (THF); fatty acid-based solvents such as formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid; acid anhydride-based solvents such as acetic anhydride; ester-based solvents such as ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, butyl acetate, and butyl formate; nitrogen-containing solvents such as ethylamine, toluidine, dimethylformamide, and dimethylacetamide; sulfur-containing solvents such as thiophene and dimethylsulfoxide; and solvents having two or more functional groups such as diacetone alcohol, 2-methoxyethanol (methyl cellosolve), 2-ethoxyethanol (ethyl cellosolve), 2-butoxyethanol (butyl cellosolve), diethylene glycol, 2-aminoethanol, acetone cyanohydrin, diethanolamine, morpholine, 1-acetoxy-2-ethoxyethane, and 2-acetoxy-1-methoxypropane. These solvents may be used singly or in combination of two or more of them.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0089">Among them, a solvent mainly containing ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, or methyl isobutyl ketone is preferred because a reduction in the physical properties of the acrylic resin film caused by the solvent can be suppressed. Further, from the viewpoint of adhesion between the coating layer and the acrylic resin film, butyl acetate and methyl isobutyl ketone are preferably used in combination. Also from the viewpoint of uneven luster after coating, a middle-boiling solvent such as butyl acetate or methyl isobutyl ketone and a high-boiling solvent such as 2-acetoxy-1-methoxypropane or cyclohexanone are preferably used in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0090">The coating liquid is preferably filtered to remove foreign matter. The filtration may be performed after the preparation of the coating liquid, or may be performed just before or during coating. The filtration can be performed using a known filtration device, but for example, CUNO filter (trade name) manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Limited is preferably used.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0091">The thickness of the coating layer is preferably 0.1 to 20 Î¼m, and is more preferably 0.1 to 10 Î¼m, most preferably 0.1 to 7 Î¼m because cracking is less likely to occur even when the acrylic resin film is molded into a deep-drawn shape by vacuum molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0092">The acrylic resin film according to the present invention may have a primer layer on its surface opposite to the surface on which the hard coat layer is provided. As a composition for forming the primer layer, a resin is used which is excellent in adhesion with an ink for printing or a metal for metal vapor deposition for use in a processing process performed later. Examples of such a resin include urethane-based resins, acrylic resins, polyester-based resins, polycarbonate, epoxy-based resins, and melamine-based resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0093">The thickness of the primer layer is preferably 0.1 to 10 Î¼m, more preferably 0.1 to 5 Î¼m, most preferably 0.1 to 3 Î¼m. If the thickness of the primer layer is less than 0.1 Î¼m, the primer layer poorly contributes to adhesion, and if the thickness of the primer layer exceeds 10 Î¼m, cracking occurs during vacuum molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0094">Further, if necessary, the surface gloss of the acrylic resin film according to the present invention may be reduced by a known method. For example, this can be achieved by kneading the acrylic resin composition (D) with an inorganic filler or cross-linked polymer particles. Alternatively, the obtained film may be embossed to reduce its surface gloss.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0095">The acrylic resin film according to the present invention may be used by laminating it on a base material such as a metal or plastic. Examples of a method for laminating the film include lamination molding, wet lamination in which an adhesive is applied onto a metal plate, such as a steel plate, and then the film is placed on and bonded to the metal plate by drying, dry lamination, extrusion lamination, and hot melt lamination.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0096">Examples of a method for laminating the film on a plastic part include insert molding or laminate injection press molding in which the film is placed in a mold and then a resin is injected into the mold, and in-mold molding in which the preliminarily-molded film is placed in a mold and then a resin is injected into the mold.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0097">The acrylic resin film according to the present invention can be used for alternatives to painting such as interior materials for cars and exterior materials for cars, building materials such as window frames, bathroom fitments, wallpapers, and floor materials, daily goods, housings for furniture and electric devices, housings for OA equipment such as facsimiles, notebook computers, and copy machines, front panels for liquid crystal displays in terminals such as mobile phones, smartphones, and tablets, films for liquid crystal display members such as polarizer protective films, front panel films, prism bases, and light guide films, and parts of electric or electronic devices. Further, a laminate using the acrylic resin film according to the present invention can be used for lighting lenses, car headlights, optical lenses, optical fibers, optical discs, light guide plates for liquid crystal displays, films for liquid crystal displays, medical supplies requiring sterilization, microwave cooking vessels, housings for home appliances, toys, and recreational goods.</p>

Then, the temperature in the polymerization apparatus was adjusted to 60Â° C., and a mixed liquid of a monomer component comprising 27 parts of n-butyl acrylate, 3 parts of methyl methacrylate, and 5 parts of allyl methacrylate and 0.2 part of cumene hydroperoxide was continuously added over 3 hours. After the completion of the addition, polymerization was further continued for 0.5 hour to obtain rubber particles (polymerization product of (C-1)). The polymerization conversion ratio was 99.5%.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0145">Then, 0.05 part of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate was fed, and then the temperature in the polymerization apparatus was adjusted to 60Â° C. A mixed liquid of a monomer component comprising 7 parts of n-butyl acrylate and 63 parts of methyl methacrylate and 0.2 part of cumene hydroperoxide was continuously added over 5 hours. Polymerization was further continued for 1 hour to obtain a rubber-containing graft copolymer latex. The polymerization conversion ratio was 98.5%. The obtained latex was salted-out with calcium chloride, coagulated, washed with water, and dried to obtain a white powder of rubber-containing graft copolymer (C1).</p>

Then, the resulting mixture was melt-kneaded using a 40 mmÏ single screw extruder equipped with a vent at a cylinder temperature of 240Â° C. to obtain pellets. The obtained pellets were molded using a 40 mmÏ extruder equipped with a T die (NEX040397 manufactured by Nakamura Sanki K.K.) at a die temperature of 240Â° C. to obtain a film having a thickness of 125 Î¼m.</p>

      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0149">RC29-124 (manufactured by DIC Corporation as a urethane acrylate-based resin dispersion liquid with a solid content concentration of 30%) was applied onto each of the films obtained in Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 with a bar coater (#6 or #10). After the completion of the coating operation, the film was dried at 80Â° C. for 1 min to volatilize a solvent and irradiated with ultraviolet rays at 748.4 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>to form a coating layer (hard coat layer) with a thickness of 4 Î¼m or 7 Î¼m. Various properties of the obtained film were evaluated, and the results of the evaluations are shown in Table 3. The pencil hardness was determined by measuring the pencil hardness of the surface of the hard coat layer.</p>

      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Production of Acrylic Resin (A2)</heading>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0150">A glutarimide acrylic resin (A2) was produced using polymethyl methacrylate as a raw material resin and monomethylamine as an imidization agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0151">In this production, a tandem-type reactive extruder was used, in which two extrusion reactors were arranged in series. The tandem-type reactive extruder had a first extruder and a second extruder, and both the extruders were intermeshing co-rotating twin screw extruders having a diameter of 75 mm and an L/D ratio (ratio of length L to diameter D of extruder) of 74. The raw material resin was supplied through the raw material supply port of the first extruder using a loss-in-weight feeder (manufactured by KUBOTA Corporation).</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0152">The pressure in each of the vents of the first and second extruders was reduced to â0.095 MPa. Further, the first extruder was connected to the second extruder through a pipe having a diameter of 38 mm and a length of 2 m, and a constant flow pressure valve was used as a system for controlling the pressure in a part connecting the resin discharge port of the first extruder to the raw material supply port of the second extruder. The resin (strand) discharged from the second extruder was cooled on a cooling conveyor and then cut into pellets by a pelletizer. In order to adjust the pressure in the part connecting the resin discharge port of the first extruder to the raw material supply port of the second extruder or to detect varying extrusion, resin-pressure meters were provided at the discharge port of the first extruder, the center of the part connecting the first and second extruders, and the discharge port of the second extruder.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0153">In the first extruder, an imide resin intermediate 1 was produced using polymethyl methacrylate (Mw: 105000) as a raw material resin and monomethylamine as an imidization agent. At this time, the temperature of maximum temperature portion of the extruder was 280Â° C., the screw rotation speed of the extruder was 55 rpm, the supply rate of the raw material resin was 150 kg/hr, and the amount of monomethylamine added was 2.0 parts with respect to 100 parts of the raw material resin. The constant flow pressure valve was provided just before the raw material supply port of the second extruder to adjust the pressure in the monomethylamine injection portion of the first extruder to 8 MPa.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0154">In the second extruder, the remaining imidization agent and a by-product were devolatilized through a rear vent and a vacuum vent, and then dimethyl carbonate was added as an esterification agent to produce an imide resin intermediate 2. At this time, the temperature of each barrel of the extruder was 260Â° C., the screw rotation speed of the extruder was 55 rpm, and the amount of dimethyl carbonate added was 3.2 parts with respect to 100 parts of the raw material resin. Further, the esterification agent was removed through a vent, and then the resin was extruded through a strand die, cooled in a water bath, and pelletized by a pelletizer to obtain a glutarimide acrylic resin (A2).</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">Examples 7 to 9 and Comparative Examples 9 and 10</heading>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0155">The obtained resin powder of rubber-containing graft copolymer (B) and an acrylic resin (A) were blended so that the number of parts of rubber particles of the rubber-containing graft copolymer (B) was as shown in Table 4 and that the total amount of the rubber-containing graft copolymer (B) and the acrylic resin (A) was 100 parts, and the resulting mixture was mixed with a mixer (SUPERFLOATER SFC-50 manufactured by KAWATA MFG Co., Ltd.) for 3 minutes. Then, the resulting mixture was melt-kneaded using a 40 mmÏ single screw extruder equipped with a vent at a cylinder temperature of 240Â° C. to obtain pellets. The obtained pellets were molded using a 40 mmÏ extruder equipped with a T die (NEX040397 manufactured by Nakamura Sanki K.K.) at a die temperature of 240Â° C. to obtain a film having a thickness of 125 Î¼m. The obtained film was used as a raw film to form a uniaxially-stretched film by the above-described method. The properties of the obtained uniaxially-stretched film were evaluated, and the results of the evaluations are shown in Table 4.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0156">It is to be noted that in Examples 7 and 8, the following acrylic resin (A1) was used as the acrylic resin (A).</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0157">HR-S (manufactured by KURARAY CO., LTD. as a methacrylate-based resin containing 98 wt % of methyl methacrylate and 2 wt % of methyl acrylate)</p>
