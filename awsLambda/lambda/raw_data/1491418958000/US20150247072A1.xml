      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">One useful class of materials is elastomer-bonding compositions (i.e., compositions that are capable of bonding to elastomer substrates). In some situations, it is useful to find elastomer-bonding compositions that are waterborne. Various polymers are known to be useful in one or more specific formulations that are capable of bonding to elastomer substrates. For example, US 2003/0158338 describes aqueous compositions useful for adhering elastomers to other substrates and lists a variety of polymers that may be included in such a composition, including halogen-substituted olefin polymers and sulfonyl halide-substituted olefin polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It is desired to make elastomer-bonding compositions that contain blends of two or more different polymers. In some cases, a blend of two or more different polymers is desired because each polymer, when used alone, provides some specific benefit to an elastomer-bonding composition. However, it has been discovered that when some of such blends are made, the resulting composition has poor shelf stability. For example, it is expected that blends of bromine substituted olefin polymer and halosulfonated olefin polymer will sometimes have poor shelf stability. It is known, for example, that solvent based adhesives that are blends of mixed-halogen substituted olefin polymer and halosulfonated olefin polymer sometimes have poor shelf stability. Likewise, it has been discovered that waterborne blends of mixed-halogen substituted olefin polymer and halosulfonated olefin polymer sometimes have poor shelf stability. It is desired to provide waterborne compositions that contain both bromine substituted olefin polymer and halosulfonated olefin polymer and that have improved shelf stability.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0008">A waterborne composition is a composition that contains water and other ingredients. In a waterborne composition, the ingredients other than water are dissolved in the water or dispersed in the water or a combination thereof. A specific ingredient other than water may be dissolved in the water or dispersed in the water or a combination thereof. If two or more ingredients other than water are present, there may be any combination of dissolved ingredients or dispersed ingredients or combination thereof. For example, if any two ingredients other than water are considered, both ingredients other than water may be dispersed; or one ingredient other than water may be dissolved while the other ingredient other than water may be dispersed; or one ingredient other than water may be both dissolved and dispersed while the other ingredient other than water may be dissolved or dispersed or both dissolved and dispersed.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0009">An ingredient that is dispersed in water is in the form of discrete particles distributed throughout the water. The distribution of particles in water may be in any form, such as, for example, a dispersion, a suspension, an emulsion, a latex, or a combination thereof. The discrete particles may be solid, liquid, or a combination thereof. Independently, the discrete particles may form a colloid or other form of distribution.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0010">In some embodiments, the practice of the present invention involves contacting a layer of an adhesive composition with an elastomer substrate. The elastomer substrate used in the practice of the present invention may be any of a wide variety of elastic materials. Elastomers are well known in the art. One description can be found in <i>Textbook of Polymer Science</i>, second edition, by F. W. Billmeyer Jr., Wiley-Interscience, 1971. As described by Billmeyer, elastomers are materials that stretch under tension to a new length that is generally at least 1.1 times their original length and may be many times their original length; they exhibit relatively high strength and stiffness when stretched; after deformation, they tend to recover their original shapes relatively quickly, with relatively little residual permanent deformation. For purposes of the present invention, materials exhibiting most or all of these characteristics will be considered âelastomers.â Elastomers can be made from a wide variety of materials, such as for example natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Synthetic rubbers include, for example, polybutadiene, neoprene, butyl rubber, polyisoprene, nitrile rubbers, styrene butadiene rubbers (also called SBRs), ethylene propylene diene based rubbers (some of which are called EPDM), and the like. Elastomers include both thermoplastic elastomers (also called elastoplastics or melt-processable rubbers) and crosslinked (also called vulcanized) elastomers. The present invention may be practiced to bond any elastomer. Preferred elastomers are crosslinked synthetic or natural rubbers; more preferred are crosslinked elastomers made using natural rubber.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0011">The adhesive compositions of the present invention may be used to bond elastomers to any of a wide variety of useful materials, including for example other elastomers; non-elastomeric but flexible materials such as for example fabrics or films; and rigid materials such as plastics, engineering plastics, wood, and metal. Some compositions of the present invention work well at bonding elastomers to metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0012">The practice of the present invention involves the use of olefin polymer. Olefin polymers, also called polyolefins, include polymers based on monomer molecules that are unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons containing one double bond per molecule. Examples of such olefin polymers are polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutene, polybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, and the various copolymers thereof. Also included in the class of olefin polymers are polymers based on natural rubber and polymers based on synthetic rubber such as for example polyisoprene; polybutadiene; polymers of adducts of butadiene and cyclic conjugated dienes; copolymers of butadiene and styrene; copolymers of ethylene, propylene, and dienes; copolymers of acrylonitrile and butadiene; and the various copolymers thereof. Also included in the class of olefin polymers are the polymers described above that also include one or more multiply functional monomers to provide crosslinking.</p>

In embodiments in which one or more dispersion enhancement compound is added to the ABC latex after formation of the ABC latex, the ratio of the dry weight of all dispersion enhancement compounds added to the ABC latex after formation of the ABC latex to the dry weight of all dispersion enhancement compounds added to the ABC latex during formation of the ABC latex may be, for example, zero; or 0.02 or higher; or 0.05 or higher; or 0.2 or higher; or 0.1 or higher. Independently, the ratio of the dry weight of all dispersion enhancement compounds added to the ABC latex after formation of the ABC latex to the dry weight of all dispersion enhancement compounds added to the ABC latex during formation of the ABC latex may be, for example, 2 or lower; or 1 or lower; or 0.5 or lower; or 0.25 or lower.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0065">Independently, forming the composition of the present invention may, for example, involve mixing an ABC latex with one or more of the following: one or more polynitroso compound, one or more anti-corrosion pigment, clay, carbon black, manganese dioxide, amine, or any mixture of some or all thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0066">In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention does not contain any significant amount (as defined herein above) of any polyisocyanate. A polyisocyanate is a compound having two or more isocyanate groups. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention does not contain any significant amount of any isocyanate compound. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention does not contain any polyisocyanate. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention does not contain any isocyanate compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0067">In some embodiments, the waterborne adhesive composition of the present invention is used to bond two or more substrates together. For example, a layer of the waterborne adhesive composition may be applied to a first substrate. In some embodiments, the layer of adhesive composition may optionally be dried before the layer of adhesive composition is brought into contact with any additional substrate. In some embodiments, at least one additional substrate is brought into contact with the layer of adhesive composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, a first substrate is used that as metal. One suitable metal is steel. In some of such embodiments, a layer of waterborne adhesive composition is applied to the metal and then dried, optionally at temperature above 25Â° C. In some embodiments, a layer of an uncured rubber formulation (including green rubber, crosslinking chemicals, and, optionally, other ingredients) is then applied to the layer of (optionally dried) adhesive composition. The article thus formed, in some embodiments, is then heated above 125Â° C. to cure the rubber formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0069">In some embodiments, a layer of waterborne adhesive composition is applied to a metal substrate and dried. Among such embodiments, a primer may or may not be applied to the metal and dried, and then the layer of the waterborne adhesive of the present invention is applied to the layer of primer. Independently of whether a primer is used, in some embodiments involving a metal substrate, the metal substrate and the dried adhesive composition are prebaked (i.e., heated to the temperature that is appropriate for curing a particular rubber formulation). Then, after the metal substrate and the dried adhesive composition are held at that temperature for a time, a layer of that particular uncured rubber formulation is applied to the layer of dried adhesive formulation, and the article thus formed is held at that temperature for a time sufficient to cure the rubber formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0070">It is to be understood that for purposes of the present specification and claims that the range and ratio limits recited herein can be combined. For example, if ranges of 60 to 120 and 80 to 110 are recited for a particular parameter, it is understood that the ranges of 60 to 110 and 80 to 120 are also contemplated. As a further, independent, example, if a particular parameter is disclosed to have suitable minima of 1, 2, and 3, and if that parameter is disclosed to have suitable maxima of 9 and 10, then all the following ranges are contemplated: 1 to 9, 1 to 10, 2 to 9, 2 to 10, 3 to 9, and 3 to 10.</p>

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0072">a. BPDCD (40% by weight solution in Xylene) was charged into the vessel to be used to make emulsion, and the agitator was started</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0073">b. With agitation, solid CSM polymer and compatibilizing polymer (in solid or liquid form, not in solution) were added and mixed at room temperature until all polymers were dissolved</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0074">c. Agitation was increased to maximum for the equipment used (If Cowles mixer was used, agitation was above 3500 rpm; if a mixer emulsifier or a rotor stator was used, agitation was above 5000 rpm; no different effects were observed from using different equipment) Surfactants and colloidal stabilizing materials (the first 4 ingredients in the above list) were added to polymer solution, allowing any solid surfactants to dissolve before proceeding to next material.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0075">d. Once all surfactants were charged and the solution was homogeneous, water was added slowly so that it was added over 60-70 minutes. Once the inversion point was reached, the water addition rate was increased. The inversion point is the point where the viscosity of the emulsion has reached a maximum with a consistency of a thick paste, and additional water, when added rapidly, reduces the viscosity. This is the point at which the emulsion goes from a water in oil emulsion to a oil in water emulsion.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0076">e. Once all of the water was added, the batch was transferred to a stripping vessel, and the batch was then heated to 70-80Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0077">f. Once batch reached the desired temperature, the pressure in the vessel was reduced to remove solvent.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0000">Note: for emulsion 1B-C, the CSM and CPE were charged to the solvent and allowed to dissolve, and the process proceeded as described above.</p>

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0079">Adhesive formulations were tested using the tensile button test (âbuttonâ herein) (ASTM D-429A), the 90-degree peel test (âpeelâ herein) (ASTM D-429B), and the prebake test (also ASTM D-429B). For the 90-degree peel test and the tensile button test, steel bars were cleaned and grit blasted, then primed with Robondâ¢ TR-100 (Rohm and Haas Co.), then coated with adhesive formulation by spray to thickness of 0.0102 mm to 0.0152 mm (0.0004 inch to 0.0006 inch). The adhesive layer was dried at 70Â° C. for 10 minutes. Then a rubber layer was applied and cured as follows:</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0080">Sample 2A and Comparative Sample 2C-C are similar except that Comparative Sample 2C-C used typical CSM and CPE emulsion found in currently-known waterborne adhesives. Both of these two samples contained manganese dioxide. When these two samples are compared, 2A always has better peel and button results, and 2A usually has better prebake results. It is noted that Sample 2A was not compared to a hypothetical sample containing polymer (a), polymer (b), and no compatibilizer, because such a hypothetical sample is not viable in normal usage because of its poor shelf stability. Thus, Sample 2A is compared with Sample 2C-C, which contains typical CSM and CPE emulsion that is known for use in waterborne adhesives. Sample 2C-C is contemplated to represent the closest adhesive composition to Sample 2A from among previously-known compositions that are viable in normal usage. The results show that Sample 2A gave improved performance, demonstrating that polymer (a) and polymer (b) can be combined to give the benefits of both, without losing shelf stability, as shown in greater detail below.</p>

Both of these samples were made without manganese dioxide. The comparison between Sample 2B and Sample 2D-C is the same type of comparison that was made between Samples 2A and 2C-C, as discussed above. When these two samples are compared, 2B always had better peel and button results, and 2B usually had better prebake results.</p>

After solvent was removed, each latex was filtered, and the amount of coagulum on the filter was noted as percent weight based on the total weight of the latex (?? or is it solids weight?). The amounts of coagulum were as follows: </p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0083">Latex 4A: less than 5%</p>

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0000">Both latexes were stored at room temperature (20Â° C. to 25Â° C.). Each latex was tested at the time the samples were made and then at various times after that. The latexes were inspected visually to determine whether the latex remained continuous (i.e., whether coagulum had formed) after mixing, since the emulsion will form two phases over time. Also, each latex was subjected during the inspection to mechanical mixing with axial flow impeller of 3.81 cm (1.5 inch) diameter at 120 revolutions per minute, and it was noted whether or not coagulum accumulated on the mixer. Latex was characterized as âokâ if no coagulum accumulated on the mixer and the latex was homogeneous. <br /> Results were as follows: </p>
