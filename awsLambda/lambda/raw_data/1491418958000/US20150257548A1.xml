      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to refrigeration systems, and more particularly to a refrigeration system including a low charge hydrocarbon refrigerant circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Refrigeration systems are used to condition merchandisers and other areas that require conditioned air (e.g., storage rooms, etc.) kept within a predetermined temperature range. Some existing systems use refrigerants such as R404a, R134a, or R744. In some instances, a hydrocarbon refrigerant (e.g., propane) is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">For systems using a hydrocarbon refrigerant, the EPA requires that each refrigeration circuit have no more than 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant to minimize the likelihood that leaked refrigerant will ignite and cause adverse conditions in the area surrounding the merchandiser. To meet this requirement, existing systems using hydrocarbon refrigerant have several (i.e. two or more) hydrocarbon refrigerant loops, each with no more than 150 grams refrigerant charge, that are arranged in parallel with each other to cooperatively condition the area needing to be cooled.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The invention provides a modular, ultra-low charge refrigeration system that uses a hydrocarbon refrigerant (e.g., propane).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one construction, the invention provides a refrigeration system including a first circuit with a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, and a pump fluidly connected in series with the first heat exchanger and the second heat exchanger to circulate a coolant within the first circuit. The refrigeration system also includes a second circuit that circulates a hydrocarbon refrigerant in heat exchange relationship with the coolant in the first circuit within the second heat exchanger to cool the refrigerant. The second circuit includes a compressor, the second heat exchanger, and a refrigerated merchandiser, which defines a product support area. An evaporator is fluidly connected in series with the compressor and the second heat exchanger and positioned to condition the entire product support area within a predetermined temperature threshold at or below approximately 41 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In another construction, the invention provides a refrigeration system including a first circuit that has a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, and a pump fluidly connected to the first heat exchanger and the second heat exchanger to circulate a first coolant within the first circuit. The refrigeration system also includes a second circuit that circulates a fluid and a refrigerated merchandiser defining a product support area. An evaporator is in communication with the product support area to condition the area within a predetermined temperature range. The refrigeration system also includes a third circuit including the second heat exchanger, a chiller unit, and a compressor fluidly connected to the second heat exchanger and the chiller unit to circulate a hydrocarbon refrigerant in heat exchange relationship with the first coolant. Heat from the hydrocarbon refrigerant is absorbed by the first coolant within the second heat exchanger. The chiller unit is positioned in communication with the second circuit such that heat from the fluid is transferred to the hydrocarbon refrigerant in the chiller unit. The third circuit defines a micro-chiller refrigerant loop having a refrigerant charge not exceeding approximately 150 grams of refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another construction, the invention provides a first circuit including a refrigerated merchandiser defining a product support area and having an evaporator to maintain the product support area within a predetermined temperature range. The first circuit further includes a chiller unit and a pump fluidly connected to the evaporator and the chiller unit to circulate a coolant within the first circuit. The refrigeration unit also includes a second circuit including a condenser, the chiller unit, and a compressor circulating a hydrocarbon refrigerant through the second circuit and in heat exchange relationship with the coolant within the chiller unit to extract heat from the coolant. Hydrocarbon refrigerant within the condenser is in heat exchange relationship with a fluid to discharge heat from the hydrocarbon refrigerant to the fluid, and the refrigerant charge of the second circuit does not exceed approximately 150 grams of hydrocarbon refrigerant.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another exemplary refrigerated merchandiser <b>10</b>â² that may be located in a supermarket or a convenience store or other retail setting (not shown). Similar to the merchandiser <b>10</b> discussed above with respect to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the merchandiser <b>10</b>â² includes a case <b>15</b>â² that has a base <b>20</b>â², side walls <b>25</b>â², a case top or canopy <b>30</b>â², and a rear wall <b>35</b>â². The area partially enclosed by the base <b>20</b>â², the side walls <b>25</b>â², the canopy <b>30</b>â², and the rear wall <b>35</b>â² defines an interior space or product support area <b>40</b>â² that supports food product in the case <b>15</b>â² (e.g., on shelves <b>45</b>â²). The base <b>20</b>â² defines an interior bottom wall <b>75</b> and the canopy <b>30</b>â² defining a first interior top wall <b>80</b>. The area bounded by the interior bottom wall <b>75</b>, the first interior rear wall <b>35</b>â², and the first interior top wall <b>80</b> defines a product support area <b>40</b>â². An open front face allows customers access to the food product stored in the case <b>15</b>â² without opening doors. The food product is stored on one or more shelves <b>45</b>â² in the product support area <b>40</b>â². The illustrated construction shows an upright merchandiser <b>10</b>â², although the merchandiser <b>10</b>â² can be a horizontal merchandiser (e.g., âcoffinâ-style) or another style of merchandiser.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In general, the merchandisers <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>â² can be a low temperature or a medium temperature merchandiser depending on the product supported in the product support areas <b>40</b>, <b>40</b>â².

As shown, the first circuit <b>105</b> is provided with the sub-circuits <b>155</b> and without connection to the second heat exchanger <b>125</b>, and the fourth circuit <b>117</b> is provided with a closed loop between the micro-chiller circuits <b>115</b> and the evaporator <b>220</b> without connection to the fifth circuit <b>118</b>. As described with regard to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the second coolant is in heat exchange relationship with air that conditions the area <b>40</b>, <b>40</b>â², and heated second coolant in the fourth circuit <b>117</b> is rejected to the second refrigerant within the chiller units <b>185</b>. Heat from the second refrigerant is then rejected to the first coolant within the heat exchangers <b>160</b>, and heat from the first coolant is rejected to the surrounding environment within the heat exchanger <b>120</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">By providing discrete, closed loop merchandiser hydrocarbon refrigerant circuits (e.g., circuits <b>110</b>, <b>118</b>) and micro-chiller circuits <b>115</b> that circulate hydrocarbon refrigerant, the amount of refrigerant charge in each circuit can be kept small while still maximizing the efficiencies of hydrocarbon refrigerant. Further, hydrocarbon refrigerant such as propane is implemented in different parts of the refrigeration system <b>100</b>, not just in an intermediate circuit (e.g., in the micro-chiller circuits <b>115</b>) or in a low side circuit (like the second or fifth circuits <b>110</b>, <b>118</b>). In other words, propane or another hydrocarbon refrigerant can be implemented in several discrete refrigerant loops to increase the efficiency of the overall system <b>100</b> and mitigating the potential for flammability risk.</p>
