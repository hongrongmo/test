      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">With the development of flat-panel display technologies, the demand for flat-panel TV is growing. The flat-panel TV is widely used by user in public or at home. It is needed to hang on the wall or stand on a table when the flat-panel TV is used. In order to keep the TV upright, a base seat is needed to support the TV. At present, the base seat to support the TV in the market takes up too much space; when being packed, large capacity is occupied by the base seat. Therefore, it causes inconvenience in the process of packing and transportation. In addition, the base seat of the TV used in the flat-panel display production is usually screwed to a bracket of the base seat, and then the bracket is connected to a display by bolt, thereby keeping the TV upright. However, such way of keeping the TV upright is inconvenient for user to operate, because special tools are required in such way. Furthermore, it is very inconvenient when it needs to disassemble the base seat so as to move the TV.</p>

However, obviously, those embodiments can also be implemented in the case of these specific details changed, replaced, or alternated. The followings, together with accompanying drawings, describe in detail certain embodiments of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 1(</figref>
        <i>a</i>) illustrates a schematic diagram of a first structure member and a second structure member of a supporting base seat in unfolded states according to a first embodiment of the present invention; <figref>FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates a schematic diagram of a first structure member and a second structure member of the supporting base seat in folded states according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The supporting base seat in the embodiment includes a first structure member <b>10</b> and a second structure member <b>20</b>; shapes of the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are symmetrical, and the first structure member <b>10</b> is hinged to the second structure member <b>20</b> in an axial symmetrical mode. A first hinging portion is arranged on a bottom rear side <b>11</b> of the first structure member <b>10</b> and a bottom rear side <b>21</b> of the second structure member <b>20</b>, a second hinging portion is arranged at a top end <b>12</b> of the first structure member <b>10</b> and a top end <b>22</b> of the second structure member <b>20</b>, and the maximum hinged included angle is smaller than 180 degrees. A first clamping hook <b>15</b> extends out of a bottom front side <b>16</b> of the first structure member <b>10</b>, and a second clamping hook <b>25</b> extends out of a bottom front side <b>26</b> of the second structure member <b>20</b>. Based on L-shape structures, the first structure member and the second structure member are designed to be L-shaped; with the axial symmetrical structure formed by the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b>, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> can be folded and unfolded. When the flat-panel display device and the supporting base seat thereof are in use, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are unfolded; since the maximum hinged included angle is smaller than 180 degrees, the unfolded supporting base seat is shown as a triangular cone-shaped frame structure. Thus, the supporting base seat is convenient to be assembled and stability is ensured; in addition, the supporting base seat is capable of keeping upright on a table, and a display panel of the flat-panel display device lies on the supporting base seat. Since the first clamping hook <b>15</b> and the second clamping hook <b>25</b> abut a front end of a frame of the display panel, the display panel can be prevented from sliding off the frame. When the supporting base seat needs to be packed in a box, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are folded, and therefore the flat-panel display device and the supporting base seat thereof are convenient to be disassembled and capable of saving occupied space.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of the first structure member and the second structure member in folded states with a decoration strip according to the first embodiment of the supporting base seat in the present invention. Base on the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>), the supporting base seat also includes a decoration strip <b>30</b>. The decoration strip <b>30</b> is connected between the first clamping hook <b>15</b> and the second clamping hook <b>25</b>. A first clamping groove and a second clamping groove are respectively arranged in two ends of the decoration strip <b>30</b>. The first clamping hook <b>15</b> is clamped in the first clamping groove, and the second clamping hook <b>25</b> is clamped in the second clamping groove. On one hand, the decoration strip <b>30</b> fastens the first structure member <b>10</b> to the second structure member <b>20</b>; the first structure member <b>10</b>, the second structure member <b>20</b>, and the decoration strip <b>30</b> form a triangular cone-shaped frame structure so as to ensure the stability of the whole supporting base seat. On the other hand, when the display panel of the flat-panel display device <b>1</b> is placed on the supporting base seat, the decoration strip <b>30</b> abuts the front side of a bottom frame of the display panel, thereby effectively preventing the display panel from sliding off. Furthermore, to further prevent the decoration strip <b>30</b> from disengaging from the first clamping hook <b>15</b> and the second clamping hook <b>25</b>, a first spring clamping column is arranged at the first clamping groove, and a second spring clamping column is arranged at the second clamping groove. A third clamping groove is arranged at a side of the first clamping hook <b>15</b> corresponding to the first spring clamping column, and the first spring clamping column extends into the third clamping groove when the first clamping hook <b>15</b> is clamped in the first clamping groove. A forth clamping groove is arranged at a side of the second clamping hook <b>25</b> corresponding to the second spring clamping column, and the second spring clamping column extends into the forth clamping groove when the second clamping hook <b>25</b> is clamped in the second clamping groove.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an explosive view of the first structure member and the second structure member of the supporting base seat according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The L-shaped first structure member <b>10</b> has an acute angle formed between the two arms of the first structure member, and the L-shaped second structure member <b>20</b> has also an acute angle formed between the two arms of the second structure member, and the angle formed between the two arms of the second structure member is equal to the angle formed between the two arms of the first structure member.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The first hinging portion includes a door pivot <b>41</b>, a first lantern ring <b>13</b> arranged on the bottom rear side of the first structure member <b>10</b>, and a third lantern ring <b>23</b> arranged on the bottom rear side of the second structure member <b>20</b>. The third lantern ring <b>23</b> engages with the first lantern ring <b>13</b>, and the door pivot <b>41</b> extends through the first lantern ring <b>13</b> and the third lantern ring <b>23</b>. The door pivot <b>41</b> is an elastic mechanism to ensure that there is some elasticity when the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are unfolded or folded and that the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are not easily returned to their original positions. Furthermore, a first gasket <b>42</b> is arranged between the first lantern ring <b>13</b> and the third lantern ring <b>23</b> for separating the first lantern ring <b>13</b> from the third lantern ring <b>23</b>, for example, when the first lantern ring <b>13</b> and the third lantern ring <b>23</b> are metal parts such as aluminum parts, the gasket <b>42</b> can prevent wearing caused by the friction between the first lantern ring <b>13</b> and the third lantern ring <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The second hinging portion includes a screw <b>43</b>, a second lantern ring <b>14</b> arranged on the top end <b>12</b> of the first structure member <b>10</b>, and a forth lantern ring <b>24</b> arranged on the top end <b>22</b> of the second structure member <b>20</b>. The forth lantern ring <b>24</b> engages with the second lantern ring <b>14</b>. Threads are formed on the inner surface of the second lantern ring <b>14</b>, and the screw <b>43</b> is screwed to the threads of the second lantern ring <b>14</b> to form an integral rotor. One part of the screw thread <b>43</b> extending out of the second lantern ring <b>14</b> passes through the forth lantern ring <b>24</b> to be in clearance fit with the forth lantern ring <b>24</b>. In this way, the forth lantern ring <b>24</b> acts as a rotatable spin axis. According to the embodiment, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> can be unfolded or folded by the hinged structure between the rotor and the spin axis. When the flat-panel display device and the supporting base seat thereof are in use, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are unfolded, forming the triangular cone-shaped frame structure, thus, the supporting base seat thereof are convenient to be assembled and the stability is ensured. When the supporting base seat needs to be packed in a box, the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are folded, and therefore the flat-panel display device and the supporting base seat thereof are convenient to be disassembled and capable of saving occupied space. Furthermore, a second gasket <b>44</b> is arranged between the second lantern ring <b>14</b> and the forth lantern ring <b>24</b> for separating the second lantern ring <b>14</b> from the forth lantern ring <b>24</b>, for example, when the second lantern ring <b>14</b> and the forth lantern ring <b>24</b> are metal parts such as aluminum parts, the second gasket <b>44</b> can prevent the wearing caused by the friction between the second lantern ring <b>14</b> and the forth lantern ring <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Magnets <b>50</b> are respectively arranged on the top end <b>12</b> of the first structure member <b>10</b> and the top end <b>22</b> of the second structure member <b>20</b>. A metal back shell of the display panel in the flat-panel display device can be attracted by magnets <b>50</b> so as to strengthen the stability of the display panel in the flat-panel display device on the supporting base seat, and to further prevent the display panel from sliding off.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A first clamping hole and a first rubber cushion <b>61</b> being in interference fit with the first clamping hole are respectively arranged at a bottom part of the first structure member <b>10</b> and a bottom part of the second structure member <b>20</b>, which can prevent the supporting base seat from sliding on the table. At the same time, the first rubber cushion <b>61</b> is an elastic element, the external diameter of the first rubber cushion <b>61</b> is bigger than the internal diameter of the first clamping hole, thus, the first rubber cushion <b>61</b> is in interference fit with the first clamping hole to prevent the first rubber cushion <b>61</b> from easily sliding from the first clamping hole. A second clamping hole <b>62</b> and a second rubber cushion <b>63</b> being in interference fit with the second clamping hole <b>62</b> are respectively arranged on the first clamping hook <b>15</b> and the second clamping hook <b>25</b>. When the supporting base seat includes a decoration strip, the second clamping hole <b>62</b> and the second rubber cushion <b>63</b> are respectively located at the rear sides of the decoration strips of the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b>. When the display panel in flat-panel display device is placed on the supporting base seat, the bottom part of the display panel is located above the second rubber cushion <b>63</b>, preventing the display panel sliding off.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a first structure member and a second structure member of the supporting base seat in unfolded states according to a second embodiment of the supporting base seat. The difference between the present embodiment and the first embodiment is: the first structure member <b>10</b> and the second structure member <b>20</b> are respectively triangular plate-shaped structures. It can still realize that the supporting base seat when folded is convenient to be assembled and is stably placed. When the supporting base seat needs to be packed in a box, the supporting base seat thereof is convenient to be disassembled and capable of saving occupied space.
