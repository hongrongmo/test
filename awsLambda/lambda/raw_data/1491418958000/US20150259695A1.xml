      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates generally to compositions and methods for manipulation of gene expression. Certain embodiments comprise methods for suppression of gene expression by targeting the regulatory region associated with that gene. The associated regulatory region may be native or heterologous. Certain embodiments provide constructs or methods for generating sterile progeny plants by combining gametes of fertile parent plants. Certain embodiments provide methods for making, propagating, and employing such plants and their progeny. Certain embodiments regulate expression by use of promoters from two or more species.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Plant breeding provides a means to combine desirable traits in a single plant variety or hybrid, including for example, disease resistance, insect resistance, drought tolerance, improved yield and better agronomic quality. Field crops generally are bred by pollination, including by self-pollination (selfing; selfed), in which pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant or to a genetically identical plant; and cross-pollination (crossing; crossed), in which pollen from one plant is transferred to a flower of a genetically different plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Plants that are selfed and selected for type over many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny. A cross between two different homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that can be heterozygous at many gene loci. A cross of two plants, each of which is heterozygous at a number of gene loci, generates plants which differ genetically and are not uniform. Selfing of hybrid plants produces progeny (F2) that generally exhibit less desirable characteristics than the F1 hybrid plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Many crop plants, including, for example, maize (corn), can be bred using self-pollination or cross-pollination techniques. Maize has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs in maize when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the ears. Many crop plants, including maize, are grown as hybrids, which generally exhibit greater vigor than the parental plants from which they are derived. As such, it is desirable to prevent random pollination when generating hybrid plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Hybrid plants (F1) are generated by crossing two different inbred male (P1) and female (P2) parental plants. Hybrid plants are valued because they can display improved yield and vigor as compared to the parental plants from which the hybrids are derived. In addition, hybrid (F1) plants generally have more desirable properties than progeny (F2) plants derived from the hybrid plants. As such, hybrid plants are commercially important, and include many agricultural crops, including, for example, wheat, maize, rice, tomatoes, and melons. Hybridization of maize has received particular focus since the 1930s. The production of hybrid maize involves the development of homozygous inbred male and female lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses for improved agronomic performance. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection are two of the breeding methods used to develop inbred lines from populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more inbred lines, or various broad-based sources, into breeding pools from which new inbred lines are developed by selfing and selecting for desired phenotypes. These new inbreds are crossed with other inbred lines and the resultant new hybrids are evaluated to determine which have improved performance or other desirable traits, thus increasing commercial value. The first generation hybrid progeny, designated F<sub>1</sub>, is more vigorous than its inbred parents. This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, can be manifested in many ways, including increased vegetative growth and increased seed yield.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Production of hybrid seed requires maintenance of the parental seed stocks. Because the parental plants generally have less commercial value than the hybrids (F1), efforts have been made to prevent parental plants in a seed-production field from self-crossing (“selfing”), since such crosses would reduce the yield of hybrid seed. Accordingly, methods have been developed to selfing of a parental plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">One method for controlling pollination is to use a parental population of plants that are male sterile, thus providing the female parent. Several methods have been used for controlling male fertility, including, for example, manual or mechanical emasculation (detasseling), cytoplasmic male sterility, genetic male sterility, and the use of gametocides. For example, parental selfing in a field can be prevented by removing the anthers or detasseling plants of the female parental (P2) population, thus removing the source of P2 pollen from the field. P2 female plants then can be pollinated with P1 pollen by hand or using mechanical means. Hybrid maize seed generally is produced by a male sterility system incorporating manual or mechanical detasseling. Alternate strips of two maize inbreds are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (P2 female). Provided that the field is sufficiently isolated from sources of foreign maize pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred are fertilized only by pollen from the other inbred (P1 male); resulting seed is hybrid and forms hybrid plants. Unfortunately, this method is time- and labor-intensive. In addition, environmental variation in plant development can result in plants producing tassels after manual detasseling of the female parent is completed. Therefore detasseling might not ensure complete male sterility of a female inbred plant. In this case, the resultant fertile female plants will successfully shed pollen and some female plants will be self-pollinated. This will result in seed of the female inbred being harvested along with the desired hybrid seed. Female inbred seed is not as productive as F<sub>1 </sub>seed. In addition, the presence of female inbred seed can represent a germplasm security risk for the company producing the hybrid. The female inbred can also be mechanically detasseled. Mechanical detasseling is approximately as reliable as hand detasseling, but is faster and less costly. However, most detasseling machines produce more damage to the plants than hand detasseling, which reduces F<sub>1 </sub>seed yields. Thus neither form of detasseling is presently entirely satisfactory, and a need continues to exist for alternative hybrid production methods that reduce production costs, increase production safety, and eliminate self-pollination of the female parent during the production of hybrid seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another method of preventing parental plant selfing is to utilize parental plants that are male sterile or female sterile. Male fertility genes have been identified in a number of plants and include dominant and recessive male fertility genes. Plants that are homozygous for a recessive male fertility gene do not produce viable pollen and are useful as female parental plants. However, a result of the female plants being homozygous recessive for a male fertility gene is that they are not capable of selfing and, therefore, a means must be provided for obtaining pollen in order to maintain the parental P2 plant line. Generally, a maintainer cell line, which is heterozygous for the male fertility gene, is generated by crossing a homozygous dominant male fertile plant with the homozygous recessive female sterile plant. The heterozygous maintainer plants then are crossed with the homozygous recessive male sterile plants to produce a population in which 50% of the progeny are male sterile. The male sterile plants are then selected for use in generating hybrids. As such, the method requires additional breeding and selection steps to obtain the male sterile plants, thus adding to the time and cost required to produce the hybrid plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">To overcome the requirement of having to select male sterile from male fertile plants generated by crossing a maintainer plant line with a female (male sterile) plant line, methods have been developed to obtain male sterile plants by expressing a cytotoxic molecule in cells of the male reproductive organs of a plant. For example, a nucleic acid encoding the cytotoxic molecule can be linked to a tapetum-specific promoter and introduced into plant cells, such that, upon expression, the toxic molecule kills anther cells, rendering the plant male sterile. As above, however, such female parental plants cannot be selfed and, therefore, require the preparation and use of a maintainer plant line, which, when crossed with the male sterile female parent restores fertility, for example, by providing a dominant male fertility gene, or by providing a means to inhibit the activity of the cytotoxic gene product (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,433).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Additional methods of conferring genetic male sterility have been described including, for example, generating plants with multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219) or with chromosomal translocations (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511). Another method of conferring genetic male sterility includes identifying a gene that is required for male fertility; silencing the endogenous gene, generating a transgene comprising an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding sequence of the male fertility gene, and inserting the transgene back into the plant, thus generating a plant that is male sterile in the absence of the inducing agent, and can be restored to male fertile by exposing the plant to the inducing agent (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">While the previously described methods of obtaining and maintaining hybrid plant lines have been useful for plant breeding and agricultural purposes, they require numerous steps and/or additional lines for maintaining male sterile or female sterile plant populations in order to obtain the hybrid plants. Such requirements contribute to increased costs for growing the hybrid plants and, consequently, increased costs to consumers. Thus, a need exists for convenient and effective methods of producing hybrid plants, and particularly for generating parental lines that can be crossed to obtain hybrid plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A reliable system of genetic male sterility would provide a number of advantages over other systems. The laborious detasseling process can be avoided in some genotypes by using cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) inbreds. In the absence of a fertility restorer gene, plants of a CMS inbred are male sterile as a result of cytoplasmic (non-nuclear) genome factors. Thus, this CMS characteristic is inherited exclusively through the female parent in maize plants, since only the female provides cytoplasm to the fertilized seed. CMS plants are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile. Pollen from the second inbred may or may not contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile. Usually seed from detasseled normal maize and CMS-produced seed of the same hybrid must be blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown and to insure cytoplasmic diversity.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Another type of genetic sterility is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar, et al. However, this form of genetic male sterility requires maintenance of multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome and requires a complex marker system to track the genes, making this system inconvenient. Patterson described a genetic system of chromosomal translocations, which can be effective, but is also very complex. (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511).</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Many other attempts have been made to address the drawbacks of existing sterility systems. For example, Fabijanski, et al., developed several methods of causing male sterility in plants (see, EPO 89/3010153.8 Publication Number 329,308 and PCT Application Number PCT/CA90/00037 published as WO 1990/08828). One method includes delivering into the plant a gene encoding a cytotoxic substance that is expressed using a male tissue specific promoter. Another involves an antisense system in which a gene critical to fertility is identified and an antisense construct to the gene inserted in the plant. Mariani, et al., also shows several cytotoxic antisense systems. See, EP 89/401, 194. Still other systems use “repressor” genes that inhibit the expression of other genes critical to male fertility. See, WO 1990/08829.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">A still further improvement of this system is one described at U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,369 in which a method of imparting controllable male sterility is achieved by silencing a gene native to the plant that is critical for male fertility and further introducing a functional copy of the male fertility gene under the control of an inducible promoter which controls expression of the gene. The plant is thus constitutively sterile, becoming fertile only when the promoter is induced, allowing for expression of the male fertility gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In a number of circumstances, a particular plant trait is expressed by maintenance of a homozygous recessive condition. Difficulties arise in maintaining the homozygous condition when a transgenic restoration gene must be used for maintenance. For example, the MS45 gene in maize (U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,369) has been shown to be critical to male fertility. Plants heterozygous or hemizygous for the dominant MS45 allele are fully fertile due to the sporophytic nature of the MS45 fertility trait. A natural mutation in the MS45 gene, designated ms45, imparts a male sterility phenotype to plants when this mutant allele is in the homozygous state. This sterility can be reversed (i.e., fertility restored) when the non-mutant form of the gene is introduced into the plant, either through normal crossing or transgenic complementation methods. However, restoration of fertility by crossing removes the desired homozygous recessive condition, and both methods restore full male fertility and prevent maintenance of pure male sterile maternal lines. The same concerns arise when controlling female fertility of the plant, where a homozygous recessive female must be maintained by crossing with a plant containing a restoration gene. Therefore there is considerable value not only in controlling the expression of restoration genes in a genetic recessive line, but also in controlling the transmission of the restoring genes to progeny during the hybrid production process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The present invention provides methods for regulating expression of a gene by use of pIR (promoter inverted repeat) constructs. Plants are designed which comprise part of a pair or set of constructs which, when combined, result in downregulation of a gene by targeting the promoter associated with such gene. The promoter may be heterologous to the downregulated gene. Combination may occur by crossing such plants. In certain embodiments, the parental phenotype is not present in the progeny. In certain embodiments, the phenotype is related to fertility, such as male sterility or female sterility. For example, fertile plants may be crossed to produce progeny which comprise suppressed male fertility genes; these progeny can be useful as females in hybrid seed production. In other examples, genes or constructs which act as dominant suppressors of fertility can be regulated using the methods of the invention, so as to restore fertility.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A targeted promoter may be operably linked to, for example, a male fertility gene or a female fertility gene. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to a breeding pair of plants, wherein the plants comprising the breeding pair are fertile (e.g., each plant is both male fertile and female fertile), and wherein sterile progeny (e.g., each progeny plant is male sterile and female fertile) are produced by crossing the breeding pair of plants. A breeding pair of plants of the invention can include, for example, a first plant comprising a pIR targeting a first portion of a promoter sequence, and a second plant comprising a pIR targeting a second portion of that promoter sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A fertility gene can be inactivated due, for example, to expression of a gene product such as a transgene product (e.g., an RNA or an encoded polypeptide) in cells of the plant in which the gene normally is expressed, or in progenitor cells, wherein the gene product reduces or inhibits expression of the fertility gene. The fertility gene, which may be endogenous or heterologous, can be inactivated due to expression of a transgene product (e.g., a hairpin RNA comprising a nucleotide sequence of the promoter of the fertility gene). The notation “pIR” indicates promoter inverted repeat and may be used interchangeably with the notation “hpRNA” for promoter hp RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In certain embodiments, in a breeding pair of plants, a pIR in Plant 1 targets a portion of Promoter 1; however, the pIR of Plant 1 is not sufficient to suppress expression of the gene operably linked to Promoter 1. In Plant 2, a pIR targets additional or alternative portions of Promoter 1; however, the pIR of Plant 2 is not sufficient to suppress expression of the gene operably linked to Promoter 1. Plant 1 and Plant 2 are crossed to produce progeny which exhibit suppression of the gene (or genes) operably linked to Promoter 1. Without being limited to any theory, this result may occur because expression of both pIRs in the progeny produces a population of siRNAs sufficient to comprise the entire sequence of the targeted promoter, or nearly the entire sequence, such that expression of the gene operably linked to that promoter is suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In certain embodiments, in an exogenous nucleic acid molecule contained in a first or second transgenic plant of a breeding pair of plants of the invention, the nucleotide sequence encoding the first or second hpRNA, respectively, is such that it includes the sequence of the promoter of the fertility gene that is to be inactivated, particularly an inverted repeat of the promoter sequence such that, upon expression, self-hybridization of the RNA results in formation of the hpRNA. As such, the nucleotide sequence, when expressed in a cell, forms a hairpin RNA molecule (i.e., an hpRNA), which may be involved in inactivating (i.e., reducing or inhibiting) expression of an endogenous fertility gene operably linked to its endogenous promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">A promoter operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a pIR can be any promoter that is active in plant cells, for example, a constitutively active promoter, (e.g., a ubiquitin promoter), a tissue-specific or tissue-preferred promoter, particularly a reproductive tissue promoter (e.g., an anther-specific or anther-preferred promoter, which may be a tapetum-specific or tapetum-preferred promoter), an inducible promoter, or a developmental- or stage-specific or developmental- or stage-preferred promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A promoter may be selected based, for example, on whether endogenous fertility genes to be inactivated are male fertility genes or female fertility genes. Thus, where endogenous male fertility genes (e.g., a BS7 gene and an SB200 gene) are to be inactivated, the promoter can be a stamen specific and/or pollen specific promoter such as an MS45 gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,523), a 5126 gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,851), a BS7 gene promoter (WO 2002/063021), an SB200 gene promoter (WO 2002/26789), a TA29 gene promoter (<i>Nature </i>347:737 (1990)), a PG47 gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,412,085; U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,546; <i>Plant J </i>3(2):261-271 (1993)), an SGB6 gene promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,359) a G9 gene promoter (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,850; 5,589,610), or the like, such that the pIR is expressed in anther and/or pollen or in tissues that give rise to anther cells and/or pollen, thereby reducing or inhibiting expression of the endogenous male fertility genes (i.e., inactivating the endogenous male fertility genes). In comparison, where the endogenous genes to be inactivated are female fertility genes, the promoter can be an ovary specific promoter, for example. However, as disclosed herein, any promoter can be used that directs expression of the pIR in the reproductive tissue of interest, including, for example, a constitutively active promoter such as a ubiquitin promoter, which generally effects transcription in most or all plant cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The present invention also provides cells of a first plant or of a second plant or of both a first plant and a second plant of a breeding pair of plants of the invention. In addition, seeds of the first plant and/or second plant are provided, as are cuttings of the first and/or second plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The present invention further relates to a transgenic non-human organism that is homozygous recessive for a recessive genotype, wherein the transgenic organism contains an expressible first exogenous nucleic acid molecule comprising a first promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide encoding a restorer gene, the expression of which restores the phenotype that is otherwise absent due to the homozygous recessive genotype, and a second exogenous nucleic acid molecule encoding a pIR. The transgenic non-human organism can be any non-human organism that has a diploid (or greater) genome, including, for example, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians or plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In one embodiment, the second expressible exogenous nucleic acid molecule of a transgenic plant of the invention encodes pIR specific for the first promoter, which drives expression of the restorer gene. In one aspect of this embodiment, the second expressible exogenous nucleic acid molecule further comprises a second promoter operably linked to the nucleotide sequence encoding the pIR. The second promoter generally is different from the first promoter (of the first expressible exogenous nucleic acid molecule), and can be, for example, a constitutive promoter, an inducible promoter, a tissue specific promoter or a developmental stage specific promoter, such that the pIR can be expressed in the transgenic organism in a constitutive manner, an inducible manner, a tissue specific manner, or at a particular stage of development. A second plant will contain a pIR also targeting the first promoter. Combination of the pIRs, such as by crossing the first and second plants, results in suppression of expression of the gene operably linked to the first promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a sterile plant. Such a method can be performed by crossing a breeding pair of plants as disclosed herein. The method may be performed using first and second parental plants, each containing a pIR targeting the promoter operably linked to a fertility gene in each of the parental plants, wherein the parental plants are fertile and the progeny plants produced by crossing the parental plants are sterile.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a fertile plant, as described elsewhere herein.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Embodiments of the invention include methods of suppressing expression of a gene by targeting the promoter operably linked, natively or heterologously, to that gene. The promoter is targeted by means of two or more pIR constructs. Expression of an individual pIR construct of the invention does not result in suppression of expression of the target gene. When the two or more pIR constructs are expressed in combination, suppression of the target gene results.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In some embodiments, the present invention is exemplified with respect to plant fertility, and more particularly with respect to plant male fertility. For example, plants may be genetically modified to contain a transgene construct encoding a pIR molecule targeting a promoter operably linked to an endogenous male fertility gene. In certain embodiments, plants are modified to contain a transgene construct encoding a pIR molecule targeting a promoter comprised within a dominant-male-sterility construct; thus the pIR molecule may be used to reverse the dominant male sterility, restoring male fertility.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Many crop plants, including rice, wheat, maize, tomatoes and melons, are grown as hybrids, which exhibit greater vigor and improved qualities as compared to the parental plants. The development of hybrids in a plant breeding program requires, in general, the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods are used to develop inbred lines from breeding populations. For example, maize plant breeding programs combine the genetic backgrounds from two or more inbred lines (or various other germplasm sources) into breeding pools, from which new inbred lines are developed by self-pollinating (selfing) and selection of desired phenotypes. The selected inbreds then are crossed with other inbred lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which of those have commercial potential. As such, plant breeding and hybrid development are expensive and time-consuming processes.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking in the other or which complements the other. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population. Using this method, superior plants are selected and selfed in successive generations until homogeneous plant lines are obtained. Recurrent selection breeding such as backcrossing can be used to improve an inbred line and a hybrid can be made using the inbreds. Backcrossing can be used to transfer a specific desirable trait from one inbred or source to a second inbred that lacks that trait, for example, by first crossing a superior inbred (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent) that carries the appropriate gene (or genes) for the trait in question, crossing the progeny of the first cross back to the superior recurrent parent, and selecting in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent. After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the progeny are homozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, and are like the superior parent for essentially all other genes. The last backcross generation is selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene being transferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A single cross hybrid (F1) results from the cross of two inbred lines (P1 and P2), each of which has a genotype that complements the genotype of the other. In the development of commercial hybrids in a maize plant breeding program, for example, only F1 hybrid plants are sought, as they are more vigorous than their inbred parents. This hybrid vigor (heterosis) can be manifested in many polygenic traits such as increased vegetative growth and increased yield. The development of a hybrid in a maize plant breeding program, for example, involves the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and crossing the selected inbred lines with different inbred lines to produce the hybrid F1 progeny. During the inbreeding process in maize, the vigor of the lines decreases, but is restored when two different inbred lines are crossed to produce the hybrid plants. An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the F1 hybrid between a defined pair of inbred parental plants always is the same. As such, once the inbreds that provide a superior hybrid are identified, the hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the inbred parents are maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Hybrid seed production requires elimination of functional pollen production by the female parent. Incomplete elimination of functional pollen production provides the potential for selfing, raising the risk that inadvertently self-pollinated seed will unintentionally be harvested and packaged with hybrid seed. Once the seed is planted, the selfed plants can be identified and selected; the selfed plants are genetically equivalent to the female inbred line used to produce the hybrid. Typically, the selfed plants are identified and selected based on their decreased vigor. For example, female selfed plants of maize are identified by their less vigorous appearance for vegetative and/or reproductive characteristics, including shorter plant height, small ear size, ear and kernel shape, cob color, or other characteristics. Selfed lines also can be identified using molecular marker analyses (see, e.g., Smith and Wych, (1995) <i>Seed Sci. Technol. </i>14:1-8). Using such methods, the homozygosity of the self-pollinated line can be verified by analyzing allelic composition at various loci in the genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Because hybrid plants are important and valuable field crops, plant breeders are continually working to develop high-yielding hybrids that are agronomically sound based on stable inbred lines. The availability of such hybrids allows a maximum amount of crop to be produced with the inputs used, while minimizing susceptibility to pests and environmental stresses. To accomplish this goal, the plant breeder must develop superior inbred parental lines for producing hybrids by identifying and selecting genetically unique individuals that occur in a segregating population. The present invention contributes to this goal, for example by providing plants that, when crossed, generate male sterile progeny, which can be used as female parental plants for generating hybrid plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">A large number of genes have been identified as being tassel preferred in their expression pattern using traditional methods and more recent high-throughput methods. The correlation of function of these genes with important biochemical or developmental processes that ultimately lead to fertile pollen is arduous when approaches are limited to classical forward or reverse genetic mutational analysis. As disclosed herein, suppression approaches in maize provide an alternative rapid means to identify genes that are directly related to pollen development in maize. The well-characterized maize male fertility gene, MS45, and several anther-preferred genes of unknown function were used to evaluate the efficacy of generating male sterility using post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS; see, for example, Kooter, et al., (1999) <i>Trends Plant Sci</i>. 4:340-346) or transcriptional gene silencing (TGS; see, for example, Mette, et al., (2000) <i>EMBO J </i>19:5194-5201) approaches.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">To examine PTGS, hairpin-containing RNAi constructs that have stem structures composed of inverted repeats of the anther-expressed cDNA sequences, and a loop containing either a non-homologous coding sequence or a spliceable intron from maize, were introduced into maize.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">To examine TGS as an approach to knock out anther gene function, a second set of constructs was generated in which the promoters of the anther-specific gene sequences formed the stem and a non-homologous sequence formed the loop. The constructs were expressed using constitutive promoters and anther-preferred promoters.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Contrasting fertility phenotypes were observed, depending on the type of hairpin construct expressed. Plants expressing the PTGS constructs were male fertile. In contrast, plants expressing the TGS constructs were male sterile, and lacked MS45 mRNA and protein. Further, the sterility phenotype of the plants containing the hpRNA specific for the MS45 promoter (i.e., the TGS constructs) was reversed when MS45 was expressed from heterologous promoters in these plants. These results demonstrate that TGS provides a tool for rapidly correlating gene expression with function of unknown genes such as anther-expressed monocot genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Some embodiments of the invention provide breeding pairs of plants, wherein the plants comprising the breeding pair are fertile (e.g., male fertile and female fertile), and wherein progeny produced by crossing the breeding pair of plants are sterile (e.g., male sterile).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As used herein, the term “endogenous”, when used in reference to a gene, means a gene that is normally present in the genome of cells of a specified organism, and is present in its normal state in the cells (i.e., present in the genome in the state in which it normally is present in nature). The term “exogenous” is used herein to refer to any material that is introduced into a cell. The term “exogenous nucleic acid molecule” or “transgene” refers to any nucleic acid molecule that either is not normally present in a cell genome or is introduced into a cell. Such exogenous nucleic acid molecules generally are recombinant nucleic acid molecules, which are generated using recombinant DNA methods as disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art. In various embodiments, a transgenic non-human organism as disclosed herein, can contain, for example, a first transgene and a second transgene. Such first and second transgenes can be introduced into a cell, for example, a progenitor cell of a transgenic organism, either as individual nucleic acid molecules or as a single unit (e.g., contained in different vectors or contained in a single vector, respectively). In either case, confirmation may be made that a cell from which the transgenic organism is to be derived contains both of the transgenes using routine and well-known methods such as expression of marker genes or nucleic acid hybridization or PCR analysis. Alternatively, or additionally, confirmation of the presence of transgenes may occur later, for example, after regeneration of a plant from a putatively transformed cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The term “inactivate” is used broadly herein to refer to any manipulation of a gene, or a cell containing the gene, such that the function mediated by a product of the gene is reduced or inhibited. It should further be recognized that, regardless of whether expression of the inactivated gene is reduced or is inhibited (i.e. completely abolished), the desired relevant phenotype is maintained. As such, reference to an inactivated male fertility gene in a parental plant defined as having a male fertile phenotype can include, for example, a male fertility gene that is expressed at a level that is lower than normal, but sufficient to maintain fertility of the parental plant, or a male fertility gene that is inhibited, and wherein fertility of the parental plant is maintained due to expression of a second gene product.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Mutation of a gene that results in suppression of the gene function can be effected, for example, by deleting or inserting one or a few nucleotides into the nucleotide sequence of the gene (e.g., into the promoter, coding sequence, or intron), by substituting one or a few nucleotides in the gene with other different nucleotides, or by knocking out the gene (e.g., by homologous recombination using an appropriate targeting vector). Plants having such mutations in both alleles can be obtained, for example, using crossing methods as disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art. Inactivation of a gene that results in suppression of the gene function also can be effected by introduction into cells of the plant of (1) a transgene that reduces or inhibits expression of the gene or a product expressed from the gene (e.g., an encoded polypeptide or RNA), or (2) a transgene that encodes a product (e.g., an RNA or polypeptide) that reduces or inhibits expression of the gene or a product encoded by the gene in cells of the plant in which the gene normally is expressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">By way of example, inactivation of fertility genes can be effected by expressing hairpin RNA molecules (hpRNA) in cells of the reproductive organs of a plant (e.g., stamen cells where the fertility genes to be inactivated are male fertility genes). The stamen, which comprises the male reproductive organ of plants, includes various cell types, including, for example, the filament, anther, tapetum, and pollen. The hpRNAs useful for purposes of the present invention are designed to include inverted repeats of a promoter of the gene to be inactivated; hpRNAs having the ability to suppress expression of a gene have been described (see, e.g., Matzke, et al., (2001) <i>Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel</i>. 11:221-227; Scheid, et al., (2002) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>99:13659-13662; Waterhouse and Helliwell (2003) <i>Nature Reviews Genetics </i>4:29-38; Aufsaftz, et al., (2002) <i>Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci</i>. 99(4):16499-16506; Sijen, et al., (2001) <i>Curr. Biol</i>. 11:436-440). As disclosed herein, the use of stamen-specific or stamen-preferred promoters, including anther-specific promoters, pollen-specific promoters, tapetum-specific promoters, and the like, allows for expression of hpRNAs in plants (particularly in male reproductive cells of the plant), wherein the hpRNA reduces or inhibits expression of a fertility gene, thereby inactivating the fertility gene. As such, an hpRNA specific for a promoter that directs expression of a fertility gene may be used to inactivate a fertility gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The terms “first”, “second”, “third” and “fourth” are used herein only to clarify relationships of various cells and molecules or to distinguish different types of a molecule, and, unless specifically indicated otherwise, are not intended to indicate any particular order, importance, or quantitative feature. For example, and unless specifically indicated otherwise, reference to a “first” plant containing a “first endogenous gene” is intended to indicate only that the specified gene is present in the specified plant. By way of a second example, and unless specifically indicated otherwise, reference to a “first plant containing a first transgene and a second transgene” is intended to indicate only that said plant contains two exogenous nucleic acid molecules that are different from each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As used herein, the term “nucleic acid molecule” or “polynucleotide” or “nucleotide sequence” refers broadly to a sequence of two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides that are linked together by a phosphodiester bond. As such, the terms include RNA and DNA, which can be a gene or a portion thereof, a cDNA, a synthetic polydeoxyribonucleic acid sequence, or the like, and can be single-stranded or double-stranded, as well as a DNA/RNA hybrid. Furthermore, the terms are used herein to include naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecules, which can be isolated from a cell, as well as synthetic molecules, which can be prepared, for example, by methods of chemical synthesis or by enzymatic methods such as by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The term “recombinant” is used herein to refer to a nucleic acid molecule that is manipulated outside of a cell, including two or more linked heterologous nucleotide sequences. The term “heterologous” is used herein to refer to nucleotide sequence that are not normally linked in nature or, if linked, are linked in a different manner than that disclosed. For example, reference to a transgene comprising a coding sequence operably linked to a heterologous promoter means that the promoter is one that does not normally direct expression of the nucleotide sequence in a specified cell in nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In general, the nucleotides comprising an exogenous nucleic acid molecule (transgene) are naturally occurring deoxyribonucleotides, such as adenine, cytosine, guanine or thymine linked to 2′-deoxyribose, or ribonucleotides such as adenine, cytosine, guanine or uracil linked to ribose. However, a nucleic acid molecule or nucleotide sequence also can contain nucleotide analogs, including non-naturally-occurring synthetic nucleotides or modified naturally-occurring nucleotides. Such nucleotide analogs are well known in the art and commercially available, as are polynucleotides containing such nucleotide analogs (Lin, et al., (1994) <i>Nucl. Acids Res</i>. 22:5220-5234; Jellinek, et al., (1995) <i>Biochemistry </i>34:11363-11372; Pagratis, et al., (1997) <i>Nature Biotechnol</i>. 15:68-73). Similarly, the covalent bond linking the nucleotides of a nucleotide sequence generally is a phosphodiester bond, but also can be, for example, a thiodiester bond, a phosphorothioate bond, a peptide-like bond or any other bond known to those in the art as useful for linking nucleotides to produce synthetic polynucleotides (see, for example, Tam, et al., (1994) <i>Nucl. Acids Res</i>. 22:977-986; Ecker and Crooke, (1995) <i>BioTechnology </i>13:351360). The incorporation of non-naturally occurring nucleotide analogs or bonds linking the nucleotides or analogs can be particularly useful where the nucleic acid molecule is to be exposed to an environment that can contain a nucleolytic activity, including, for example, a plant tissue culture medium or in a plant cell, since the modified molecules can be less susceptible to degradation.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">A nucleotide sequence containing naturally-occurring nucleotides and phosphodiester bonds can be chemically synthesized or can be produced using recombinant DNA methods, using an appropriate polynucleotide as a template. In comparison, a nucleotide sequence containing nucleotide analogs or covalent bonds other than phosphodiester bonds generally is chemically synthesized, although an enzyme such as T7 polymerase can incorporate certain types of nucleotide analogs into a polynucleotide and, therefore, can be used to produce such a polynucleotide recombinantly from an appropriate template (Jellinek, et al., supra, 1995).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">An exogenous nucleic acid molecule can comprise operably linked nucleotide sequences such as a promoter operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding an hpRNA, or a promoter linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding a male fertility gene product. The term “operably linked” is used herein to refer to two or more molecules that, when joined together, generate a molecule that shares features characteristic of each of the individual molecules. For example, when used in reference to a promoter (or other regulatory element) and a second nucleotide sequence encoding a gene product, the term “operably linked” means that the regulatory element is positioned with respect to the second nucleotide sequence such that transcription or translation of the isolated nucleotide sequence is under the influence of the regulatory element. A coding region and its native promoter are operably linked. A heterologous promoter can be operably linked to a coding region. When used in reference to a fusion protein comprising a first polypeptide and one or more additional polypeptides, the term “operably linked” means that each polypeptide component of the fusion (chimeric) protein exhibits some or all of a function that is characteristic of the polypeptide component (e.g., a cell compartment localization domain and a enzymatic activity). In another example, two operably linked nucleotide sequences, each of which encodes a polypeptide, can be such that the coding sequences are in frame and, therefore, upon transcription and translation, result in production of two polypeptides, which can be two separate polypeptides or a fusion protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Where an exogenous nucleic acid molecule includes a promoter operably linked to a nucleotide sequence encoding an RNA or polypeptide of interest, the exogenous nucleic acid molecule can be referred to as an expressible exogenous nucleic acid molecule (or transgene). The term “expressible” is used herein because, while such a nucleotide sequence can be expressed from the promoter, it need not necessarily actually be expressed at a particular point in time. For example, where a promoter of an expressible transgene is an inducible promoter lacking basal activity, an operably linked nucleotide sequence encoding an RNA or polypeptide of interest is expressed only following exposure to an appropriate inducing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Transcriptional promoters generally act in a position- and orientation-dependent manner, and usually are positioned at or within about five nucleotides to about fifty nucleotides 5′ (upstream) of the start site of transcription of a gene in nature. In comparison, enhancers can act in a relatively position- or orientation-independent manner, and can be positioned several hundred or thousand nucleotides upstream or downstream from a transcription start site, or in an intron within the coding region of a gene, yet still be operably linked to the coding region so as to enhance transcription. The relative positions and orientations of various regulatory elements in addition to a promoter, including the positioning of a transcribed regulatory sequence such as an internal ribosome entry site, or a translated regulatory element such as a cell compartmentalization domain in an appropriate reading frame, are well known, and methods for operably linking such elements are routine in the art (see, for example, Sambrook, et al., “Molecular Cloning: A laboratory manual” (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989); Ausubel, et al., “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” (John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore Md. 1987 and supplements through 1995)).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Promoters useful for expressing a nucleic acid molecule of interest can be any of a range of naturally-occurring promoters known to be operative in plants or animals, as desired. Promoters that direct expression in cells of male or female reproductive organs of a plant are useful for generating a transgenic plant or breeding pair of plants of the invention. The promoters useful in the present invention can include constitutive promoters, which generally are active in most or all tissues of a plant; inducible promoters, which generally exhibit a low basal level of expression or no expression, and can be induced to a relatively high activity upon contact of cells with an appropriate inducing agent; tissue-specific (or tissue-preferred) promoters, which generally are expressed in only one or a few particular cell types (e.g., plant anther cells) and developmental- or stage-specific promoters, which are active only during a defined period during the growth or development of a plant. Often promoters can be modified, if necessary, to vary the expression level. Certain embodiments comprise promoters exogenous to the species being manipulated. For example, the Ms45 gene introduced into ms45ms45 maize germplasm may be driven by a promoter isolated from another plant species; a hairpin construct may then be designed to target the exogenous plant promoter, reducing the possibility of hairpin interaction with non-target, endogenous maize promoters.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">An inducible regulatory element is one that is capable of directly or indirectly activating transcription of one or more DNA sequences or genes in response to an inducer. The inducer can be a chemical agent such as a protein, metabolite, growth regulator, herbicide or phenolic compound; or a physiological stress, such as that imposed directly by heat, cold, salt or toxic elements, or indirectly through the action of a pathogen or disease agent such as a virus; or other biological or physical agent or environmental condition. A plant cell containing an inducible regulatory element may be exposed to an inducer by externally applying the inducer to the cell or plant such as by spraying, watering, heating or similar methods. An inducing agent useful for inducing expression from an inducible promoter is selected based on the particular inducible regulatory element. In response to exposure to an inducing agent, transcription from the inducible regulatory element generally is initiated de novo or is increased above a basal or constitutive level of expression. Typically the protein factor that binds specifically to an inducible regulatory element to initiate or increase transcription is present in a non-active form which is then directly or indirectly converted to the active form by the inducer. Any inducible promoter can be used in the instant invention (See, Ward, et al., (1993) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 22: 361-366).</p>

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">An exogenous nucleic acid molecule can be introduced into a cell as a naked DNA molecule, can be incorporated in a matrix such as a liposome or a particle such as a viral particle, or can be incorporated into a vector. Incorporation of the polynucleotide into a vector can facilitate manipulation of the polynucleotide, or introduction of the polynucleotide into a plant cell. Accordingly, the vector can be derived from a plasmid or can be a viral vector such as a T-DNA vector (Horsch, et al., (1985) <i>Science </i>227:1229-1231). If desired, the vector can include components of a plant transposable element, for example, a Ds transposon (Bancroft and Dean, (1993) <i>Genetics </i>134:1221-1229) or an Spm transposon (Aarts, et al., (1995) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>. 247:555-564). In addition to containing the transgene of interest, the vector also can contain various nucleotide sequences that facilitate, for example, rescue of the vector from a transformed plant cell; passage of the vector in a host cell, which can be a plant, animal, bacterial, or insect host cell; or expression of an encoding nucleotide sequence in the vector, including all or a portion of a rescued coding region. As such, a vector can contain any of a number of additional transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and inducible promoters, enhancers, and the like (see, for example, Bitter, et al., (1987) <i>Meth. Enzymol</i>. 153:516-544). For example, a vector can contain elements useful for passage, growth or expression in a bacterial system, including a bacterial origin of replication; a promoter, which can be an inducible promoter; and the like. A vector also can contain one or more restriction endonuclease recognition and cleavage sites, including, for example, a polylinker sequence, to facilitate insertion or removal of a transgene.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In addition to, or alternatively to, a nucleotide sequence relevant to a fertility gene (e.g., an hpRNA comprising an inverted repeat of a fertility gene promoter, or a coding sequence of a fertility gene, alone or operably linked to a heterologous promoter), an exogenous nucleic acid molecule, or a vector containing such a transgene, can contain one or more other expressible nucleotide sequences encoding an RNA or a polypeptide of interest. For example, the additional nucleotide sequence can encode an antisense nucleic acid molecule; an enzyme such as β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, glutathione α-transferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, guanine xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase and neomycin phosphotransferase; a viral polypeptide or a peptide portion thereof; or a plant growth factor or hormone.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In certain embodiments, the expression vector contains a gene encoding a selection marker which is functionally linked to a promoter that controls transcription initiation. For a general description of plant expression vectors and reporter genes, see, Gruber, et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in <i>Methods of Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology </i>89-119 (CRC Press, 1993). In using the term, it is meant to include all types of selection markers, whether scorable or selective. Expression of such a nucleotide sequence can provide a means for selecting for a cell containing the construct, for example, by conferring a desirable phenotype to a plant cell containing the nucleotide sequence. For example, the additional nucleotide sequence can be, or encode, a selectable marker, which, when present or expressed in a plant cell, provides a means to identify the plant cell containing the marker.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">A selectable marker provides a means for screening a population of organisms or cells of an organism (e.g., plants or plant cells) to identify those having the marker and, therefore, the transgene of interest. A selectable marker generally confers a selective advantage to the cell, or to an organism (e.g., a plant) containing the cell, for example, the ability to grow in the presence of a negative selective agent such as an antibiotic or, for a plant, an herbicide. A selective advantage also can be due, for example, to an enhanced or novel capacity to utilize an added compound as a nutrient, growth factor or energy source. A selective advantage can be conferred by a single polynucleotide, or its expression product, or by a combination of polynucleotides whose expression in a plant cell gives the cell a positive selective advantage, a negative selective advantage, or both. It should be recognized that expression of the transgene of interest (e.g., encoding a hpRNA) also provides a means to select cells containing the encoding nucleotide sequence. However, the use of an additional selectable marker, which, for example, allows a plant cell to survive under otherwise toxic conditions, provides a means to enrich for transformed plant cells containing the desired transgene. Examples of suitable scorable or selection genes known in the art can be found in, for example, Jefferson, et al., (1991) in <i>Plant Molecular Biology Manual</i>, ed. Gelvin, et al., (Kluwer Academic Publishers), pp. 1-33; DeWet, et al., (1987) <i>Mol. Cell.

Biol</i>. 16:807-820); neomycin phosphotransferase, which confers resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin, kanamycin and paromycin (Herrera-Estrella, (1983) <i>EMBO J</i>. 2:987-995) and hygro, which confers resistance to hygromycin (Marsh, (1984) <i>Gene </i>32:481-485; see also, Waldron, et al., (1985) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 5:103-108; Zhijian, et al., (1995) <i>Plant Science </i>108:219-227); trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan; hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine (Hartman, (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>85:8047); mannose-6-phosphate isomerase which allows cells to utilize mannose (WO 1994/20627); ornithine decarboxylase, which confers resistance to the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, 2-(difluoromethyl)-DL-ornithine (DFMO; McConlogue, 1987, In: Current Communications in Molecular Biology, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory ed.) and deaminase from <i>Aspergillus terreus</i>, which confers resistance to Blasticidin S (Tamura, (1995) <i>Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. </i>59:2336-2338). Additional selectable markers include, for example, a mutant EPSPV-synthase, which confers glyphosate resistance (Hinchee, et al., (1998) <i>BioTechnology </i>91:915-922), a mutant acetolactate synthase, which confers imidazolinone or sulfonylurea resistance (Lee, et al., (1988) <i>EMBO J</i>. 7:1241-1248), a mutant psbA, which confers resistance to atrazine (Smeda, et al., (1993) <i>Plant Physiol</i>. 103:911-917) or a mutant protoporphyrinogen oxidase (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,373) or other markers conferring resistance to an herbicide such as glufosinate. Examples of suitable selectable marker genes include, but are not limited to, genes encoding resistance to chloramphenicol (Herrera Estrella, et al., (1983) <i>EMBO J</i>. 2:987-992); streptomycin (Jones, et al., (1987) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>. 210:86-91); spectinomycin (Bretagne-Sagnard, et al., (1996) <i>Transgenic Res</i>. 5:131-137); bleomycin (Hille, et al., (1990) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 7:171-176); sulfonamide (Guerineau, et al., (1990) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 15:127-136); bromoxynil (Stalker, et al., (1988) <i>Science </i>242:419-423); glyphosate (Shaw, et al., (1986) <i>Science </i>233:478-481); phosphinothricin (DeBlock, et al., <i>EMBO J</i>. (1987) 6:2513-2518), and the like. One option for use of a selective gene is a glufosinate-resistance encoding DNA and in one embodiment can be the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (“PAT”), maize optimized PAT gene or bar gene under the control of the CaMV 35S or ubiquitin promoters. The genes confer resistance to bialaphos. See, Gordon-Kamm, et al., (1990) <i>Plant Cell </i>2:603; Uchimiya, et al., (1993) <i>BioTechnology </i>11:835; White, et al., (1990) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>18:1062; Spencer, et al., (1990) <i>Theor. Appl. Genet</i>. 79:625-631 and Anzai, et al., (1989) <i>Mol. Gen. Gen</i>. 219:492). A version of the PAT gene is the maize optimized PAT gene, described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,096,947.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In addition, markers that facilitate identification of a plant cell containing the polynucleotide encoding the marker include, for example, luciferase (Giacomin, (1996) <i>Plant Sci</i>. 116:59-72; Scikantha, (1996) <i>J. Bacteriol</i>. 178:121), green fluorescent protein (Gerdes, (1996) <i>FEBS Lett</i>. 389:44-47; Chalfie, et al., (1994) Science 263:802) and other fluorescent protein variants, or β-glucuronidase (Jefferson, (1987) <i>Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. </i>5:387; Jefferson, et al., (1987) <i>EMBO J</i>. 6:3901-3907; Jefferson, (1989) <i>Nature </i>342(6251):837-838); the maize genes regulating pigment production (Ludwig, et al., (1990) <i>Science </i>247:449; Grotewold, et al., (1991) <i>PNAS </i>88:4587-4591; Cocciolone, et al., (2001) <i>Plant J </i>27(5):467-478; Grotewold, et al., (1998) <i>Plant Cell </i>10:721-740); β-galactosidase (Teeri, et al., (1989) <i>EMBO J</i>. 8:343-350); luciferase (Ow, et al., (11986) <i>Science </i>234:856-859); chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (Lindsey and Jones, (1987) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 10:43-52) and numerous others as disclosed herein or otherwise known in the art. Such markers also can be used as reporter molecules. Many variations on promoters, selectable markers and other components of the construct are available to one skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The term “plant” is used broadly herein to include any plant at any stage of development, or to part of a plant, including a plant cutting, a plant cell, a plant cell culture, a plant organ, a plant seed, and a plantlet. A plant cell is the structural and physiological unit of the plant, comprising a protoplast and a cell wall. A plant cell can be in the form of an isolated single cell or aggregate of cells such as a friable callus, or a cultured cell, or can be part of a higher organized unit, for example, a plant tissue, plant organ or plant. Thus, a plant cell can be a protoplast, a gamete producing cell, or a cell or collection of cells that can regenerate into a whole plant. As such, a seed, which comprises multiple plant cells and is capable of regenerating into a whole plant, is considered a plant cell for purposes of this disclosure. A plant tissue or plant organ can be a seed, protoplast, callus or any other groups of plant cells that is organized into a structural or functional unit. Particularly useful parts of a plant include harvestable parts and parts useful for propagation of progeny plants. A harvestable part of a plant can be any useful part of a plant, for example, flowers, pollen, seedlings, tubers, leaves, stems, fruit, seeds, roots and the like. A part of a plant useful for propagation includes, for example, seeds, fruits, cuttings, seedlings, tubers, rootstocks and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">A transgenic plant can be regenerated from a genetically modified plant cell, i.e., a whole plant can be regenerated from a plant cell; a group of plant cells; a protoplast; a seed or a piece of a plant such as a leaf, a cotyledon or a cutting. Regeneration from protoplasts varies among species of plants. For example, a suspension of protoplasts can be made and, in certain species, embryo formation can be induced from the protoplast suspension, to the stage of ripening and germination. The culture media generally contain various components necessary for growth and regeneration, including, for example, hormones such as auxins and cytokinins; and amino acids such as glutamic acid and proline, depending on the particular plant species. Efficient regeneration will depend, in part, on the medium, the genotype, and the history of the culture, and is reproducible if these variables are controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Regeneration can occur from plant callus, explants, organs or plant parts. Transformation can be performed in the context of organ or plant part regeneration. (see, <i>Meth. Enzymol</i>. Vol. 118; Klee, et al., (1987) <i>Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol</i>. 38:467). Utilizing the leaf disk-transformation-regeneration method, for example, disks are cultured on selective media, followed by shoot formation in about two to four weeks (see, Horsch, et al., supra, 1985). Shoots that develop are excised from calli and transplanted to appropriate root-inducing selective medium. Rooted plantlets are transplanted to soil as soon as possible after roots appear. The plantlets can be repotted as required, until reaching maturity. This is the T0 generation.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In seed-propagated crops, mature T0 plants can be self-pollinated. The resulting seeds can be grown and the progeny plants tested for presence of the transgene, often by screening for the expression of a linked marker gene. These transgenic plants represent the T1 generation. Multiple generations (T2, T3, etc.) may be produced to ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited, and seeds can be harvested. In this manner, the present invention provides a transformed seed (also referred to as a “transgenic seed”) having a polynucleotide of the invention, for example, an expression cassette of the invention, stably incorporated into its genome. Methods for further selfing, selection, and cross breeding of plants having desirable characteristics or other characteristics of interest include those disclosed herein and others well known to plant breeders. Progeny, variants, and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the invention, provided that they comprise the introduced polynucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In various aspects of the present invention, one or more transgenes is introduced into cells. When used in reference to a transgene, the term “introducing” means transferring the exogenous nucleic acid molecule into a cell. A nucleic acid molecule can be introduced into a plant cell by a variety of methods. For example, the transgene can be contained in a vector, can be introduced into a plant cell using a direct gene transfer method such as electroporation or microprojectile mediated transformation, or using <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation. As used herein, the term “transformed” refers to a plant cell containing an exogenously introduced nucleic acid molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">One or more exogenous nucleic acid molecules can be introduced into plant cells using any of numerous well-known and routine methods for plant transformation, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols (see, e.g., Miki, et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants”; In Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick and Thompson, Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88). In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are routine and well-known (see, e.g., Gruber, et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation”; Id. at pages 89-119).</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Suitable methods of transforming plant cells include microinjection, Crossway, et al., (1986) <i>Biotechniques </i>4:320-334; electroporation, Riggs, et al., (1986) <i>Proc.

      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">
        <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation provides a useful method for introducing a transgene into plants (Horsch, et al., (1985) <i>Science </i>227:1229). <i>A. tumefaciens </i>and <i>A. rhizogenes </i>are plant pathogenic soil bacteria that genetically transform plant cells. The Ti and Ri plasmids of <i>A. tumefaciens </i>and <i>A. rhizogenes</i>, respectively, carry genes responsible for genetic transformation of the plant (see, e.g., Kado, (1991) <i>Crit. Rev. Plant Sci</i>.10:1; see, also, Moloney, et al., (1989) <i>Plant Cell </i>Reports 8:238; U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,616; WO 1999/47552; Weissbach and Weissbach, “Methods for Plant Molecular Biology” (Academic Press, NY 1988), section VIII, pages 421-463; Grierson and Corey, “Plant Molecular Biology” 2d Ed. (Blackie, London 1988), Chapters 7-9; see, also, Horsch, et al., supra, 1985).</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">With respect to <i>A. tumefaciens</i>, the wild type form contains a Ti plasmid, which directs production of tumorigenic crown gall growth on host plants. Transfer of the tumor-inducing T-DNA region of the Ti plasmid to a plant genome requires the Ti plasmid-encoded virulence genes as well as T-DNA borders, which are a set of direct DNA repeats that delineate the region to be transferred. An <i>Agrobacterium </i>based vector is a modified form of a Ti plasmid, in which the tumor-inducing functions are replaced by a nucleotide sequence of interest that is to be introduced into the plant host. Methods of using <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation include cocultivation of <i>Agrobacterium </i>with cultured isolated protoplasts; transformation of plant cells or tissues with <i>Agrobacterium</i>; and transformation of seeds, apices or meristems with <i>Agrobacterium</i>. In addition, in planta transformation by <i>Agrobacterium </i>can be performed using vacuum infiltration of a suspension of <i>Agrobacterium </i>cells (Bechtold, et al., (1993) C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 316:1194).</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">
        <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation can employ cointegrate vectors or binary vector systems, in which the components of the Ti plasmid are divided between a helper vector, which resides permanently in the <i>Agrobacterium </i>host and carries the virulence genes, and a shuttle vector, which contains the gene of interest bounded by T-DNA sequences. Binary vectors are well known in the art (see, for example, De Framond, (1983) <i>BioTechnology </i>1:262; Hoekema, et al., (1983) <i>Nature </i>303:179) and are commercially available (Clontech; Palo Alto Calif.). For transformation, <i>Agrobacterium </i>can be cocultured, for example, with plant cells or wounded tissue such as leaf tissue, root explants, hypocotyls, cotyledons, stem pieces or tubers (see, for example, Glick and Thompson, “Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology” (Boca Raton Fla., CRC Press 1993)). Wounded cells within the plant tissue that have been infected by <i>Agrobacterium </i>can develop organs de novo when cultured under the appropriate conditions; the resulting transgenic shoots eventually give rise to transgenic plants which contain the introduced polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">
        <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation has been used to produce a variety of transgenic plants, including, for example, transgenic cruciferous plants such as <i>Arabidopsis</i>, mustard, rapeseed and flax; transgenic leguminous plants such as alfalfa, pea, soybean, trefoil and white clover; and transgenic solanaceous plants such as eggplant, petunia, potato, tobacco and tomato (see, for example, Wang, et al., “Transformation of Plants and Soil Microorganisms” (Cambridge, University Press 1995)). In addition, <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation can be used to introduce an exogenous nucleic acid molecule into apple, aspen, belladonna, black currant, carrot, celery, cotton, cucumber, grape, horseradish, lettuce, morning glory, muskmelon, neem, poplar, strawberry, sugar beet, sunflower, walnut, asparagus, rice, wheat, sorghum, barley, maize, and other plants (see, for example, Glick and Thompson, supra, 1993; Hiei, et al., (1994) <i>Plant J</i>. 6:271-282; Shimamoto, (1995) <i>Science </i>270:1772-1773).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Suitable strains of <i>A. tumefaciens </i>and vectors as well as transformation of Agrobacteria and appropriate growth and selection media are well known in the art (GV3101, pMK9ORK), Koncz, (1986) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>. 204:383-396; (C58C1, pGV3850kan), Deblaere, (1985) <i>Nucl. Acid Res</i>. 13:4777; Bevan, (1984) <i>Nucleic Acid Res</i>. 12:8711; Koncz, (1986) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As noted herein, the present invention provides vectors capable of expressing genes of interest under the control of the regulatory elements. In general, the vectors should be functional in plant cells. At times, it may be preferable to have vectors that are functional in <i>E. coli </i>(e.g., production of protein for raising antibodies, DNA sequence analysis, construction of inserts, obtaining quantities of nucleic acids). Vectors and procedures for cloning and expression in <i>E. coli </i>are discussed in Sambrook, et al. (supra).</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">The transformation vector, comprising the promoter of the present invention operably linked to an isolated nucleotide sequence in an expression cassette, can also contain at least one additional nucleotide sequence for a gene to be co-transformed into the organism. Alternatively, the additional sequence(s) can be provided on another transformation vector.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Where the exogenous nucleic acid molecule is contained in a vector, the vector can contain functional elements, for example “left border” and “right border” sequences of the T-DNA of <i>Agrobacterium</i>, which allow for stable integration into a plant genome. Furthermore, methods and vectors that permit the generation of marker-free transgenic plants, for example, where a selectable marker gene is lost at a certain stage of plant development or plant breeding, are known, and include, for example, methods of co-transformation (Lyznik, (1989) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 13:151-161; Peng, (1995) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 27:91-104), or methods that utilize enzymes capable of promoting homologous recombination in plants (see, e.g., WO 1997/08331; Bayley, (1992) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 18:353-361; Lloyd, (1994) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>. 242:653-657; Maeser, (1991) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>. 230:170-176; Onouchi, (1991) <i>Nucl. Acids Res</i>. 19:6373-6378; see, also, Sambrook, et al., supra, 1989).</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Direct gene transfer methods also can be used to introduce the desired transgene (or transgenes) into cells, including plant cells that are refractory to <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation (see, e.g., Hiei, et al., (1994) <i>Plant J</i>. 6:271-282; U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,616). Such methods include direct gene transfer (see, European Patent A 164 575), injection, electroporation, biolistic methods such as particle bombardment, pollen-mediated transformation, plant RNA virus-mediated transformation, liposome-mediated transformation, transformation using wounded or enzyme-degraded immature embryos, or wounded or enzyme-degraded embryogenic callus, and the like. Direct gene transfer methods include microprojectile-mediated (biolistic) transformation methods, wherein the transgene is carried on the surface of microprojectiles measuring 1 to 4 mm. A vector, particularly an expression vector containing the transgene(s) of interest, is introduced into plant tissues with a biolistic device that accelerates the microprojectiles to speeds of 300 to 600 m/s, sufficient to penetrate plant cell walls and membranes (see, e.g., Sanford, et al., (1987) <i>Part. Sci. Technol</i>. 5:27; Sanford, (1988) <i>Trends Biotech</i>. 6:299, Klein, et al., (1988) <i>BioTechnology </i>6:559-563; Klein, et al., (1992) <i>BioTechnology </i>10:268). In maize, for example, several target tissues can be bombarded with DNA-coated microprojectiles in order to produce transgenic plants, including, for example, callus (Type I or Type II), immature embryos, and meristem tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Other methods for physical delivery of a transgene into plants utilize sonication of the target cells (Zhang, et al., (1991) <i>BioTechnology </i>9:996); liposomes or spheroplast fusion (Deshayes, et al., (1985) <i>EMBO J</i>. 4:2731; Christou, et al., (1987) <i>Proc Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>84:3962); CaCl<sub>2 </sub>precipitation or incubation with polyvinyl alcohol or poly-L-ornithine (Hain, et al., (1985) <i>Mol. Gen. Genet</i>.199:61; Draper, et al., (1982) <i>Plant Cell Physiol. </i>23:451); and electroporation of protoplasts and whole cells and tissues (Donn, et al., (1990) In “Abstracts of VIIIth International Congress on <i>Plant Cell </i>and Tissue Culture” IAPTC, A2-38, pg. 53; D'Halluin, et al., (1992) <i>Plant Cell </i>4:1495-1505; Spencer, et al., (1994) <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 24:51-61).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">A direct gene transfer method such as electroporation can be particularly useful for introducing exogenous nucleic acid molecules into a cell such as a plant cell. For example, plant protoplasts can be electroporated in the presence of a recombinant nucleic acid molecule, which can be in a vector (Fromm, et al., (1985) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>82:5824). Electrical impulses of high field strength reversibly permeabilize membranes allowing the introduction of the nucleic acid. Electroporated plant protoplasts reform the cell wall, divide and form a plant callus. Microinjection can be performed as described in Potrykus and Spangenberg (eds.), Gene Transfer To Plants. Springer Verlag, Berlin, N.Y. (1995). A transformed plant cell containing the introduced recombinant nucleic acid molecule can be identified due to the presence of a selectable marker included in the construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">As mentioned above, microprojectile mediated transformation also provides a useful method for introducing exogenous nucleic acid molecules into a plant cell (Klein, et al., (1987) <i>Nature </i>327:70-73). This method utilizes microprojectiles such as gold or tungsten, which are coated with the desired nucleic acid molecule by precipitation with calcium chloride, spermidine or polyethylene glycol. The microprojectile particles are accelerated at high speed into a plant tissue using a device such as the BIOLISTIC PD-1000 particle gun (BioRad; Hercules Calif.). Microprojectile mediated delivery (“particle bombardment”) is especially useful to transform plant cells that are difficult to transform or regenerate using other methods. Methods for the transformation using biolistic methods are well known (Wan, (1984) <i>Plant Physiol</i>. 104:37-48; Vasil, (1993) <i>BioTechnology </i>11:1553-1558; Christou, (1996) <i>Trends in Plant Science </i>1:423-431). Microprojectile mediated transformation has been used, for example, to generate a variety of transgenic plant species, including cotton, tobacco, corn, wheat, oat, barley, sorghum, rice, hybrid poplar and papaya (see, Glick and Thompson, supra, 1993; Duan, et al., (1996) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>14:494-498; Shimamoto, (1994) <i>Curr. Opin. Biotech. </i>5:158-162).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">A rapid transformation regeneration system for the production of transgenic plants such as a system that produces transgenic wheat in two to three months (see, European Patent Number EP 0709462A2) also can be useful for producing a transgenic plant according to a method of the invention, thus allowing more rapid identification of gene functions. The transformation of most dicotyledonous plants is possible with the methods described above. Transformation of monocotyledonous plants also can be transformed using, for example, biolistic methods as described above, protoplast transformation, electroporation of partially permeabilized cells, introduction of DNA using glass fibers, <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Plastid transformation also can be used to introduce a nucleic acid molecule into a plant cell (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,451,513, 5,545,817 and 5,545,818; WO 1995/16783; McBride, et al., (1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>91:7301-7305). Chloroplast transformation involves introducing regions of cloned plastid DNA flanking a desired nucleotide sequence, for example, a selectable marker together with polynucleotide of interest, into a suitable target tissue, using, for example, a biolistic or protoplast transformation method (e.g., calcium chloride or PEG mediated transformation). One to 1.5 kb flanking regions (“targeting sequences”) facilitate homologous recombination with the plastid genome, and allow the replacement or modification of specific regions of the plastome. Using this method, point mutations in the chloroplast 16S rRNA and rps12 genes, which confer resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin and can be utilized as selectable markers for transformation (Svab, et al., (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>87:8526-8530; Staub and Maliga, (1992) <i>Plant Cell </i>4:39-45), resulted in stable homopiasmic transformants, at a frequency of approximately one per 100 bombardments of target leaves. The presence of cloning sites between these markers allowed creation of a plastid targeting vector for introduction of foreign genes (Staub and Maliga, (1993) <i>EMBO J</i>. 12:601-606). Substantial increases in transformation frequency are obtained by replacement of the recessive rRNA or r-protein antibiotic resistance genes with a dominant selectable marker, the bacterial aadA gene encoding the spectinomycin-detoxifying enzyme aminoglycoside-3′-adenyltransferase (Svab and Maliga, (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA </i>90:913-917). Approximately 15 to 20 cell division cycles following transformation are generally required to reach a homoplastidic state. Plastid expression, in which genes are inserted by homologous recombination into all of the several thousand copies of the circular plastid genome present in each plant cell, takes advantage of the enormous copy number advantage over nuclear-expressed genes to permit expression levels that can readily exceed 10% of the total soluble plant protein.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The cells that have been transformed can be grown into plants in accordance with conventional ways. See, for example, McCormick, et al., (1986) <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>5:81-84. These plants can then be grown and pollinated with the same transformed strain or different strains, and resulting plants having expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic can then be identified. Two or more generations can be grown to ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">A “subject plant” or “subject plant cell” is one in which genetic alteration, such as transformation, has been effected as to a gene of interest, or is a plant or plant cell which is descended from a plant or plant cell so altered and which comprises the alteration. A “control” or “control plant” or “control plant cell” provides a reference point for measuring changes in the subject plant or plant cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">A control plant or control plant cell may comprise, for example: (a) a wild-type plant or plant cell, i.e., of the same genotype as the starting material for the genetic alteration which resulted in the subject plant or subject plant cell; (b) a plant or plant cell of the same genotype as the starting material but which has been transformed with a null construct (i.e. with a construct which has no known effect on the trait of interest, such as a construct comprising a marker gene); (c) a plant or plant cell which is a non-transformed segregant among progeny of a subject plant or subject plant cell; (d) a plant or plant cell genetically identical to the subject plant or subject plant cell but which is not exposed to conditions or stimuli that would induce expression of the gene of interest; or (e) the subject plant or subject plant cell itself, under conditions in which the gene of interest is not expressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In certain species, such as maize, the control and reference plants may represent two hybrids, where the first hybrid is produced from two parent inbred lines, and the second hybrid is produced from the same two parental inbred lines except that one of the parent inbred lines contains a recombinant DNA construct. Performance of the second hybrid would typically be measured relative to the first hybrid.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">Further, where a plant comprising a recombinant DNA construct is assessed or measured relative to a control plant not comprising the recombinant DNA but otherwise having a comparable genetic background to the plant, the control and reference plant may share at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity of nuclear genetic material. There are many laboratory-based techniques available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genetic backgrounds; among these are isozyme electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as microsatellites.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Plants suitable for purposes of the present invention can be monocots or dicots and include, but are not limited to, maize, wheat, barley, rye, sweet potato, bean, pea, chicory, lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, turnip, radish, spinach, asparagus, onion, garlic, pepper, celery, squash, pumpkin, hemp, zucchini, apple, pear, quince, melon, plum, cherry, peach, nectarine, apricot, strawberry, grape, raspberry, blackberry, pineapple, avocado, papaya, mango, banana, soybean, tomato, sorghum, sugarcane, sugar beet, sunflower, rapeseed, clover, tobacco, carrot, cotton, alfalfa, rice, potato, eggplant, cucumber, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, and woody plants such as coniferous and deciduous trees. Thus, a transgenic plant or genetically modified plant cell of the invention can be an angiosperm or gymnosperm.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Angiosperms are divided into two broad classes based on the number of cotyledons, which are seed leaves that generally store or absorb food; a monocotyledonous angiosperm has a single cotyledon, and a dicotyledonous angiosperm has two cotyledons. Angiosperms produce a variety of useful products including materials such as lumber, rubber, and paper; fibers such as cotton and linen; herbs and medicines such as quinine and vinblastine; ornamental flowers such as roses and, where included within the scope of the present invention, orchids; and foodstuffs such as grains, oils, fruits and vegetables. Angiosperms encompass a variety of flowering plants, including, for example, cereal plants, leguminous plants, oilseed plants, hardwood trees, fruit-bearing plants and ornamental flowers, which general classes are not necessarily exclusive. Cereal plants, which produce an edible grain, include, for example, corn, rice, wheat, barley, oat, rye, orchardgrass, guinea grass, and sorghum. Leguminous plants include members of the pea family (Fabaceae) and produce a characteristic fruit known as a legume. Examples of leguminous plants include, for example, soybean, pea, chickpea, moth bean, broad bean, kidney bean, lima bean, lentil, cowpea, dry bean and peanut, as well as alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, clover and sainfoin. Oilseed plants, which have seeds that are useful as a source of oil, include soybean, sunflower, rapeseed (canola) and cottonseed. Angiosperms also include hardwood trees, which are perennial woody plants that generally have a single stem (trunk). Examples of such trees include alder, ash, aspen, basswood (linden), beech, birch, cherry, cottonwood, elm, eucalyptus, hickory, locust, maple, oak, persimmon, poplar, sycamore, walnut, sequoia and willow. Trees are useful, for example, as a source of pulp, paper, structural material and fuel.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed within a mature, ripened ovary. An angiosperm fruit can be suitable for human or animal consumption or for collection of seeds to propagate the species. For example, hops are a member of the mulberry family that are prized for their flavoring in malt liquor. Fruit-bearing angiosperms also include grape, orange, lemon, grapefruit, avocado, date, peach, cherry, olive, plum, coconut, apple and pear trees and blackberry, blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, pineapple, tomato, cucumber and eggplant plants. An ornamental flower is an angiosperm cultivated for its decorative flower. Examples of commercially important ornamental flowers include rose, lily, tulip and chrysanthemum, snapdragon, camellia, carnation and petunia plants, and can include orchids. It will be recognized that the present invention also can be practiced using gymnosperms, which do not produce seeds in a fruit.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Certain embodiments of this invention overcome the problem of maintenance of homozygous recessive reproductive traits when using a transgenic restoration approach, while decreasing the number of plants, plantings and steps needed for maintenance of plants with such traits.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Homozygosity is a genetic condition existing when identical alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes. Heterozygosity is a genetic condition existing when different alleles reside at corresponding loci on homologous chromosomes. Hemizygosity is a genetic condition existing when there is only one copy of a gene (or set of genes) with no allelic counterpart on the sister chromosome.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Maintenance of the homozygous recessive condition for male sterility may be achieved by introducing into a plant a restoration transgene construct that is linked to a sequence which interferes with the formation, function, or dispersal of male gametes of the plant, to create a “maintainer” or “donor” plant. The restoring transgene, upon introduction into a plant that is homozygous recessive for the male sterility genetic trait, restores the genetic function of that trait. Due to the linked gene driven by a male-gamete-specific-promoter, all pollen containing the restoration transgene is rendered nonviable or nonfunctional. All viable, functional pollen produced contains a copy of the recessive allele but does not contain the restoration transgene. The transgene is kept in the hemizygous state in the maintainer plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The pollen from the maintainer can be used to fertilize plants that are homozygous for the recessive trait, and the progeny will therefore retain their homozygous recessive condition. The maintainer plant containing the restoring transgene construct is propagated by self-fertilization, with half of the resulting seed used to produce further plants that are homozygous recessive for the gene of interest and hemizygous for the restoring transgene construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">The maintainer plant serves as a pollen donor to the plant having the homozygous recessive trait. The maintainer is optimally produced from a plant having the homozygous recessive trait and which also has nucleotide sequences introduced therein which would restore the trait created by the homozygous recessive alleles. Further, the restoration sequence is linked to nucleotide sequences that interfere with the function, formation or dispersal of male gametes. The gene can operate to prevent formation of male gametes or prevent function of the male gametes by any of a variety of well-known modalities and is not limited to a particular methodology. By way of example but not limitation, this can include use of one or more genes which express a product cytotoxic to male gametes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,792,853 and 5,689,049; PCT/EP89/00495); inhibit formation of a gene product important to male gamete formation, function, or dispersal (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,341 and 6,297,426); combine with another gene product to produce a substance preventing gamete formation, function, or dispersal (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,162,964; 6,013,859; 6,281,348; 6,399,856; 6,248,935; 6,750,868 and 5,792,853) are antisense to or cause co-suppression of a gene critical to male gamete formation, function, or dispersal (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,184,439; 5,728,926; 6,191,343; 5,728,558 and 5,741,684), or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">Ordinarily, to produce more plants having the recessive condition, one might cross the recessive plant with another recessive plant, or self pollinate a recessive plant. This may not be desirable for some recessive traits and may be impossible for recessive traits affecting reproductive development. Alternatively, one could cross the homozygous plant with a second plant having the restoration gene, but this requires further crossing to segregate away the restoring gene to once again reach the recessive phenotypic state. Instead, in certain embodiments is provided a process in which the homozygous recessive condition can be maintained, while crossing it with the maintainer plant. This method can be used with any situation in which it is desired to continue the recessive condition. This results in a relatively simple, cost-effective system for maintaining a population of homozygous recessive plants. When the homozygous recessive condition is one that produces male sterility, the maintainer plant, of necessity, must contain a functional restoring transgene construct capable of complementing the mutation and rendering the homozygous recessive plant able to produce viable pollen. Linking this male fertility restoration gene with a second functional nucleotide sequence which interferes with the formation, function or dispersal of the male gametes of the plant results in a maintainer plant that produces functional pollen containing only the recessive allele of the restored gene at its native locus due to the pollen-specific action of the second nucleotide sequence. This viable, functional pollen fraction is non-transgenic with regard to the restoring transgene construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">For example, it is desirable to produce male sterile female plants for use in the hybrid production process which are sterile as a result of being homozygous for a mutation in the MS45 gene, a gene which is essential for male fertility. Such a mutant MS45 allele is designated as ms45. A plant that is homozygous for ms45 (represented by the notation ms45/ms45) displays the homozygous recessive male sterility phenotype and produces no functional pollen. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,478,369; 5,850,014; 6,265,640 and 5,824,524. In both the inbred and hybrid production processes, it is highly desired to maintain this homozygous recessive condition. When sequences encoding the MS45 gene are introduced into a plant having the homozygous condition, sporophytic restoration of male fertility results. (Cigan, et al., (2001) <i>Sex. Plant Repro</i>. 14:135-142). By the method of the invention, a plant which is ms45/ms45 homozygous recessive may have introduced into it a functional MS45 gene, and thus male fertility is restored. This gene can be linked to a second gene which operates to render pollen nonfunctional or which prevents its formation, or which produces a lethal product in pollen, or which otherwise interferes with pollen function, and which is linked to a promoter directing its expression in the male gametes. This results in a plant which produces viable, functional pollen containing ms45 without the restoring transgene construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">An example is a construct that includes the MS45 gene operably linked to the 5126 promoter, a male tissue-preferred promoter (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,851) and further linked to the cytotoxic DAM methylase gene under control of the PG47 promoter (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,792,853; 5,689,049). The resulting plant produces pollen, but the only viable, functional pollen produced contains the ms45 gene and not the restoring MS45 allele. The plant can therefore be used as a pollinator to fertilize the homozygous recessive plant (ms45/ms45), and 100% of the progeny produced will continue to be male sterile as a result of maintaining homozygosity for ms45. The progeny will not contain the introduced restoring transgene construct.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Clearly, many variations on this method are available as it relates to male sterility. Any other gene critical to male fertility may be used in this system. For example and without limitation, such genes can include the SBMu200 gene (also known as SB200 or MS26) described at WO 2002/26789; the BS92-7 gene (also known as BS7) described at WO 2002/063021; MS2 gene described at Albertsen and Phillips, (1981) Canadian Journal of Genetics &amp; Cytology 23:195-208 or the <i>Arabadopsis </i>MS2 gene described at Aarts, et al., (1993) <i>Nature</i>, 363:715-717 and the <i>Arabidopsis </i>gene MS1 described at Wilson, et al., (2001) <i>Plant J</i>., 1:27-39.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">A desirable result of the process of the invention is that the plant having the restorer nucleotide sequence may be self-fertilized; that is, pollen from the plant can be transferred to a flower of the same plant to achieve the propagation of restorer plants. (Note that “self fertilization” includes both the situation where the plant producing the pollen is fertilized with that same pollen, and the situation where pollen from a plant, or from a group of genetically identical plants, pollinates a plant which is a genetically identical individual, or a group of such genetically identical plants.) The restoring transgene construct will not be present in the pollen, but it will be contained in 50% of the ovules (the female gamete). The seed resulting from the self-fertilization can be planted, and selection made for the seed having the restoring transgene construct. The selection process can occur by any one or more of many known processes, the most common being where the restoration nucleotide sequence is linked to a marker gene. The marker can be scorable or selectable, and allows identification of the seed comprising the restoration sequence, and/or of those plants produced from the seed having the restoration sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">In an embodiment of the invention, it is possible to provide that the promoter driving the restoration gene is inducible. Additional control is thus allowed in the process, where so desired, by providing that the plant having the restoration nucleotide sequences is constitutively male sterile. This type of male sterility is set forth the in U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,341. In order for the plant to become fertile, the inducing substance or condition must be provided, and the plant will become fertile. Again, when combined with the process of the invention as described supra, all functional pollen produced will lack the restoration nucleotide sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the gamete controlling the transmission of the restoration nucleotide sequences can be the female gamete, instead of the male gamete. The process is the same as that described above, with the exception in those instances where one also desires to maintain the plant having the restoration nucleotide sequences by self fertilization. In that case, it will be useful to provide that the promoter driving the restoration gene is inducible, so that female fertility may be triggered by exposure to the inducing substance or condition, and seed can be formed. Control of female fertility in such a manner is described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,426. Examples of genes impacting female fertility include the teosinte branched1 (Tb1) gene, which increases apical dominance, resulting in multiple tassels and repression of female tissue. Hubbard, et al., (2002) <i>Genetics </i>162:1927-1935; Doebley, et al., (1997) <i>Nature </i>386:485-488. Another example is the so-called “barren 3” or “ba3”. This mutant was isolated from a mutant maize plant infected with wheat-streak mosaic virus and is described at Pan and Peterson, (1992) <i>J. Genet. And Breed</i>. 46:291-294. The plants develop normal tassels but do not have any ear shoots along the stalks. Barren-stalk fastigiate is described at Coe and Beckett, (1987) <i>Maize Genet. Coop. Newslett</i>. 61:46-47. Other examples include the barren stalkl gene (Gallavotti, et al., (2004) <i>Nature </i>432:630-635); lethal ovule mutant (Vollbrecht, (1994) <i>Maize Genetics Cooperation Newsletter </i>68:2-3) and defective pistil mutant (Miku and Mustyatsa, (1978) <i>Genetika </i>14(2):365-368).</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">Any plant-compatible promoter elements can be employed to control expression of the regions of the restoring transgene construct that encode specific proteins and functions. Those can be plant gene promoters, such as, for example, the ubiquitin promoter, the promoter for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase, or promoters from the tumor-inducing plasmids from <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>, such as the nopaline synthase and octopine synthase promoters, or viral promoters such as the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 19S and 35S promoters or the figwort mosaic virus 35S promoter. See, Kay, et al., (1987) <i>Science </i>236:1299 and European Patent Application Number 0 342 926. See, International Application WO 1991/19806 for a review of illustrative plant promoters suitably employed in the present invention. The range of available plant-compatible promoters includes tissue-specific and inducible promoters.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">The invention contemplates the use of promoters providing tissue-preferred expression, including promoters which preferentially express to the gamete tissue, male or female, of the plant. The invention does not require that any particular gamete tissue-preferred promoter be used in the process, and any of the many such promoters known to one skilled in the art may be employed. By way of example, but not limitation, one such promoter is the 5126 promoter, which preferentially directs expression of the gene to which it is linked to male tissue of the plants, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,851 and 5,689,051. Other examples include the MS45 promoter described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,523; SF3 promoter described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,452,069; the BS92-7 or BS7 promoter described at WO 2002/063021; the SBMu200 promoter described at WO 2002/26789; a SGB6 regulatory element described at U.S. Pat. No. 5,470,359, and TA39 (Koltunow, et al., (1990) <i>Plant Cell </i>2:1201-1224; Goldberg, et al., (1993) <i>Plant Cell </i>5:1217-1229 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,856.

      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">A nucleotide sequence operably linked to a regulatory element disclosed herein can be an antisense sequence for a targeted gene. By “antisense DNA nucleotide sequence” is intended a sequence that is in inverse orientation to the 5′-to-3′ normal orientation of that nucleotide sequence. When delivered into a plant cell, expression of the antisense DNA sequence prevents normal expression of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. The antisense nucleotide sequence encodes an RNA transcript that is complementary to and capable of hybridizing with the endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. In this case, production of the native protein encoded by the targeted gene is modulated to achieve a desired phenotypic response. Thus, regulatory sequences disclosed herein can be operably linked to antisense DNA sequences to reduce or inhibit expression of a native or exogenous protein in the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Many nucleotide sequences are known which reduce or inhibit pollen formation or function or dispersal, and any sequences which accomplish this, solely or in combination, will suffice. A discussion of genes which can impact proper development or function is included at U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,856 and includes dominant negative genes such as cytotoxin genes and methylase genes. Dominant negative genes include diphtheria toxin A-chain gene (Czako and An, (1991) <i>Plant Physiol</i>. 95:687-692); cell cycle division mutants such as CDC in maize (Colasanti, et al., (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>88:3377-3381); the WT gene (Farmer, et al., (1994) <i>Hum. Mol. Genet</i>. 3:723-728) and P68 (Chen, et al., (1991) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci</i>. USA 88, 315-319). A suitable gene may also encode a protein involved in inhibiting pistil development, pollen stigma interactions, pollen tube growth or fertilization or a combination thereof. In addition, genes that interfere with the normal accumulation of starch in pollen or affect osmotic balance within pollen may also be suitable. These may include, for example, the maize alpha-amylase gene, maize beta-amylase gene, debranching enzymes such as Sugaryl and pullulanase, glucanase and SacB. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,696,405; 7,875,764; 8,013,218; and 8,614,367.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">In an illustrative embodiment, the DAM-methylase gene, the expression product of which catalyzes methylation of adenine residues in the DNA of the plant, is used. Methylated adenines will not affect cell viability and will be found only in the tissues in which the DAM-methylase gene is expressed, because such methylated residues are not found endogenously in plant DNA. Examples of so-called “cytotoxic” genes are discussed supra and can include, but are not limited to pectate lyase gene pelE, from <i>Erwinia chrysanthermi </i>(Kenn, et al., (1986) <i>J. Bacteriol </i>168:595); diphtheria toxin A-chain gene (Greenfield, et al., (1983) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>80:6853, Palmiter, et al., (1987) <i>Cell </i>50:435); T-urf13 gene from cms-T maize mitochondrial genomes (Braun, et al., (1990) <i>Plant Cell </i>2:153; Dewey, et al., (1987) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>84:5374); CytA toxin gene from <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>Israeliensis that causes cell membrane disruption (McLean, et al., (1987) <i>J. Bacteriol </i>169:1017, U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,006); DNAses, RNAses, (U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,441); proteases, or genes expressing anti-sense RNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Further, the methods of the invention are useful in retaining the homozygous recessive condition of traits other than those impacting plant fertility. The gene of interest which restores the condition would be introduced into a plant linked to a nucleotide sequence which reduces or inhibits the formation, function, or dispersal of pollen and which may be further linked to a male gamete tissue-preferred promoter and a gene encoding a marker, for example a seed-specific marker. Viable, functional pollen produced by the plant into which the construct is introduced contains only the recessive allele of the gene of interest and none of the restoring transgene sequences. Half of the female gametes of the hemizygous transgenic plant contain the transgene and this plant can be self-pollinated, or pollinated by a plant comprising the recessive alleles, such that half of the seeds produced will carry the transgene and can optionally be identified by means of the linked marker. The hemizygous condition can be maintained by self ing the hemizygous plant; half of the offspring will contain the transgene and thus the trait of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">Genes of interest are reflective of the commercial markets and interests of those involved in the development of the crop. Crops and markets of interest change, and as developing nations open up world markets, new crops and technologies will emerge also. In addition, as our understanding of agronomic traits and characteristics such as yield and heterosis increases, the choice of genes for transformation will change accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Regulation of male fertility is necessarily measured in terms of its effect on individual cells. For example, suppression in 99.99% of pollen grains may be required to achieve reliable sterility for commercial use. However, successful suppression or restoration of expression of other traits may be accomplished with lower stringency. Within a particular tissue, for example, expression in 98%, 95%, 90%, 80% or fewer cells may result in the desired phenotype.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">This invention has utility for a variety of genes, not limited to those where affecting reproductive capacity. General categories of genes of interest include, for example, those genes involved in information, such as zinc fingers, those involved in communication, such as kinases, and those involved in housekeeping, such as heat shock proteins. More specific categories of transgenes, for example, include genes encoding important traits for agronomics, plant architecture, developmental timing and initiation of reproductive growth, insect resistance, disease resistance, herbicide resistance, sterility, grain characteristics, and commercial products. Genes of interest include, generally, those involved in oil, starch, carbohydrate, or nutrient metabolism as well as those affecting kernel size, sucrose loading, and the like. Agronomically important traits such as oil, starch and protein content can be genetically altered in addition to using traditional breeding methods. Modifications include increasing content of oleic acid, saturated and unsaturated oils, increasing levels of lysine and sulfur, providing essential amino acids, and also modification of starch. Hordothionin protein modifications are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,703,049, 5,885,801, 5,885,802 and 5,990,389.

No. 5,850,016 and the chymotrypsin inhibitor from barley, described in Williamson, et al., (1987) <i>Eur. J. Biochem. </i>165:99-106. Other important genes encode growth factors and transcription factors.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Agronomic traits can be improved by altering expression of genes that: affect growth and development, especially during environmental stress. These include, for example, genes encoding cytokinin biosynthesis enzymes, such as isopentenyl transferase; genes encoding cytokinin catabolic enzymes, such as cytokinin oxidase; genes encoding polypeptides involved in regulation of the cell cycle, such as CyclinD or cdc25; genes encoding cytokinin receptors or sensors, such as CRE1, CKI1 and CKI2, histidine phospho-transmitters or cytokinin response regulators.</p>

      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) “reference sequence”, (b) “comparison window”, (c) “percentage of sequence identity” and (d) “substantial identity”.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">(a) As used herein, “reference sequence” is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, a segment of a full-length promoter sequence or the complete promoter sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">(b) As used herein, “comparison window” makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence may be compared to a reference sequence and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100 or more contiguous nucleotides in length. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence, a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">(c) As used herein, “percentage of sequence identity” means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">(d) The term “substantial identity” of polynucleotide sequences means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 70% sequence identity, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% and most preferably at least 95%, compared to a reference sequence using one of the alignment programs described using standard parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">Methods of aligning sequences for comparison are well known in the art.

Biol. </i>215:403-410; see also, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) searches under default parameters for identity to sequences contained in the BLAST “GENEMBL” database. A sequence can be analyzed for identity to all publicly available DNA sequences contained in the GENEMBL database using the BLASTN algorithm under the default parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">For purposes of defining the present invention, GAP (Global Alignment Program) is used. GAP uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (<i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>48:443-453, 1970) to find the alignment of two complete sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. Default gap creation penalty values and gap extension penalty values in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Package® (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for protein sequences are 8 and 2, respectively. For nucleotide sequences the default gap creation penalty is 50 while the default gap extension penalty is 3. Percent Similarity is the percent of the symbols that are similar. Symbols that are across from gaps are ignored. A similarity is scored when the scoring matrix value for a pair of symbols is greater than or equal to 0.50, the similarity threshold. The scoring matrix used in Version 10 of the Wisconsin Package® (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) is BLOSUM62 (see, Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:10915).</p>

      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">Sexually reproducing plants develop specialized tissues specific for the production of male and female gametes. Successful production of male gametes relies on proper formation of the male reproductive tissues. The stamen, which embodies the male reproductive organ of plants, contains various cell types, including for example, the filament, anther, tapetum and pollen. As used herein, “male tissue” refers to the specialized tissue in a sexually reproducing plant that is responsible for production of the male gamete. Male tissues include, but are not limited to, the stamen, filament, anther, tapetum and pollen.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">The process of mature pollen grain formation begins with microsporogenesis, wherein meiocytes are formed in the sporogenous tissue of the anther. Microgametogenesis follows, wherein microspores divide mitotically and develop into the microgametophyte or pollen grains. The condition of “male fertility” or “male fertile” refers to those plants producing a mature pollen grain capable of fertilizing a female gamete to produce a subsequent generation of offspring. The term “influences male fertility” or “modulates male fertility”, as used herein, refers to any increase or decrease in the ability of a plant to produce a mature pollen grain when compared to an appropriate control. A “mature pollen grain” or “mature pollen” refers to any pollen grain capable of fertilizing a female gamete to produce a subsequent generation of offspring.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">Likewise, the term “male fertility polynucleotide” or “male fertility polypeptide” refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that modulates male fertility. A male fertility polynucleotide may, for example, encode a polypeptide that participates in the process of microsporogenesis or microgametogenesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Expression of fertility genes has been shown to influence male fertility in a variety of ways.

The SPOROCYTELESS gene of <i>Arabidopsis </i>is required for initiation of sporogenesis and encodes a novel nuclear protein (<i>Genes Dev</i>. (1999) 13(16):2108-17).</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">Ms26 polypeptides have been reported to have significant homology to P450 enzymes found in yeast, plants, and mammals. P450 enzymes have been widely studied and characteristic protein domains have been elucidated. The Ms26 protein contains several structural motifs characteristic of eukaryotic P450's, including the heme-binding domain FxxGxRxCxG (domain D), domain A A/GGXD/ETT/S (dioxygen-binding), domain B (steroid-binding) and domain C. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that Ms26 is most closely related to P450s involved in fatty acid omega-hydroxylation found in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana </i>and <i>Vicia sativa</i>. See, for example, US Patent Application Publication Number 2012/0005792, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">The Ms45 polynucleotide is a male fertility polynucleotide characterized in maize (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,369) and wheat (U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/697,590, filed Sep. 6, 2012). Mutations of Ms45 can result in breakdown of microsporogenesis during vacuolation of the microspores rendering the mutated plants male sterile. When the cloned Ms45 polynucleotide is introduced into such mutated male sterile plants, the gene can complement the mutation and confer male fertility. The cloned Ms45 gene, for example the Ms45 gene of maize or wheat or rice, can also be used to complement male sterility induced by expression of pIR molecule targeting the Ms45 promoter, as described herein. Certain embodiments described herein using the MS45 gene and/or promoter could be practiced with other genes, such as MS26 or Ms22.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">Strategies for manipulation of expression of male-fertility polynucleotides in wheat will require consideration of the ploidy level of the individual wheat variety. <i>Triticum aestivum </i>is a hexaploid containing three genomes designated A, B, and D (N=21); each genome comprises seven pairs of nonhomologous chromosomes. Einkorn wheat varieties are diploids (N=7) and emmer wheat varieties are tetraploids (N=14). Dominant gene suppression strategies may be of particular interest for polyploid species.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid molecules or protein compositions are disclosed herein. An “isolated” or “purified” nucleic acid molecule, polynucleotide or protein, or biologically active portion thereof, is substantially or essentially free from components that normally accompany or interact with the polynucleotide or protein as found in its naturally occurring environment. Thus, an isolated or purified polynucleotide or protein is substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. Optimally, an “isolated” polynucleotide is free of sequences (optimally protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the polynucleotide (i.e., sequences located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the polynucleotide) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the polynucleotide is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated polynucleotide can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequence that naturally flank the polynucleotide in genomic DNA of the cell from which the polynucleotide is derived. A protein that is substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of protein having less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or 1% (by dry weight) of contaminating protein. When the polypeptides disclosed herein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, optimally culture medium represents less than about 30%, 20%, 10%, 5% or 1% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-protein-of-interest chemicals.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">Fragments and variants of the disclosed polynucleotides and proteins encoded thereby are also provided. By “fragment” is intended a portion of the polynucleotide or a portion of the amino acid sequence and hence protein encoded thereby. Fragments of a polynucleotide may encode protein fragments that retain the biological activity of the native protein and hence influence male fertility. Alternatively, fragments of a polynucleotide that are useful as hybridization probes generally do not encode fragment proteins retaining biological activity. Thus, fragments of a nucleotide sequence may range from at least about 20 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides, and up to the full-length polynucleotide encoding the polypeptides disclosed herein. A fragment of a promoter polynucleotide may or may not retain promoter function. A fragment of a promoter polynucleotide may be used to create a pIR (promoter inverted repeat, aka hairpin) useful in a suppression construct which targets that promoter. See, for example, Matzke, et al., (2001) <i>Curr. Opin. Genet. Devel</i>. 11:221-227; Mette, et al., (2000) <i>EMBO J</i>. 19:5194-5201.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">A fragment of a polynucleotide that encodes a biologically active portion of a polypeptide that influences male fertility may encode at least 15, 25, 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 525 or 537 contiguous amino acids, or up to the total number of amino acids present in a full-length polypeptide that influences male fertility. Fragments of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide that influences male fertility that are useful as hybridization probes or PCR primers generally need not encode a biologically active portion of a polypeptide that influences male fertility.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">Thus, a fragment of a male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein may encode a biologically active portion of a male fertility polypeptide or it may be a fragment that can be used as a hybridization probe or PCR primer using methods disclosed below or it may be a fragment of a promoter sequence natively associated with a male fertility polynucleotide. A biologically active portion of a male fertility polypeptide can be prepared by isolating a portion of one of the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein, expressing the encoded portion of the male fertility protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro), and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the male fertility polypeptide. Polynucleotides that are fragments of a male fertility polynucleotide comprise at least 16, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600 or 1629 nucleotides or up to the number of nucleotides present in a full-length male fertility polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">“Variants” is intended to mean substantially similar sequences. For polynucleotides, a variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. As used herein, a “native” or “wild type” polynucleotide or polypeptide comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence, respectively. For polynucleotides, conservative variants include those sequences that, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode the amino acid sequence of one of the male fertility polypeptides disclosed herein. Naturally occurring allelic variants such as these can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined below. Variant polynucleotides also include synthetically derived polynucleotides, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis but which still encode a male fertility polypeptide. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide disclosed herein will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">Variants of a particular polynucleotide disclosed herein (i.e., the reference polynucleotide) can also be evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity between the polypeptide encoded by a variant polynucleotide and the polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Percent sequence identity between any two polypeptides can be calculated using sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">Where any given pair of polynucleotides disclosed herein is evaluated by comparison of the percent sequence identity shared by the two polypeptides they encode, the percent sequence identity between the two encoded polypeptides is at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">“Variant” protein is intended to mean a protein derived from the native protein by deletion or addition of one or more amino acids at one or more internal sites in the native protein and/or substitution of one or more amino acids at one or more sites in the native protein. Variant proteins disclosed herein are biologically active, that is they continue to possess the desired biological activity of the native protein, that is, male fertility activity as described herein. Such variants may result from, for example, genetic polymorphism or from human manipulation. Biologically active variants of a male fertility protein disclosed herein will have at least about 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to the amino acid sequence for the native protein as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. A biologically active variant of a protein disclosed herein may differ from that protein by as few as 1-15 amino acid residues, as few as 1-10, such as 6-10, as few as 5, as few as 4, 3, 2 or even 1 amino acid residue.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">The proteins disclosed herein may be altered in various ways including amino acid substitutions, deletions, truncations, and insertions. Methods for such manipulations are generally known in the art. For example, amino acid sequence variants and fragments of the male fertility polypeptides can be prepared by mutations in the DNA. Methods for mutagenesis and polynucleotide alterations are well known in the art. See, for example, Kunkel, (1985) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:488-492; Kunkel, et al., (1987) <i>Methods in Enzymol</i>. 154:367-382; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,192; Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983) Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York) and the references cited therein. Guidance as to appropriate amino acid substitutions that do not affect biological activity of the protein of interest may be found in the model of Dayhoff, et al., (1978) <i>Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure </i>(Natl. Biomed. Res. Found., Washington, D.C.), herein incorporated by reference. Conservative substitutions, such as exchanging one amino acid with another having similar properties, may be optimal.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">Thus, the genes and polynucleotides disclosed herein include both the naturally occurring sequences as well as DNA sequence variants which retain function. Likewise, the male fertility polypeptides and proteins encompass both naturally occurring polypeptides as well as variations and modified forms thereof. Such polynucleotide and polypeptide variants will continue to possess the desired male fertility activity. The mutations that will be made in the DNA encoding the variant must not place the sequence out of reading frame and optimally will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mRNA structure. See, EP Patent Application Publication Number 75,444.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">The deletions, insertions and substitutions of the protein sequences encompassed herein are not expected to produce radical changes in the characteristics of the protein. However, when it is difficult to predict the exact effect of the substitution, deletion or insertion in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect will be evaluated by routine screening assays. That is, the activity can be evaluated by assaying for male fertility activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">Increases or decreases in male fertility can be assayed in a variety of ways. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily assess activity of the variant or fragment by introducing the polynucleotide into a plant homozygous for a stable male sterile allele of the polynucleotide, and observing male tissue development in the plant. In certain embodiments, the variant or fragment polynucleotide is introduced into a plant which is male-sterile as a result of expression of a polynucleotide which confers dominant male sterility. Such a polynucleotide conferring dominant male sterility may be, for example, a pIR directed to the native promoter of a fertility gene, or a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide which interferes with development of reproductive tissue, such as DAM-methylase or barnase (See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,853 or 5,689,049; PCT/EP89/00495).</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0168">Variant functional polynucleotides and proteins also encompass sequences and proteins derived from a mutagenic and recombinogenic procedure such as DNA shuffling. With such a procedure, one or more different male fertility sequences can be manipulated to create a new male fertility polypeptide possessing the desired properties. In this manner, libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of related sequence polynucleotides comprising sequence regions that have substantial sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. For example, using this approach, sequence motifs encoding a domain of interest may be shuffled between the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein and other known male fertility polynucleotides to obtain a new gene coding for a protein with an improved property of interest, such as an increased K<sub>m </sub>in the case of an enzyme. Strategies for such DNA shuffling are known in the art. See, for example, Stemmer, (1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>91:10747-10751; Stemmer, (1994) <i>Nature </i>370:389-391; Crameri, et al., (1997) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>15:436-438; Moore, et al., (1997) <i>J. Mol. Biol</i>. 272:336-347; Zhang, et al., (1997) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>94:4504-4509; Crameri, et al., (1998) <i>Nature </i>391:288-291 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793 and 5,837,458.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">II. Sequence Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">As used herein, “sequence identity” or “identity” in the context of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have “sequence similarity” or “similarity”. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0170">As used herein, “percentage of sequence identity” means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0171">Unless otherwise stated, sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight of 3, and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and % similarity for an amino acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. By “equivalent program” is intended any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by GAP Version 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0172">The use of the term “polynucleotide” is not intended to limit the present disclosure to polynucleotides comprising DNA. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that polynucleotides, can comprise ribonucleotides and combinations of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Such deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides include both naturally occurring molecules and synthetic analogues. The polynucleotides disclosed herein also encompass all forms of sequences including, but not limited to, single-stranded forms, double-stranded forms, hairpins, stem-and-loop structures, and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">III. Expression Cassettes</heading>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0173">The male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein can be provided in expression cassettes for expression in an organism of interest. The cassette can include 5′ and 3′ regulatory sequences operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein. “Operably linked” is intended to mean a functional linkage between two or more elements. For example, an operable linkage between a polynucleotide of interest and a regulatory sequence (e.g., a promoter) is a functional link that allows for expression of the polynucleotide of interest. Operably linked elements may be contiguous or non-contiguous. When used to refer to the joining of two protein coding regions, by operably linked is intended that the coding regions are in the same reading frame.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0174">The expression cassettes disclosed herein may include in the 5′-3′ direction of transcription, a transcriptional and translational initiation region (i.e., a promoter), a polynucleotide of interest, and a transcriptional and translational termination region (i.e., termination region) functional in the host cell (i.e., the plant). Expression cassettes are also provided with a plurality of restriction sites and/or recombination sites for insertion of the male fertility polynucleotide to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions described elsewhere herein. The regulatory regions (i.e., promoters, transcriptional regulatory regions, and translational termination regions) and/or the polynucleotide of interest may be native/analogous to the host cell or to each other. Alternatively, the regulatory regions and/or the polynucleotide of interest may be heterologous to the host cell or to each other. As used herein, “heterologous” in reference to a polynucleotide or polypeptide sequence is a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous polynucleotide is from a species different from the species from which the polynucleotide was derived, or, if from the same/analogous species, one or both are substantially modified from their original form and/or genomic locus, or the promoter is not the native promoter for the operably linked polynucleotide. As used herein, a chimeric polynucleotide comprises a coding sequence operably linked to a transcription initiation region that is heterologous to the coding sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0175">In certain embodiments the polynucleotides disclosed herein can be stacked with any combination of polynucleotide sequences of interest or expression cassettes as disclosed elsewhere herein. For example, the male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein may be stacked with any other polynucleotides encoding male-gamete disruptive polynucleotides or polypeptides, cytotoxins, markers or other male fertility sequences as disclosed elsewhere herein. The stacked polynucleotides may be operably linked to the same promoter as the male fertility polynucleotide, or may be operably linked to a separate promoter polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">As described elsewhere herein, expression cassettes may comprise a promoter operably linked to a polynucleotide of interest, along with a corresponding termination region. The termination region may be native to the transcriptional initiation region, may be native to the operably linked male fertility polynucleotide of interest or with the male fertility promoter sequences, may be native to the plant host, or may be derived from another source (i.e., foreign or heterologous). Convenient termination regions are available from the Ti-plasmid of <i>A. tumefaciens</i>, such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions.

      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0177">Where appropriate, the polynucleotides of interest may be optimized for increased expression in the transformed plant. That is, the polynucleotides can be synthesized using plant-preferred codons for improved expression. See, for example, Campbell and Gowri, (1990) <i>Plant Physiol</i>. 92:1-11 for a discussion of host-preferred codon usage. Methods are available in the art for synthesizing plant-preferred genes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,380,831 and 5,436,391 and Murray, et al., (1989) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>17:477-498, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">Additional sequence modifications are known to enhance gene expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon-intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats and other such well-characterized sequences that may be deleterious to gene expression. The G-C content of the sequence may be adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. When possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">The expression cassettes may additionally contain 5′ leader sequences. Such leader sequences can act to enhance translation. Translation leaders are known in the art and include: picornavirus leaders, for example, EMCV leader (Encephalomyocarditis 5′ noncoding region) (Elroy-Stein, et al., (1989) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86:6126-6130); potyvirus leaders, for example, TEV leader (Tobacco Etch Virus) (Gallie, et al., (1995) <i>Gene </i>165(2):233-238), MDMV leader (Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus) (Johnson, et al., (1986) <i>Virology </i>154:9-20) and human immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) (Macejak, et al., (1991) <i>Nature </i>353:90-94); untranslated leader from the coat protein mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4) (Jobling, et al., (1987) <i>Nature </i>325:622-625); tobacco mosaic virus leader (TMV) (Gallie, et al., (1989) in <i>Molecular Biology of RNA</i>, ed. Cech (Liss, New York), pp. 237-256) and maize chlorotic mottle virus leader (MCMV) (Lommel, et al., (1991) <i>Virology </i>81:382-385). See also, Della-Cioppa, et al., (1987) <i>Plant Physiol</i>. 84:965-968. Other methods known to enhance translation can also be utilized, for example, introns, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">In preparing the expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous DNA, removal of restriction sites, or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, e.g., transitions and transversions, may be involved.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">In particular embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a promoter operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide, or active fragment or variant thereof, as disclosed herein.

      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">In certain embodiments, plant promoters can preferentially initiate transcription in certain tissues, such as stamen, anther, filament and pollen, or developmental growth stages, such as sporogenous tissue, microspores and microgametophyte. Such plant promoters are referred to as “tissue-preferred”, “cell type-preferred” or “growth-stage preferred”. Promoters which initiate transcription only in certain tissue are referred to as “tissue-specific”. Likewise, promoters which initiate transcription only at certain growth stages are referred to as “growth stage-specific”. A “cell type-specific” promoter drives expression only in certain cell types in one or more organs, for example, stamen cells, or individual cell types within the stamen such as anther, filament or pollen cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0183">Male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein, and active fragments and variants thereof, can be operably linked to male-tissue-specific or male-tissue-preferred promoters including, for example, stamen-specific or stamen-preferred promoters, anther-specific or anther-preferred promoters, pollen-specific or pollen-preferred promoters, tapetum-specific promoters or tapetum-preferred promoters, and the like. Promoters can be selected based on the desired outcome. For example, the polynucleotides of interest can be operably linked to constitutive, tissue-preferred, growth stage-preferred or other promoters for expression in plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">In one embodiment, the promoters may be those which preferentially express a polynucleotide of interest in the male tissues of the plant. No particular male fertility tissue-preferred promoter must be used in the process, and any of the many such promoters known to one skilled in the art may be employed. One such promoter is the 5126 promoter, which preferentially directs expression of the polynucleotide to which it is linked to male tissue of the plants, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,851 and 5,689,051. Other examples include the maize Ms45 promoter described at U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,523; SF3 promoter described at U.S. Pat.

      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0197">Plants are further provided comprising the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprising a male fertility polynucleotide operably linked to a promoter that is active in the plant. In some embodiments, expression of the male fertility polynucleotide modulates male fertility of the plant. In certain embodiments, expression of the male fertility polynucleotide increases male fertility of the plant. For example, plants are provided comprising an expression cassette comprising an MS45 polynucleotide or an active fragment or variant thereof, operably linked to a promoter. Upon expression of the Ms45 polynucleotide, male fertility of the plant is increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0198">In certain embodiments, expression cassettes comprising a heterologous male fertility polynucleotide as disclosed herein, or an active fragment or variant thereof, operably linked to a promoter active in a plant, are provided to a male sterile plant.

Accordingly, when a plant or plant cell comprising stacked expression cassettes with two polynucleotides undergoes meiosis, the two polynucleotides segregate into the same progeny (daughter) cell. In this manner, stacked polynucleotides will likely be expressed together in any cell for which they are present. For example, a plant may comprise an expression cassette comprising a male fertility polynucleotide stacked with an expression cassette comprising a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide such that the male fertility polynucleotide and the male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide are inherited together. Specifically, a male sterile plant could comprise an expression cassette comprising a male fertility polynucleotide disclosed herein operably linked to a constitutive promoter, stacked with an expression cassette comprising a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide operably linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter, such that the plant produces mature pollen grains. However, in such a plant, development of the daughter pollen cells comprising the male fertility polynucleotide will be impacted by expression of the male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide.</p>

Progeny, variants and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the disclosure, provided that these parts comprise the introduced nucleic acid sequences.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0201">The methods disclosed herein comprise introducing a polypeptide or polynucleotide into a plant cell. “Introducing” is intended to mean presenting to the plant the polynucleotide or polypeptide in such a manner that the sequence gains access to the interior of a cell. The methods disclosed herein do not depend on a particular method for introducing a sequence into the host cell, only that the polynucleotide or polypeptides gains access to the interior of at least one cell of the host. Methods for introducing polynucleotide or polypeptides into host cells (i.e., plants) are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, stable transformation methods, transient transformation methods, and virus-mediated methods. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide is introduced to a plant by sexual cross to another plant. For example, pollen comprising a polynucleotide of interest is transferred to the stigma of a receptor plant, to produce progeny comprising the polynucleotide of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0202">“Stable transformation” is intended to mean that the nucleotide construct introduced into a host (i.e., a plant) integrates into the genome of the plant and is capable of being inherited by the progeny thereof. “Transient transformation” is intended to mean that a polynucleotide is introduced into the host (i.e., a plant) and expressed temporally or a polypeptide is introduced into a host (i.e., a plant).</p>

Such transient transformation methods include, but are not limited to, the introduction of the male fertility polypeptide or variants and fragments thereof directly into the plant or the introduction of a male fertility transcript into the plant. Such methods include, for example, microinjection or particle bombardment. See, for example, Crossway, et al., (1986) <i>Mol Gen.

Nos. 5,889,191, 5,889,190, 5,866,785, 5,589,367, 5,316,931 and Porta, et al., (1996) <i>Molecular Biotechnology </i>5:209-221, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0207">Methods are known in the art for the targeted insertion of a polynucleotide at a specific location in the plant genome. In one embodiment, the insertion of the polynucleotide at a desired genomic location is achieved using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example, WO 1999/25821, WO 1999/25854, WO 1999/25840, WO 1999/25855 and WO 1999/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Briefly, the polynucleotide disclosed herein can be contained in transfer cassette flanked by two non-identical recombination sites. The transfer cassette is introduced into a plant having stably incorporated into its genome a target site which is flanked by two non-identical recombination sites that correspond to the sites of the transfer cassette. An appropriate recombinase is provided and the transfer cassette is integrated at the target site. The polynucleotide of interest is thereby integrated at a specific chromosomal position in the plant genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0208">The cells that have been transformed may be grown into plants in accordance with conventional ways. These are referred to as T0 plants. See, for example, McCormick, et al., (1986) <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>5:81-84. These plants may then be grown, and pollinated with either the same transformed strain or different strains, and the resulting progeny having desired expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations (e.g., T1, T2, T3) may be grown to ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested to ensure expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic has been achieved. In this manner, the present disclosure provides transformed seed (also referred to as “transgenic seed”) having a male fertility polynucleotide disclosed herein, for example, an expression cassette disclosed herein, stably incorporated into their genome. Seed comprising any expression cassette disclosed herein can be sorted based on size parameters, including but not limited to, seed length, seed width, seed density, seed color, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0209">The male fertility polynucleotides and expression cassettes disclosed herein may be used for transformation of any plant species, including, but not limited to, monocots and dicots. Examples of plant species of interest include, but are not limited to, corn (<i>Zea mays</i>), <i>Brassica </i>sp.

      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0210">In particular embodiments, wheat plants are used in the methods and compositions disclosed herein. As used herein, the term “wheat” refers to any species of the genus <i>Triticum</i>, including progenitors thereof, as well as progeny thereof produced by crosses with other species. Wheat includes “hexaploid wheat” which has genome organization of AABBDD, comprised of 42 chromosomes, and “tetraploid wheat” which has genome organization of AABB, comprised of 28 chromosomes. Hexaploid wheat includes <i>T. aestivum, T. spelta, T. mocha, T. compactum, T. sphaerococcum, T. vavilovii </i>and interspecies cross thereof. Tetraploid wheat includes <i>T. durum </i>(also referred to as <i>durum </i>wheat or <i>Triticum turgidum </i>ssp. <i>durum</i>), <i>T. dicoccoides, T. dicoccum, T. polonicum </i>and interspecies cross thereof. In addition, the term “wheat” includes possible progenitors of hexaploid or tetraploid <i>Triticum </i>sp. such as <i>T. uartu, T. monococcum </i>or <i>T. boeoticum </i>for the A genome, <i>Aegilops speltoides </i>for the B genome, and <i>T. tauschii </i>(also known as <i>Aegilops squarrosa </i>or <i>Aegilops tauschii</i>) for the D genome. A wheat cultivar for use in the present disclosure may belong to, but is not limited to, any of the above-listed species. Also encompassed are plants that are produced by conventional techniques using <i>Triticum </i>sp. as a parent in a sexual cross with a non-<i>Triticum </i>species, such as rye <i>Secale cereale</i>, including but not limited to Triticale. In some embodiments, the wheat plant is suitable for commercial production of grain, such as commercial varieties of hexaploid wheat or durum wheat, having suitable agronomic characteristics which are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0211">Typically, an intermediate host cell will be used in the practice of the methods and compositions disclosed herein to increase the copy number of the cloning vector. With an increased copy number, the vector containing the nucleic acid of interest can be isolated in significant quantities for introduction into the desired plant cells. In one embodiment, plant promoters that do not cause expression of the polypeptide in bacteria are employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0212">Prokaryotes most frequently are represented by various strains of <i>E. coli</i>; however, other microbial strains may also be used. Commonly used prokaryotic control sequences which are defined herein to include promoters for transcription initiation, optionally with an operator, along with ribosome binding sequences, include such commonly used promoters as the beta lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose (lac) promoter systems (Chang, et al., (1977) <i>Nature </i>198:1056), the tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel, et al., (1980) <i>Nucleic Acids Res</i>. 8:4057) and the lambda derived P L promoter and N-gene ribosome binding site (Shimatake, et al., (1981) <i>Nature </i>292:128). The inclusion of selection markers in DNA vectors transfected in <i>E coli</i>. is also useful. Examples of such markers include genes specifying resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0213">The vector is selected to allow introduction into the appropriate host cell. Bacterial vectors are typically of plasmid or phage origin. Appropriate bacterial cells are infected with phage vector particles or transfected with naked phage vector DNA. If a plasmid vector is used, the bacterial cells are transfected with the plasmid vector DNA. Expression systems for expressing a protein disclosed herein are available using <i>Bacillus </i>sp. and <i>Salmonella </i>(Palva, et al., (1983) <i>Gene </i>22:229-235); Mosbach, et al., (1983) <i>Nature </i>302:543-545).</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0214">In some embodiments, the expression cassette or male fertility polynucleotides disclosed herein are maintained in a hemizygous state in a plant. Hemizygosity is a genetic condition existing when there is only one copy of a gene (or set of genes) with no allelic counterpart on the sister chromosome. In certain embodiments, the expression cassettes disclosed herein comprise a first promoter operably linked to a male fertility polynucleotide which is stacked with a male-gamete-disruptive polynucleotide operably linked to a male tissue-preferred promoter, and such expression cassettes are introduced into a male sterile plant in a hemizygous condition. When the male fertility polynucleotide is expressed, the plant is able to successfully produce mature pollen grains because the male fertility polynucleotide restores the plant to a fertile condition. Given the hemizygous condition of the expression cassette, only certain daughter cells will inherit the expression cassette in the process of pollen grain formation. The daughter cells that inherit the expression cassette containing the male fertility polynucleotide will not develop into mature pollen grains due to the male tissue-preferred expression of the stacked encoded male-gamete-disruptive gene product. Those pollen grains that do not inherit the expression cassette will continue to develop into mature pollen grains and be functional, but will not contain the male fertility polynucleotide of the expression cassette and therefore will not transmit the male fertility polynucleotide to progeny through pollen.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0000">V. Modulating the Concentration and/or Activity of Male Fertility Polypeptides</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0215">A method for modulating the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptides disclosed herein in a plant is provided. The term “influences” or “modulates”, as used herein with reference to the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptides, refers to any increase or decrease in the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptides when compared to an appropriate control. In general, concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide disclosed herein is increased or decreased by at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% relative to a native control plant, plant part, or cell. Modulation as disclosed herein may occur during and/or subsequent to growth of the plant to the desired stage of development. In specific embodiments, the male fertility polypeptides disclosed herein are modulated in monocots, particularly wheat.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0216">A variety of methods can be employed to assay for modulation in the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide. For instance, the expression level of the male fertility polypeptide may be measured directly, for example, by assaying for the level of the male fertility polypeptide or RNA in the plant (i.e., Western or Northern blot), or indirectly, for example, by assaying the male fertility activity of the male fertility polypeptide in the plant. Methods for measuring the male fertility activity are described elsewhere herein. In specific embodiments, modulation of male fertility polypeptide concentration and/or activity comprises the modulation (i.e., an increase or a decrease) in the level of male fertility polypeptide in the plant. Methods to measure the level and/or activity of male fertility polypeptides are known in the art and are discussed elsewhere herein. In still other embodiments, the level and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptide is modulated in vegetative tissue, in reproductive tissue, or in both vegetative and reproductive tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0217">In one embodiment, the activity and/or concentration of the male fertility polypeptide is increased by introducing the polypeptide or the corresponding male fertility polynucleotide into the plant. Subsequently, a plant having the introduced male fertility sequence is selected using methods known to those of skill in the art such as, but not limited to, Southern blot analysis, DNA sequencing, PCR analysis or phenotypic analysis. In certain embodiments, marker polynucleotides are introduced with the male fertility polynucleotide to aid in selection of a plant having or lacking the male fertility polynucleotide disclosed herein. A plant or plant part altered or modified by the foregoing embodiments is grown under plant forming conditions for a time sufficient to modulate the concentration and/or activity of the male fertility polypeptide in the plant. Plant forming conditions are well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0218">As discussed elsewhere herein, many methods are known the art for providing a polypeptide to a plant including, but not limited to, direct introduction of the polypeptide into the plant, or introducing into the plant (transiently or stably) a polynucleotide construct encoding a male fertility polypeptide. It is also recognized that the methods disclosed herein may employ a polynucleotide that is not capable of directing, in the transformed plant, the expression of a protein or an RNA. Thus, the level and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide may be increased by altering the gene encoding the male fertility polypeptide or its promoter. See, e.g., Kmiec, U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,350; Zarling, et al., PCT/US93/03868. Therefore mutagenized plants that carry mutations in male fertility genes, where the mutations increase expression of the male fertility gene or increase the activity of the encoded male fertility polypeptide are provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0219">In other embodiments, the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide is increased by introduction into a plant of an expression cassette comprising a male fertility polynucleotide, or an active fragment or variant thereof, as disclosed elsewhere herein. The male fertility polynucleotide may be operably linked to promoter that is heterologous to the plant or native to the plant. By increasing the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide in a plant, the male fertility of the plant is likewise increased. Thus, the male fertility of a plant can be increased by increasing the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide. For example, male fertility can be restored to a male sterile plant by increasing the concentration and/or activity of a male fertility polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0220">It is also recognized that the level and/or activity of the polypeptide may be modulated by employing a polynucleotide that is not capable of directing, in a transformed plant, the expression of a protein or an RNA. For example, the polynucleotides disclosed herein may be used to design polynucleotide constructs that can be employed in methods for altering or mutating a genomic nucleotide sequence in an organism. Such polynucleotide constructs include, but are not limited to, RNA:DNA vectors, RNA:DNA mutational vectors, RNA:DNA repair vectors, mixed-duplex oligonucleotides, self-complementary RNA:DNA oligonucleotides, and recombinogenic oligonucleobases. Such nucleotide constructs and methods of use are known in the art. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,565,350; 5,731,181; 5,756,325; 5,760,012; 5,795,972 and 5,871,984, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. See also, WO 1998/49350, WO 1999/07865, WO 1999/25821 and Beetham, et al., (1999) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>96:8774-8778, herein incorporated by reference. It is therefore recognized that methods disclosed herein do not depend on the incorporation of the entire polynucleotide into the genome, only that the plant or cell thereof is altered as a result of the introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0221">In one embodiment, the genome may be altered following the introduction of the polynucleotide into a cell. For example, the polynucleotide, or any part thereof, may incorporate into the genome of the plant. Alterations to the genome disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, additions, deletions, and substitutions of nucleotides into the genome. While the methods disclosed herein do not depend on additions, deletions and substitutions of any particular number of nucleotides, it is recognized that such additions, deletions or substitutions comprises at least one nucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0222">RNA interference refers to the process of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire, et al., (1998) <i>Nature </i>391:806). The corresponding process in plants is commonly referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. The process of post-transcriptional gene silencing is thought to be an evolutionarily-conserved cellular defense mechanism used to prevent the expression of foreign genes and is commonly shared by diverse flora and phyla (Fire, et al., (1999) <i>Trends Genet. </i>15:358).</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0223">Small (or short) RNAs play an important role in controlling gene expression. Regulation of many developmental processes, including flowering, is controlled by small RNAs. It is now possible to engineer changes in gene expression of plant genes by using transgenic constructs which produce small RNAs in the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0224">Small RNAs appear to function by base-pairing to complementary RNA or DNA target sequences. When bound to RNA, small RNAs trigger either RNA cleavage or translational inhibition of the target sequence. When bound to DNA target sequences, it is thought that small RNAs can mediate DNA methylation of the target sequence. The consequence of these events, regardless of the specific mechanism, is that gene expression is reduced or inhibited.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0225">As used herein, the term “Cas gene” refers to a gene that is generally coupled, associated or close to or in the vicinity of flanking CRISPR loci.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0226">CRISPR loci (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) (also known as SPIDRs—SPacer Interspersed Direct Repeats) constitute a family of recently described DNA loci. CRISPR loci consist of short and highly conserved DNA repeats (typically 24 to 40 bps, repeated from 1 to 140 times, also referred to as CRISPR-repeats) which are partially palindromic. The repeated sequences (usually specific to a species) are interspaced by variable sequences of constant length (typically 20 to 58 by depending on the CRISPR locus (WO 2007/025097, published Mar. 1, 2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0227">CRISPR loci were first recognized in <i>E. coli </i>(Ishino, et al., (1987) <i>J. Bacterial. </i>169:5429-5433; Nakata, et al., (1989) J. Bacterial. 171:3553-3556). Similar interspersed short sequence repeats have been identified in <i>Haloferax mediterranei, Streptococcus pyogenes, Anabaena </i>and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(Groenen, et al., (1993) <i>Mol. Microbiol</i>. 10:1057-1065; Hoe, et al., (1999) <i>Emerg. Infect. Dis</i>. 5:254-263; Masepohl, et al., (1996) <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1307:26-30; Mojica, et al., (1995) <i>Mol. Microbiol</i>. 17:85-93). The CRISPR loci differ from other SSRs by the structure of the repeats, which have been termed short regularly spaced repeats (SRSRs) (Janssen, et al., (2002) <i>OMICS J. Integ. Biol. </i>6:23-33; Mojica, et al., (2000) <i>Mol. Microbiol</i>. 36:244-246). The repeats are short elements that occur in clusters, that are always regularly spaced by variable sequences of constant length (Mojica, et al., (2000) <i>Mol. Microbiol</i>. 36:244-246).</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0228">The terms “Cas gene”, “CRISPR-associated (Cas) gene” are used interchangeably herein. A comprehensive review of the Cas protein family is presented in Haft, et al., (2005) <i>Computational Biology, PLoS Comput Biol </i>1 (6):e60.doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010060. As described therein, 41 CRISPR-associated (Cas) gene families are described, in addition to the four previously known gene families. It shows that CRISPR systems belong to different classes, with different repeat patterns, sets of genes, and species ranges. The number of Cas genes at a given CRISPR locus can vary between species. The Cas endonuclease gene can be a Cas9 endonuclease gene, such as but not limited to, Cas9 genes listed in SEQ ID NOS: 462, 474, 489, 494, 499, 505 and 518 of WO 2007/025097 published Mar. 1, 2007 and incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0229">As used herein, the term “guide RNA” refers to a synthetic fusion of two RNA molecules, a crRNA (CRISPR RNA) comprising a variable targeting domain and a tracrRNA. In one embodiment, the guide RNA comprises a variable targeting domain of 12 to 30 nucleotide sequences and a RNA fragment that can interact with a Cas endonuclease.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0230">The term “variable targeting domain” refers to a nucleotide sequence 5-prime of the GUUUU sequence motif in the guide RNA, that is complementary to one strand of a double strand DNA target site in the genome of a plant cell, plant or seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0231">The guide RNA and Cas endonuclease are capable of forming a complex, referred to as “guide RNA/Cas endonuclease complex” or “guide RNA/Cas endonuclease system” that enables the Cas endonuclease to introduce a double strand break at a DNA target site.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Inbred Maintenance and Increase of LOF-pIRmf Male Sterile Plants Using a Hemizygous Maintainer</heading>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0236">It would be advantageous to produce a pure line of male sterile plants to allow for cross pollination with a different inbred variety to produce hybrid seed. Generally, strategies that incorporate dominant sterility as a means to invoke male sterility cannot self-pollinate. This example provides such a method.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0237">In some embodiments, when promoter inverted repeat strategies are used to silence genes involved in male fertility (Loss of Function: LOF-pIRmf), supplying an exogenous copy of the silenced gene restores male fertility. This is an example of restoration of fertility by Gain of Function (GOF-MF); see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. When silencing the wheat MS45 gene and restoring using an exogenous source of the suppressed fertility gene, the female inbreds are examples of LOF-pIRmf, while the male restorers are examples of GOF-MF; see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0238">It would be advantageous to generate an inbred maintainer plant or population, to increase the male-sterile inbred line. To accomplish this, in one embodiment for wheat, the maize MS45 promoter expressing the rice MS45 gene (GOF-MF) is linked to the maize alpha amylase (AA) gene under control of the maize PG47 promoter and linked to a DsRed2 gene under control of the barley LTP2 promoter (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,716) and also carrying a PINII terminator sequence (GOF-MF-AA-DsRED). This construct is transformed directly into wheat by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Wheat plants containing single-copy GOF-MF-AA-DsRED cassette are emasculated and stigmas are fertilized with pollen from male fertile plants containing LOF-pIRmf and GOF-MF constructs. Seeds are harvested, screening by PCR for plants or seeds containing only the GOF-MF-AA-DsRED and LOF-pIRmf TDNA insertions. These seeds are planted and plants are allowed to self-pollinate. Red fluorescing seed from these selfed plants are planted and progeny screened by QPCR for homozygous LOF-pIRmf TDNA insertions. Seed from this generation of progeny segregates at a frequency of 1:1 red-fluorescing and non-red. Red-fluorescing seed is hemizygous for GOF-MF-AA-DsRED, homozygous for LOF-pIRmf, while non-fluorescing seed is homozygous for LOF-pIRmf. Progeny of the non-fluorescing seed are male sterile and can be used as female inbreds during hybrid production. The red-fluorescing seed produce progeny (hemizygous for GOF-MF-AA-DsRED; homozygous LOF-pIRmf) that can be used to maintain and propagate the male sterile inbred.</p>

        <i>E. coli </i>DNA (Adenosine-N6-)-Methyltransferase (DAM) Expression Affects Plant Fertility in Wheat</heading>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0239">This example demonstrates that the fertility or fertility potential of wheat plants can be altered by expression of <i>E. coli </i>DNA (Adenosine-N6-)-Methyltransferase (DAM) when under the control of the maize anther promoter 5126.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0240">In maize, anther-directed expression of the <i>E. coli </i>DAM gene resulted in a high frequency of male sterile plants due to disruption of normal tapetum function (Unger, et al. (2001) <i>Trans Res </i>10:409-422). However, it was not known whether expression of DAM in a polyploid plant would result in male sterility.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0241">Nucleic acid molecules and methods for preparing a vector to express in wheat plants, PHP56791, are similar to those previously described (Unger, et al., (2001) <i>Trans Res </i>10:409-422). DNA sequence of the DAM gene was modified for expression in plants. The optimized DAM gene was placed under the transcriptional control of the maize 5126 promoter (Unger, et al., (2001) <i>Trans Res </i>10:409-422) to generate the plant transformation vector PHP56791. PHP56791 was introduced into wheat Fielder variety by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation methods similar to those described or referenced elsewhere herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0242">Plants were grown in the greenhouse and transgene copy-number was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Plants were grown to maturity and male fertility phenotype was recorded. Of the 85 primary T0 wheat transformants, 73 plants were male sterile while 12 plants were male fertile. Microscopic examination of anthers from several independent PHP56791 plants revealed that these anthers lacked pollen in contrast to similarly staged anthers from untransformed Fielder plants. In addition, anthers were consistently one-third to one-half the size of fully-developed fertile anthers and did not contain microspores beyond the early vacuolate stage of development. The small size of the anthers and lack of pollen in PHP56791 male sterile plants were similar to the male sterility phenotypes observed in maize plants transformed with anther-expressed DAM gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0243">These results demonstrate that the plant optimized DAM gene expressed from the maize anther promoter in PHP56791 is capable of generating male sterile wheat plants. Additional details are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/203,698, filed 11 Mar. 2014, incorporated herein by reference.</p>

      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0244">This example demonstrates that male-sterile plants containing construct PHP56791 can be restored to male fertility when also containing a promoter silencing construct. In maize, promoter silencing constructs effectively transcriptionally silence both endogenous and transformed promoters in planta (Cigan, et al., (2005) <i>Plant Journal </i>43:929-940). This example was designed to test whether a promoter inverted repeat designed to silence the maize anther promoter, 5126, was capable of directing similar male sterility phenotypes in wheat. In addition, if fertility was not impacted by the maize 5126 promoter inverted repeat, the experiment would determine whether this silencing cassette could suppress the anther expression of the DAM gene in PHP56791 transgenic wheat plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0245">Nucleic acid molecules and methods for preparing the plant vector PHP54783 capable of suppressing the maize 5126 promoter used to express the DAM gene in PHP56791 are essentially as described for PHP20089 (Cigan, et al., (2005) <i>Plant Journal </i>43:929-940). PHP54783 was introduced into wheat Fielder variety by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation methods similar to those described or referenced elsewhere herein. Transformed plants were regenerated from tissue culture and grown in the greenhouse. Transgene copy-number was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Plants were grown to maturity and male fertility phenotype was recorded.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0246">All plants containing only the PHP54783 TDNA insertions were male fertile, suggesting that unlike expression of this pIR suppression cassette in maize, the Zm5126 pIR does not result in male sterile wheat plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0247">To determine whether the Zm5126 pIR silencing cassette was capable of reversing the male sterility phenotype associated with PHP56791, pollen from two non-identical single-copy PHP54783 TDNA insertions (Male 1 and Male 2) were used to fertilize three non-identical, male sterile, PHP56791 plants (Female 1, 3, 4). Seed was harvested from these crosses, planted and progeny genotyped for the presence of PHP54783 and PHP56791 TDNA insertions by PCR. Plants containing only PHP56791, or both PHP56791 and PHP54783, were grown to maturity and male fertility phenotype recorded. As shown in Table 1, Group 1 and 4 wheat plants containing only PHP56791 did not contain pollen and were male sterile (“No Seed”). In contrast, PHP56791 plants also containing PHP54783 from Groups 1, 3 and 4 shed pollen and were capable of self-fertilization (“Seed”). Seed number per plant in PHP56791/PHP54783 progeny was similar to seed numbers obtained from untransformed Fielder variety plants. These results demonstrate that the <i>Zea mays </i>5126 promoter inverted repeat was capable of restoring fertility to wheat plants containing the dominant male sterility construct PHP56791.</p>

      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">Sources of Promoters and Gene Products to Confer Male Sterility and Restore Fertility in Wheat</heading>
      <p id="p-00250-en" num="0248">The promoter expressing the <i>E. coli </i>DAM gene in PHP56791 can be an anther-preferred promoter such as the promoter of the maize MS45, BS7 or MS26 gene, or for example, the promoter of the rice or <i>Arabidopsis </i>homolog of the maize MS45, 5126, BS7 or MS26 gene, such that expression by this plant promoter:DAM transcription unit renders wheat plants male sterile. In certain respects, it is advantageous to use non-wheat promoters to express the DAM gene in wheat. For example, where promoter inverted repeats from the same species have the potential to reduce target promoter function such that the plant is non-viable or non-reproductive, a promoter from a different species can be used to transcriptionally express the dominant sterility gene (e.g., DAM), thus circumventing this potential problem.</p>
      <p id="p-00251-en" num="0249">In addition, the <i>E. coli </i>DAM gene in PHP56791 can be replaced by sources other than DAM, for example barnase or another gene product that renders plants male sterile as a result of reduced tapetum function or other disruption of development of male reproductive tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0250">Taken together, the present examples demonstrate that a dominant male sterility gene can be inhibited using pIR-mediated suppression and that a fertile phenotype can be restored in genotypically sterile plants.</p>

      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">Inbred Maintenance and Increase of LOF-DomMS Male Sterile Plants Using a Hemizygous Maintainer</heading>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0251">It would be advantageous to produce a pure line of male sterile plants to allow for cross pollination with a different inbred variety to produce hybrid seed. Generally, sterility strategies that include dominant approaches prevent plants from self-pollinating. This example provides such a method.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0252">In some embodiments, dominant male sterility is accomplished by the introduction of a construct comprising a promoter driving a gene to express a gene product, such as a protein or RNA, that causes male sterile plants due to general or specific disruption of reproductive development, such as anther development, tapetum development or microspore function. In these Dominant Loss of Function (LOF-DomMS) examples, restoration of fertility could be accomplished by co-expressing an exogenous promoter inverted repeat (pIR) construct that silences the promoter (MSp) used to drive the Dominant sterility gene (MSpMS). This is an example of restoration of fertility by Gain of Function by promoter inverted repeats (GOF-pIRMSp); see <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. As described previously, disrupting normal tapetum function by Zm5126:DAM (MSpMS) is an example of the LOF-DomMS female inbred; restoration of fertility using an exogenous source of the Zm5126pIR (pIRMSp) is an example of GOF-pIRMSp (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0253">It would be advantageous to generate an inbred maintainer population which could be used to increase the male sterile inbred line containing MSpMS. To accomplish this, the GOF-pIRMSp is linked to the maize alpha amylase gene under control of the PG47 promoter and linked to a DsRed2 gene under control of the barley LTP2 promoter (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,716) and also carrying a PINII terminator sequence (GOF-pIRMSp-AA-DsRED). This construct is transformed directly into wheat by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Wheat plants containing single-copy GOF-pIRMSp-AA-DsRED cassette are emasculated and stigmas are fertilized with pollen from male fertile plants containing MSpMS/GOF-pIRMSp. Seeds are harvested, screening by PCR for plants or seeds containing only the GOF-pIRMSp-AA-DsRED and MSpMS TDNA insertions. Plants are allowed to self-pollinate. Red fluorescing seed from these selfed plants are planted and progeny screened by QPCR for homozygous MSpMS TDNA insertions. Seed from this generation of progeny will segregate at a frequency of 1:1 red fluorescing and non-red. Red fluorescing seed is hemizygous for GOF-pIRMSp-AA-DsRED and homozygous for MSpMS, while non-fluorescing seed is homozygous for MSpMS. Progeny of the non-fluorescing seed are male sterile and can be used as female inbreds during hybrid production. The red fluorescing seed produce progeny (hemizygous for GOF-pIRMSp-AA-DsRED; homozygous for MSpMS) that would be used to propagate the male sterile inbred. In the example above, the MSpMS could be Zm5126DAM, while GOF-pIRMSp would correspond to Zm5126pIR.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0254">As the progeny produced during hybrid seed production would contain a hemizygous dominant sterility-causing gene construct, MSpMS, it would be advantageous to generate male inbred varieties that contain homozygous male fertility restorer (GOF-pIRMSp). These male inbred varieties could be used during hybrid production. F1 seed, generated by fertilization of MSpMS/MSpMS male sterile females with pollen from male fertile pIRMSp/pIRMSp male inbreds, would be genotypically MSpMS/pIRMSp and phenotypically male fertile.</p>

      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">Maintenance of Male Sterile Inbreds Containing LOF-pIRmf and GOF-MF-AA-DsRED</heading>
      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0255">In this example, fertility was restored to wheat plants containing a pIR construct targeting the wheat MS45 promoter (PHP54693 T-DNA; TaMS45pIR) using a functional copy of the maize MS45 gene linked to (a) the maize alpha amylase gene under control of the PG47 promoter and (b) a DsRed2 gene under control of the barley LTP2 promoter (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,716), GOF-MF-AA-DsRED.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0256">It would be advantageous to produce a pure line of male sterile plants to allow for cross pollination with a different inbred variety to produce hybrid seed. Wheat plants containing PHP56988 (T-DNA comprising a maize MS45 gene linked to the pollen PG47 promoter expressing maize alpha amylase and a third gene composed of the barley LTP2 promoter expressing the fluorescent marker, DsRed2) were used to maintain male fertility. This maintainer line construct, PHP56988, was initially generated by <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation. Pollen from TaMS45pIR plants containing the MS45 restorer was then used to fertilize emasculated wheat plants containing PHP56988. Seeds were harvested, and progeny plants were screened by PCR to select those containing only GOF-MF-AA-DsRED (PHP56988) and LOF-pIRmf TDNA (PHP54693) insertions. Plants were allowed to self-pollinate. Red fluorescing seed (indicating inheritance of the DsRed marker in PHP56988) from these selfed plants was planted and progeny screened by QPCR for homozygous LOFpIRmf (PHP54693); seed from this generation of progeny segregates at a frequency of 1:1 red-fluorescing and non-red. Red-fluorescing seed was hemizygous (one copy) for GOF-MF-AA-DsRED (PHP56988) and homozygous (two copies) for LOF-pIRmf (PHP54693), while non-fluorescing seed were homozygous for LOF-pIRmf (PHP54693). Progeny of the non-fluorescing seed were male sterile due to the presence of the LOF-pIRmf TDNA insert. The red-fluorescing seed progeny (hemizygous for GOF-MF-AA-DsRED; homozygous LOF-pIRmf) were male fertile and set seed.</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0257">This example demonstrates that the male sterility phenotype, conferred by the promoter inverted repeat directed against the wheat MS45 promoter carried in LOF-pIRmf vector PHP54693, could be reversed by the presence and action of the functional Ms45 copy contained in the GOF-MF-AA-DsRED cassette. In addition, 1:1 segregation of male fertility phenotype with male sterile phenotype was coincident with the presence of PHP56988 (GOE-MF-AA-DsRED) and PHP54693 (LOF-pIRmf) or PHP54693 (LOF-pIRmf) only, respectively.</p>

      <heading id="h-00023-en" level="1">Methods of Restoring Fertility in Hybrid Plants Containing LOF-pIRmf</heading>
      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0258">The pure line of LOF-pIRmf male sterile plants used as females and cross-pollinated with a different male inbred variety would produce hybrid seed in which the LOF-pIRmf insertions would be hemizygous. The progeny plants derived from this F1 seed would be male sterile and incapable of producing pollen and selfed seed. It would be advantageous to devise strategies that allow for the self-fertilization of the hybrid seed containing hemizygous LOF-pIRmf insertions. In these examples, various strategies to overcome the sterility imparted by LOF-pIRmf in F1 hybrids are described.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0259">One solution to overcome F1 sterility would be to use a male inbred variety which contains a copy of Ms45 or the pIR-targeted fertility gene which is not silenced by the TaMS45pIR or LOF-pIRmf, respectively. This solution was previously described for restoring fertility of homozygous or hemizygous TaMs45pIR containing plants (PCT/US2014/023932). Thus, male inbred varieties could contain homozygous restoring constructs, and be used as pollen donors during hybrid seed production. All F1 hybrid seed would produce fertile plants, as the hemizygous copy of exogenously supplied Ms45 would restore function by complementing the wheat Ms45 gene which was silenced by the action of the TaMs45pIR.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0260">A second solution to restore fertility in the F1 plant would be to use a male inbred variety which contains a genic modified copy of the wheat Ms45 or the pIR-targeted fertility gene promoter which is not silenced by the TaMS45pIR or LOF-pIRmf, respectively. In this example, the endogenous wheat Ms45 promoter could be replaced with DNA sequences which would not be targeted for silencing by the TaMs45pIR yet would be competent for expressing a fertility complementing version of wheat Ms45. The plant genome could be manipulated using DNA cutting reagents (for example, Zinc Finger nucleases, TALE nucleases, custom meganuclease or guide RNA/Cas endonuclease systems) to introduce a double-strand-break in the region of the endogenous native wheat Ms45 gene and an exogenously supplied DNA template which contains promoter sequences sufficient to express wheat Ms45 but not targeted for silencing by the TaMs45pIR (maize or rice Ms45 or 5126 for example, or a combination of wheat and non-wheat derived sequences). By producing a double-strand-break in this region which promotes homologous recombination, the wheat Ms45 promoter could be replaced or altered to the extent that the region is no longer a target for suppression or silencing. Male inbreds that contain this non-target promoter at the fertility locus would be used as pollen donors during hybrid seed production. All F1 seed would produce male fertile plants, as the hemizygous copy of the endogenous TaMs45 gene now linked to a non-target promoter is not silenced by the action of TaMs45pIR also present in these progeny.</p>

The AGO4-siRNAs duplex directs a silencing complex to homologous genomic regions through basepairing to DNA. As the generation of these 24 nt small RNAs is independent of the source of the constitutively expressed promoter inverted repeat RNA, multiple promoter inverted repeat constructs could be designed to generate sufficient 24nt small RNA coverage of the targeted promoter region.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0263">In one embodiment, maize inbred plants contain hemizygous promoter inverted repeats targeting a promoter operably linked (natively or heterologously) to a fertility gene. These female inbred plants are pollinated with any wild-type male inbred variety. The progeny, which contain hemizygous unpaired promoter inverted repeats, are male fertile due to the inability of either single promoter inverted repeat to silence the fertility gene driven by the target promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00266-en" num="0264">Promoter inverted repeat pairs are designed such that the first pIR construct contains only part of the target sequence, while the second promoter inverted repeat contains the remaining portion of the target promoter needed for silencing. As the promoter being targeted would not be silenced or suppressed due to incomplete coverage by a single promoter inverted repeat, only in the presence of the paired first and second promoter inverted repeat would the target promoter be silenced. Plants, generated to contain the unique pairs of promoter inverted repeat constructs at a single location in the plant genome, would be crossed to generate a male sterile female inbred line due to the silencing of the fertility gene by the combined action of the paired promoter inverted repeats.</p>
      <p id="p-00267-en" num="0265">This female inbred line would be maintained by a Gain-of-Function-Male-Fertility-alpha-Amylase-DsRED construct which would allow for the generation of a segregating population: one half of the seed population would fluoresce due to the presence of GOF-MF-AA-DsRED and hemizygous LOF-pIR1mf/LOF-pIR2mf, while the other half of the seed population would not fluoresce but only contain hemizygous LOF-pIR1mf/LOF-pIR2mf. Progeny containing GOF-MF-AA-DsRED and hemizygous LOF-pIR1mf/LOF-pIR2mf would be male fertile, while progeny LOF-pIR1mf/LOF-pIR2mf plants would be male sterile and used as female inbreds during hybrid production. Fertilization of LOF-pIR1mf/LOF-pIR2mf plants with wild-type male inbred would result in progeny which would segregate away each copy of LOF-pIR1mf and LOF-pIR2mf insertions, yielding LOF-pIR1 mf-only and LOF-pIR2mf-only plants which would be male fertile, as these single LOF-pIRmf versions are incapable of silencing the endogenous copies of the fertility gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00268-en" num="0266">Multiple promoter inverted repeat combinations could be designed to enable silencing of the target promoter; these could include, but are not limited to, promoter inverted repeat pairs that contain contiguous stretches of DNA sequence, splitting DNA sequences equally or unequally, the target promoter sequence, or chimeras consisting of stretches of non-contiguous, overlapping or non-overlapping, DNA target sequences. Moreover, it could be envisioned that the order of these sequences within these paired promoter inverted repeat constructs could be altered and different relative to order of the target DNA sequence.</p>
