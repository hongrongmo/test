      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a carbon electrode used for manufacturing polycrystalline silicon, and an apparatus for manufacturing a polycrystalline silicon rod using the carbon electrode.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A Siemens method is known as a method for manufacturing polycrystalline silicon that is a raw material of monocrystalline silicon for manufacturing semiconductors or silicon for manufacturing solar cells. The Siemens method is a method of bringing a material gas containing chlorosilane into contact with a heated silicon core to grow polycrystalline silicon from vapor phase on a surface of the silicon core using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In growing polycrystalline silicon from vapor phase by the Siemens method, two vertical silicon cores and one horizontal silicon core are assembled into an inverted U-shape in a reactor of a vapor phase growth device, and opposite ends of the vertical silicon cores are secured to a pair of metal electrodes placed on a base plate via a pair of core holders.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Next, a current is applied from the metal electrodes to heat the silicon cores to a temperature range of 900Â° C. to 1200Â° C. in a hydrogen atmosphere, and a material gas, for example, a mixed gas of trichlorosilane and hydrogen is supplied from a gas nozzle into the reactor. Then, silicon is grown from vapor phase on the silicon core, and a polycrystalline silicon rod having a desired diameter is formed into an inverted U-shape. After the reactor is cooled, the polycrystalline silicon rod is taken out of the reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In recent years, with increasing diameter of a polycrystalline silicon rod, a crack or a break easily occurs in the polycrystalline silicon rod during vapor phase growth or cooling of the polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">This may be because, in growing a polycrystalline silicon rod by a Siemens method, a temperature difference occurs between a center and a surface in a growing direction (radial direction) of the silicon rod during or after vapor phase growth, and this causes stress by thermal expansion or contraction of the polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">If the polycrystalline silicon rod breaks and falls in the reactor, heavy metal contamination occurs due to contact with an inner wall of the reactor and metal that constitutes a base plate or a metal electrode, and also it takes time to collect the collapsed polycrystalline silicon rod and clean the base plate to significantly increase an operation cycle time, thereby significantly reducing productivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Various proposals have been made to prevent occurrence of such a crack or a break of a polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 8-45847 (Patent Literature 1) proposes a mounting tool of a carrier member (core) including at least one spring element provided between a current lead portion (metal electrode) and an electrode holder (holding tool of core holder), wherein the spring element allows movement of the electrode holder with respect to the current lead portion and also absorbs the movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-16243 (Patent Literature 2) proposes that a seed holding electrode including a carbon seed holder and a metal electrode, in which the seed holder and the metal electrode are joined by fitting in a tapered shape, and a noble metal sheet is joined therebetween in a rubbing manner, is used to prevent a break of polycrystalline silicon or a carbon component used in the seed holding electrode due to thermal strain generated in a cooling step after production of polycrystalline silicon.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-240934 (Patent Literature 3) proposes that a carbon holder, in which ends of a silicon core are electrically connected to electrodes via conductive holders holding the silicon cores and at least one holder is slidable on an electrode surface both to left and right in a direction of a line connecting opposite ends of an inverted U-shaped silicon core, is used to reduce occurrence of cracks in a polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">As described above, during a vapor phase growth process of polycrystalline silicon by a conventional general Siemens method, opposite ends of an inverted U-shaped silicon core are secured via a pair of core holders to a pair of metal electrodes placed on a base plate. However, if opposite ends of an inverted U-shaped polycrystalline silicon rod (hereinafter simply referred to as âU rodâ in some cases) are secured to the metal electrodes, expansion and contraction of the U rod in a horizontal surface direction are inhibited. The expansion and contraction in the horizontal surface direction refer to expansion and contraction, for example, in a direction of a line connecting the opposite ends of the U rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The expansion and contraction of the U rod in the horizontal surface direction are not limited to those in the direction of the line connecting the opposite ends of the U rod. For example, if there is a different U rod near an inside of the U rod, radiant heat from the different U rod easily expands the inside. Also, if an outside of the U rod is cooled by a wall of a reactor, the outside is easily contracted. Thus, the U rod can be expanded and contracted in all directions in the horizontal surface direction depending on environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">However, the mounting tool disclosed in Patent Literature 1 has a complex structure, and does not allow movement of the electrode holder other than in the expansion and contraction directions of the spring element. The seed holding electrode disclosed in Patent Literature 2 is expensive because a noble metal sheet is used in a rubbing manner, and the noble metal is easily incorporated into polycrystalline silicon. Also, the fitting in the tapered shape may cause the seed holder to slide upward along a taper in expansion and be released from the electrode. Further, in the carbon holder disclosed in Patent Literature 3, the polycrystalline silicon rod is slidable only in the direction of the line connecting the opposite ends of the silicon core. Thus, these proposals are insufficient for preventing occurrence of a crack or a break in a polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The present invention is achieved in view of such problems, and has an object to provide a technique having a high effect of preventing occurrence of a crack or a break in a U rod that can be expanded and contracted in all directions during a vapor phase growth process of a polycrystalline silicon rod.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In the carbon electrode, the upper electrode includes a hole extending from an upper surface to a lower surface, a lower end of a rod-shaped fastening member inserted into the hole is secured to the lower electrode, a diameter of the hole is larger than a diameter of a straight body portion of the rod-shaped fastening member, and a gap is provided between an inside of the hole and the straight body portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">For example, the diameter of the hole is 1 mm or larger than the diameter of the straight body portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The carbon electrode may have a configuration in which the upper electrode is placed on the lower electrode so that a protrusion provided in an upper part of the lower electrode is inserted into a recess provided in a lower part of the upper electrode, an inner size of the recess is larger than an outer size of the protrusion, and a gap is provided between the recess and the protrusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The carbon electrode may have a configuration in which the upper electrode is placed on the lower electrode so that a protrusion provided in the lower part of the upper electrode is inserted into a recess provided in the upper part of the lower electrode, an inner size of the recess is larger than an outer size of the protrusion, and a gap is provided between the recess and the protrusion.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">For example, the gap between the recess and the protrusion is 1 mm or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Preferably, the upper electrode and the lower electrode are made of graphite.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Preferably, a coefficient of static friction of a contact surface between the upper electrode and the lower electrode is 0.3 or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The present invention provides an apparatus for manufacturing a polycrystalline silicon rod in which electric power is supplied from a pair of metal electrodes to opposite ends of silicon cores assembled into an inverted U-shape to grow polycrystalline silicon from vapor phase on the silicon core, wherein the both opposite ends of the silicon core assembled into the inverted U-shape are respectively held by securing portions provided in carbon electrodes, and at least one of the carbon electrodes is a type of carbon electrode according to the present invention described above.</p>

Meanwhile, an upper electrode <b>31</b> is placed on a lower electrode <b>32</b> so that a protrusion <b>41</b> provided in a lower part of the upper electrode <b>31</b> is inserted into a recess <b>42</b> provided in an upper part of the lower electrode <b>32</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Now, a vapor phase growth process using an apparatus for manufacturing a polycrystalline silicon rod of the present invention will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">First, the silicon core <b>5</b> is connected to the metal electrode <b>2</b>, the reaction container <b>10</b> is tightly placed on the base plate <b>1</b>, and a nitrogen gas is supplied from the gas nozzle <b>3</b> to replace air in the reaction container <b>10</b> with nitrogen. At this time, the air and the nitrogen in the reaction container <b>10</b> are exhausted from the exhaust port <b>4</b>. After the inside of the reaction container <b>10</b> is replaced with a nitrogen atmosphere, a hydrogen gas is supplied from the gas nozzle <b>3</b> instead of the nitrogen gas to bring the inside of the reaction container <b>10</b> into a hydrogen atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Then, a heater (not shown) is used to preheat the silicon core <b>5</b> to a temperature of 250Â° C. or more to be conductive so that a current efficiently flows through the silicon core <b>5</b>. Then, a current is supplied from the metal electrode <b>2</b> to the silicon core <b>5</b> to heat the silicon core <b>5</b> to 900Â° C. or more. Further, a hydrogen gas and also a trichlorosilane gas are supplied as a material gas to grow polycrystalline silicon from vapor phase on the silicon core <b>5</b> within a temperature range of 900Â° C. to 1200Â° C. An unreacted gas and a by-product gas are exhausted from the exhaust port <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">If the temperature is increased to grow polycrystalline silicon from vapor phase on the silicon core <b>5</b>, the bridge portion <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the silicon core <b>5</b> stretches due to expansion, and the vapor phase growth of polycrystalline silicon advances in that state. With increasing diameters of the straight body portions <b>6</b> and the bridge portion <b>8</b> of the polycrystalline silicon rod, temperature distribution is formed in a diametrical direction of the portions.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">For the straight body portions <b>6</b> of the polycrystalline silicon rod, for example, facing surfaces of the pair of straight body portions <b>6</b> that form a U rod radiationally heat each other and expand, and the core holder <b>20</b> and the upper electrode <b>31</b> are moved in a direction to increase space therebetween. An outside of the U rod is cooled by the reaction container <b>10</b> and is lower in temperature than an inside of the U rod, and the core holder <b>20</b> and the upper electrode <b>31</b> are moved in a direction to warp the U rod outward.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">After the straight body portion <b>6</b> and the bridge portion <b>8</b> of the polycrystalline silicon rod grow to desired diameters, supply of a material gas and supply of a current are stopped in this order, and then the temperature in the reaction container <b>10</b> is reduced. At this time, for the U rod with the space increased during growth, the core holder <b>20</b> and the upper electrode <b>31</b> are moved in a direction to reduce space of the bridge portion <b>8</b>. For the U rod with a lower temperature on the outside during growth, the core holder <b>20</b> and the upper electrode <b>31</b> are moved toward a center of the reaction container <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In order to smoothly move the upper electrode <b>31</b> on the lower electrode <b>32</b>, a carbon electrode having low friction of a surface contact portion between the upper electrode <b>31</b> and the lower electrode <b>32</b> needs to be used. From the inventors' diligent study, it has been found that a carbon electrode having a coefficient of static friction of 0.3 or less of a surface contact portion between the upper electrode <b>31</b> and the lower electrode <b>32</b> allows the upper electrode <b>31</b> to smoothly move on the lower electrode <b>32</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon core <b>5</b> is assembled into an inverted U-shape in a reactor <b>10</b>, and opposite ends of the inverted U-shaped silicon core <b>5</b> are secured to a pair of metal electrodes <b>2</b> placed on a base plate <b>1</b> via a pair of core holders <b>20</b> and a pair of carbon electrodes <b>30</b> made of graphite.
