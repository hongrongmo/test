      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and, particularly, to a method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-236134, filed Oct. 25, 2012, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Oil containing a polycyclic aromatic component such as light cycle oil (hereinafter, abbreviated as âLCOâ) which is a cracked light oil produced in a fluid catalytic cracking (hereinafter, abbreviated as âFCCâ) apparatus has so far been used mainly as a light oil or heavy oil-oriented fuel base material. In recent years, a technique has been proposed that efficiently produces a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms which can be used as a high octane gasoline base material or a petrochemical feedstock and has a high added value (for example, benzene, toluene, or coarse xylene; hereinafter, these will be collectively referred to as âBTXâ) from a feedstock containing a polycyclic aromatic component.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In addition, as an application of the method for producing BTX from a feedstock containing a polycyclic aromatic component, another method has been proposed for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon in which BTX is produced from a thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from an apparatus for producing ethylene (for example, refer to PTL 1).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In the method for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon according to PTL 1, compared with the thermally-cracked heavy oil (cracked heavy oil) in the related art which has been mostly used as a fuel or the like for a boiler or the like in industrial complexes, the thermally-cracked heavy oil is hydrogenated, is brought into contact with a catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and is reacted, thereby producing BTX.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0008">Both in the technique that produces BTX from LCO and in the technique that produces a BTX fraction from a thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from an apparatus for producing ethylene as well, there is a desire of a more efficient production of the BTX fraction in order to decrease the production cost of BTX.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0009">In addition, in order to decrease the production cost of BTX, even in apparatuses that carry out the above-described techniques as well, there is a demand for reducing the building cost or operational costs thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0010">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances and an object thereof is to provide a method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon enabling the reduction of the production cost of BTX.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0011">As a result of the repetition of thorough studies for achieving the object, the present inventors clarified that, in the past, the use of a fluidized-bed reactor having a high building cost and high operational costs as a cracking and reforming reaction device used to produce BTX using a cracking and reforming reaction hindered the reduction of the production cost of BTX. That is, even though the use of a fixed-bed reactor having a low building cost or low operational costs could reduce the production cost of BTX, the production efficiency of BTX was still decreased due to the deterioration of a catalyst in the fixed-bed reactor and thus the fluidized-bed reactor was used in the past. Therefore, as a result of additional studies based on the above-described finding, the present inventors completed the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0012">That is, a method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon of the present invention includes a cracking and reforming reaction step of obtaining a product containing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms by bringing a feedstock oil having a 10 volume % distillate temperature of 140Â° C. or higher and a 90 volume % distillate temperature of 390Â° C. or lower and a saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms into contact with a catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon containing crystalline aluminosilicate, which is loaded into a fixed-bed reactor, and reacting the feedstock oil and the saturated hydrocarbon.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0013">In the production method, the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms is preferably methane.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0014">In the production method, the feedstock oil is a thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from an apparatus for producing ethylene and a partially-hydrogenated substance of the thermally-cracked heavy oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0015">Alternatively, in the production method, the feedstock oil is a cracked light oil or a partially-hydrogenated substance of the cracked light oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0016">In the production method, in the cracking and reforming reaction step, it is preferable that two or more fixed-bed reactors be used and a cracking and reforming reaction and reproduction of the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon be repeated while the reactors are periodically switched.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0017">In the production method, the crystalline aluminosilicate contained in the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in the cracking and reforming reaction step preferably includes a medium-pore zeolite and/or a large-pore zeolite as a main component.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0018">In addition, in the production method, the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon used in the cracking and reforming reaction step preferably contains phosphorous.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0019">According to the method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon of the present invention, it is possible to reduce the production cost of BTX.</p>

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0022">A feedstock oil used in the present invention is an oil having a 10 volume % distillate temperature of 140Â° C. or higher and a 90 volume % distillate temperature of 390Â° C. or lower. In an oil having a 10 volume % distillate temperature of lower than 140Â° C., the target monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is decomposed and the productivity degrades. In addition, in a case in which an oil having a 90 volume % distillate temperature of higher than 390Â° C. is used, the yield of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is decreased and thus there is a tendency that the amount of coke accumulated on a catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon increases and an abrupt degradation of the catalyst activity is caused. The 10 volume % distillate temperature of the feedstock oil is preferably 150Â° C. or higher and the 90 volume % distillate temperature of the feedstock is preferably 360Â° C. or lower. The 10 volume % distillate temperature and the 90 volume % distillate temperature refer to values measured according to JIS K 2254 âTesting Method For Distillation Of Petroleum Productsâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0023">Examples of the feedstock oil having a 10 volume % distillate temperature of 140Â° C. or higher and a 90 volume % distillate temperature of 390Â° C. or lower include a thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from an apparatus for producing ethylene, a hydrocarbon of the thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from the apparatus for producing ethylene, a cracked light oil (LCO) produced using a fluid catalytic cracking apparatus, hydrorefined oil of LCO, coal liquefaction oil, heavy oil hydrogenolysis refined oil, distilled kerosene, distilled light oil, coker kerosene, coker light oil, oil sand hydrogenolysis refined oil, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0024">The thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from the apparatus for producing ethylene is a fraction heavier than a BTX fraction obtained from the apparatus for producing ethylene and contains a large amount of an aromatic hydrocarbon. In addition, a cracked light oil (LCO) produced using a fluid catalytic cracking apparatus and the like also contain a large amount of an aromatic hydrocarbon. In a case in which, out of fractions containing a large amount of an aromatic hydrocarbon, a fraction containing a large amount of a polycyclic aromatic is used, the fraction causes the generation of coke in the following cracking and reforming reaction and thus it is desirable to carry out a hydrogenation treatment. Even for the thermally-cracked heavy oil or fractions derived from LCO, when the fraction contains a large amount of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, it is not always required to carry out the hydrogenation treatment. Even for other feedstock oils, the feedstock oils are selected with, basically, the same way of thinking and it is desirable to avoid feedstock oils from which coke is excessively generated in the cracking and reforming reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0025">The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is a substance which has a low reactivity and is not easily converted to a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in the cracking and reforming reaction of the present invention. However, conversely, when hydrogenated with a hydrogenation reaction, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is converted to naphthenobenzene and then, when supplied to the cracking and reforming reaction, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be converted to a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. However, among polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tricyclic or higher aromatic hydrocarbons consume a large amount of hydrogen in the hydrogenation reaction step and have a low reactivity in the cracking and reforming reaction in spite of being hydrogenation reactants and thus containing a large amount of tricyclic or higher aromatic hydrocarbons is not preferred. Therefore, the content of the tricyclic or higher aromatic hydrocarbon in the feedstock oil is preferably 25% by volume or less and more preferably 15% by volume or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0026">The polycyclic aromatic component mentioned herein refers to a total value of the content of a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (bicyclic aromatic component) and the content of a tricyclic or higher aromatic hydrocarbon (tricyclic or higher aromatic component) which are measured according to JPI-5S-49 âHydrocarbon Type Testing Method for Petroleum Products using High Performance Liquid Chromatographyâ or are analyzed using an FID gas chromatograph method or a two-dimensional gas chromatograph method. Hereinafter, in a case in which the content of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or the tricyclic or higher aromatic hydrocarbon is expressed using % by volume, the content is a value measured according to JP1-5S-49 and, in a case in which the content is expressed using % by mass, the content is a value measured on the basis of the FID gas chromatograph method or the two-dimensional gas chromatograph method.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0027">(Hydrogenation Treatment of Feedstock Oil)</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0028">In a case in which the feedstock oil has been hydrogenated in advance, the hydrogenation reaction is desirably caused in accordance with instructions described below. In the hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogenated feedstock oil is partially hydrogenated instead of being fully hydrogenated. That is, mainly bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in the feedstock oil is selectively hydrogenated and is converted to a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (naphthenobenzene or the like) in which only one aromatic ring is hydrogenated. Here, examples of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon include indane, tetralin, alkylbenzene, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0029">When the feedstock oil is partially hydrogenated as described above, the amount of hydrogen consumed in the hydrogenation reaction step is suppressed and, simultaneously, the amount of heat generated during the treatment can also be suppressed. For example, when naphthalene, which is a typical example of the bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is hydrogenated to decalin, the amount of hydrogen consumed per mole of naphthalene reaches 5 moles; however, in a case in which naphthalene is hydrogenated to tetralin, naphthalene can be hydrogenated with an amount of hydrogen consumed of 2 moles. In addition, in the case of a fraction including an indene skeleton in the feedstock oil, the fraction needs to be hydrogenated until the indene skeleton is hydrogenated.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0030">As the hydrogen used in the hydrogenation reaction, hydrogen generated from the cracking and reforming reaction in the present application can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0031">The above-described hydrogenation treatment can be carried out using a well-known hydrogenation reactor. In the hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogen partial pressure at the reactor inlet is preferably in a range of 1 MPa to 9 MPa. The lower limit is more preferably 1.2 MPa or more and still more preferably 1.5 MPa or more. In addition, the upper limit is more preferably 7 MPa or less and still more preferably 5 MPa or less. In a case in which the hydrogen partial pressure is less than 1 MPa, coke is vigorously generated on the catalyst and the catalyst life becomes short. On the other hand, in a case in which the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds 9 MPa, more bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are fully hydrogenated so that both rings in the hydrocarbon are hydrogenated and the amount of hydrogen consumed significantly increases and thus there is a concern that the economic efficiency may be impaired due to a decrease in the yield of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and an increase in the building costs for the hydrogenation reactor or peripheral equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0032">The liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of the hydrogenation reaction is preferably in a range of 0.05 h<sup>â1 </sup>to 10 h<sup>â1</sup>. The lower limit is more preferably 0.1 h<sup>â1 </sup>or more and still more preferably 0.2 h<sup>â1 </sup>or more. In addition, the upper limit is more preferably 5 h<sup>â1 </sup>or less and more preferably 3 or less. In a case in which the LHSV is less than 0.05 If % the building cost of the reactor becomes excessive and there is a concern that the economic efficiency may be impaired. On the other hand, in a case in which the LHSV exceeds 10 h<sup>â1</sup>, the hydrogenation treatment of the feedstock oil does not sufficiently proceed and there is a possibility that the target hydride may not be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0033">The reaction temperature (hydrogenation temperature) in the hydrogenation reaction is preferably in a range of 150Â° C. to 400Â° C. The lower limit is more preferably 170Â° C. or higher and still more preferably 190Â° C. or higher. In addition, the upper limit is more preferably 380Â° C. or lower and still more preferably 370Â° C. or lower. In a case in which the reaction temperature is below 150Â° C., there is a tendency that the feedstock oil is not sufficiently hydrogenated. On the other hand, in a case in which the reaction temperature exceeds 400Â° C., the generation of a gas component, which is a byproduct, increases and thus the yield of a hydrogenated oil decreases, which is not desirable.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0034">The hydrogen/oil ratio in the hydrogenation reaction is preferably in a range of 100 NL/L to 2000 NL/L. The lower limit is more preferably 110 NL/L or more and still more preferably 120 NL/L or more. In addition, the upper limit is more preferably 1800 NL/L or less and still more preferably 1500 NL/L or less. In a case in which the hydrogen/oil ratio is less than 100 NL/L, the generation of coke on the catalyst in the reactor outlet proceeds and there is a tendency that the catalyst life becomes short. On the other hand, in a case in which the hydrogen/oil ratio exceeds 2000 NL/L, the building cost of a recycling compressor becomes excessive and there is a concern that the economic efficiency may be impaired.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0035">There is no particular limitation regarding the reaction format in the hydrogenation treatment, generally, the reaction format can be selected from a variety of processes such as a fixed bed and a movable bed and, among them, the fixed bed is preferred since the building cost or the operational costs are inexpensive. In addition, the hydrogenation reaction device preferably has a tower shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0036">A catalyst for the hydrogenation treatment which is used for the hydrogenation treatment is not limited as long as the catalyst is capable of selectively hydrogenating and converting bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the feedstock oil to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (naphthenobenzenes or the like) in which only one aromatic ring is hydrogenated. A preferable catalyst for the hydrogenation treatment contains at least one metal selected from Group 6 metals in the periodic table and at least one metal selected from Groups 8 to 10 metals in the periodic table. The Group 6 metal in the periodic table is preferably molybdenum, tungsten, or chromium and particularly preferably molybdenum or tungsten. The Groups 8 to 10 metal is preferably iron, cobalt, or nickel and more preferably cobalt or nickel. These metals may be singly used or a combination of two or more metals may be used. Specific examples of the combination that is preferably used include molybdenum-cobalt, molybdenum-nickel, tungsten-nickel, molybdenum-cobalt-nickel, tungsten-cobalt-nickel, and the like. The periodic table refers to the extended periodic table specified by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0037">The catalyst for the hydrogenation treatment is preferably a catalyst obtained by supporting the above-described metals in an inorganic carrier containing aluminum oxide. Preferable examples of the inorganic carrier containing aluminum oxide include carriers obtained by adding a porous inorganic compound such as a variety of clay minerals such as alumina, alumina-silica, alumina-boria, alumina-titania, alumina-zirconia, alumina-magnesia, alumina-silica-zirconia, alumina-silica-titania, a variety of zeolites, sebiolite, and montmorillonite to alumina and, among them, alumina is particularly preferred. The inorganic carrier made of a plurality of metal oxides such as alumina-silica described above may be a pure mixture of those oxides or a composite oxide.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0038">The catalyst for the hydrogenation treatment is preferably a catalyst obtained by supporting at least one metal selected from Group 6 metals in the periodic table in a range of 10% by mass to 30% by mass and at least one metal selected from Groups 8 to 10 metals in the periodic table in a range of 1% by mass to 7% by mass in an inorganic carrier containing aluminum oxide in relation to the total catalyst mass which is the total mass of the inorganic carrier and the metals. In a case in which the support amount of the Group 6 metals in the periodic table and the support amount of the Groups 8 to 10 metals in the periodic table are less than the respective lower limits, there is a tendency that the catalyst does not exhibit sufficient hydrogenation treatment activity and, on the other hand, in a case in which the support amounts exceed the respective upper limits, the catalyst cost increases, the supported metals are likely to be agglomerated or the like, and there is a tendency that the catalyst does not exhibit sufficient hydrogenation treatment activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0039">There is no particular limitation regarding the precursor of the metallic species used to support the metals in the inorganic carrier, the inorganic salts, organic metal compounds, or the like of the metals are used, and water-soluble inorganic salts are preferably used. In a supporting step, the metals are supported in the inorganic carrier using a solution, preferably an aqueous solution, of the metal precursor. As a supporting operation, for example, a well-known method such as an immersion method, an impregnation method, or a co-precipitation method is preferably employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0040">It is preferable that the carrier in which the metal precursor is supported be fired after being dried, preferably in the presence of oxygen, and the metallic species is, first, made to form an oxide. Furthermore, it is preferable, before the hydrogenation treatment of the feedstock oil, to form a sulfide with the metal species through a sulfurization treatment called preliminary sulfurization.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0041">There is no particular limitation regarding the conditions of the preliminary sulfurization, but it is preferable that a sulfur compound be added to a petroleum fraction or a thermally-cracked heavy oil (hereinafter, referred to as the preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil) and the compound be continuously brought into contact with the catalyst for the hydrogenation treatment under conditions of a temperature in a range of 200Â° C. to 380Â° C., LHSV in a range of 1 h<sup>=1 </sup>to 2 h<sup>â1</sup>, a pressure applied at the same time as the operation of the hydrogenation treatment, and a treatment time of 48 hours or longer. The sulfur compound added to the preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil is not particularly limited and is preferably dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), sulfazole, hydrogen sulfide, or the like, and approximately 1% by mass of the sulfur compound in terms of the mass of the preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil is preferably added to the preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0043">In the cracking and reforming reaction, the supplied feedstock oil (containing the hydrogenated oil) is brought into contact with the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the feedstock oil and the catalyst are reacted together, and a product containing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0044">[Catalyst for Producing Monocyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon]</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0045">The catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contains crystalline aluminosilicate. The content of the crystalline aluminosilicate in the catalyst may be determined depending on the reactivity or selectivity of a required cracking and reforming reaction or the shape and strength of the catalyst and is not particularly limited, but is preferably in a range of 10% by mass to 100% by mass. The catalyst is used in a fixed-bed reactor and thus may be a catalyst only made of the crystalline aluminosilicate. When a binder is added in order to increase the strength, the content of the crystalline aluminosilicate is preferably in a range of 20% by mass to 95% by mass and more preferably in a range of 25% by mass to 90% by mass. However, when the content of the crystalline aluminosilicate is below 10%, the amount of the catalyst necessary to obtain sufficient catalytic activity becomes excessive, which is not preferable.</p>

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0047">The crystalline aluminosilicate preferably includes a medium-pore zeolite and/or a large-pore zeolite as a main component since the yield of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon can be further increased.</p>

      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0064">In addition, the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is formed in a powder form, a granular form, a pellet form, or the like depending on the reaction format in the cracking and reforming reaction device. In the present invention, a fixed-bed reactor is used, and the catalyst having a granular form or a pellet form is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0065">In a case in which a granular-form or pellet-form catalyst is obtained, it is possible to blend an inactive oxide with the catalyst as a binder as necessary and then shape the catalyst using a variety of shaping devices. For catalysts used in the above-described fixed-bed reactor, an inorganic substance such as silica or alumina is preferably used as the binder.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0066">In a case in which the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contains a binder or the like, a substance containing phosphorous may be used as the binder as long as the content of phosphorous is in the above-described preferable range.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0067">In addition, in a case in which the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contains a binder, it is also possible to mix the binder and the gallium and/or zinc-supported crystalline aluminosilicate or mix the binder and the crystalline aluminogallosilicate and/or crystalline aluminozincosilicate and then add phosphorous, thereby producing a catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0068">[Reaction Format]</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0069">As a reaction format of the cracking and reforming reaction, in the present invention, a fixed bed can be used as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0070">The fixed bed has an apparatus coat that is extremely inexpensive compared with a fluidized bed or a movable bed. That is, the fixed bed has a building cost or operational costs that are inexpensive compared with the fluidized bed or the movable bed. Therefore, while it is still possible to repeat the reaction and production with one fixed-bed reactor, in order to continuously carry out the reaction and reproduction, two or more reactors can be installed.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0071">In the fixed-bed cracking and reforming reaction device, as the cracking and reforming reaction proceeds, coke is attached to the catalyst surface and the activity of the catalyst degrades. When the activity degrades as described above, in the cracking and reforming reaction step, while the yield of an olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms increases, the yield of a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms (BTX fraction) decreases and the total amount of the olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms decreases. Therefore, the reproduction treatment of the catalyst becomes necessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0072">[Reaction Temperature]</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0073">The reaction temperature when the feedstock oil is brought into contact with and is reacted with the catalyst is not particularly limited, but is preferably in a range of 350Â° C. to 700Â° C. and more preferably in a range of 400Â° C. to 650Â° C. When the reaction temperature is lower than 350Â° C., the reaction activity is not sufficient. When the reaction temperature exceeds 700Â° C., the reaction becomes disadvantageous in terms of energy and the amount of coke generated is significantly increased and thus the production efficiency of the target substance is decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0074">[Reaction Pressure]</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0075">The reaction pressure when the feedstock oil is brought into contact with and is reacted with the catalyst is in a range of 0.1 MPaG to 2.0 MPaG. That is, the feedstock oil is brought into contact with the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon at a pressure in a range of 0.1 MPaG to 2.0 MPaG.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0076">In the present invention, since the reaction concept is completely different from that of a method of the related art in which hydrogenolysis is used, a condition of high pressure, which is preferred in hydrogenolysis, is not required. Conversely, a pressure higher than necessary accelerates cracking and produces unintended light gas as a byproduct, which is not preferable. In addition, the non-necessity of the high-pressure condition is also preferred in terms of the design of the reaction apparatus. That is, when the reaction pressure is in a range of 0.1 MPaG to 2.0 MPaG, it is possible to efficiently cause a hydrogen transfer reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0077">[Contact Time]</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0078">The contact time between the feedstock oil and the catalyst is not particularly limited as long as a desired reaction substantially proceeds and, for example, the gas passing time over the catalyst is preferably in a range of 2 seconds to 150 seconds, more preferably in a range of 3 seconds to 100 seconds, and still more preferably in a range of 5 seconds to 80 seconds. When the contact time is shorter than 2 seconds, a substantial reaction is difficult. When the contact time exceeds 150 seconds, the amount of a carbonaceous material accumulated on the catalyst due to coking or the like increases or the amount of light gas generated by cracking increases and, furthermore, the size of the device is also increased, which is not preferable.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0079">[Reproduction Treatment]</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0080">Once a cracking and reforming reaction treatment is carried out for a predetermined time, the cracking and reforming reaction treatment is operated using the other cracking and reforming reaction device and, in the cracking and reforming reaction device stopped to be used for the cracking and reforming reaction treatment, the reproduction of the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having the degraded activity can be carried out. In order to continuously cause the reaction, two or more reactors may be installed or it is also possible to repeat the reaction and reproduction with a single reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0081">Since the catalyst degradation of the catalyst is mainly caused by the attachment of coke to the catalyst surface, as the reproduction treatment, a treatment to remove coke from the catalyst surface is carried out. Specifically, air is circulated in the cracking and reforming reaction device and coke attached to the catalyst surface is combusted. Since the cracking and reforming reaction device is maintained at a sufficiently high temperature, the coke attached to the catalyst surface is easily combusted simply by circulating air. However, when ordinary air is supplied and circulated in the cracking and reforming reaction device, there is a concern of abrupt combustion. Therefore, it is preferable to supply and circulate air having an oxygen concentration decreased by interfusing nitrogen in advance to the cracking and reforming reaction device. That is, as the air used in the reproduction treatment, for example, air having an oxygen concentration decreased in a range of approximately several % to 10% is preferably used. In addition, it is not necessary to equal the reaction temperature and the reproduction temperature and preferred temperatures can be appropriately set.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0082">[Dilution Treatment]</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0083">In the present invention, in the cracking and reforming reaction treatment in the cracking and reforming reaction device, in order to suppress the attachment of coke to the catalyst surface, the feedstock oil is treated in a state in which a saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, for example, methane, coexist. Methane is almost unreactive and thus, even when methane is brought into contact with the catalyst in the cracking and reforming reaction device, a reaction is not caused. Therefore, for the attachment of a heavy hydrocarbon derived from the feedstock oil to the catalyst surface occurring while the catalyst reaction proceeds, the methane acts as a diluting agent that decreases the concentration of the hydrocarbon on the catalyst surface and thus suppresses (hinders) the attachment. Therefore, the methane suppresses the heavy hydrocarbon derived from the feedstock oil being attached to the catalyst surface so as to become coke. In the present application, regarding the coexistence of the feedstock oil and the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, there is no particular limitation regarding the method or configuration of the apparatus therefor as long as both components are introduced into the reactor in a mixture form. Both components are preferably sufficiently mixed since being diluted.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0084">There is no particular limitation regarding the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms which is provided to the cracking and reforming reaction device and it is possible to use saturated hydrocarbons that can be easily procured, for example, in a case in which the thermally-cracked heavy oil from the apparatus for producing ethylene is used as the feedstock oil, methane produced form the same ethylene apparatus and, in a case in which LCO is used as the feedstock oil, off-gas obtained from the fluid catalytic cracking apparatus. In this case, for example, methane gas may be heated to a predetermined temperature in the heating furnace <b>26</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. In addition, it is also possible to collect and use methane produced from the cracking and reforming reaction. As described above, as the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, methane having the lowest reactivity is preferred, but it is also possible to use ethane or propane instead of methane. Other saturated hydrocarbons having 2 or 3 carbon atoms may be jointly used with methane and it is still possible to carry other saturated hydrocarbon gases or the like as long as the gas or the like includes the above-described saturated hydrocarbon as a main component.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0085">The ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms/oil in the cracking and reforming reaction is preferably in a range of 20 NL/L to 2000 NL/L. The lower limit is more preferably 30 NL/L or more and still more preferably 50 NL/L or more. In addition, the upper limit is more preferably 1800 NL/L or less and still more preferably 1500 NL/L or less. In a case in which the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms/oil is less than 20 NL/L, the dilution effect is insufficient and it becomes impossible to sufficiently suppress the attachment of coke to the catalyst surface. On the other hand, in a case in which the ratio of the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms/oil exceeds 2000 NL/L, the size of the cracking and reforming reaction device is increased and thus the building cost thereof increases and a decrease in the production cost of an olefin or BTX is impaired.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0086">Hereinafter, an embodiment of a case in which a thermally-cracked heavy oil from the apparatus for producing ethylene is used as the feedstock oil will be described in detail as an example with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a view for illustrating an example of the apparatus for producing ethylene used to carry out the method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms of the present invention and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a view for illustrating the cracking and reforming process of the apparatus for producing ethylene illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0087">First, the schematic configuration of an example of the apparatus for producing ethylene according to the present invention and a process according to the production method of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>

Therefore, an apparatus produced by adding the cracking and reforming process of the present invention to the existing apparatus for producing ethylene is also included in the scope of the embodiment of the apparatus for producing ethylene according to the present invention. Examples of the well-known apparatus for producing ethylene include the apparatus described in NPL 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0089">The apparatus for producing ethylene according to the present embodiment is also called a steam cracker, a steam cracking device, or the like and, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, includes a cracking furnace <b>1</b> and a product collection device <b>2</b> that separates and collects hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, a C4 fraction, and a fraction containing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms (BTX fraction: cracked gasoline) respectively from a cracked product produced in the cracking furnace <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0090">The cracking furnace <b>1</b> thermally cracks feedstocks such as a naphtha fraction, a kerosene fraction, and a light fraction, produces hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, a C4 fraction, and the BTX fraction, and produces a thermally-cracked heavy oil as a residual oil (bottom oil) heavier than the BTX fraction. The thermally-cracked heavy oil is also called a heavy aromatic residue oil (HAR oil) in some cases. The operation conditions of the cracking furnace <b>1</b> are not particularly limited and the cracking furnace can be operated under ordinary conditions. For example, diluted water vapor is used as a feedstock and the cracking furnace is operated at a thermal cracking reaction temperature in a range of 770Â° C. to 850Â° C. and a retention time (reaction time) in a range of 0.1 seconds to 0.5 seconds. When the thermal cracking temperature is lower than 770Â° C., cracking does not proceed and a target product cannot be obtained and thus the lower limit of the thermal cracking reaction temperature is more preferably 775Â° C. or higher and still more preferably 780Â° C. or higher. On the other hand, when the thermal cracking temperature exceeds 850Â° C., the amount of gas generated abruptly increases, thus, hindrance is caused in the operation of the cracking furnace <b>1</b>, and thus the upper limit of the thermal cracking reaction temperature is more preferably 845Â° C. or lower and still more preferably 840Â° C. or lower. The steam/feedstock (mass ratio) is desirably in a range of 0.2 to 0.9, more desirably in a range of 0.25 to 0.8, and still more desirably in a range of 0.3 to 0.7. The retention time (reaction time) of the feedstock is more desirably in a range of 0.15 seconds to 0.45 seconds and still more desirably in a range of 0.2 seconds to 0.4 seconds.</p>

Therefore, as described below, separately from a thermally-cracked heavy oil illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, it is also possible to directly supply the feedstock oil to a hydrogenation reaction device <b>31</b> or a cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> which is a device that configures the cracking and reforming process <b>21</b> provided behind the early distillation tower <b>30</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0120">A cracking and reforming reaction product derived from the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> contains a gas containing an olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, a BTX fraction, and an aromatic hydrocarbon of C9 or more. Therefore, the cracking and reforming reaction product is separated into the respective components, refined, and collected using a refinement and collection device <b>34</b> provided behind the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0121">The refinement and collection device <b>34</b> includes a BTX fraction collection tower <b>35</b> and a gas separation tower <b>36</b>.</p>

In the gas separation tower <b>36</b>, the light fraction having 8 or less carbon atoms separated in the BTX fraction collection tower <b>35</b> is distilled and separated into a BTX fraction containing benzene, toluene, and coarse xylene and a gas fraction having a boiling point lower than that of the BTX fraction. In the BTX fraction collection tower <b>35</b> and the gas separation tower <b>36</b>, the fractions obtained from the respective towers are retreated and thus it is not necessary to increase the distillation accuracy and it is possible to carry out the distillation operation in a relatively brief manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0123">(Product Collection Step)</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0124">As described above, in the gas separation tower <b>36</b>, since the distillation operation is carried out in a relatively brief manner, the gas fraction separated in the gas separation tower <b>36</b> mainly contains hydrogen, C4 fractions such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene, and BTX. Therefore, the gas fraction, that is, a gas fraction that serves as a part of the product obtained in the cracking and reforming reaction step, is treated again in the product collection device <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. That is, the gas fraction is provided to the thermally-cracked heavy oil separation step <b>3</b> together with the cracking product obtained in the cracking furnace <b>1</b>. In addition, hydrogen or methane is separated and collected by treating the gas fraction mainly using the cracked gas compressor <b>4</b>, the demethanizer tower <b>6</b>, and the like and, furthermore, the gas fraction is treated using the deethanizer tower <b>9</b> and the ethylene-rectifying tower <b>10</b> so as to collect ethylene. In addition, the gas fraction is treated using the depropanizing tower <b>13</b> and the propylene-rectifying tower <b>14</b> so as to collect propylene and is treated using the depentanizer tower <b>17</b>, the debutanization tower <b>18</b>, and the like so as to collect a cracked gasoline (BTX fraction) such as butylene or butadiene.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0125">Benzene, toluene, and xylene separated using the gas separation tower <b>36</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> are provided to the BTX refinement device <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, and benzene, toluene, and xylene are respectively refined and rectified so as to be separated and collected as products. In addition, in the present embodiment, BTX is collectively collected, but may be respectively and separately collected using the configuration of the apparatus and the like in the latter part. For example, xylene may be directly supplied to an apparatus for producing paraxylene or the like instead of the BTX refinement device.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0126">(Recycling Step)</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0127">The heavy fraction (bottom fraction) having 9 or more carbon atoms separated in the BTX fraction collection tower <b>35</b> is returned to the hydrogenation reaction device <b>31</b> through a recycling path <b>37</b> (recycling step) which is recycle means and is again provided to the hydrogenation reaction step together with the light thermally-cracked heavy oil derived from the early distillation tower <b>30</b>. That is, the heavy fraction (bottom fraction) is returned to the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> through the hydrogenation reaction device <b>31</b> and is provided to the cracking and reforming reaction step. In the recycling step (recycling path <b>37</b>), for example, a heavy component having a 90 volume % distillate temperature (T90), as a distillation characteristic, of higher than 390Â° C. is preferably cut back before being provided to the hydrogenation reaction device <b>31</b> (hydrogenation reaction step) and stored with the heavy thermally-cracked heavy oil. Even in a case in which a fraction having a 90 volume % distillate temperature (T90) of higher than 390Â° C. is rarely contained, it is preferable to discharge a certain amount of the fraction outside the system when fractions having a low reactivity are accumulated or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0128">Thus far, the refinement, collection, and recycling to the cracking and reforming reaction step of the cracking and reforming reaction product derived from the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> have been described, but it is also possible to return all the cracking and reforming reaction product to the product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene and collect and treat the cracking and reforming reaction product and, in this case, the installment of the refinement and collection device <b>34</b> is not required. In addition, it is also possible to recycle the heavy fraction (bottom fraction) having 9 or more carbon atoms obtained from the bottom of the BTX fraction collection tower <b>35</b> to the hydrogenation reaction device <b>31</b>, return the fraction having 8 or less carbon atoms obtained from the top of the tower to the product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene, and treat the fractions at the same time.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0129">According to the method for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms of the present embodiment, since a product containing BTX is obtained by bringing the feedstock oil and methane into contact with the catalyst for producing a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon loaded into the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> (fixed-bed reactor) and reacting the feedstock oil and methane, it is possible to suppress the attachment of coke to the catalyst surface and suppress the deterioration of the catalyst by making methane, which is rarely reactive in the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b>, coexist with the feedstock oil so as to act as a diluting agent. Therefore, the production efficiency of BTX can be increased and the frequency of the reproduction of the catalyst can be decreased or the reproduction time can be shortened and thus it is possible to reduce the operational costs of the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the production cost of BTX. In addition, the use of the fixed-bed reactor having a price that is inexpensive compared with a fluidized-bed reactor as the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> can also reduce the production cost of BTX.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0130">In addition, the feedstock oil made of a partially-hydrogenated substance of the thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from the apparatus for producing ethylene is cracked and reformed using the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> and a part of the obtained product is collected and treated in the product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene and thus it is possible to easily collect a light olefin produced as a byproduct from the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> using the existing product collection device <b>2</b> without building a new device. Therefore, an increase in the cost is suppressed and a light olefin can be produced with higher production efficiency. In addition, it is also possible to efficiently produce BTX using the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0131">In addition, since two or more fixed-bed reactors are used as the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> and the cracking and reforming reaction and the reproduction of the catalyst for producing an olefin and a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon are repeated by periodically switching the reactors, it is possible to produce the BTX fraction with high production efficiency. In addition, since the fixed-bed reactor of an apparatus cost that is extremely lower compared with that of the fluidized-bed reactor is used, it is possible to suppress the cost of the configuration of the apparatus used for the cracking and reforming process <b>21</b> at a sufficiently low level. Furthermore, since the light olefin generated together with the BTX fraction can also be easily collected using the existing product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene, it is also possible to produce the light olefin with high production efficiency together with the BTX fraction.</p>

      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0133">For example, in the present embodiment, the thermally-cracked heavy oil obtained from the apparatus for producing ethylene or the partially-hydrogenated substance of the thermally-cracked heavy oil is used as the feedstock oil; however, as the feedstock oil of the present invention, any oils other than the thermally-cracked heavy oil or the partially-hydrogenated substance of the thermally-cracked heavy oil may be used as long as the 10 volume % distillate temperature is 140Â° C. or higher and the 90 volume % distillate temperature is 390Â° C. or lower. Specifically, a cracked light oil (LCO) which satisfies the distillation characteristics and is produced in the FCC apparatus or a partially-hydrated substance of the cracked light oil may be used as the feedstock oil of the present invention. In this case as well, it is possible to reduce the production cost of BTX. In addition, even a mixture of a plurality of the feedstock oils can be used as the feedstock oil of the present application as long as the distillation characteristics of a 10 volume % distillate temperature of 140Â° C. or higher and a 90 volume % distillate temperature of 390Â° C. or lower are satisfied. In this case as well, the production cost of the BTX fraction can be reduced.</p>

      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0135">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a part of the product obtained through the cracking and reforming reaction in the cracking and reforming reaction device <b>33</b> is collected in the product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene, but it is also possible to carry out a collection treatment on the respective components using collection devices in other plants different from the apparatus for producing ethylene instead of carrying out a collection treatment on the product obtained through the cracking and reforming reaction using the product collection device <b>2</b> in the apparatus for producing ethylene.

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">The catalyst A was loaded into a fixed-bed continuous circulation-type reaction apparatus and, first, the preliminary sulfurization of the catalyst was carried out. That is, to a fraction (preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil) corresponding to a straight distillation-based light oil having a density at 15Â° C. of 851.6 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, an initial boiling point of 231Â° C. and a finishing boiling point of 376Â° C. in a distillation test, a content of a sulfur component of 1.18% by mass in terms of a sulfur atom on the basis of the mass of the preliminary sulfurization feedstock oil, and a hue of L1.5, 1% by mass of DMDS in terms of the mass of the fraction was added, and the mixture was continuously supplied to the catalyst A for 48 hours. After that, the thermally-cracked heavy oil A and the cracked light oil B described in Table 2 were respectively used as the feedstock oils and a hydrogenation treatment was carried out at a reaction temperature of 300Â° C., LHSV=1.0 h<sup>â1</sup>, a hydrogen oil ratio of 500 NL/L, and a pressure of 3 MPa. The characteristics of the obtained hydrogenated thermally-cracked heavy oil A-1 and hydrogenated cracked light oil B-1 are described in Table 2.</p>

The obtained mixture was vigorously stirred for 15 minutes using a mixer, a gel was crushed and thus was put into a homogeneous fine milky state.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0153">Next, the mixture was put into a stainless steel autoclave and a crystallization operation was carried out under the self-pressure under conditions in which the temperature was set to 165Â° C., the time was set to 72 hours, and the stirring rate was set to 100 rpm. After the end of the crystallization operation, the product was filtered so as to collect the solid product and washing and filtration were repeated 5 times using approximately 5 liters of deionized water. A solid substance obtained through filtration was dried at 120Â° C. and, furthermore, was fired at 550Â° C. for 3 hours under air circulation.</p>

      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0165">Reactions were caused under the above-described conditions for the times described in Table 3 so as to produce olefins having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons having 6 to 8 carbon atoms (benzene, toluene, and xylene) and the compositional analyses of the products were carried out through an FID gas chromatograph directly coupled to the reaction apparatus so as to evaluate the catalyst activities. The evaluation results are described in Table 3. Here, the olefin refers to an olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms, BTX refers to an aromatic compound having 6 to 8 carbon atoms, the heavy component refers to a product heavier than BTX, and the gas and naphtha other than the olefin refer to products other than the olefin, BTX, and the heavy component.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0166">From the results described in Table 3, it was found that, in Examples 1 to 4 in which the saturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 3 carbon atoms coexisted with the feedstock as a diluting material, it was possible to produce an olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and a monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon having 6 to 8 carbon atoms (benzene, toluene, or xylene) with a favorable yield in contrast to Comparative Examples 1 and 2 in which the saturated hydrocarbon did not coexist. In addition, Table 4 describes the amounts of coke generated in Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 and it was found that the generation of coke was suppressed by the introduction of a diluting agent. That is, when a certain amount or more of the diluting material was introduced, the generation of coke could be suppressed and, consequently, while no huge difference in the yields of the olefin and BTX was caused, the yield of BTX significantly decreased without the diluting material.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0167">Therefore, it was confirmed that, in Examples 1 to 4 of the present invention, it was possible to efficiently produce an olefin and BTX by introducing a light hydrocarbon.</p>
