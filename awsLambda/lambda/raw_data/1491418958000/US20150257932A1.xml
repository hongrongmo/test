      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to the treatment of glaucoma. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to medical devices and methods for creating a drainage pathway to divert aqueous humor out of the anterior chamber of the eye such that pressure within the eye is reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. State of the Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Glaucoma, a progressive ocular disease that manifests itself through elevated intraocular pressure (âIOPâ), is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. When the pressure in the eye remains sufficiently high for a long enough period of time, blindness or total vision loss may occur. If properly treated, the pressure within a glaucomic eye may be reduced and the possibility of blindness may be averted.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The anatomy of the eye is described with reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The eye <b>10</b> includes an iris <b>12</b>, which is a colored circular muscle that controls the size of the pupil <b>21</b>, which is an opening located in the center of the iris <b>12</b>. By adjusting the size of the pupil <b>21</b>, the amount of light that is allowed to enter the eye can be adjusted in response to light conditions. A cornea <b>14</b>, which is a transparent external surface, covers the pupil <b>21</b> and the iris <b>12</b>. The area of the eye above the lens <b>22</b> and under the cornea <b>14</b> comprises the anterior chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The sclera <b>28</b>, which is the white of the eye, is a tough outer membrane that covers the entire eye <b>10</b>, except for the portion of the eye <b>10</b> that is covered by the cornea <b>14</b>. The area or junction where the cornea <b>14</b> merges into the sclera <b>28</b> is known as the limbus <b>25</b>. A portion of the sclera <b>28</b> is covered by a thin tissue called the Tenon's membrane (also called the Tenons Capsule) <b>34</b>, which envelopes the bulb of the eye <b>10</b> from the optic nerve (not shown) to the ciliary body <b>18</b> of the eye <b>10</b>. The conjunctiva <b>36</b> lines the inside of the eyelids (not shown) and overlies the Tenon's membrane <b>34</b> and the sclera <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The trabecular meshwork <b>24</b> is a wedge-shaped structure composed of collagen beams arranged in a three-dimensional sieve-like structure. The beams are lined with a monolayer of cells called trabecular cells. The spaces between the collagen beams are filled with an extracellular substance that is produced by the trabecular cells. These cells also produce enzymes that degrade the extracellular material. The trabecular meshwork <b>24</b> and the Schlemm's canal <b>26</b> are located at or near the angle <b>30</b>, which is the angle formed at the vertex of the iris <b>12</b> and the cornea <b>14</b>. The outer wall of the trabecular meshwork <b>24</b> coincides with the inner wall of Schlemm's canal <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Schlemm's canal <b>26</b> is a tube-like structure that runs around the circumference of the cornea <b>14</b>. In human adults, Schlemm's canal <b>26</b> is believed to be divided by septa into a series of autonomous, dead-end canals. Aqueous humor travels through the spaces between the trabecular beams of the trabecular meshwork <b>24</b>, into Schlemm's canal <b>26</b>, and through a series of collecting channels that drain from Schlemm's canal <b>26</b> and into the episcleral venous system (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The anterior chamber <b>16</b>, which is the space between the iris <b>12</b> and the cornea <b>14</b>, contains a clear fluid called aqueous humor, which is essential for the proper functioning of the eye. Aqueous humor is formed by the ciliary body <b>18</b> which is adjacent to the posterior chamber <b>20</b> of the eye <b>10</b>. The aqueous humor, which is made at a fairly constant rate, passes around the lens <b>22</b>, through the pupil <b>21</b> in the iris <b>12</b> and into the anterior chamber <b>16</b>. The aqueous humor naturally drains out of the anterior chamber <b>14</b> primarily through the trabecular meshwork <b>24</b> and Schlemm's canal <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In a normal patient, aqueous humor production is equal to aqueous humor outflow and intraocular pressure remains fairly constant, typically in the 8 to 18 mmHg range. If the production of aqueous humor is not balanced by its proper drainage, the aqueous humor will build up to a high level of intraocular pressure (or IOP) and cause glaucoma.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Various devices have been designed to treat glaucoma by alleviating the IOP within the eye. Examples of such devices may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,431,709; 7,594,899; 7,837,644; and U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2013/0184631, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">One such device for treating glaucoma will now be described with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. A drainage implantation device <b>100</b> includes a tube <b>102</b> having a lumen <b>104</b> extending lengthwise through the tube <b>102</b>, and a protrusion or fin <b>106</b> extending radially outward from the exterior of the tube <b>102</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The fin <b>106</b> is configured to prevent the tube <b>102</b> from migrating and to prevent the leakage of aqueous humor from around the tube <b>102</b> (i.e., peri-annular leakage) once the device <b>100</b> is implanted in a patient's eye as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The tube <b>102</b> has an inlet end <b>108</b> disposed opposite an exit end <b>110</b>. During implantation, the inlet end <b>108</b> is positioned within the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye, and the exit end <b>110</b> is positioned within a space (or pouch) <b>114</b> that is formed primarily between Tenon's membrane <b>34</b> and the sclera <b>28</b> by physical dissection of the conjunctiva <b>36</b> and Tenon's membrane from the sclera <b>28</b> with scissors as evident from <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The tube <b>102</b> extends through a needle tract <b>116</b> through the sclera <b>28</b> leading to the anterior chamber <b>16</b>. The needle tract <b>116</b> may be formed from a 25 gauge (G) needle (which is approximately 0.020â³ or 0.51 mm in diameter). The inlet end <b>108</b> of the tuber <b>102</b> can have a diameter that is approximately 0.013â³ or 0.33 mm, which is smaller than the diameter of the needle, which facilitates maneuvering of the inlet end <b>108</b> through the needle tract <b>116</b> into the anterior chamber <b>16</b>. The fin <b>106</b> has a diameter than is larger than the diameter of the needle and thus larger than the needle tract <b>116</b>. In this configuration, the fin <b>106</b> may be wedged into scleral tissue of the needle tract <b>116</b> and act as a stopper where the scleral tissue seals against the exterior surface of the fin <b>106</b> and thus prevent peri-annular leakage. Preventing such uncontrolled leakage of aqueous humor out of the anterior chamber <b>16</b> is desirable because hypotony (very low IOP) may otherwise result, thereby damaging the eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The device <b>100</b> may be delivered to the implantation site via a hollow needle. To reduce the possibility of damaging the eye from the insertion of the needle therethrough, it is desirable that the needle be as narrow as possible. However, since the device <b>100</b> is to translate through the needle, the needle must necessarily have a greater diameter than that of the device <b>100</b>. Often, such needles have incorporated slots, extending along the length of the needle to accommodate the fin <b>106</b> of the tube <b>102</b> of the device <b>100</b> as the tube <b>102</b> translates through a lumen extending lengthwise through the needle.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Unfortunately, the use of a slotted, hollow needle may present a few noteworthy challenges and difficulties. For example, a slotted needle may not penetrate the sclera <b>28</b> of the eye <b>10</b> as easily as a needle that does not have such a slot. In particular, the missing section of the slotted needle may impede the insertion of the needle through the sclera <b>28</b>. Therefore, the force necessary to penetrate the sclera <b>28</b> may be greater when using a slotted needle as compared to a needle that does not have such a slot. Since it is desirable that the forces required to insert the needle through the sclera be as small as possible such that the possibility of trauma to the eye is kept to a minimum, the use of a slotted needle poses a challenge. Another challenge may be translating the implant, e.g., device <b>100</b>, to the implantation site as it may be difficult to push a relatively soft tube through a hollow needle because the soft tube may expand sufficiently to become jammed in the hollow space of the needle.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Disclosed herein are systems, devices, and methods for the treatment of ocular pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In an embodiment, a system for the treatment of ocular pressure may include a needle device and an aqueous humor drainage device. The needle device may include an elongate needle body that has a sharp distal end and a proximal end. The needle may have a configuration or shape that is straight or curved, and may have a gauge (or diameter) that is between 30 G and 22 G inclusive (a smaller gauge number corresponding to a larger sized diameter). The aqueous humor drainage device may include an elongate tube with two opposed ends. One end of the tube may be operatively coupled to the proximal end of the needle body. The tube can be flexible and formed from an elastomeric polymer material. The tube can have an outer diameter that is at least as large as (or greater than) the maximum diameter of the needle body or preferably, the tube can have an outer diameter that is at least as large as (or greater than) the maximum diameter of the needle passageway formed by inserting the needle through the tissue of the eye. In one embodiment, the tube can have an outer diameter that is between 100 to 600 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The aqueous humor drainage device can also include one or more protrusions that extend radially outward from the exterior surface of the intermediate portion of the tube. Such protrusion(s) can be bulbous in shape or simple flares or bumps in the tube, if desired. The protrusion(s) can be either symmetrical or non-symmetrical around the axis of the tube. Such protrusion(s) can function to aid in fixing the position of the aqueous humor drainage device in the preferred location in the eye. In addition, the tube can include a visual indicator (such as a mark) that indicates a proper place where the drainage tube should be placed, cut or otherwise trimmed, if needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The aqueous humor drainage device may be formed from a variety of materials. In an embodiment, the tube is formed from a flexible elastomeric polymer material that is capable of bending and assuming the curvature of the eye when implanted therein. Furthermore, the aqueous humor drainage device may be formed from a material that is bio-stable or not bio-reactive. For example, the aqueous humor drainage device may be formed from a synthetic thermoplastic polymer such as a polyolefin, e.g., poly(styrene-block-isobutylene-block-styrene) (SIBS).</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In another embodiment, a method for the treatment or prevention of glaucoma may include providing a system that includes a needle device and an aqueous humor drainage device. The needle device may include an elongate needle body that has a sharp distal end and a proximal end. The aqueous humor drainage device may include an elongate flexible tube with opposed first and second ends. The first end of the tube may be operatively coupled to the proximal end of the needle body. The outer diameter of the tube may be at least as great as the maximum diameter of the needle body. The method may further include inserting the sharp distal end of the needle body through an entrance site in eye tissue to form tissue passageways leading to and from the anterior chamber of the eye, and pushing the needle body through such tissue passageways such that the sharp distal end of the needle body exits from an exit site of tissue spaced from the entrance site and extends beyond the exit site. The exposed portion of the needle body that extends beyond the exit site can be grasped and pulled such that the needle body and tube are pulled through the tissue passageways with at least the first end of the tube that is coupled to the proximal end of the needle body extending beyond the exit site of the needle. A portion of the tube adjacent the first end that extends beyond the exit site is then decoupled from the proximal end of the needle body, for example by cutting the first end portion of the drainage tube at a desired location spaced from the proximal end of the needle body. A drainage bleb (e.g., a blister-like space) can be defined by eye tissue near either the exit site or the entrance site of the needle. For example, the drainage bleb can be defined between the conjunctiva/Tenon's membrane and the sclera over a localized portion of the eye tissue adjacent the exit site or the entrance site. In one embodiment, the drainage bleb is defined by eye tissue near the exit site, and the first end portion of the tube that extends beyond the exit site is positioned such that it is positioned inside the drainage bleb, and the opposed second end of the tube is positioned inside the anterior chamber of the eye. In another embodiment, the drainage bleb is defined by eye tissue near the entrance site, and the first end portion of the drainage tube is positioned inside the anterior chamber of the eye, and the opposed second end of the tube that extends beyond the entrance site is positioned inside the drainage bleb. In either configuration, the tube is positioned such that it provides fluid communication between the anterior chamber of the eye and the drainage bleb to allow for aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye through the tube into the drainage bleb.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Various approaches for implanting the aqueous humor drainage device are disclosed. In one embodiment, referred to herein as an ab interno approach, the distal end of the needle body is inserted into an entrance site at the cornea near the limbus. The needle body is advanced through the cornea and into the anterior chamber, where it is advanced through the anterior chamber under the cornea until the distal end hits the angle of the eye. The needle body is advanced further through the angle into the sclera below the limbus. The needle body is further maneuvered through the sclera below the limbus where its distal tip emerges at an exit site spaced from the entrance site. The needle body is pushed further such that the distal end of the needle body extends beyond the exit site to expose a distal portion of the needle body adjacent the distal end. The exposed distal portion of the needle body that extends beyond the exit site can be grasped and pulled (for example, with a needle clamp) such that the needle body and tube are pulled through the tissue passageways defined by the needle body with at least the first end of the tube that is coupled to the proximal end of the needle body extending beyond the exit site. The opposed second end of the tube is positioned inside the anterior chamber of the eye. The drainage bleb is defined by eye tissue near the exit site. The first end portion of the tube that extends beyond the exit site of the needle is then decoupled from the proximal end of the needle and possibly trimmed if need be. The first end portion of the tube is then positioned such that the end of the tube that extends beyond the exit site is positioned inside the drainage bleb. In this configuration, the tube is positioned such that it provides fluid communication between the anterior chamber of the eye and the drainage bleb to allow for aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye through the tube into the drainage bleb.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In another embodiment, referred to herein as an ab externo approach, the distal end of the needle body is inserted into an entrance site in the conjunctiva near the limbus (or in the sclera near the limbus in the event that the conjunctiva is pulled away from the sclera at the entrance site). The needle body is then pushed such that its distal end advances through the sclera under the limbus until its distal end enters the anterior chamber at or near the angle of the eye. The needle body is further advanced through the anterior chamber of the eye such that it pierces the cornea and emerges at an exit site in the cornea spaced from the entrance site. The needle body is pushed further such that the distal end of the needle body extends beyond the exit site to expose a distal portion of the needle body adjacent the distal end. The exposed distal portion of the needle body that extends beyond the exit site can be grasped and pulled (for example, with a needle clamp) such that the needle body and tube are pulled through the tissue passageways defined by the needle body with at least the first end of the tube that is coupled to the proximal end of the needle extending beyond the exit site. The first end portion of the tube that extends beyond the exit site is then decoupled from the proximal end of the needle. The drainage bleb is defined by eye tissue near the entrance site of the needle. The opposed second end of tube that extends beyond the entrance site can be grasped and pulled such that the opposed first end portion of the tube is positioned inside the anterior chamber of the eye. The second end of tube that extends beyond the entrance site can be trimmed, if necessary, and positioned inside the drainage bleb. In this configuration, the tube is positioned such that it provides fluid communication between the anterior chamber of the eye and the drainage bleb to allow for aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye through the tube into the drainage bleb.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In a still further embodiment, a medicant may be injected or applied to the eye to reduce the possibility of complications from the procedure. The medicant may include, for example, an antiproliferative or antimetabolite agent, e.g., mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil, etc. The medicant may also include other agents such as lidocaine, epinephrine, steroids, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The entrance site (and possibly parts of the tissue passageways leading into the anterior chamber of the eye) can be formed by the needle body or be an incision that was formed in the eye for another procedure, such as an incision for removal of a cataractous lens for traditional phacoemulsification of the natural crystalline lens of the eye.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As used herein, the term âdistalâ is generally defined as in the direction of the eye of the patient, or away from a user of the system, apparatus, and/or device. Conversely, âproximalâ generally means in the direction away from the eye of the patient or toward the user of the system, apparatus, or device. As used herein, the word âdiameterâ refers to the greatest diameter or width of an object along a length thereof, and does not necessarily mean that the object being referred to has a cross-section that is a circle (e.g., the object may have a cross-section that is generally circular or oval-shaped).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Embodiments of an aqueous humor drainage system for the treatment of glaucoma are described herein with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, an aqueous humor drainage system <b>200</b>A may include an aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b> including an aqueous humor drainage tube (or âdrainage tube) <b>202</b>, and may also include a needle device defined by an elongate needle body <b>204</b> operatively coupled to the drainage tube <b>202</b>. For example, one end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> may be operatively coupled to a proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>204</b> by an adhesive, a swagged fitting, a crimping, a whipping, or combinations thereof. The transition of the needle body <b>204</b> to the drainage tube <b>202</b> can be abrupt or the end of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that is coupled to the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>204</b> can possibly be tapered to provide a tapered transition that facilitates smooth pull-through. The drainage tube <b>202</b> can also be molded around the filament of a conventional suture that is coupled to the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>204</b>. The needle body <b>204</b> has a sharp distal tip <b>208</b>. The needle body <b>204</b> is configured to lead the drainage tube <b>202</b> through tissue passageways through eye tissue, which may be formed by the translation of the needle body <b>204</b> through the eye tissue toward an implantation site within the eye. The drainage tube <b>202</b> may be severable or capable of being cut such that the needle body <b>204</b> may be uncoupled from the drainage tube <b>202</b>, wherein the needle body <b>204</b> may be discarded once the drainage tube <b>202</b> is positioned at a desired location. The needle body <b>204</b> may have a sufficiently short length such that it may be used in areas around the cornea <b>14</b> without interfering with the forehead or nose of the patient as may occur if a long, rigid inserter were utilized for the implantation of the drainage tube <b>202</b> in the eye <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The drainage tube <b>202</b> may be configured to be implanted within the eye to divert aqueous humor away from the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye <b>10</b>. The drainage tube <b>202</b> may have generally tubular configuration. In particular, the drainage tube <b>202</b> may have a generally tubular shape having an elongate generally cylindrical shape, and may include a lumen <b>207</b> extending along its length through which fluid may pass. The drainage tube <b>202</b> may have an outer diameter d<sub>T </sub>that is between 100 and 700 Î¼m, inclusive, and may preferably be between 200 and 500 Î¼m, inclusive. The lumen <b>207</b> may have a diameter d<sub>L </sub>that is between 30 and 200 Î¼m, inclusive, and may preferably be between 40 and 120 Î¼m, inclusive. The drainage tube <b>202</b> may have an overall length L that is between 1 and 30 mm, inclusive, and may be trimmed in situ to a desired length that may be between 4 and 15 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The needle body <b>204</b> may have an elongate, generally cylindrical configuration or shape, and may be generally straight as shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>. The needle body <b>204</b> may also include a tapered or pointed distal end <b>208</b> that may facilitate puncturing and insertion of the needle body <b>204</b> through eye tissue without creating an opening that is larger than the gauge of the needle body <b>204</b>. The interior (not shown) of the needle <b>204</b> may be solid or hollow. The needle body <b>204</b> may be formed from any conventional needle material including, but not limited to, a metal, such as stainless steel, chrome plated steel, titanium, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The needle body <b>204</b> may be generally straight, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>. However, the needle body may have any shape or configuration that facilitates the implantation of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. In <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, an aqueous humor drainage system <b>200</b>B is shown that is substantially similar to the system <b>200</b>A except in the ways that will now be described. In particular, the system <b>200</b>B includes needle body <b>205</b> that is generally curved. It is to be understood, that needle bodies having other shapes or configurations may be incorporated into the systems <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B. For example, a needle body having a variety of shapes, for example, multiple curves, may replace the needle body <b>204</b> or <b>205</b> of the systems <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Each of the needle bodies <b>204</b> and <b>205</b> of the systems <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B, respectively, may have a maximal outer diameter d<sub>N </sub>that is relatively smaller than the exterior diameter d<sub>T </sub>of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. In one embodiment, the maximum exterior diameter d<sub>N </sub>of the needle body <b>204</b> or <b>205</b> may have a gauge that ranges from 30 G (approximately 0.0122â³ or 0.3112 mm) to 22 G (approximately 0.02825â³ or 0.7176 mm). The ratio of outer diameter d<sub>N </sub>of the drainage tube <b>204</b> to the outer diameter d<sub>N </sub>of the needle body may be in the range of 1 to 3, and more preferably in the range of 1.1 to 1.8.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The sharp or distal end <b>208</b> of needle body <b>204</b> of system <b>200</b>A or needle body <b>205</b> of system <b>200</b>B may include bevels (not shown) that are capable of cutting a hole through tissue as well as dilating tissue. Moreover, a hole that is formed in tissue as a result of the needle body being inserted through the tissue may correspond to or equal the gauge or thickness of the needle body. When the needle body is retracted from the tissue tract (or tissue passage) which it has formed, the diameter of the tissue tract may shrink. For example, if the needle body is 25 G in diameter, the hole when the needle body is in place may be 25 G. However, upon retraction of the needle body, the tissue tract, which is formed by the insertion of the needle body through the tissue, may shrink to about 27 G. The extent of the shrinkage may correspond to the sharpness and geometry of the distal end of the needle body. Accordingly, the diameter d<sub>T </sub>of the drainage tube <b>202</b> may be approximately the same size or somewhat larger than the diameter d<sub>N </sub>to effectively fill and lodge within the tissue tract to prevent or inhibit peri-annular leakage around the drainage tube <b>202</b> and migration of the drainage tube <b>202</b> from within the tissue tract formed by the needle body. Moreover, the drainage tube <b>202</b> may be formed from a compressible or semi-compressible material such that the drainage tube <b>202</b> becomes elongated in length with a reduced outer diameter as it is pulled through the tissue tract and is biased to return toward its natural length and outer diameter where there is no pulling forces applied to the drainage tube <b>202</b>. In this case, when the pulling of the drainage tube <b>202</b> is ceased with the drainage tube <b>202</b> located in the tissue tract, the drainage tube <b>202</b> can relax back toward its natural original diameter and lodge in the tissue tract thereby preventing peri-annular leakage as well as preventing migration of the drainage tube <b>202</b> within the tissue tract. Moreover, the elasticity of the tissue of the tissue tract may accommodate the reception of a slightly larger sized diameter tube <b>202</b> such that the drainage tube <b>202</b> is received snuggly therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>, one or more protrusions <b>211</b> can extend radially outward from the exterior of the drainage tube <b>202</b> at an intermediate position offset between the opposed ends of the drainage tube. The embodiment of <figref>FIG. 3C</figref> includes one protrusion <b>211</b>. The embodiment of <figref>FIG. 3D</figref> includes two protrusions <b>211</b>A and <b>211</b>B that are spaced apart from one another along the length of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. The protrusion(s) <b>211</b> can be bulbous in shape if desired. Such protrusion(s) can function to aid in positioning and fixing the drainage tube <b>202</b> in the preferred location in the eye. In addition, the drainage tube <b>202</b> can include a visual indicator (such as a mark <b>213</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>) that indicates a proper place where the drainage tube <b>202</b> should be cut or severed or decoupled from the needle and/or trimmed, if needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIG. 3E</figref> shows an aqueous humor drainage system <b>200</b>C that is similar to the system <b>200</b>B with a curved needle body <b>205</b>. The curved needle body <b>205</b> has a triangular cross-section whose apex cutting edge is located on the outside of the needle body curvature. The proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b> is hollow to define a cavity that receives the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. The outer diameter of the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> is less than inner diameter of the hollow cavity of the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>. Adhesive can be applied to the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> before it is inserted into the hollow cavity of the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>, and then the adhesive can be allowed to cure to operably couple the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> to the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>. Alternatively, the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b> can employ a swagged fitting, a crimping, a whipping, combinations thereof or other suitable fastening mechanism that operably couples the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> to the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>. The drainage tube <b>202</b> of the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 3E</figref> includes two anchor sections <b>211</b>Aâ² and <b>211</b>Bâ² that are spaced apart from one another on opposite ends of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. The anchor sections <b>211</b>Aâ² and <b>211</b>Bâ² each have maximum outer diameter d<sub>A </sub>that is greater than the outer diameter d<sub>T </sub>of the intermediate tube section that extends between the two anchor sections <b>211</b>Aâ² and <b>211</b>Bâ² as shown. The end of the anchor section <b>211</b>Aâ² that is located opposite the free end of the drainage tube <b>202</b> (and thus closer to the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>) can have a surface <b>213</b>A with a tapered profile that extends radially outward while tapering away from the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. The end of the anchor section <b>211</b>Bâ² that is located adjacent the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube (and near the proximal end <b>206</b> of the needle body <b>205</b>) can have a surface <b>213</b>B with a tapered profile that extends radially outward while tapering away from the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b>. The tapered surfaces <b>213</b>A and <b>213</b>B of the anchor sections <b>211</b>Aâ² and <b>211</b>Bâ² can function to aid in reducing resistance while pulling the drainage tube through the needle tract defined by the needle body <b>205</b>. The anchor sections <b>211</b>Aâ² and <b>211</b>Bâ² themselves can function to aid in positioning and fixing the drainage tube <b>202</b> in the preferred location in the eye in the same manner described herein with respect to the protrusion(s) of the embodiments of <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The aqueous humor drainage device (tube) as described herein may be formed from a material that is capable of bending and assuming the curvature of the eye once implanted therein. Furthermore, the material forming the aqueous humor drainage device (tube) is preferably relatively bio-inert such that, after implantation, the production of inflammation and fibrosis at or around the implantation site is minimal. In one embodiment, the aqueous humor drainage device may be formed of a bio-stable material, e.g., SIBS (poly(styrene-block-isobutylene-block-styrene). The use of such materials may reduce the possibility that the lumen <b>207</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> may become obstructed over time following its implantation within the eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In other embodiments, the aqueous humor drainage device (tube) may be formed of a synthetic thermoplastic polymer including but not limited to polyolefin, e.g., SIBS, polyethylene, polypropylene, SEBS (styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene), etc. Other materials that may form the aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b> may include polyurethanes, such as polyetherurethanes, polycarbonate urethanes, copolymers of polyurethane with silicone-diols, polyisobutylene-diols, polyfluoro-diols, etc. The aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b> may also be formed of fluropolymers, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), polyvinylidene fluoride or polyvinylidene diflouride (PVDF), etc. Other more rigid polymers that can be pre-shaped, such as polymide, polysulfone, etc., may be used to form the aqueous humor drainage device (tube). Still other materials that may be used to form the aqueous humor drainage device (tube) include biological polymers such as collagen, elastin, gelatin, polysaccharides, etc. The aqueous humor drainage device (tube) can be formed by extrusion molding of the synthetic thermoplastic polymer. Other suitable thermoplastic forming methodologies can also be used such as injection molding, insert molding, solvent casting, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">While it is desirable that the lumen <b>207</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> be free of tissue ingrowth that may block or obstruct the flow of fluid therethrough, an exterior or outer surface of the drainage tube <b>202</b> may be configured to facilitate tissue ingrowth such that the migration or relative motion between the tissue bed and the drainage tube <b>202</b> is prevented, thereby facilitating permanent anchoring of the drainage tube <b>202</b> at the implantation site after its implantation. It may also be advantageous in certain embodiments to have the wall of the tube fenestrated to provide multiple inflow and outflow paths to and from the lumen in the event the ends of the lumen become occluded.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Prior to the procedures for implanting the aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b>, which are described below with reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A to 7</figref>, a fluid, such as a viscoelastic fluid, may be pumped into the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye <b>10</b> to create an enlarged space for the reception of the aqueous drainage system therethrough. The viscoelastic fluid may be removed from the eye by aspiration at the end of the procedure. Moreover, other fluids such as mitomycin C may be injected under the conjunctiva/Tenons to create a hydrated area that functions as a localized drainage bled. Note that this localized drainage bled is formed in a different manner that physical dissection of the conjunctiva <b>36</b> and the Tenon's membrane <b>34</b> of the eye <b>10</b> from the sclera <b>28</b> as described above with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The creation of the drainage bleb can involve swabbing or milking the tissue following the injection to press the raised area toward the limbus of the eye. The aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b> may be implanted in fluid communication with the drainage bleb such that aqueous humor can be diverted from the anterior chamber <b>16</b> into the drainage bleb following the implantation of the aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b>. The injection of Mitomycin C may occur at the time of surgery or preferably 30 minutes to several days prior to surgery to allow the Mitomycin C to soak into the tissue as opposed to forming puddles of Mitomycin C. The reason puddles of Mitomycin C are avoided is to prevent it back-flowing through the drainage shunt into the anterior chamber which can cause trauma to the cornea and other organelles of the eye.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A-4D</figref>, an ab interno approach will now be described that utilizes the aqueous humor drainage system <b>200</b>A of <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> to implant the aqueous humor drainage device <b>201</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, the distal end <b>208</b> of the needle body <b>204</b> may penetrate the cornea <b>14</b> at entrance site I (or, if done subsequent to cataract surgery, a slit in the clear cornea may already be in place at entrance site I). The drainage bled is formed near the exit site E as described below. The needle body <b>204</b> may be pushed such it is advanced through the entrance site I in the cornea <b>14</b> into the anterior chamber <b>16</b> and then through the anterior chamber <b>16</b> until the distal tip <b>208</b> contacts the angle <b>30</b> of the eye <b>10</b>. The needle body <b>204</b> is pushed to advance and maneuver the needle body <b>204</b> through the sclera <b>28</b> below the limbus <b>25</b> such that the distal tip <b>208</b> emerges through the sclera <b>28</b> (and/or any overlying conjunctiva <b>36</b>) at the exit site E. At this point, the distal end of the needle body <b>204</b> extends beyond the exit site E to expose a distal portion of the needle body <b>204</b> adjacent the distal end of the needle body <b>204</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. The exposed distal portion of the needle body <b>204</b> can be grasped and pulled (for example, with a needle clamp (not shown)) such that the needle body <b>204</b> and the drainage tube <b>202</b> are pulled through the tissue passageways defined by the advancement of the needle body <b>204</b> through the tissue of the eye <b>10</b> with at least the end <b>203</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that is coupled to the proximal end of the needle <b>204</b> extending beyond the exit site E as shown in <figref>FIG. 4C</figref>. The exposed distal portion of the needle body <b>204</b> may be grasped and pulled to pull the drainage tube <b>202</b> until a length of the drainage tube <b>202</b> drops below the cornea <b>14</b> and remains in the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye, and a portion of the drainage tube <b>202</b> extends out from the sclera <b>28</b> beyond the exit site E. In this configuration, 1 to 3 mm of the drainage tube <b>202</b> can remain in the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye. Thereafter, the portion of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the exit site E may be severed or cut or otherwise decoupled from the needle body <b>204</b>, and the needle body <b>204</b> may be discarded while leaving the drainage tube <b>202</b> implanted within the eye <b>10</b>. The severing or cutting or decoupling of the drainage tube can occur at a visual indicator (such as visual indicator <b>213</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>). The remaining tail of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the exit site E can then be positioned inside the drainage bleb. The unshaded portion of the eye <b>10</b> in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> illustrate the conjunctiva <b>36</b> can be pushed anteriorly, scrunched up, or retracted toward the limbus <b>25</b> (moved out of the way) to enable the needle to penetrate the conjunctiva posteriorly (towards the head). Penetration posteriorly is preferred as the conjunctiva/Tenons are thicker and will heal quicker with less chance of leakage as compared to an anterior penetration. Once the needle <b>204</b> is severed from the tube <b>202</b>, the conjunctiva <b>36</b> may then be swabbed, moved back, or sutured at or near its initial position such that the exposed end of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the exit site E is positioned inside the drainage bleb and anteriorly from the exit wound. Thereafter, any external opening in the eye, e.g., the entrance site I formed by the needle <b>204</b>, may be sealed, for example, by cauterizing, suturing or gluing such an opening. In this configuration, the drainage tube <b>202</b> is positioned such that it provides fluid communication between the anterior chamber of the eye and the drainage bleb to allow for aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye through the lumen <b>207</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> into the drainage bleb.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 5A-5D</figref>, an ab externo approach will now be described that uses the aqueous humor drainage system <b>200</b>A of <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> to implant the aqueous drainage device <b>201</b>. In an area near the entrance site I where the needle body <b>204</b> is to be inserted, the conjunctiva <b>36</b> may be scrunched up or milked anteriorly to enable penetration of the conjunctiva/Tenons through a thicker section to allow for better healing as well as to locate the conjunctiva wound in an area remote from the end of the drainage tube. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the distal end <b>208</b> of the needle body <b>204</b> may be pushed such that it penetrates through the conjunctiva <b>36</b> (if not retracted) and the sclera <b>28</b> at the entrance site I. The needle body <b>204</b> may be advanced such that the distal tip <b>208</b> is advanced under the limbus <b>25</b> and enters into the anterior chamber <b>16</b> at or near the angle <b>30</b> of the eye and passes through the anterior chamber <b>16</b> under the cornea <b>14</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>.

The exit end portion of the drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the exit site E is then severed or cut or decoupled from the proximal end of the needle body <b>204</b>. The severing or cutting or decoupling of the drainage tube <b>202</b> can occur at a visual indicator (such as visual indicator <b>213</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>). Thereafter, the needle body <b>204</b> may be discarded. The drainage bleb is defined by eye tissue near the entrance site I. The opposed free end of drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the entrance site I can be grasped and pulled such that the opposed exit end portion of the drainage tube <b>202</b> is retracted into a position inside the anterior chamber <b>16</b> under the cornea <b>14</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 5D</figref>. In this configuration, 1 to 3 mm of the drainage tube <b>202</b> can remain in the anterior chamber <b>16</b> of the eye. The free end of drainage tube <b>202</b> that extends beyond the entrance site I can be trimmed, if necessary, and positioned inside the drainage bleb. If the conjunctiva <b>36</b> was pushed anteriorly, scrunched up, or retracted toward the limbus <b>25</b>, the portion of the conjunctiva the may be returned to its initial position, for example, by using sutures or may be forced back into its initial position or simply relax back to its initial position. Thereafter, any external opening in the eye, e.g., the exit site E formed by the needle body <b>204</b>, may be sealed if necessary, for example, by cauterizing, gluing or suturing such an opening. In this configuration, the drainage tube <b>202</b> is positioned such that it provides fluid communication between the anterior chamber of the eye and the drainage bleb to allow for aqueous humor to drain from the anterior chamber of the eye through the lumen <b>207</b> of the drainage tube <b>202</b> into the drainage bleb.</p>
