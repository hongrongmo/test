    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">An article of footwear with an inner bootie that fits into and is strapped into an external shell to form the article of footwear. The inner bootie may have specially-treated regions that together allow the bootie to slip readily into the external shell and to be held firmly in place. When the inner bootie is in place in the external shell, cable loops woven into the lateral side and the medial side of the inner bootie protrude from corresponding openings in the external shell. A lace may then be laced through the cable loops to fasten the throat opening of the external shell over a wearer's foot.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present embodiments relate generally to articles of footwear that may be used for contact sports such as wrestling.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Articles of footwear can generally be described as having two primary elements, an upper for enclosing the wearer's foot, and a sole structure attached to the upper. The upper generally extends over the toe and instep areas of the foot, along the medial and lateral sides of the foot and around the back of the heel. The sole structure may include an insole, a midsole, and an outsole. The insole is in close contact with the wearer's foot or sock, and provides a comfortable feel to the sole of the wearer's foot. The midsole generally attenuates impact or other stresses due to ground forces as the wearer is walking, running, jumping, or engaging in other activities. The outsole generally carries a tread pattern to ensure a firm contact with the ground or playing surface. For some activities, the outsole may also use cleats, spikes or other protrusions to engage the ground or playing surface and thus provide additional traction.</p>

      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one aspect, an article of footwear includes an inner bootie and an external shell. The inner bootie has an ankle opening, a sole, a toe region and a forefoot region. The inner bootie also includes at least one cable loop woven into a lateral side of the inner bootie and at least one cable loop woven into the medial side of the inner bootie. The inner bootie has a perimeter region around at least one of the toe region and the forefoot region, where the perimeter region is configured to detachably attach itself to corresponding interior regions of the external shell. The inner bootie also has a region on a lower surface of the inner bootie that has a smooth surface. The article of footwear also includes an ankle strap attached to a heel region of the external shell that may be laced through slots on the lateral and medial sides of the ankle opening of the inner bootie. The external shell has a longitudinal throat opening and at least one opening on a lateral side of the longitudinal throat opening that corresponds to the at least one cable loop on the lateral side of the inner bootie.

      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of the lateral side of an embodiment of an inner bootie <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, inner bootie <b>200</b> has a toe region <b>202</b>, a forefoot region <b>203</b>, a midfoot region <b>204</b> and a heel region <b>205</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In some embodiments, inner bootie <b>200</b> can include provisions to engage a fastener, such as a lace. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, inner bootie <b>200</b> has lateral cable loops <b>212</b> woven into a lateral side <b>207</b> of inner bootie <b>200</b> and medial cable loops <b>213</b> woven into a medial side <b>208</b> of inner bootie <b>200</b>. Lace <b>168</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) may be laced through lateral cable loops <b>212</b> and medial cable loops <b>213</b> to integrate inner bootie <b>200</b> into external shell <b>300</b>, and to close longitudinal throat opening <b>165</b>, as explained below.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In some embodiments, each cable loop of lateral cable loops <b>212</b> and medial cable loops <b>213</b> may comprise a first portion, a second portion and an intermediate portion. For example, as best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a cable loop <b>231</b> includes a first portion <b>232</b>, a second portion <b>233</b> and an intermediate portion <b>234</b>, where intermediate portion <b>234</b> is disposed between first portion <b>232</b> and second portion <b>233</b>. In some embodiments, first portion <b>232</b> and second portion <b>233</b> both extend from a lower periphery <b>209</b> of bootie <b>200</b> up towards an instep portion <b>237</b> of bootie <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, first portion <b>232</b> and second portion <b>233</b> are embedded within, or otherwise attached to, bootie <b>200</b>. For example, first portion <b>232</b> and second portion <b>233</b> may be woven into bootie <b>200</b>. Intermediate portion <b>234</b> may loop around between first portion <b>232</b> and second portion <b>233</b> in instep portion <b>237</b>. Moreover, in some embodiments, intermediate portion <b>234</b> may be free of bootie <b>200</b>, such that intermediate portion <b>234</b> can move independently of bootie <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, inner bootie <b>200</b> has an entrance slot <b>110</b> and an exit slot <b>111</b> for lateral side ankle strap <b>1601</b> on the lateral side of ankle opening <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, inner bootie <b>200</b> also has an entrance slot <b>1102</b> and an exit slot <b>1112</b> slot on the medial side for the medial side ankle strap <b>1602</b> on the medial side of ankle opening <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Inner bootie <b>200</b> may be configured to slide readily into external shell <b>300</b>. Once bootie <b>200</b> has been inserted into external shell <b>300</b>, lateral side <b>1601</b> of ankle strap <b>160</b> and medial side <b>1602</b> of ankle strap <b>160</b> of external shell <b>300</b> may be inserted though corresponding openings in bootie <b>200</b>. Specifically, as best shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, lateral side ankle strap <b>1601</b> may be inserted through entrance slot <b>110</b> and exit slot <b>111</b> of bootie <b>200</b>. Additionally, as best shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, medial side ankle strap <b>1602</b> may be inserted through entrance slot <b>1102</b> and exit slot <b>1112</b> of bootie <b>200</b>. Lateral side ankle strap <b>1601</b> and medial side ankle strap <b>1602</b> may be further fastened using lace <b>168</b>, as described below, or may be fastened using other fastening means, such as a separate lace, a buckle, buttons, hook-and-loop fasteners or other fastening means.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, when inner bootie <b>200</b> is inserted into external shell <b>300</b>, lateral cable loops <b>112</b> are aligned with lateral openings <b>359</b> on lateral side <b>179</b> of external shell <b>300</b>. Likewise, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, medial cable loops <b>113</b> are aligned with medial openings <b>361</b> on medial side <b>180</b> of external shell <b>300</b>. To further couple bootie <b>200</b> with external shell <b>300</b>, lateral cable loops <b>112</b> may be pulled through lateral openings <b>359</b> (see <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) and medial cable loops <b>113</b> may be pulled through medial openings <b>361</b> in external shell <b>300</b> (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref>). A lace, such as lace <b>168</b>, may then be passed through lateral cable loops <b>112</b> and medial cable loops <b>113</b> to fasten external shell <b>300</b> around the wearer's foot. This also fastens inner bootie <b>200</b> to external shell <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Lace <b>168</b> may be laced through lateral cable loops <b>112</b> and medial cable loops <b>113</b> protruding from openings <b>357</b> on the lateral and medial sides of external shell <b>300</b>, respectively. If lace <b>168</b> is used to also fasten ankle strap <b>1601</b> and ankle strap <b>1602</b>, lace <b>168</b> may then be laced through lateral end ring <b>1611</b> of ankle strap <b>1601</b> and medial end ring <b>1612</b> of ankle strap <b>1602</b>, and tied into a bow to fasten the ankle straps around a wearer's ankle and to close longitudinal throat opening <b>165</b> over the wearer's foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram of the heel of the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, showing article of footwear <b>100</b> with inner bootie <b>200</b> in external shell <b>300</b>. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows ankle straps <b>160</b> attached to the back of heel region <b>155</b> and emerging from just above the upper edge <b>167</b> of external shell <b>300</b> to wrap around heel <b>105</b> of inner bootie <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As seen in <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>, external shell <b>300</b> may be comprised of an upper portion <b>302</b> and a sole portion <b>304</b>. Moreover, in at least some embodiments, upper portion <b>302</b> may be further comprised of one, two or more different portions, where each portion may have different material characteristics. Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, upper portion <b>302</b> of external shell <b>300</b> comprises a base portion <b>368</b>, along with a first overlay portion <b>166</b> and a second overlay portion <b>366</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some embodiments, base portion <b>368</b> may extend throughout the majority of external shell <b>300</b>, though only some portions of base portion <b>368</b> may be visible on an exterior surface of external shell <b>300</b>. For example, as best indicated in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, base portion <b>368</b> may be primarily visible on medial side <b>180</b> of external shell <b>300</b>. In contrast, first overlay portion <b>166</b> and second overlay portion <b>366</b> may only be associated with some portions of upper portion <b>302</b>. In particular, in some embodiments, first overlay portion <b>166</b> and second overlay portion <b>366</b> may be disposed over base portion <b>368</b>. As seen in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, first overlay portion <b>166</b> extends primarily on medial side <b>180</b>, extending through forefoot region <b>153</b>, midfoot region <b>154</b> and heel region <b>155</b> of externals shell <b>300</b>. As best shown in <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, second overlay portion <b>366</b> may extend adjacent to sole portion <b>304</b> on medial side <b>180</b> and lateral side <b>179</b> of external shell <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, first overlay portion <b>166</b> may be made of a first material, second overlay portion <b>366</b> may be made of a second material and base portion <b>368</b> may be made of a third material. In some embodiments, each of the first material, the second material and the third material could have different properties. For example, in some embodiments, the first material may have a lower coefficient of friction than the third material. Also, the second material may have a lower coefficient of friction than the third material. Thus, first overlay portion <b>166</b> and second overlay portion <b>366</b> may be substantially more slippery to the grip of an opponent than base portion <b>368</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In some embodiments, the material properties of the first material and the second material could vary from one another. In some embodiments, for example, the first material making up first overlay portion <b>166</b> could have a lower coefficient of friction than the second material making up second overlay portion <b>366</b>. In other embodiments, first overlay portion <b>166</b> and second overlay portion <b>366</b> could have substantially similar coefficients of friction. By varying the coefficients of friction between first overlay portion <b>166</b> and second overlay portion <b>366</b>, the frictional properties (e.g., the slipperiness) of different portions of external shell <b>300</b> can be varied to impede different ways that an opponent may attempt to grip article <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In some embodiments, external shell <b>300</b> may be made of flexible materials such that inner bootie <b>200</b> and external shell <b>300</b> can conform to each other when assembled, and provide a unitary flexible article of footwear. In some embodiments, in other words, the first material, the second material and the third material comprising first overlay portion <b>166</b>, second overlay portion <b>366</b> and base portion <b>368</b> may each be made of flexible materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Some embodiments can include provisions to enhance the breathability of article <b>100</b>, especially at portions comprised of materials that may include polymers or similar materials that might otherwise block airflow through portions of an upper. In at least some embodiments, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, first overlay portion <b>166</b> may include one or more slots <b>569</b>. Slots <b>569</b> may be openings that allow moisture to escape, since the underlying base portion <b>368</b> may be more breathable than the material comprising first overlay portion <b>166</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, in some embodiments, throat opening <b>167</b> may be biased towards one side of article <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, throat opening <b>167</b> may be biased towards a medial side of article <b>100</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, throat opening <b>167</b> may be biased towards a lateral side of article <b>100</b>. Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, throat opening <b>167</b> extends from the front of opening <b>114</b> towards lateral side <b>179</b> of external shell <b>300</b>. Due to this bias of throat opening <b>167</b> away from the center of article <b>100</b>, a forward end portion <b>190</b> of throat opening <b>167</b> may be disposed further from a central longitudinal axis <b>775</b> of article <b>100</b> than a rearward end portion <b>192</b> of throat opening <b>167</b>. As clearly shown by comparing <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a majority of throat opening <b>167</b> is associated with lateral side <b>179</b>, while a much smaller portion of throat opening <b>180</b> is associated with medial side <b>107</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As clearly indicated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, a longitudinal axis <b>776</b> of throat opening <b>167</b> may form an angle <b>779</b> with respect to central longitudinal axis <b>775</b> of article <b>100</b>. In different embodiments, the value of angle <b>779</b> could vary in a range between 0 degrees (i.e., no biasing) to 45 degrees, for example. In still other embodiments, angle <b>779</b> could be greater than 45 degrees. It is contemplated that some embodiments may utilize a configuration where throat opening <b>167</b> forms an angle approximately in the range between 5 degrees and 30 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">While some embodiments may include a throat opening that may be approximately straight and biased towards lateral side <b>179</b>, other embodiments could include throat openings that are curved or otherwise non-linear in their configuration. In some embodiments, different portions of throat opening <b>167</b> could vary in their angular orientation relative to, for example, central longitudinal axis <b>775</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Biasing the throat opening to the lateral side may have the effect of making it more difficult for an opponent to obtain a firm grasp on, for example, a wrestler's shoe. It is more difficult for an opposing wrestler to obtain a firm grasp on a shoe with a biased throat opening because the opponent's hand has to reach around the apex of the shoe and almost down to the lateral edge of the shoe so that his fingers can grasp the opposite side of the throat opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, a throat opening need not be biased towards a lateral (or medial) side of an article. In an alternative embodiment, depicted in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, an article <b>1100</b> includes similar provisions to article <b>100</b> discussed above and shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-11</figref>.

An ankle strap, such as ankle strap <b>1412</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref> may be laced through entry slot <b>1510</b> and exit slot <b>1511</b> to fasten ankle opening <b>1514</b> of inner bootie <b>1500</b> around a wearer's ankle and to attach inner bootie <b>1500</b> to an external shell.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">
        <figref>FIG. 16</figref> is a schematic diagram of an alternative embodiment of an inner bootie <b>1600</b>, which has just one cable loop on the medial side of the inner bootie and one cable loop on the lateral side of the inner bootie. In this embodiment, the lower portion of cable loop <b>1632</b> is woven into the fabric of the inner bootie towards the rear of midfoot portion <b>1504</b> of the inner bootie. The top portion <b>1634</b> of cable loop <b>1632</b> can then be inserted through a corresponding opening in an external shell, such as openings <b>359</b> and <b>361</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. A lace, such as lace <b>1468</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, may then be laced through openings in an external shell such as openings <b>1467</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. The lace may then be laced through the top portion <b>1634</b> of cable loops <b>1632</b> and through end rings such as end rings <b>1413</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref> to fasten the external shell around a wearer's foot and to attach the inner bootie to the external shell.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, the strobel or upper surface of the bottom portion of the external shell may have portions corresponding to portions of the bottom of the inner bootie. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, a strobel <b>1700</b> of an external shell may have portions that correspond to the bottom of the inner bootie shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. Thus, rounded generally triangular region <b>1722</b> on the top surface of strobel <b>1700</b> may match rounded generally triangular region <b>922</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. Region <b>1722</b>, like region <b>922</b>, may be made of a material that has a relatively low coefficient of friction.

        <figref>FIG. 18</figref> is a schematic diagram of an alternative embodiment of an outsole <b>1800</b> of the external shell. In this embodiment, outsole <b>1800</b> provides enhanced traction at the heel region <b>1805</b>, the forefoot region <b>1803</b> and the toe region <b>1802</b> of the external shell. Outsole <b>1800</b> may also provide a smooth surface <b>1834</b> in the midfoot region <b>1804</b> that would be more difficult for an opponent in a wrestling match, for example, to grip firmly. For example, outsole <b>1800</b> may have a tread pattern <b>1835</b> at its heel region <b>1805</b>, and may also have a similar tread pattern <b>1833</b> in its forefoot region <b>1803</b> and a similar tread pattern <b>1832</b> its toe region <b>1802</b>. It may alternatively have different tread patterns in its heel region, its forefoot region and/or its toe region.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In the embodiment shown schematically in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, outsole <b>1800</b> has openings <b>1840</b> in the forefoot region <b>1803</b>, which expose a lower layer <b>1841</b> (or rand) of the sole. Openings <b>1840</b> provide greater flexibility in the forefoot region of the article of footwear, allowing the footwear to flex longitudinally and/or laterally during an athletic or recreational activity. Tab <b>1850</b>, which may have a smooth surface in this embodiment, is a thin, relatively flexible and supple material that protects the lower layer or rand, and does not significantly affect the ability of the forefoot region of the sole to flex.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The embodiments of the article of footwear shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-18</figref>, when used as a wrestling shoe, may provide significant advantages to a wrestler, because they are light and flexible, because the sole can flex, and because the inner bootie may be removed and washed after use.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In the embodiments described above, the inner bootie may be made of a lightweight flexible and soft material, such as a spacer mesh or a material that has similar properties. In some embodiments, the inner bootie may be made of a moisture-wicking material that wicks away perspiration from the wearer's foot. The external shell may also be made of a malleable and flexible material.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In the embodiments described above, the low coefficient of friction materials may be overlaid over the fabric of the upper, or may be separate materials sewn to, welded to, fused to, or adhesively attached to the breathable fabric of the upper.
