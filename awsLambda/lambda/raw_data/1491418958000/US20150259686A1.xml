      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure provides double-stranded nucleic acid molecules capable of gene silencing and, more specifically, a nicked or gapped double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) comprising at least three strands that decreases expression of a target gene by, for example, RNA interference and uses of such dsRNA to treat or prevent disorders associated with expression of the target gene or genes affected by the target gene.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the cellular process of sequence specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing in animals mediated by small inhibitory nucleic acid molecules, such as a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is homologous to a portion of a targeted messenger RNA (Fire et al., <i>Nature </i>391:806, 1998; Hamilton et al., <i>Science </i>286:950-951, 1999). RNAi has been observed in a variety of organisms, including mammalians (Fire et al., <i>Nature </i>391:806, 1998; Bahramian and Zarbl, <i>Mol. Cell. Biol. </i>19:274-283, 1999; Wianny and Goetz, <i>Nature Cell Biol. </i>2:70, 1999). RNAi can be induced by introducing an exogenous synthetic 21-nucleotide RNA duplex into cultured mammalian cells (Elbashir et al., <i>Nature </i>411:494, 2001a).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The mechanism by which dsRNA mediates targeted gene-silencing can be described as involving two steps. The first step involves degradation of long dsRNAs by a ribonuclease III-like enzyme, referred to as Dicer, into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) having from 21 to 23 nucleotides with double-stranded regions of about 19 base pairs (Berstein et al., <i>Nature </i>409:363, 2001; Elbashir et al., <i>Genes Dev. </i>15:188, 2001b; and Kim et al., <i>Nature Biotech. </i>23(2):222, 2005). The second step of RNAi gene-silencing involves activation of a multi-component nuclease having one strand (guide or antisense strand) from the siRNA and an Argonaute protein to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (âRISCâ) (Elbashir et al., <i>Genes Dev. </i>15:188, 2001). Argonaute initially associates with a double-stranded siRNA and then endonucleolytically cleaves the non-incorporated strand (passenger or sense strand) to facilitate its release due to resulting thermodynamic instability of the cleaved duplex (Leuschner et al., <i>EMBO </i>7:314, 2006). The guide strand in the activated RISC binds to a complementary target mRNA and cleaves the mRNA to promote gene silencing. Cleavage of the target RNA occurs in the middle of the target region that is complementary to the guide strand (Elbashir et al., 2001b).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Target specific gene silencing can be achieved by exogenously adding siRNA, but non-specific silencing of non-targeted genes (referred to as off-target effects) can be a challenge (see, e.g., Jackson et al., <i>Nat. Biotechnol. </i>21:635, 2003; Du et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>33:1671, 2005. Hence, there remains a need in the art for alternative dsRNA molecules and methods to mediate gene silencing. The present disclosure meets such needs, and further provides other related advantages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present disclosure provides dsRNA molecules comprising at least three strands, designated herein as A, S1 and S2 (A:S1S2), wherein S1 and S2 are complementary to, and form base pairs (bp) with, non-overlapping regions of A. Thus, for siRNA molecules described herein; the double-stranded region formed by the annealing of S1 and A is distinct from the double-stranded region formed by the annealing of S2 and A. An A:S1 duplex may be separated from an A:S2 duplex by a âgapâ resulting from at least one unpaired nucleotide in the A strand that is positioned between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex and that is distinct from any one or more unpaired nucleotide at the 3â² end of either or both of the A, S1, and/or S2 strand. Alternatively, an A:S1 duplex may be separated from an A:S2 duplex by a ânickâ such that there are no unpaired nucleotides in the A strand that are positioned between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex such that the only unpaired nucleotide, if any, is at the 3â² end of either or both of the A, S1, and/or S2 strand.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one aspect, the instant disclosure provides a meroduplex RNA (mdRNA) molecule, comprising a first strand that is complementary to a target RNA, and a second strand and a third strand that are each complementary to non-overlapping regions of the first strand, wherein the second strand and third strands can anneal with the first strand to form at least two double-stranded regions separated by a gap of up to 10 nucleotides, and wherein (a) at least one double-stranded region is from about 5 base pairs up to 13 base pairs, or (b) the double-stranded regions combined total about 15 base pairs to about 40 base pairs and the mdRNA molecule comprises blunt ends. In certain embodiments, the first strand is about 15 to about 40 nucleotides in length, and the second and third strands are each, individually, about 5 to about 20 nucleotides, wherein the combined length of the second and third strands is about 15 nucleotides to about 40 nucleotides. In other embodiments, the mdRNA is a RISC activator (e.g., the first strand has about 15 nucleotides to about 25 nucleotides) or a Dicer substrate (e.g., the first strand has about 26 nucleotides to about 40 nucleotides). In some embodiments, the gap comprises at least one to ten unpaired nucleotides in the first strand positioned between the double-stranded regions formed by the second and third strands when annealed to the first strand, or the gap comprises a nick. In certain embodiments, the nick or gap is located 10 nucleotides from the 5â²-end of the first (antisense) strand or at the Argonaute cleavage site. In another embodiment, the meroduplex nick or gap is positioned such that the thermal stability is maximized for the first and second strand duplex and for the first and third strand duplex as compared to the thermal stability of such meroduplexes having a nick or gap in a different position.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0028">The instant disclosure provides gapped double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) comprising at least three strands that is a suitable substrate for Dicer or for association with RISC and, therefore, may be advantageously employed for gene silencing via, for example, the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. That is, partially duplexed dsRNA molecules described herein (also referred to as meroduplexes or meromers having a nick or gap in at least one strand) are capable of initiating an RNAi cascade that modifies (e.g., reduces) expression of a target messenger RNA (mRNA) or a family of related target mRNAs. The gene silencing functionality of such a structure was unpredictable since the thermodynamically less stable nicked or gapped dsRNA passenger strand (as compared to an intact dsRNA) would be expected to fall apart before any gene silencing occurred (see, e.g., Leuschner et al., <i>EMBO </i>7:314, 2006; Bramsen et al., <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>35:5886, 2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0029">Meroduplex ribonucleic acid (mdRNA) molecules described herein include a first (antisense) strand that is complementary to a target mRNA, along with second and third strands (together forming a gapped sense strand) that are each complementary to non-overlapping regions of the first strand, wherein the second and third strands can anneal with the first strand to form at least two double-stranded regions separated by a gap, and wherein at least one double-stranded region is from about 5 base pairs to 15 base pairs, or the combined double-stranded regions total about 15 base pairs to about 40 base pairs and the mdRNA is blunt-ended.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0030">The gap can be from zero nucleotides (i.e., a nick in which only a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides is broken in a polynucleotide molecule) up to about 10 nucleotides (i.e., the first strand will have at least non-terminal unpaired nucleotide). In certain embodiments, the nick or gap is located about 10 nucleotides from the 5â²-end of the first (antisense) strand or at the Argonaute cleavage site. In another embodiment, the meroduplex nick or gap is positioned such that the thermal stability is maximized for the first and second strand duplex and for the first and third strand duplex as compared to the thermal stability of such meroduplexes having a nick or gap in a different position.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0031">Also provided herein are methods of using such dsRNA to reduce expression of a target gene, or one or more genes that are a part of the target gene family, in a cell or to treat or prevent diseases or disorders associated with expression of one or more target gene family members, such as hyperproliferative disorders (e.g., cancer), inflammatory conditions (e.g., arthritis), respiratory disease, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, allergic disorders, neurologic disease, infectious disease (e.g., viral infection, such as influenza), renal disease, transplant rejection, or any other disease or condition that responds to modulation of a target gene or gene family.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0032">Prior to introducing more detail into this disclosure, it may be helpful to an appreciation thereof to provide definitions of certain terms to be used herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0033">In the present description, any concentration range, percentage range, ratio range, or integer range is to be understood to include the value of any integer within the recited range and, when appropriate, fractions thereof (such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer), unless otherwise indicated. Also, any number range recited herein relating to any physical feature, such as polymer subunits, size or thickness, are to be understood to include any integer within the recited range, unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, âaboutâ or âconsisting essentially ofâ meanÂ±20% of the indicated range, value, or structure, unless otherwise indicated. As used herein, the terms âincludeâ and âcompriseâ are open-ended and are used synonymously. It should be understood that the terms âaâ and âanâ as used herein refer to âone or moreâ of the enumerated components. The use of the alternative (e.g., âorâ) should be understood to mean either one, both, or any combination thereof of the alternatives.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0034">As used herein, âcomplementaryâ refers to a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bond(s) with another nucleic acid molecule or itself by either traditional Watson-Crick base pairing or other non-traditional types of pairing (e.g., Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding) between complementary nucleosides or nucleotides. In reference to the nucleic molecules of the present disclosure, the binding free energy for a nucleic acid molecule with its complementary sequence is sufficient to allow the relevant function of the nucleic acid molecule to proceed, for example, RNAi activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the nucleic acid molecule (e.g., dsRNA) to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, or under conditions in which the assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays (e.g., hybridization assays). Determination of binding free energies for nucleic acid molecules is well known in the art (see, e.g., Turner et al., <i>CSH Symp. Quant. Biol. LII:</i>123, 1987; Frier et al., <i>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </i>83:9373, 1986; Turner et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>109:3783, 1987). Thus, âcomplementaryâ or âspecifically hybridizableâ or âspecifically bindsâ are terms that indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., dsRNA) and a DNA or RNA target. It is understood in the art that a nucleic acid molecule need not be 100% complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence to be specifically hybridizable or to specifically bind. That is, two or more nucleic acid molecules may be less than fully complementary and is indicated by a percentage of contiguous residues in a nucleic acid molecule that can form hydrogen bonds with a second nucleic acid molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0035">For example, a first nucleic acid molecule may have 10 nucleotides and a second nucleic acid molecule may have 10 nucleotides, then base pairing of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 nucleotides between the first and second nucleic acid molecules, which may or may not form a contiguous double-stranded region, represents 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% complementarity, respectively. In certain embodiments, complementary nucleic acid molecules may have wrongly paired basesâthat is, bases that cannot form a traditional Watson-Crick base pair or other non-traditional types of pair (i.e., âmismatchedâ bases). For instance, fully complementary nucleic acid molecules may be identified as having a certain number of âmismatches,â such as zero or about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4 or about 5.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0036">âPerfectlyâ or âfullyâ complementary nucleic acid molecules means those in which a certain number of nucleotides of a first nucleic acid molecule hydrogen bond (anneal) with the same number of residues in a second nucleic acid molecule to form a contiguous double-stranded region. For example, two or more fully complementary nucleic acid molecule strands can have the same number of nucleotides (i.e., have the same length and form one double-stranded region, with or without an overhang) or have a different number of nucleotides (e.g., one strand may be shorter than but fully contained within a second strand or one strand may overhang the second strand).</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0037">As used herein, âribonucleic acidâ or âRNAâ means a nucleic acid molecule comprising at least one ribonucleotide molecule. It should be understood that âribonucleotideâ refers to a nucleotide with a hydroxyl group at the 2â²-position of a Î²-<smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-ribofuranose moiety. The term RNA includes double-stranded (ds) RNA, single-stranded (ss) RNA, isolated RNA (such as partially purified RNA, essentially pure RNA, synthetic RNA, recombinantly produced RNA), altered RNA (which differs from naturally occurring RNA by the addition, deletion, substitution or alteration of one or more nucleotides), or any combination thereof. For example, such altered RNA can include addition of non-nucleotide material, such as at one or both ends of an RNA molecule, internally at one or more nucleotides of the RNA, or any combination thereof. Nucleotides in RNA molecules of the instant disclosure can also comprise non-standard nucleotides, such as naturally occurring nucleotides, non-naturally occurring nucleotides, chemically-modified nucleotides, deoxynucleotides, or any combination thereof. These altered RNAs may be referred to as analogs or analogs of RNA containing standard nucleotides (i.e., standard nucleotides, as used herein, are considered to be adenine, cytidine, guanidine, thymidine, and uridine).</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0038">The term âdsRNAâ as used herein, which is interchangeable with âmdRNA,â refers to any nucleic acid molecule comprising at least one ribonucleotide and is capable of inhibiting or down regulating gene expression, for example, by promoting RNA interference (âRNAiâ) or gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner. The dsRNAs (mdRNAs) of the instant disclosure may be suitable substrates for Dicer or for association with RISC to mediate gene silencing by RNAi. One or both strands of the dsRNA can further comprise a terminal phosphate group, such as a 5â²-phosphate or 5â²,3â²-diphosphate. As used herein, dsRNA molecules, in addition to at least one ribonucleotide, can further include substitutions, chemically-modified nucleotides, and non-nucleotides. In certain embodiments, dsRNA molecules comprise ribonucleotides up to about 100% of the nucleotide positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0039">In addition, as used herein, the term dsRNA is meant to be equivalent to other terms used to describe nucleic acid molecules that are capable of mediating sequence specific RNAi, for example, meroduplex RNA (mdRNA), nicked dsRNA (ndsRNA), gapped dsRNA (gdsRNA), short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), siRNA, micro-RNA (miRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), short interfering oligonucleotide, short interfering substituted oligonucleotide, short interfering modified oligonucleotide, chemically-modified dsRNA, post-transcriptional gene silencing RNA (ptgsRNA), or the like. The term âlarge double-stranded (ds) RNAâ refers to any double-stranded RNA longer than about 40 base pairs (bp) to about 100 bp or more, particularly up to about 300 bp to about 500 bp. The sequence of a large dsRNA may represent a segment of an mRNA or an entire mRNA. A double-stranded structure may be formed by self-complementary nucleic acid molecule or by annealing of two or more distinct complementary nucleic acid molecule strands.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0040">In one aspect, a dsRNA comprises two separate oligonucleotides, comprising a first strand (antisense) and a second strand (sense), wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary (i.e., each strand comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in the other strand and the two separate strands form a duplex or double-stranded structure, for example, wherein the double-stranded region is about 15 to about 24 or 25 base pairs or about 25 or 26 to about 40 base pairs); the antisense strand comprises a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to a nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof; and the sense strand comprises a nucleotide sequence corresponding (i.e., homologous) to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof (e.g., a sense strand of about 15 to about 25 nucleotides or about 26 to about 40 nucleotides corresponds to the target nucleic acid or a portion thereof).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0041">In another aspect, the dsRNA is assembled from a single oligonucleotide in which the self-complementary sense and antisense strands of the dsRNA are linked by together by a nucleic acid based-linker or a non-nucleic acid-based linker. In certain embodiments, the first (antisense) and second (sense) strands of the dsRNA molecule are covalently linked by a nucleotide or non-nucleotide linker as described herein and known in the art. In other embodiments, a first dsRNA molecule is covalently linked to at least one second dsRNA molecule by a nucleotide or non-nucleotide linker known in the art, wherein the first dsRNA molecule can be linked to a plurality of other dsRNA molecules that can be the same or different, or any combination thereof. In another embodiment, the linked dsRNA may include a third strand that forms a meroduplex with the linked dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0042">In still another aspect, dsRNA molecules described herein form a meroduplex RNA (mdRNA) having three or more strands such as, for example, an âAâ (first or antisense) strand, âS1â (second) strand, and âS2â (third) strand in which the âS1â and âS2â strands are complementary to and form base pairs (bp) with non-overlapping regions of the âAâ strand (e.g., an mdRNA can have the form of A:S1S2). The S1, S2, or more strands together essentially comprise a sense strand to the âAâ strand. The double-stranded region formed by the annealing of the âS1â and âAâ strands is distinct from and non-overlapping with the double-stranded region formed by the annealing of the âS2â and âAâ strands. An mdRNA molecule is a âgappedâ molecule, meaning a âgapâ ranging from 0 nucleotides up to about 10 nucleotides. In one embodiment, the A:S1 duplex is separated from the A:S2 duplex by a gap resulting from at least one unpaired nucleotide (up to about 10 unpaired nucleotides) in the âAâ strand that is positioned between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplex and that is distinct from any one or more unpaired nucleotide at the 3â²-end of one or more of the âAâ, âS1â, or âS2â strands. In another embodiment, the A:S1 duplex is separated from the A:S2 duplex by a gap of zero nucleotides (i.e., a nick in which only a phosphodiester bond between two nucleotides is broken or missing in the polynucleotide molecule) between the A:S1 duplex and the A:S2 duplexâwhich can also be referred to as nicked dsRNA (ndsRNA). For example, A:S1S2 may be comprised of a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions that combined total about 14 base pairs to about 40 base pairs and the double-stranded regions are separated by a gap of about 0 to about 10 nucleotides, optionally having blunt ends, or A:S1S2 may comprise a dsRNA having at least two double-stranded regions separated by a gap of up to 10 nucleotides wherein at least one of the double-stranded regions comprises between about 5 base pairs and 13 base pairs.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0043">A dsRNA or large dsRNA may include a substitution or modification in which the substitution or modification may be in a phosphate backbone bond, a sugar, a base, or a nucleoside.

In more detailed embodiments, this disclosure provides small nucleic acid molecules, such as short interfering nucleic acid (siNA), short interfering RNA (siRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), nicked double-stranded RNA (ndsRNA), gapped double-stranded RNA (gdsRNA), microRNA (miRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules, or any combination thereof, which have a at least one nick or gap and alter expression of a target gene or family of genes to prevent, treat, or alleviate symptoms of a disease or disorder in a subject (e.g., human). Within these and related therapeutic compositions and methods, the use of nicked or gapped dsRNAs (which have been optionally substituted or modified) will often improve properties of the dsRNA molecules in comparison to the properties of native dsRNA molecules, such as reduced off-target effects, reduced interferon response, increased resistance to nuclease degradation in vivo, improved cellular uptake, increased potency, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0093">In particular embodiments, there are provided methods of treating or preventing diseases, disorders, or conditions related to gene expression, including those related, or responsive, to the level of a target nucleic acid molecule (e.g., mRNA) in a cell or tissue, by administering a gapped dsRNA (mdRNA) molecule of this disclosure, alone or in combination with an adjunctive therapy, in an amount sufficient to activate target gene-specific RNAi. In one embodiment, there is provided a method of treating or preventing a disease or disorder by administering a dsRNA molecule that is capable of target gene-specific RNAi, which dsRNA has at least one substitution or modification as described herein and has a reduced or minimal off-target effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0094">The âpercent identityâ between two or more nucleic acid sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=number of identical positions/total number of positionsÃ100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap that needs to be introduced to optimize alignment of two or more sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two or more sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm, such as BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs at their default parameters (e.g., Altschul et al., <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403, 1990; see also BLASTN at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).</p>

In certain embodiments of the instant disclosure, a single dsRNA can be used to knockdown mRNA expression of one or more target gene family member.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0098">In some embodiments, the dsRNA comprises at least three strands in which the first strand comprises about 5 nucleotides to about 40 nucleotides, and the second and third strands include each, individually, about 5 nucleotides to about 20 nucleotides, wherein the combined length of the second and third strands is about 15 nucleotides to about 40 nucleotides.

      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0100">The introduction of substituted and modified nucleotides into mdRNA and dsRNA molecules of this disclosure provides a tool for overcoming potential limitations of in vivo stability and bioavailability inherent to native RNA molecules (i.e., having standard nucleotides) that are exogenously delivered. In certain embodiments, the use of substituted or modified dsRNA molecules of this disclosure can enable a lower dose of a particular nucleic acid molecule for a given therapeutic effect since of dsRNA molecules may be designed to have an increased melting temperature or half-life in a subject or biological samples (e.g., serum). Furthermore, certain substitutions or modifications can be used to improve the bioavailability of dsRNA by targeting particular cells or tissues or improving cellular uptake of the dsRNA molecules. Therefore, even if the activity of a dsRNA molecule of this disclosure is reduced as compared to a native RNA molecule, the overall activity of the substituted or modified dsRNA molecule can be greater than that of the native RNA molecule due to improved stability or delivery of the molecule. The mdRNA structure may result in a reduced interferon response, and substituted and modified dsRNA can also minimize the possibility of activating an interferon response in, for example, humans.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0101">In certain embodiments, a dsRNA molecule of this disclosure has at least one uridine, at least three uridines, or each and every uridine (i.e., all uridines) of the first (antisense) strand of the dsRNA substituted or replaced with 5-methyluridine or 2-thioribothymidine.

In certain embodiments, the 3â²-end comprising one or more deoxyribonucleotide is in an mdRNA molecule and is either in the gap, not in the gap, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, dsRNA molecules or analogs thereof have a blunt end at one or both ends of the dsRNA. In certain embodiments, the 5â²-end of the first or second strand is phosphorylated.

In certain embodiments, the overhang may be at the 3â²end or the 5â²end. The total length of dsRNAs having overhangs is expressed as the sum of the length of the paired double-stranded portion together with the overhanging nucleotides. For example, if a 19 base pair dsRNA has a two nucleotide overhang at both ends, the total length is expressed as 21-mer. Furthermore, since the overhanging sequence may have low specificity to one or more target gene, it is not necessarily complementary (antisense) or identical (sense) to a target gene sequence. In further embodiments, a dsRNA of this disclosure that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi may further comprise a low molecular weight structure (e.g., a natural RNA molecule such as a tRNA, rRNA or viral RNA, or an artificial RNA molecule) at, for example, one or more overhanging portion of the dsRNA.</p>

In this regard, each of the sense and antisense strands can incorporate about 1 to about 6 or more of the substituted pyrimidine nucleosides.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0125">In certain embodiments, when two or more substituted pyrimidine nucleosides are incorporated within a dsRNA of this disclosure, at least one of the substituted pyrimidine nucleosides will be at a 3â² or 5â²end of one or both strands, and in certain embodiments at least one of the substituted pyrimidine nucleosides will be at a 5â²end of one or both strands. In other embodiments, the substituted pyrimidine nucleosides are located at a position corresponding to a position of a pyrimidine in an unmodified dsRNA that is constructed as a homologous sequence for targeting a cognate mRNA, as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0126">In addition, the terminal structure of the dsRNAs of this disclosure may have a stem-loop structure in which ends of one side of the dsRNA molecule are connected by a linker nucleic acid, e.g., a linker RNA. The length of the double-stranded region (stem-loop portion) can be, for example, about 15 to about 49 basepairs (bp), about 15 to about 35 bp, or about 21 to about 30 bp long. Alternatively, the length of the double-stranded region that is a final transcription product of dsRNAs to be expressed in a target cell may be, for example, approximately about 15 to about 49 bp, about 15 to about 35 bp, or about 21 to about 30 bp long. When linker segments are employed, there is no particular limitation in the length of the linker as long as it does not hinder pairing of the stem portion. For example, for stable pairing of the stem portion and suppression of recombination between DNAs coding for this portion, the linker portion may have a clover-leaf tRNA structure. Even if the linker has a length that would hinder pairing of the stem portion, it is possible, for example, to construct the linker portion to include introns so that the introns are excised during processing of a precursor RNA into mature RNA, thereby allowing pairing of the stem portion. In the case of a stem-loop dsRNA, either end (head or tail) of RNA with no loop structure may have a low molecular weight RNA. As described above, these low molecular weight RNAs may include a natural RNA molecule, such as tRNA, rRNA or viral RNA, or an artificial RNA molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0127">A dsRNA molecule may be comprised of a circular nucleic acid molecule, wherein the dsRNA is about 38 to about 70 nucleotides in length having from about 18 to about 23 base pairs (e.g., about 19 to about 21) wherein the circular oligonucleotide forms a dumbbell shaped structure having about 19 base pairs and two loops. In certain embodiments, a circular dsRNA molecule contains two loop motifs, wherein one or both loop portions of the dsRNA molecule is biodegradable. For example, a circular dsRNA molecule of this disclosure is designed such that degradation of the loop portions of the dsRNA molecule in vivo can generate a double-stranded dsRNA molecule with 3â²terminal overhangs, such as 3â²terminal nucleotide overhangs comprising from about 1 to about 4 (unpaired) nucleotides.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0128">Substituting pyrimidine nucleosides into a dsRNA according to this disclosure can be chosen to increase resistance to enzymatic degradation, such as exonucleolytic degradation, including 5â²exonucleolytic or 3â²exonucleolytic degradation. As such, the dsRNAs described herein will exhibit significant resistance to enzymatic degradation compared to a corresponding dsRNA having standard nucleotides, and will thereby possess greater stability, increased half-life, and greater bioavailability in physiological environments (e.g., when introduced into a eukaryotic target cell). In addition to increasing resistance of the substituted or modified dsRNAs to exonucleolytic degradation, the incorporation of one or more pyrimidine nucleosides according to Formula I or II will render dsRNAs can make these molecules more stable and bioavailable than otherwise identical dsRNAs that do not include the substitutions or modifications. In related aspects of this disclosure, dsRNA substitutions or modifications described herein are chosen to improve stability of a modified dsRNA for use within research, diagnostic and treatment methods wherein the modified dsRNA is contacted with a biological sample, for example, a mammalian cell, intracellular compartment, serum or other extracellular fluid, tissue, or other in vitro or in vivo physiological compartment or environment. In one embodiment, diagnosis is performed on an isolated biological sample. In another embodiment, the diagnostic method is performed in vitro. In a further embodiment, the diagnostic method is not performed (directly) on a human or animal body.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0129">In addition to increasing stability of substituted or modified dsRNAs, incorporation of one or more pyrimidine nucleosides according to Formula I or II in a dsRNA designed for gene silencing can be used to yield additional desired functional results, including increasing a melting point of a substituted or modified dsRNA compared to a corresponding, unmodified dsRNA. By thus increasing a dsRNA melting point, the subject substitutions or modifications will often block or reduce the occurrence or extent of partial dehybridization of the substituted or modified dsRNA (that would ordinarily occur and render the unmodified dsRNA more vulnerable to degradation by certain exonucleases), thereby increasing the stability of the substituted or modified dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0130">In another aspect of this disclosure, the mdRNA structure can be used to reduce off-target effects, which can be improved with substitutions or modifications described herein, when the mdRNA are contacted with a biological sample (e.g., when introduced into a target eukaryotic cell having specific, and non-specific mRNA species present as potential specific and non-specific targets). Similarly, the mdRNA structure can be used to reduce interferon activation, which can be improved with substitutions or modifications described herein, when the mdRNA is contacted with a biological sample, for example, when introduced into a eukaryotic cell. Hence, substituted or modified dsRNAs (mdRNAs) according to this disclosure are employed in methods of gene silencing, wherein the substituted or modified dsRNAs exhibit reduced or undetectable off-target effects or reduced interferon response compared to a corresponding dsRNA lack a nick or gap or modification.</p>

These and other multiple substitutions or modifications according to Formula I or II can be introduced into one or more pyrimidines, or into any combination and up to all pyrimidines present in one or both strands of a dsRNA, so long as the dsRNA retains RNAi activity.</p>

Additionally, any of these multiple modification embodiments may have these multiple modifications on one strand, two strands, three strands, a plurality of strand, or all strands. Finally, in any of these multiple modification dsRNA, the dsRNA must retain gene silencing activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0135">Within certain aspects, the present disclosure provides dsRNA that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi, and compositions comprising one or more dsRNA, wherein at least one dsRNA comprises one or more universal-binding nucleotide(s) in the first, second or third position in the anti-codon of the antisense strand of the dsRNA duplex and wherein the dsRNA is capable of specifically binding to one or more target sequence, such as an RNA expressed by a target cell. In cases wherein the sequence of a target RNA includes one or more single nucleotide substitutions, dsRNA comprising a universal-binding nucleotide retains its capacity to specifically bind a target RNA, thereby mediating gene silencing and, as a consequence, overcoming escape of the target from dsRNA-mediated gene silencing. Non-limiting examples of universal-binding nucleotides that may be suitably employed in the compositions and methods disclosed herein include inosine, 1-Î²-<smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-ribofuranosyl-5-nitroindole, and 1-Î²-<smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-ribofuranosyl-3-nitropyrrole. For the purpose of the present disclosure, a universal-binding nucleotide is a nucleotide that can form a hydrogen bonded nucleotide pair with more than one nucleotide type.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0136">Non-limiting examples for the above compositions includes modifying the anti-codons for tyrosine (AUA) or phenylalanine (AAA or GAA), cysteine (ACA or GCA), histidine (AUG or GUG), asparagine (AUU or GUU), isoleucine (UAU) and aspartate (AUC or GUC) within the anti-codon of the antisense strand of the dsRNA molecule.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0137">For example, within certain embodiments, the isoleucine anti-codon UAU, for which AUA is the cognate codon, may be modified such that the third-position uridine (U) nucleotide is substituted with the universal-binding nucleotide inosine I to create the anti-codon UAI. Inosine is an exemplary universal-binding nucleotide that can pair with an adenosine (A), uridine (U), and cytidine (C) nucleotide, but not guanosine (G). This modified anti-codon UAI increases the specific-binding capacity of the dsRNA molecule and thus permits the dsRNA to pair with mRNAs having any one of AUA, UUA, and CUA in the corresponding position of the coding strand thereby expanding the number of available RNA degradation targets to which the dsRNA may specifically bind.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0138">Alternatively, the anti-codon AUA may also or alternatively be modified by substituting a universal-binding nucleotide in the third or second position of the anti-codon such that the anti-codon(s) represented by UAI (third position substitution) or UIU (second position substitution) to generate dsRNA that are capable of specifically binding to AUA, CUA and UUA and AAA, ACA and AUA.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0139">In certain aspects, dsRNA disclosed herein can include between about 1 universal-binding nucleotide and about 10 universal-binding nucleotides. Within certain aspects, the presently disclosed dsRNA may comprise a sense strand that is homologous to a sequence of one or more target gene and an antisense strand that is complementary to the sense strand, with the proviso that at least one nucleotide of the antisense strand of the otherwise complementary dsRNA duplex is replaced by one or more universal-binding nucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0140">By way of background, within the silencing complex, the dsRNA molecule is positioned so that it can interact or bind to a target RNA. The RISC will encounter thousands of different RNAs that are in a typical cell at any given moment. But, the dsRNA loaded in RISC will specifically anneal with a target RNA that has close complementarity with the antisense of the dsRNA molecule. So, unlike an interferon response to a viral infection, the silencing complex is highly selective in identifying a target RNA. RISC cleaves the captured target RNA strand and releases the two pieces of the RNA (now rendered incapable of directing protein synthesis) and moves on. RISC itself stays intact and is capable of finding and cleaving additional target RNA molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0141">It will be understood that, regardless of the position at which the one or more universal-binding nucleotide is substituted, the dsRNA molecule is capable of binding to a target gene and one or more variant(s) thereof thereby facilitating the degradation of the target gene or variant thereof via Dicer or RISC. Thus, the dsRNA of the present disclosure are suitable for introduction into cells to mediate targeted post-transcriptional gene silencing of one or more target gene or variants thereof. When a dsRNA is inserted into a cell, the dsRNA duplex is then unwound, and the antisense strand anneals with mRNA to form a Dicer substrate or the antisense strand is loaded into an assembly of proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).</p>

In these embodiments the double-stranded portion of a final transcription product of the dsRNAs to be expressed within the target cell can be, for example, about 5 to about 40 bp, about 15 to about 24 bp, or about 25 to about 40 bp long. Within exemplary embodiments, double-stranded portions of dsRNAs, in which two or more strands pair up, are not limited to completely paired nucleotide segments, and may contain non-pairing portions due to a mismatch (the corresponding nucleotides are not complementary), bulge (lacking in the corresponding complementary nucleotide on one strand), overhang, or the like. Non-pairing portions can be contained to the extent that they do not interfere with dsRNA formation and function. In certain embodiments, a âbulgeâ may comprise 1 to 2 non-pairing nucleotides, and the double-stranded region of dsRNAs in which two strands pair up may contain from about 1 to 7, or about 1 to 5 bulges. In addition, âmismatchâ portions contained in the double-stranded region of dsRNAs may include from about 1 to 7, or about 1 to 5 mismatches. In other embodiments, the double-stranded region of dsRNAs of this disclosure may contain both bulge and mismatched portions in the approximate numerical ranges specified herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0145">A dsRNA or analog thereof of this disclosure may be further comprised of a nucleotide, non-nucleotide, or mixed nucleotide/non-nucleotide linker that joins the sense region of the dsRNA to the antisense region of the dsRNA. In one embodiment, a nucleotide linker can be a linker of more than about 2 nucleotides length up to about 10 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the nucleotide linker can be a nucleic acid aptamer. By âaptamerâ or ânucleic acid aptamerâ as used herein is meant a nucleic acid molecule that binds specifically to a target molecule wherein the nucleic acid molecule has sequence that comprises a sequence recognized by the target molecule in its natural setting. Alternately, an aptamer can be a nucleic acid molecule that binds to a target molecule wherein the target molecule does not naturally bind to a nucleic acid. The target molecule can be any molecule of interest. For example, the aptamer can be used to bind to a ligand-binding domain of a protein, thereby preventing interaction of the naturally occurring ligand with the protein. This is a non-limiting example and those in the art will recognize that other embodiments can be readily generated using techniques generally known in the art (see, e.g., Gold et al., <i>Annu. Rev.

In another embodiment, synthesis of the two complementary strands of a dsRNA molecule is by solid phase oligonucleotide synthesis. In yet another embodiment, synthesis of the two complementary strands of a dsRNA molecule is by solid phase tandem oligonucleotide synthesis.</p>

      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0149">In one embodiment, this disclosure features substituted or modified dsRNA molecules, such as phosphate backbone modifications comprising one or more phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, methylphosphonate, phosphotriester, morpholino, amidate carbamate, carboxymethyl, acetamidate, polyamide, sulfonate, sulfonamide, sulfamate, formacetal, thioformacetal, or alkylsilyl, substitutions.

      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0150">In another embodiment, a conjugate molecule can be optionally attached to a dsRNA or analog thereof that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi. For example, such conjugate molecules may be polyethylene glycol, human serum albumin, or a ligand for a cellular receptor that can, for example, mediate cellular uptake. Examples of specific conjugate molecules contemplated by the instant disclosure that can be attached to a dsRNA or analog thereof of this disclosure are described in Vargeese et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0130186, published Jul. 10, 2003, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0110296, published Jun. 10, 2004. In another embodiment, a conjugate molecule is covalently attached to a dsRNA or analog thereof that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi via a biodegradable linker. In certain embodiments, a conjugate molecule can be attached at the 3â²end of either the sense strand, the antisense strand, or both strands of a dsRNA molecule provided herein.

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0000">Methods for Selecting dsRNA Molecules Specific for a Target Sequence</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0151">As indicated above, the present disclosure also provides methods for selecting dsRNA and analogs thereof capable of specifically binding to one or more target gene while being not specifically binding or minimally binding to non-target genes. The selection process disclosed herein is useful, for example, in eliminating dsRNA analogs that are cytotoxic due to non-specific binding to, and subsequent degradation of, one or more non-target genes.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0152">Methods of the present disclosure do not require a priori knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of every possible gene variant targeted by the dsRNA or analog thereof. In one embodiment, the nucleotide sequence of the dsRNA is selected from a conserved region or consensus sequence of one or more target gene. In another embodiment, the nucleotide sequence of the dsRNA may be selectively or preferentially targeted to a certain sequence contained within an mRNA splice variant of a target gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0153">In certain embodiments, methods are provided for selecting one or more dsRNA molecule that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi, comprising a first strand that is complementary to a target gene mRNA, or any combination thereof, and a second strand that is complementary to the first strand, wherein the first and second strands form a double-stranded region of about 15 to about 40 base pairs, and wherein at least one uridine of the dsRNA molecule is replaced with a 5-methyluridine or 2-thioribothymidine, which methods employ âoff-targetâ profiling whereby one or more dsRNA provided herein is contacted with a cell, either in vivo or in vitro, and total target mRNA is collected for use in probing a microarray comprising oligonucleotides having one or more nucleotide sequence from a panel of known genes, including non-target genes (e.g., interferon). The âoff-targetâ profile of the dsRNA provided herein is quantified by determining the number of non-target genes having reduced expression levels in the presence of the candidate dsRNAs. The existence of âoff targetâ binding indicates a dsRNA provided herein that is capable of specifically binding to one or more non-target gene messages. In certain embodiments, a dsRNA as provided herein applicable to therapeutic use will exhibit a greater stability, minimal interferon response, and little or no âoff-targetâ binding.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0154">Still further embodiments provide methods for selecting more efficacious dsRNA by using one or more reporter gene constructs comprising a constitutive promoter, such as a cytomegalovirus (CMV) or phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, operably fused to, and capable of altering the expression of one or more reporter genes, such as a luciferase, chloramphenicol (CAT), or Î²-galactosidase, which, in turn, is operably fused in-frame with a dsRNA (such as one having a length between about 15 base-pairs and about 40 base-pairs or from about 5 nucleotides to about 24 nucleotides, or about 25 nucleotides to about 40 nucleotides) that contains one or more target sequence, as provided herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0155">Individual reporter gene expression constructs may be co-transfected with one or more dsRNA or analog thereof. The capacity of a given dsRNA to reduce the expression level of a target gene may be determined by comparing the measured reporter gene activity in cells transfected with or without a dsRNA molecule of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0156">Certain embodiments disclosed herein provide methods for selecting one or more modified dsRNA molecule(s) that employ the step of predicting the stability of a dsRNA duplex. In some embodiments, such a prediction is achieved by employing a theoretical melting curve wherein a higher theoretical melting curve indicates an increase in dsRNA duplex stability and a concomitant decrease in cytotoxic effects. Alternatively, stability of a dsRNA duplex may be determined empirically by measuring the hybridization of a single RNA analog strand as described herein to a complementary target gene within, for example, a polynucleotide array. The melting temperature (i.e., the T<sub>m </sub>value) for each modified RNA and complementary RNA immobilized on the array can be determined, and from this T<sub>m </sub>value, the relative stability of a substituted or modified RNA pairing with a complementary RNA molecule can be determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0157">For example, for universal-binding nucleotide, Kawase et al. (<i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>14:7727, 1986) have described an analysis of the nucleotide-pairing properties of Di (inosine) to A, C, G, and T, which was achieved by measuring the hybridization of oligonucleotides (ODNs) with Di in various positions to complementary sets of ODNs made as an array. The relative strength of nucleotide-pairing is I-C&gt;I-A&gt;I-GâI-T. Generally, Di containing duplexes showed lower T<sub>m </sub>values when compared to the corresponding WC nucleotide pair. The stabilization of Di by pairing was in order of Dc&gt;Da&gt;Dg&gt;Dt&gt;Du. From the thermodynamic values calculated using Van't Hoff plots according to a two state model, Kawase et al. conclude that the sequence of purine-pyrimidine is favored in double strand formation due to nucleotide stacking. For instance the duplex formation of XY=AT is a more favored formation than an XY=CG and TA. As a person of skill in the art would understand, although universal-binding nucleotides are used herein as an example of determining stability (i.e., the T<sub>m </sub>value), other nucleotide substitutions (e.g., 5-methyluridine for uridine) or further modifications (e.g., a ribose modification at the 2â²-position) can also be evaluated by these or similar methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0158">Within certain embodiments, methods disclosed herein comprise the steps of (a) designing or synthesizing a suitable dsRNA for RNAi gene silencing of one or more target gene, wherein the dsRNA comprises at least three strands and optionally at least one modification or substitution (such as a 5-methyluridine, LNA, 2â²-methoxy, 2â²-fluoro, phosphorothioate, or any combination thereof); and (b) contacting a cell expressing one or more target protein with the dsRNA, wherein the dsRNA is capable of specifically binding to one or more target mRNA or gene, thereby reducing expression of one or more target members.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0159">Any of these methods of identifying dsRNA of interest can also be used to examine a dsRNA that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNA interference, comprising a first strand that is complementary to a target mRNA, or any combination thereof, and a second and third strand that have non-overlapping complementarity to the first strand, wherein the first and at least one of the second or third strand form a double-stranded region of about 5 to about 13 base pairs; wherein at least one pyrimidine of the dsRNA comprises a pyrimidine nucleoside according to Formula I or II:</p>

      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0174">Within additional aspects of this disclosure, combination formulations and methods are provided comprising an effective amount of one or more dsRNA of the present disclosure in combination with one or more secondary or adjunctive active agents that are formulated together or administered coordinately with the dsRNA of this disclosure to control one or more target gene-associated disease or condition as described herein. Useful adjunctive therapeutic agents in these combinatorial formulations and coordinate treatment methods include, for example, enzymatic nucleic acid molecules, allosteric nucleic acid molecules, antisense, decoy, or aptamer nucleic acid molecules, antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies, small molecules and other organic or inorganic compounds including metals, salts and ions, and other drugs and active agents indicated for treating one or more target gene-associated disease or condition, including chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0175">Exemplary chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents (e.g., cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, busulfan, nitrosoureas, nitrogen mustards, uramustine, temozolomide), antimetabolites (e.g., aminopterin, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, fluorouracil, cytarabine), taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel), anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idaruicin, mitoxantrone, valrubicin), bleomycin, mytomycin, actinomycin, hydroxyurea, topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., camptothecin, topotecan, irinotecan, etoposide, teniposide), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, gemtuzumab, panitumumab, rituximab, tositumomab, trastuzumab), vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbine), cyclophosphamide, prednisone, leucovorin, oxaliplatin.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0176">To practice the coordinate administration methods of this disclosure, a dsRNA is administered simultaneously or sequentially in a coordinated treatment protocol with one or more secondary or adjunctive therapeutic agents described herein or known in the art. The coordinate administration may be done in either order, and there may be a time period while only one or both (or all) active therapeutic agents, individually or collectively, exert their biological activities. A distinguishing aspect of all such coordinate treatment methods is that the dsRNA present in a composition elicits some favorable clinical response, which may or may not be in conjunction with a secondary clinical response provided by the secondary therapeutic agent. For example, the coordinate administration of the dsRNA with a secondary therapeutic agent as contemplated herein can yield an enhanced (e.g., synergistic) therapeutic response beyond the therapeutic response elicited by either or both the purified dsRNA or secondary therapeutic agent alone.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0177">In another embodiment, a dsRNA of this disclosure can include a conjugate member on one or more of the nucleotides of a dsRNA (e.g., terminal). The conjugate member can be, for example, a lipophile, a terpene, a protein binding agent, a vitamin, a carbohydrate, or a peptide. For example, the conjugate member can be naproxen, nitroindole (or another conjugate that contributes to stacking interactions), folate, ibuprofen, or a C5 pyrimidine linker. In other embodiments, the conjugate member is a glyceride lipid conjugate (e.g., a dialkyl glyceride derivatives), vitamin E conjugates, or thio-cholesterols. Additional conjugate members include peptides that function, when conjugated to a modified dsRNA of this disclosure, to facilitates delivery of the dsRNA into a target cell, or otherwise enhance delivery, stability, or activity of the dsRNA when contacted with a biological sample. Exemplary peptide conjugate members for use within these aspects of this disclosure, include peptides PN27, PN28, PN29, PN58, PN61, PN73, PN158, PN159, PN173, PN182, PN202, PN204, PN250, PN361, PN365, PN404, PN453, and PN509 are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2006/0040882 and 2006/0014289, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/939,578, which are all incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, when peptide conjugate partners are used to enhance delivery of dsRNA or analogs thereof of this disclosure, the resulting dsRNA formulations and methods will often exhibit further reduction of an interferon response in target cells as compared to dsRNAs delivered in combination with alternate delivery vehicles, such as lipid delivery vehicles (e.g., Lipofectamineâ¢).</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0178">In still another embodiment, a dsRNA or analog thereof of this disclosure may be conjugated to the polypeptide and admixed with one or more non-cationic lipids or a combination of a non-cationic lipid and a cationic lipid to form a composition that enhances intracellular delivery of the dsRNA as compared to delivery resulting from contacting the target cells with a naked dsRNA. In more detailed aspects of this disclosure, the mixture, complex or conjugate comprising a dsRNA and a polypeptide can be optionally combined with (e.g., admixed or complexed with) a cationic lipid, such as Lipofectineâ¢. To produce these compositions comprised of a polypeptide, dsRNA and a cationic lipid, the dsRNA and peptide may be mixed together first in a suitable medium such as a cell culture medium, after which the cationic lipid is added to the mixture to form a dsRNA/delivery peptide/cationic lipid composition. Optionally, the peptide and cationic lipid can be mixed together first in a suitable medium such as a cell culture medium, followed by the addition of the dsRNA to form the dsRNA/delivery peptide/cationic lipid composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0179">This disclosure also features the use of dsRNA compositions comprising surface-modified liposomes containing poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-modified, or long-circulating liposomes or stealth liposomes). These formulations offer a method for increasing the accumulation of drugs in target tissues (Lasic et al., <i>Chem. Rev. </i>95:2601, 1995; Ishiwata et al., <i>Chem. Pharm. Bull. </i>43:1005, 1995). Such liposomes have been shown to accumulate selectively in tumors, presumably by extravasation and capture in the neovascularized target tissues (Lasic et al., <i>Science </i>267:1275, 1995; Oku et al., <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1238:86, 1995). The long-circulating liposomes enhance the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nucleic acid molecules as compared to conventional cationic liposomes, which are known to accumulate in tissues of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) (Liu et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>42:24864, 1995; Choi et al., PCT Publication No. WO 96/10391; Ansell et al., PCT Publication No. WO 96/10390; Holland et al., PCT Publication No. WO 96/10392). Long-circulating liposomes may also provide additional protection from nuclease degradation as compared to cationic liposomes in theory due to avoiding accumulation in metabolically aggressive MPS tissues, such as the liver and spleen.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0180">In one embodiment, this disclosure provides compositions suitable for administering dsRNA molecules of this disclosure to specific cell types, such as hepatocytes. For example, the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr) (Wu and Wu, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>262:4429, 1987) is unique to hepatocytes and binds branched galactose-terminal glycoproteins, such as asialoorosomucoid (ASOR). Binding of such glycoproteins or synthetic glycoconjugates to the receptor takes place with an affinity that strongly depends on the degree of branching of the oligosaccharide chain, for example, triatennary structures are bound with greater affinity than biatenarry or monoatennary chains (Baenziger and Fiete, <i>Cell </i>22: 611, 1980; Connolly et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem</i>. 257:939, 1982). Lee and Lee (<i>Glycoconjugate J. </i>4:317, 1987) obtained this high specificity through the use of N-acetyl-<smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-galactosamine as the carbohydrate moiety, which has higher affinity for the receptor compared to galactose. This âclustering effectâ has also been described for the binding and uptake of mannosyl-terminating glycoproteins or glycoconjugates (Ponpipom et al., <i>J. Med. Chem. </i>24:1388, 1981). The use of galactose and galactosamine based conjugates to transport exogenous compounds across cell membranes can provide a targeted delivery approach to the treatment of liver disease. The use of bioconjugates can also provide a reduction in the required dose of therapeutic compounds required for treatment. Furthermore, therapeutic bioavailability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetic parameters can be modulated through the use of dsRNA bioconjugates of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0181">The present disclosure also features a method for preparing dsRNA nanoparticles. A first solution containing melamine derivatives is dissolved in an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide, or dimethyl formamide to which an acid such as HCl has been added. The concentration of HCl would be about 3.3 moles of HCl for every mole of the melamine derivative. The first solution is then mixed with a second solution, which includes a nucleic acid dissolved or suspended in a polar or hydrophilic solvent (e.g., an aqueous buffer solution containing, for instance, ethylenediaminetraacetic acid (EDTA), or tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (TRIS), or combinations thereof. The mixture forms a first emulsion. The mixing can be done using any standard technique such as, for example, sonication, vortexing, or in a microfluidizer. This causes complexing of the nucleic acids with the melamine derivative forming a trimeric nucleic acid complex. While not being bound to theory or mechanism, it is believed that three nucleic acids are complexed in a circular fashion about one melamine derivative moiety, and that a number of the melamine derivative moieties can be complexed with the three nucleic acid molecules depending on the size of the number of nucleotides that the nucleic acid has. The concentration should be from about 1 to about 7 moles of the melamine derivative for every mole of a double-stranded nucleic acid having about 20 nucleotide pairs, more if the double-stranded nucleic acid is larger. The resultant nucleic acid particles can be purified and the organic solvent removed using size-exclusion chromatography or dialysis or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0182">The complexed nucleic acid nanoparticles can then be mixed with an aqueous solution containing either polyarginine or a Gln-Asn polymer, or both, in an aqueous solution. A preferred molecular weight of each polymer is about 5000 to about 15,000 Daltons. This forms a solution containing nanoparticles of nucleic acid complexed with the melamine derivative and the polyarginine and the Gln-Asn polymers. The mixing steps are carried out in a manner that minimizes shearing of the nucleic acid while producing nanoparticles on average smaller than about 200 nanometers in diameter. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the polyarginine complexes with the negative charge of the phosphate groups within the minor groove of the nucleic acid, and the polyarginine wraps around the trimeric nucleic acid complex. At either terminus of the polyarginine other moieties, such as the TAT polypeptide, mannose or galactose, can be covalently bound to the polymer to direct binding of the nucleic acid complex to specific tissues, such as to the liver when galactose is used. While not being bound to theory, it is believed that the Gln-Asn polymer complexes with the nucleic acid complex within the major groove of the nucleic acid through hydrogen bonding with the bases of the nucleic acid. The polyarginine and the Gln-Asn polymer should be present at a concentration of 2 moles per every mole of nucleic acid having 20 base pairs. The concentration should be increased proportionally for a nucleic acid having more than 20 base pairs. For example, if the nucleic acid has 25 base pairs, the concentration of the polymers should be 2.5-3 moles per mole of double-stranded nucleic acid. An example of is a polypeptide operatively linked to an N-terminal protein transduction domain from HIV TAT. The HIV TAT construct for use in such a protein is described in detail in Vocero-Akbani et al., <i>Nature Med. </i>5:23, 1999. See also, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0132161, published on Jul. 8, 2004. The resultant nanoparticles can be purified by standard means such as size exclusion chromatography followed by dialysis. The purified complexed nanoparticles can then be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0183">One embodiment of the present disclosure provides nanoparticles less than 100 nanometers (nm) comprising dsRNA that decreases expression of one or more target gene by RNAi. More specifically, the dsRNA is less than about 30 base pairs in length, or is from about 20 to about 25 base pairs in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0184">A pharmaceutically effective dose is that dose required to prevent, inhibit the occurrence, or treat (alleviate a symptom to some extent, preferably all of the symptoms) a disease state. The pharmaceutically effective dose depends on the type of disease, the composition used, the route of administration, the type of subject being treated, the physical characteristics of the specific subject under consideration for treatment, concurrent medication, and other factors that those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. For example, an amount between 0.1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight/day of active ingredients may be administered depending on the potency of a dsRNA of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0185">Dosage levels in the order of about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day can be useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that can be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form varies depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0186">It is understood that the specific dose level for any particular patient depends upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Following administration of dsRNA according to the formulations and methods of this disclosure, test subjects will exhibit about a 10% up to about a 99% reduction in one or more symptoms associated with the disease or disorder being treated, as compared to placebo-treated or other suitable control subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0187">Nucleic acid molecules and polypeptides can be administered to cells by a variety of methods known to those of skill in the art, including administration within formulations that comprise the dsRNA and polypeptide alone, or that further comprise one or more additional components, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, excipient, adjuvant, emulsifier, buffer, stabilizer, preservative, or the like. In certain embodiments, the dsRNA or the polypeptide can be encapsulated in liposomes, administered by iontophoresis, or incorporated into other vehicles, such as hydrogels, cyclodextrins, biodegradable nanocapsules, bioadhesive microspheres, or proteinaceous vectors (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO 00/53722). Alternatively, a nucleic acid/peptide/vehicle combination can be locally delivered by direct injection or by use of an infusion pump. Direct injection of the nucleic acid molecules of this disclosure, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal, can take place using standard needle and syringe methodologies, or by needle-free technologies, such as those described in Conroy et al., <i>Clin. Cancer Res. </i>5:2330, 1999, and PCT Publication No. WO 99/31262.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0188">The dsRNAs can also be administered in the form of suppositories, for example, for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient that is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0189">For administration to non-human animals, the composition can also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It can be convenient to formulate the animal feed and drinking water compositions so that the animal takes in a therapeutically appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet. It can also be convenient to present the composition as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.</p>

      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0191">In addition to in vivo gene inhibition, a skilled artisan will appreciate that the dsRNAs of the present disclosure are useful in a wide variety of in vitro applications, such as in scientific and commercial research (e.g., elucidation of physiological pathways, drug discovery and development), and medical and veterinary diagnostics. In general, the method involves the introduction of the dsRNA agent into a cell using known techniques (e.g., absorption through cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices, such as electroporation, lipofection, or through the use of peptide conjugates), then maintaining the cell for a time sufficient to obtain degradation of one or more target mRNA.</p>

Preparation for transfection: 250 Î¼l of OPTIMEM media without serum was mixed with 5 Î¼l of 20 pmol/Î¼l dsRNA and 5 Î¼l of HIPERFECT transfection solution (Qiagen) was mixed with another 250 Î¼l OPTIMEM media. After both mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 5 minutes, the RNA and transfection solutions were combined and left at room temperature for 20 minutes to form transfection complexes. The final concentration of HIPERFECT was 50 Î¼M, and the dsRNAs were tested at 0.05 nM, 0.1 nM, 0.2 nM, 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, and 10 nM, while the mdRNA was tested at 0.2 nM, 0.5 nM, 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 20 nM, and 50 nM. Complete media was removed, the cells were washed with incomplete OPTIMEM, and then 500 transfection mixture was applied to the cells, which were incubated with gentle shaking at 37Â° C. for 4 hours. After transfecting, the transfection media was removed, cells were washed once with complete DMEM/high glucose media, fresh media added, and the cells were then incubated for 48 hours at 37Â° C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0198">Transfected cells were washed with PBS, and then detached with 0.5 ml trypsin/EDTA. The detached cells were suspended in 1 ml complete DMEM/high glucose and transferred to a clean tube. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 250Ãg for 5 minutes, and then resuspended in 50 Î¼l 1Ã lysis buffer at 4Â° C. The lysed cells were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles on dry ice and a 37Â° C. water bath. The lysed samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4Â° C. and the supernatant was recovered. For each sample, 1.5 Î¼l and 10 Î¼l of lysate was transferred to a clean tube and sterile water added to a final volume of 30 Î¼l followed by the addition of 70 Î¼l o-nitrophenyl-Î²-<smallcaps>D</smallcaps>-galactopyranose (ONPG) and 200 Î¼l 1Ã cleavage buffer with Î²-mercaptoethanol. The samples were mixed briefly, incubated for 30 minutes at 37Â° C., and then 500 Î¼l stop buffer was added (final volume 800 Î¼l). Î²-Galactosidase activity for each sample was measured in disposable cuvettes at 420 nm. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method. For the purpose of the instant example, the level of measured LacZ activity was correlated with the quantity of LacZ transcript within 9L/LacZ cells. Thus, a reduction in Î²-galactosidase activity after dsRNA transfection, absent a negative impact on cell viability, was attributed to a reduction in the quantity of LacZ transcripts resulting from targeted degradation mediated by the LacZ dsRNA.</p>

      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0199">Knockdown activity in transfected and untransfected cells was normalized to a Qneg control dsRNA and presented as a normalized value of the Qneg control (i.e., Qneg represented 100% or ânormalâ gene expression levels). Both the lacZ RISC activator and Dicer substrate dsRNAs molecule showed good knockdown of Î²-galactosidase activity at concentration as low as 0.1 nM (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), while the Dicer substrate antisense strand alone (single stranded 27mer) had no silencing effect. Surprisingly, a gapped mdRNA showed good knockdown although somewhat lower than that of intact RISC activator and Dicer substrate dsRNAs (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The presence of the gapmer cytidine (i.e., the missing nucleotide) at various concentrations (0.1 Î¼M to 50 Î¼M) had no effect on the activity of the mdRNA (data not shown). None of the dsRNA or mdRNA solutions showed any detectable toxicity in the transfected 9L/LacZ cells. The IC<sub>50 </sub>of the lacZ mdRNA was calculated to be 3.74 nM, which is about 10 fold lower than what had been previously measured for lacZ dsRNA 21/21 (data not shown). These results show that a meroduplex (gapped dsRNA) is capable of inducing gene silencing.</p>

Each of the G1498 dsRNA or ndsRNA (meroduplex), with or without the 5-methyluridine substitution, was used to transfect HeLa S3 cells having an influenza target sequence associated with a luciferase gene. Also, the G1498 antisense strand alone or the antisense strand annealed to the 11 nucleotide sense strand portion alone or the 10 nucleotide sense strand portion alone were examined for activity. </p>

The firefly luciferase in the psiCHECKâ¢-2 vector is used to normalize <i>Renilla </i>luciferase expression and serves as a control for transfection efficiency.</p>

Using essentially the same transfection procedure as described in Example 1, the HeLa S3 cells were transfected with the psiCHECKâ¢-influenza plasmid (75 ng) and G1498 dsRNA or ndsRNA (final concentration of 10 nM or 100 nM) formulated in Lipofectamineâ¢ 2000 and OPTIMEM reduced serum medium.

After measuring the firefly luminescence, Stop &amp; GloÂ® Reagent (Promega, Madison, Wis.) was added for 10 minutes with shaking to simultaneously quench the firefly reaction and initiate the <i>Renilla </i>luciferase reaction, and then the <i>Renilla </i>luciferase luminescent signal was quantitated VICTOR<sup>3</sup>â¢ 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.).</p>

      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0206">Knockdown activity in transfected and untransfected cells was normalized to a Qneg control dsRNA and presented as a normalized value of the Qneg control (i.e., Qneg represented 100% or ânormalâ gene expression levels). Thus, a smaller value indicates a greater knockdown effect. The G1498 dsRNA-wt and dsRNA-rT showed similar good knockdown at a 100 nM concentration (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). Surprisingly, the G1498 ndsRNA-rT, whether phosphorylated or not, showed good knockdown although somewhat lower than the G1498 dsRNA-wt (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). Similar results were obtained with dsRNA or ndsRNA at 10 nM (data not shown). None of the G1498 dsRNA or ndsRNA solutions showed any detectable toxicity in HeLa S3 cells at either 10 nM or 100 nM. Even the presence of only half a nicked sense strand (an 11 nucleotide or 10 nucleotide strand alone) with a G1498 antisense strand showed some detectable activity. These results show that a nicked-type meroduplex dsRNA molecule is unexpectedly capable of promoting gene silencing.</p>

      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0207">In this example, the activity of a dicer substrate LacZ dsRNA of Example 1 having a sense strand with a nick at various positions was examined. In addition, a dideoxy nucleotide (i.e., ddG) was incorporated at the 5â²-end of the 3â²-most strand of a sense sequence having a nick or a single nucleotide gap to determine whether the in vivo ligation of the nicked sense strand is ârescuingâ activity. The ddG is not a substrate for ligation. Also examined was the influenza dicer substrate dsRNA of Example 6 having a sense strand with a nick at one of positions 8 to 14. The âpâ designation indicates that the 5â²-end of the 3â²-most strand of the nicked sense influenza sequence was phosphorylated. The âLâ designation indicates that the G at position 2 of the 5â²-most strand of the nicked sense influenza sequence was substituted for a locked nucleic acid G. The Qneg is a negative control dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0208">The dual fluorescence assay of Example 2 was used to measure knockdown activity with 5 nM of the LacZ sequences and 0.5 nM of the influenza sequences. The lacZ dicer substrate (25/27, LacZ-DS) and lacZ RISC activator (21/21, LacZ) are equally active, and the LacZ-DS can be nicked in any position between 8 and 14 without affecting activity (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In addition, the inclusion of a ddG on the 5â²-end of the 3â²-most LacZ sense sequence having a nick (LacZ:DSNkd13-3â²dd) or a one nucleotide gap (LacZ:DSNkd13D1-3â²dd) was essentially as active as the unsubstituted sequence (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The influenza dicer substrate (G1498DS) nicked at any one of positions 8 to 14 was also highly active (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). Phosphorylation of the 5â²-end of the 3â²-most strand of the nicked sense influenza sequence had essentially no effect on activity, but addition of a locked nucleic acid appears to improve activity.</p>

The dual luciferase assay of Example 2 was used.

Also tested were RISC activator molecules (21/21) with or without a nick at various positions, G1498DS:Nkd12, and G1498DS:Nkd14, each of the nicked versions with a locked nucleic acid as described above (data not shown). The Qneg is a negative control dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0210">The IC<sub>50 </sub>of the RISC activator G1498 was calculated to be about 22 pM, while the dicer substrate G1498DS IC<sub>50 </sub>was calculated to be about 6 pM. The IC<sub>50 </sub>of RISC and Dicer mdRNAs range from about 200 pM to about 15 nM. The inclusion of a single locked nucleic acid reduced the IC<sub>50 </sub>of Dicer mdRNAs by up 4 fold (data not shown).

      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0212">The dual fluorescence assay of Example 2 was used to measure knockdown activity. Similar results were obtained at both the 5 nM and 10 nM concentrations. These data show that an mdRNA having a gap of up to 6 nucleotides still has activity, although having four or fewer missing nucleotides shows the best activity (see, also, <figref>FIG. 6</figref>). Thus, mdRNA having various sizes gaps that are in various different positions have knockdown activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0213">To examine the general applicability of a sequence having a sense strand with a gap of differing sizes and positions, a different dsRNA sequence was tested. The lacZ RISC dsRNA of Example 1 was generated with a sense strand having a gap of 0 to 6 nucleotides at position 8, a gap of 5 nucleotides at position 9, a gap of 4 nucleotides at position 10, a gap of 3 nucleotides at position 11, a gap of 2 nucleotides at position 12, a gap of 1 nucleotide at position 12, and a nick (gap of 0) at position 14 (see Table 4). The Qneg is a negative control dsRNA. Each of the mdRNAs was tested at a concentration of 5 nM (data not shown) and 25 nM. The lacZ mdRNAs have the following antisense strand 5â²-AAAUCGCUGAUUUGUGUAGdTdTUAAA (SEQ ID NO:2) and nicked or gapped sense strands as shown in Table 4.</p>

      <p id="p-00248-en" num="0216">The dual fluorescence assay of Example 2 was used to measure knockdown activity. These data show that increasing the number of locked nucleic acid substitutions tends to increase activity of an mdRNA having a nick at any of a number of positions. The single locked nucleic acid per sense strand is most active when the nick is at position 11 (see <figref>FIG. 8</figref>). But, multiple locked nucleic acids on each sense strand make mdRNA having a nick at any position as active as the most optimal nick position with a single substitution (i.e., position 11) (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>). Thus, mdRNA having duplex stabilizing modifications make mdRNA essentially equally active regardless of the nick position.</p>
      <p id="p-00249-en" num="0217">Similar results were observed when locked nucleic acid substitutions were made in the LacZ dicer substrate mdRNA of Example 1 (SEQ ID NOS:3 and 4). The lacZ dicer was nicked at positions 8 to 14, and a duplicate set of nicked LacZ dicer molecules were made with the exception that the A at position 3 (from the 5â²-end) of the 5â² sense strand was substituted for a locked nucleic acid A (LNA-A). As is evident from <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, most of the nicked lacZ dicer molecules containing LNA-A were as potent in knockdown activity as the unsubstituted lacZ dicer (see <figref>FIG. 9</figref>).</p>

      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0219">For the viral infectivity assay, Vero cells were seeded at 6.5Ã10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well the day before transfection in 500 Î¼l 10% FBS/DMEM media per well. Samples of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 nM stock of each dsRNA were complexed with 1.0 Î¼l (1 mg/ml stock) of Lipofectamineâ¢ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature in 150 Î¼l OPTIMEM (total volume) (Gibco, Carlsbad, Calif.). Vero cells were washed with OPTIMEM, and 150 Î¼l of the transfection complex in OPTIMEM was then added to each well containing 150 Î¼l of OPTIMEM media. Triplicate wells were tested for each condition. An additional control well with no transfection condition was prepared. Three hours post transfection, the media was removed. Each well was washed once with 200 Î¼l PBS containing 0.3% BSA and 10 mM HEPES/PS. Cells in each well were infected with WSN strain of influenza virus at an MOI 0.01 in 200 Î¼l of infection media containing 0.3% BSA/10 mM HEPES/PS and 4 Î¼g/ml trypsin. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37Â° C. Unadsorbed virus was washed off with the 200 Î¼l of infection media and discarded, then 400 Î¼l DMEM containing 0.3% BSA/10 mM HEPES/PS and 4 Î¼g/ml trypsin was added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37Â° C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 48 hours, then 50 Î¼l supernatant from each well was tested in duplicate by TCID<sub>50 </sub>assays (Tissue-Culture Infective Dose 50, WHO protocol) in MDCK cells and titers were estimated using the Spearman and Karber formula.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0220">The results show that all of the G1498 nicked mdRNAs caused a 10-fold reduction in influenza viral titers (<figref>FIG. 10</figref>). That is, these mdRNAs show about a 50% to 60% viral titer knockdown, even at a concentration as low as 10 pM (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0221">An in vivo influenza mouse model was also used to examine the activity of a dicer substrate nicked dsRNA in reducing influenza virus titer as compared to a wild-type dsRNA (i.e., not having a nick). Female BALB/c mice (age 8-10 weeks with 5-10 mice per group) were dosed intranasally with 120 nmol/kg/day dsRNA (formulated in C12-norArg(NH<sub>3</sub>+Clâ)-C12/DSPE-PEG2000/DSPC/cholesterol at a ratio of 30:1:20:49) for three consecutive days before intranasal challenge with influenza strain PR8 (20 PFU/mouse). Two days after infection, whole lungs are harvested from each mouse and placed in a solution of PBS/0.3% BSA with antibiotics, homogenize, and measure the viral titer (TCID<sub>50</sub>). Doses were well tolerated by the mice, indicated by less than 2% body weight reduction in any of the dose groups. The mdRNAs tested exhibit similar, if not slightly greater, virus reduction in vivo as compared to unmodified and unnicked G1498 dicer substrate (see <figref>FIG. 12</figref>). Hence, mdRNA are active in vivo.</p>

      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0222">The effect of the mdRNA structure on cytokine induction in vivo was examined Female BALB/c mice (age 7-9 weeks) were dosed intranasally with about 50 Î¼M dsRNA (formulated in C12-norArg(NH<sub>3</sub>+Cl+C12/DSPE-PEG2000/DSPC/cholesterol at a ratio of 30:1:20:49) or with 605 nmol/kg/day naked dsRNA for three consecutive days. About four hours after the final dose is administered, the mice were sacrificed to collect bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF), and collected blood is processed to serum for evaluation of the cytokine response. Bronchial lavage was performed with 0.5 mL ice-cold 0.3% BSA in saline two times for a total of 1 mL. BALF was spun and supernatants collected and frozen until cytokine analysis. Blood was collected from the vena cava immediately following euthanasia, placed into serum separator tubes, and allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 20 minutes. The samples were processed to serum, aliquoted into Millipore ULTRAFREE 0.22 nm filter tubes, spun at 12,000 rpm, frozen on dry ice, and then stored at â70Â° C. until analysis. Cytokine analysis of BALF and plasma were performed using the Procartaâ¢ mouse 10-Plex Cytokine Assay Kit (Panomics, Fremont, Calif.) on a Bio-Plexâ¢ array reader. Toxicity parameters were also measured, including body weights prior to the first dose on day 0 and again on day 3, just prior to euthanasia. Spleens were harvested, weighed, and weights were normalized to final body weights. The results are provided in Table 6.</p>

      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0223">The mdRNA (RISC or dicer sized) induced cytokines to lesser extent than the intact (i.e., not nicked) parent molecules. The decrease in cytokine induction was greatest when looking at IL-12(p40), the cytokine with consistently the highest levels of induction of the 10 cytokine multiplex assay. For the mdRNA, the decrease in IL-12 (p40) ranges from 25- to 56-fold, while the reduction in either IL-6 or TNFÎ± induction was more modest (the decrease in these two cytokines ranges from 2- to 10-fold). Thus, the mdRNA structure appears to provide an advantage in vivo in that cytokine induction is minimized compared to unmodified dsRNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0224">Similar results were obtained with the formulated mdRNA, although the reduction in induction was not as prominent. In addition, the presence or absence of a locked nucleic acid has no effect on cytokine induction. These results are shown in Table 7.</p>
