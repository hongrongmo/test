      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates to the mounting of traction gear on the bottom of footwear, in particular, athletic footwear.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Progress has been made in recent years in reducing the labor involved in installing traction cleats into the outsoles of athletic shoes. For example, removable cleats employing the Q-LOKâ¢ attachment structure, the TRI-LOKâ¢ attachment structure, or the FASTTWISTâ¢ attachment structure require less than a full turn to install the cleat into the mating receptacle. (Q-LOKâ¢ is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,768,809, 6,151,805, 6,108,944, and 6,463,681, while Fast Twistâ¢ is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,123,184, 5,524,367, 5,974,700 and 6,272,774, each of which patents is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.) Because each athletic shoe usually includes many cleats, these attachment structures represented a step forward from previous systems that required multiple turns per cleat. However, some partial-turn cleat systems can introduce some uncertainty as to whether the cleat has been turned sufficient degrees to firmly mate with the receptacle. A system and method for installing cleats into athletic footwear that offers the labor savings of partial-turn cleat attachment system with increased certainty of proper cleat installation is desirable.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an attachment structure is provided for a removable cleat for footwear. The attachment structure includes a cleat base and a cylindrical structure projecting from the base. The cylindrical structure includes at least one ramp and one or more locking tabs, disposed about the outer surface of the structure. The ramp extends from the end of the cylindrical structure, distal to the base, towards the other end of the cylindrical structure, which end is proximate to the cleat base. The locking tab or tabs cooperate with corresponding tabs on the mating receptacle to retain the cleat attachment structure in the receptacle after insertion. Insertion may be accomplished by snapping the cleat onto the receptacle. The ramp cooperates with a corresponding ramp on the receptacle to dislodge the locking tabs when the cleat is rotated about the central axis of the cylindrical structure. Thus, the cleat can be disengaged from the receptacle and removed from the footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In another preferred embodiment of the invention, a receptacle is provided that mates with the cleat attachment structure. The receptacle includes a base and a cylindrical cavity in the base. The inner surface of the cavity includes one or more locking tabs together with at least one ramp extending from the closed end of the cavity towards the open end of the cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The cleat attachment structure and the receptacle form an attachment system for a removable cleat to footwear. To install the cleat into the receptacle, the central axis of the cylindrical structure of the cleat is aligned with the central axis of the receptacle's central cavity, and the cleat is rotated so that corresponding ramps on the cleat and receptacle are aligned. The cleat is then pushed into the receptacle engaging the locking tabs and the ramps on cleat and receptacle to lock the receptacle with the cleat. Removal is also straightforward: when the cleat is twisted, the ramps on the cleat attachment structure and the receptacle cooperate to force the cleat and receptacle apart, dislodging the locking tabs, and allowing the cleat to be removed from the footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a preferred embodiment, the cleat attachment structure includes a cylindrical core disposed about the central axis and within a perimeter defined by the cylinder. This cylindrical core may be used, in conjunction with corresponding structure in the receptacle, to help align the cleat with the receptacle for attachment of the cleat to the shoe. This cylindrical core preferably includes a flange with a vertically oriented wall adapted to cooperate with a corresponding wall in the receptacle to resist rotation of the attachment about its central axis. Preferably, the height of the core is greater than the height of the cylinder.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Similarly, in a preferred embodiment, the receptacle includes an inner cylindrical wall defining an inner cylindrical opening disposed about the central axis and within the cavity. This inner cylindrical opening is adapted to receive the cylindrical core of the cleat attachment structure. This inner cylindrical opening preferably includes a slot with a vertically oriented wall adapted to cooperate with the corresponding wall in the attachment structure's core to resist rotation of the attachment structure about the central axis. Preferably, the height of the inner cylindrical opening is greater than the height of the receptacle's cavity.</p>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As used in this description and the accompanying claims, the following term shall have the meaning indicated, unless the context otherwise requires: âFootwearâ means any outer covering for a foot including, without limitation, athletic footwear, sandals, boots, shoes and slippers.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In preferred embodiments of the invention, a traction cleat attachment system for footwear is provided. The system comprises a cleat attachment structure and a receptacle. The cleat attachment structure includes a cylindrical structure on a base with one or more locking tabs disposed around the outside of the cylinder. The receptacle includes a cylindrical cavity with one or more locking tabs on its inner surface. The cleat attachment structure mates with the receptacle by aligning the axis of the cylinder with the axis of the cylindrical cavity and pushing one into the other, thereby engaging the locking tabs. Ramps on the cleat attachment structure and the receptacle cooperate to disengage the locking tabs when the cleat attachment structure is twisted about its axis. The cleat attachment structure is thereby detached from the receptacle. Note that the ramp or ramps on the cleat must be aligned with the corresponding ramp or ramps on the receptacle before the cleat attachment structure and receptacle are mated.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a traction cleat <b>10</b> with a cleat attachment structure according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is another view of the cleat attachment structure of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The cleat attachment structure allows the traction cleat to securely be attached to a receptacle embedded in footwear. The traction cleat in this embodiment includes a plurality of traction legs <b>12</b> for gripping a surface. The traction legs <b>12</b> are attached to one surface of a cleat base <b>15</b>. (Other types of gripping structures may be used instead of a plurality of traction legs; for example, a single metal spike may be used, or a plurality of ridges or bumps may be used.) This surface of the cleat base will be called a âbottom surfaceâ of the cleat for purposes of description. Terms such as âtopâ and âbottomâ as used herein are for purposes of description and are not intended to describe an absolute orientation in space, but are intended to evoke the orientation of a properly installed cleat and receptacle when the wearer of the footwear is standing on the ground; thus, when a cleat is in use, a âbottomâ surface would normally face the ground, and a âtopâ surface would face the bottom of a wearer's foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The cleat attachment structure consists of a cylindrical structure <b>20</b> or âcylinderâ attached to an opposing face of the cleat base, which will be called the âtop surfaceâ of the cleat base <b>15</b> for purposes of description. Likewise, the end of the cylinder <b>20</b> attached to the cleat base will be called the âbottomâ end of the cylinder for purposes of description. The outer surface of the cylinder <b>20</b> includes a plurality of locking tabs <b>22</b>. The locking tabs engage with one or more corresponding locking tabs on the inner surface of a cylindrical cavity in a receptacle in the footwear outsole. The engagement of the locking tabs retains the cleat attachment structure in the receptacle. In this embodiment, slots <b>26</b> are formed in the walls of the cylinder <b>20</b>, and the cylinder defines a cavity <b>28</b>. In this description and in any appended claims, the term âcylinderâ will include cylindrical structures with such slots and cavities. The slots <b>26</b> facilitate flexing of the tabs <b>22</b> as the tabs engage a corresponding locking tab or tabs in the receptacle. Other embodiments may not include such slots and/or may not include such a cavity. Further, in some embodiments of the invention, the cleat attachment structure may include differing numbers of locking tabs, including a single locking tab. The width of each locking tab may vary in various preferred embodiments to vary the force needed to insert the cleat into the receptacle and the force needed to disengage the cleat from the receptacle. Preferably, the locking tabs are disposed on a sector of the cylinder extending greater than 180 degrees around the cylinder.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The cleat attachment structure also includes a ramp <b>24</b>. The ramp <b>24</b> extends from the top end of the cylinder <b>20</b> towards the bottom end of the cylinder. Preferably, the ramp is disposed on a sector of the cylinder extending less than 90 degrees around the cylinder.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The ramp <b>24</b> mates with a corresponding ramp in a cylindrical cavity in the receptacle. Ramps on the cleat attachment structure and receptacle are aligned prior to insertion of the cleat attachment structure into the receptacle cavity. When only one ramp is provided on the cleat attachment structure, alignment of the cleat attachment structure ramp to the corresponding ramp in the receptacle cavity determines the orientation of the cleat to the receptacle and, thus, to the shoe outsole that contains the receptacle. When an installed cleat is twisted about the central axis of the cylindrical structure <b>20</b>, these ramps translate the cleat attachment structure vertically along the central axis, relative to the receptacle. This axial movement disengages the locking tabs of cleat and receptacle, allowing the cleat to be removed from the footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In some embodiments of the invention, more than one ramp is provided on the cleat attachment structure. In specific embodiments of the invention, when more than one ramp is provided on the cleat attachment structure, the ramps may be situated symmetrically about the cylinder so that more than one rotational position is possible for the cleat with respect to the receptacle, when cleat and receptacle are mated.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows the bottom face of a receptacle <b>30</b> that receives a cleat attachment structure, according to an embodiment of the invention. The view is along the central axis of the receptacle's cylindrical cavity <b>34</b>. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows the receptacle of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> in a perspective view. The receptacle <b>30</b> includes a flange <b>32</b> that can be molded into the outsole of footwear, to retain the receptacle in the outsole. The cylindrical cavity <b>34</b> is defined by a wall <b>31</b> and includes a ramp <b>44</b> and a locking tab <b>42</b>. The ramp <b>44</b> cooperates with the corresponding ramp of the cleat attachment structure to disengage the cleat and receptacle when the cleat is twisted, as described above. Preferably, the ramp <b>44</b> is disposed on a sector of the cylindrical cavity <b>34</b> extending less than 90 degrees around the cylindrical cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The locking tab <b>42</b> cooperates with the corresponding locking tabs on the cleat attachment structure to retain the cleat attachment structure in the receptacle after insertion. In this embodiment, a single locking tab <b>42</b> is provided. In other embodiments, a plurality of locking tabs may be provided for the receptacle and for the mating cleat attachment structure. The width of the tabs may vary to accommodate differing levels of insertion force and retention force for the corresponding cleat attachment structure. All tabs need not have the same width in each embodiment. Preferably, the locking tab <b>42</b> is (or a plurality of locking tabs are) disposed along a sector of the cylindrical cavity <b>34</b> extending greater than 180 degrees around the cylindrical cavity <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">To install the cleat in the receptacle, the cleat and receptacle are placed adjacent each other so that the top of the cleat and the bottom of the receptacle are facing each other and so that the ramps of the cleat and receptacle are lined up with each other. Then, the cleat is simply pushed and snapped into place in the receptacle, so that the locking tabs on each of the cleat and the receptacle overlap each other to hold the cleat in the receptacle. Thus, the cleat is relatively easy to install, merely requiring an aligning of the cleat with the receptacle and snapping the cleat into the receptacle. As discussed above, the cleat may be removed relatively easily by twisting the cleat with respect to the receptacle, preferably with a cleat wrench. Turning the cleat causes the ramps of the cleat and the receptacle to interact with each other, causing the cleat to move axially with respect to the receptacle, and in turn causing the locking tabs to bend so as to overcome the force of the locking tabs holding the cleat in place. This action causes the cleat to be popped out of the receptacle with a simple twist of the cleat, a twist that is less than a half turn and, indeed, preferably less than a quarter turn.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">
        <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> show an alternative embodiment of an attachment structure <b>50</b> for a removable cleat, according to an alternative embodiment of the invention. This attachment structure <b>50</b> may be molded intoâor otherwise connected toâa gripping structure, which may, for example, include a plurality of traction legs, a metal spike or other structure to provide traction on a surface. The attachment structure <b>50</b> of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> includes a flange <b>52</b> that can be molded into the rest of a cleat, to fixedly connect the attachment structure to the traction-providing structure. The attachment structure <b>50</b> may include wrench holes <b>70</b> for accepting the cleat wrench that is used to twist the cleat out of the receptacle. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a top perspective view of the attachment side of the attachment structure, <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a top view of the attachment structure of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a side view of the cleat attachment structure of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As with the <figref>FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, the <figref>FIG. 5</figref> embodiment allows the traction cleat to securely be attached to a receptacle embedded in footwear. The cleat attachment structure consists of a cylindrical structure <b>20</b> or âcylinderâ attached to the top face of the attachment structure. The cylinder <b>20</b> defines a cavity <b>28</b>. The outer surface of the cylinder <b>20</b> includes a plurality of locking tabs <b>22</b>. The locking tabs engage with one or more corresponding locking tabs on the inner surface of a cylindrical cavity in a receptacle in the footwear outsole. The engagement of the locking tabs <b>22</b> holds the cleat attachment structure <b>50</b>âand thus the entire cleatâin the receptacle. Slots <b>26</b> may be formed in the walls of the cylinder <b>20</b> to facilitate flexing of the tabs <b>22</b> as the tabs engage a corresponding locking tab or tabs in the receptacle. The widths and number of locking tabs may vary in various preferred embodiments to vary the force needed to insert the cleat into the receptacle and the force needed to disengage the cleat from the receptacle. Preferably, as shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> (as well as <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), the locking tabs <b>22</b> are disposed on a sector of the cylinder <b>20</b> extending greater than 180 degrees around the cylinder.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Again, as with the <figref>FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, the cleat attachment structure of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> also includes a ramp <b>24</b>. The ramp <b>24</b> extends from the top end of the cylinder <b>20</b> towards the bottom end of the cylinder. Preferably, the ramp <b>24</b> is disposed on a sector of the cylinder extending less than 90 degrees around the cylinder. The ramp <b>24</b> mates with a corresponding ramp in a cylindrical cavity in the receptacle. When the cleat is twisted about the central axis of the cylindrical structure <b>20</b>, these ramps translate the cleat attachment structure vertically along the central axis, relative to the receptacle. This axial movement disengages the locking tabs of cleat and receptacle, allowing the cleat to be removed from the footwear. As noted above, in some embodiments of the invention, more than one ramp may be provided on each of the cleat attachment structure and the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">There are several differences between the embodiments of <figref>FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, including the number of locking tabs <b>22</b>. The primary difference, however, is that the <figref>FIG. 5</figref> embodiment includes an inner cylindrical core <b>55</b>, which cooperates with a corresponding structure (item <b>85</b>, discussed below in connection with <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) on the receptacle in order to help line up the cleat and receptacle for insertion. This alignment core <b>55</b> is located within the cavity <b>28</b> defined by the cylinder <b>20</b> and is coaxially aligned about the central axis of cylinder.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The alignment core <b>55</b> may also include a vertical flange <b>57</b> to help rotationally orient the cleat and the receptacle for proper insertion of the cleat, and in particular to help align the ramps of the cleat and receptacle to each other. This alignment core <b>55</b> may also include an arrow <b>56</b> to help the user visually orient the cleat and the receptacle for insertion of the cleat into the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The vertical flange <b>57</b> of the alignment core <b>55</b> may also include a vertical wall <b>59</b> that can interact with a corresponding wall (item <b>91</b>, discussed below in connection with <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) in the receptacle to resist rotation of the cleat attachment structure (and the cleat) with respect to the receptacle after the cleat has been installed in the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the alignment core <b>55</b> has a greater height than the cylinder <b>20</b>. This greater height makes it easier for the person inserting the cleat to properly align and orient the cleat attachment structure <b>50</b> with the receptacle before trying to snap the cleat into place in the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> depict an embodiment of a receptacle adapted to be used with the cleat attachment structure of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a bottom perspective view of the receptacle, <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a bottom view of the receptacle of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a side view of the receptacle of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Like the receptacle embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the bottom face of the receptacle <b>30</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> includes a wall <b>31</b> defining a cylindrical cavity <b>34</b> that receives the cleat attachment structure and includes a flange <b>32</b> that allows the receptacle be molded into and retained in the outsole of footwear. The receptacle's locking tab is broken into three smaller locking tabs <b>42</b><i>a, </i><b>42</b><i>b, </i>and <b>42</b><i>c. </i>The receptacle's ramp <b>44</b> cooperates with the corresponding ramp of the cleat attachment structure to disengage the cleat and receptacle when the cleat is twisted, as described above. The locking tabs <b>42</b><i>a, </i><b>42</b><i>b, </i>and <b>42</b><i>c </i>cooperate with the corresponding locking tabs on the cleat attachment structure to retain the cleat attachment structure in the receptacle after insertion.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">An inner cylindrical wall <b>85</b>, which defines an inner cylindrical opening <b>86</b>, is disposed within the cavity <b>34</b>. The inner cylindrical opening <b>86</b> is coaxially aligned about the central axis of the cavity <b>34</b>. The inner cylindrical wall <b>85</b> includes an expanded section <b>87</b> defining a slot <b>88</b>, which can receive the flange (item <b>57</b> of <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) of the cleat attachment structure in order to rotationally orient the cleat properly for insertion into the receptacle. The geometries of the slot <b>88</b> and the corresponding flange <b>57</b> of the cleat attachment structure also preferably complement each other so as to limit the amount of rotational play of the cleat in the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The slot <b>88</b> includes a vertically oriented wall <b>91</b> adapted to cooperate with the corresponding wall (item <b>59</b> in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) in the cleat attachment structure in order to resist rotation of the cleat attachment structure (item <b>50</b> in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>) about the central axis after it has been inserted into the receptacle <b>30</b>. The geometry of the corresponding walls (the wall <b>59</b> in the cleat attachment structure of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, and the wall <b>91</b> on the slot <b>88</b> of the receptacle of <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>), as well as the materials from which these corresponding walls are made, may be modified to adjust the amount of torque necessary to twist the cleat out of the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Preferably, the height of the receptacle's inner cylindrical wall <b>85</b> is greater than the height of the receptacle's wall <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. This greater height of the inner cylindrical wall <b>85</b>, along with the alignment core <b>55</b> extending beyond the top of the cleat attachment structure's cylinder <b>20</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>), makes it easier for the person inserting the cleat to properly align and orient the cleat attachment structure <b>50</b> with the receptacle <b>30</b> before trying to snap the cleat into place in the receptacle. The alignment core <b>55</b> and vertical flange <b>57</b> of the cleat attachment structure work with the receptacle's inner cylindrical opening <b>86</b> and slot <b>88</b> to help align and rotationally orient the cleat and the receptacle for proper insertion of the cleat, and in particular to help align the ramps of the cleat and receptacle to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Like the cleat and receptacle embodiments shown respectively in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the cleat and receptacle embodiments shown respectively in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b> and in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are attached to each other with a simple snapping action and are detached from each other with a simple, partial-turn twisting action (preferably, less than a 180 degree turn, and more preferably, less than a 90 degree turn). After proper alignment of the cleat and receptacle, the cleat is simply pushed and snapped into place in the receptacle, so that the locking tabs on each of the cleat and the receptacle overlap each other to hold the cleat in the receptacle. For removal, the cleat is twisted with respect to the receptacle, preferably with a cleat wrench, which causes the ramps of the cleat and the receptacle to interact with each other, causing the cleat to move axially with respect to the receptacle, and in turn causing the locking tabs to bend so as to overcome the force of the locking tabs holding the cleat in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">It is desirable in some footwear to reduce the thickness of the outsole in which a receptacle is installed. Thickness reduction for an outsole can save weight and reduce the cost as compared to a thicker outsole. Preferred embodiments of the invention allow reduced height receptacle and corresponding cleat attachment structures as compared to conventional cleat attachment systems that employ screw threads, for example. Such thickness reduction can occur because retention of the cleat in the receptacle is provided by the cooperation of the locking tabs, which can be on about the same plane in receptacle and the cleat. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the height of a receptacle can be 4 mm or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In other embodiments of the invention, the cleat attachment structure and the attachment structure for the receptacle may be swapped so that the cleat includes the cylindrical cavity (as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> or in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) and the receptacle includes the cylindrical structure (as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> or in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>). Alternatively, just the inner aligning structures of the cleat and receptacle (respectively, the core <b>55</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, and the inner cylindrical wall <b>85</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>) may be swapped between the cleat and the receptacle.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In various embodiments of the invention, system components can be made of any of a variety of materials, including plastic and metal. The components may be fabricated by processes typical for such components such as injection molding, die cut and assembly (adhered, glued, etc.), compression and flow molding, casting, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Similarly, it is of course apparent that the present invention is not limited to the detailed description set forth above. Various changes and modifications of this invention as described will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
