      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to United Kingdom Application No. 1404918.3, filed Mar. 19, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a cleaner head for an appliance such as a vacuum cleaner.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The cleaner head of an appliance, such as a vacuum cleaner, may include an agitator rotatably mounted within a main body. Tolerances in the cleaner head may mean that there is a degree of play in the agitator relative to the main body. Consequently, as the agitator rotates, the agitator vibrates and generates noise.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention provides a cleaner head comprising a main body having an agitator chamber, an axle that extends into the chamber, a bearing assembly mounted on the axle, the bearing assembly being moveable along the axle between a first position and a second position, a biasing member biasing the bearing assembly towards the first position, and an agitator rotatably mounted within the chamber, wherein the agitator is mounted on the bearing assembly and pushes the bearing assembly along the axle against the biasing member towards the second position.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Since the agitator pushes against the biasing member, any play of the agitator in an axial direction (i.e. in a direction parallel to the rotational axis of the agitator) is prevented or reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The bearing assembly may comprise a mount having a ramped surface, and the agitator may have a ramped surface at one end. The agitator is then supported on the mount such that the ramped surface of the agitator mates with the ramped surface of the mount. As a result, play of the agitator in a radial direction (i.e. in a direction normal to the rotational axis of the agitator) is prevented or reduced. Additionally, the ramped surfaces help improve the concentricity of the agitator relative to the bearing assembly. As a result, radial loading of the bearing assembly by the agitator is reduced and therefore the lifespan of the bearing assembly, and thus the cleaner head, is prolonged.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The bearing assembly may comprise a bearing secured to a carriage, and the carriage may be prevented from rotating relative to the axle when the bearing assembly is in the second position. Consequently, as the agitator rotates, rotation of the inner race of the bearing relative to the axle is prevented and thus wear of the axle is avoided. For example, the axle may have a non-circular cross-section, or the carriage may have projections that engage with grooves in the axle. Alternatively, the carriage and the cleaner head may comprise components that engage when the bearing assembly is in the second position so as to prevent rotation of the carriage relative to the axle, and the components may disengage when the bearing assembly is in the first position. For example, the cleaner head may comprise a sprocket that surrounds the axle, and the carriage may comprise teeth that engage with the sprocket when the bearing assembly is in the second position and disengage with the sprocket when the bearing assembly in the first position. This then permits the use of a circular axle and carriage, which results in a more compact arrangement.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The main body may comprise an opening through which the agitator is removable. The cleaner head may then comprise an end cap that is attachable to the main body to close the opening. Moreover, the agitator may be mounted at a first end on the bearing assembly and at a second end on a bearing or bushing seated within the end cap. A removable agitator has the advantage that the agitator may be more easily cleaned or repaired. With a conventional cleaner head having a removable agitator, there is often a large degree of play in the movement of the agitator relative to the main body. With the cleaner head of the present invention, play in the agitator is prevented or reduced by the biasing member. Upon releasing or removing the end cap from the main body, the biasing member provides a force that pushes the agitator out of the opening. As a result, a user is able to more easily grasp the agitator in order to pull it from the main body.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The cleaner head may comprise a drive assembly for driving the agitator. The drive assembly may then be mounted on the axle, and the agitator may surround the drive assembly. As a result, a more compact cleaner head may be realised. Furthermore, the drive assembly may transfer torque to the agitator without the need for a complex transmission arrangement. Should the agitator be removable from the main body, the agitator may slide over the drive assembly like a sleeve. A coupling element formed integrally within the agitator may then engage directly with the drive assembly. As a result, removal of the agitator from the main body is made relatively easy.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The bearing assembly may contact the drive assembly when in the first position. This then has the advantage that, when the agitator is removed, the drive assembly acts as a stop for the bearing assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The cleaner head may be attached to a duct for rotation about an axis, and the drive assembly may be mounted on the axle such that the centre of gravity of the cleaner head is located in a vertical plane containing the axis. When a conventional cleaner head is lifted off the floor, the head will typically rotate to the left or right due to the weight of the drive assembly. Positioning the drive assembly such that the centre of gravity of the cleaner head is in a vertical plane containing the rotational axis has the advantage that, when lifted, the cleaner head remains level. This then makes handling of the cleaner head easier. Reference is made to a vertical plane since it is not essential that the centre of gravity of the cleaner head lies directly on the rotational axis. Rotation of the cleaner head relative to the duct will also be prevented by having a centre of gravity that is located directly above or below the rotational axis. In the present context, the term ‘containing’ should be understood to mean that the rotational axis is contained wholly within the vertical plane (i.e. the rotational axis is parallel to the vertical plane) and not simply that the rotational axis passes through the vertical plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The biasing member may comprise a coil spring that surrounds the axle. This then has the advantage of providing a relatively compact arrangement for biasing the bearing assembly.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The cleaner head <b>1</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> comprises a main body <b>2</b>, a first end cap <b>3</b>, a second end cap <b>4</b>, a bearing assembly <b>5</b>, a biasing member <b>6</b>, a drive assembly <b>7</b> and an agitator <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The main body <b>2</b> comprises an agitator chamber <b>10</b> within which the agitator <b>8</b> is rotatable mounted. An opening <b>11</b> is provided in the base of the main body <b>2</b>, through which the agitator <b>8</b> is able to agitate a surface. A further opening <b>12</b> is provided in a side of the main body <b>2</b>, through which the agitator <b>8</b> is removable from the main body <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The two end caps <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> are secured to the main body <b>2</b> at opposite sides of the agitator chamber <b>10</b>. The first end cap <b>3</b> is secured to the main body <b>2</b> so as to close the side opening <b>12</b>. The end cap <b>3</b> is secured by means of a bayonet-style fitting and comprises a number of L-shaped slots that engage with an equal number of projections formed on the main body <b>2</b>. The second end cap <b>4</b> comprises a disc <b>20</b>, an axle <b>21</b> that extends centrally from the disc <b>20</b>, and a sprocket <b>22</b> that surrounds the axle <b>21</b>. The end cap <b>4</b> is secured to the main body <b>2</b> such that the axle <b>21</b> extends into the agitator chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The bearing assembly <b>5</b> is slidably mounted on the axle <b>21</b>. Movement of the bearing assembly <b>5</b> along the axle <b>21</b> is limited in one direction by the drive assembly <b>7</b>, which is mounted to the axle <b>21</b>, and in an opposite direction by the disc <b>20</b>. Consequently, the bearing assembly <b>5</b> is moveable between a first position in which the bearing assembly <b>5</b> contacts the drive assembly <b>7</b> (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) and a second position in which the bearing assembly <b>5</b> contacts the disc <b>20</b> (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The bearing assembly <b>5</b> comprises a carriage <b>30</b>, a bearing <b>31</b> secured to the carriage <b>30</b>, and a mount <b>32</b> secured to the bearing <b>31</b>. The carriage <b>30</b> may be regarded as having a first portion and a second portion. The first portion comprises a collar <b>33</b> that surrounds the axle <b>21</b>. The second portion comprises a brim <b>34</b> that extends radially from the collar <b>33</b> and a plurality of teeth or pickets <b>35</b> that extend axially from the brim <b>34</b> in a direction towards the disc <b>20</b> of the second end cap <b>4</b>. The bearing <b>31</b> comprises an inner race and an outer race. The inner race is then secured to the carriage <b>30</b>, and the outer race is secured to the mount <b>32</b>. The mount <b>32</b> comprises a cylindrical section <b>37</b> and a conical section <b>38</b> that extends outwardly from an end of the cylindrical section <b>37</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The biasing member <b>6</b> comprises a coil spring that surrounds the axle <b>21</b>. The biasing member <b>6</b> is located between the disc <b>20</b> of the second end cap <b>4</b> and the carriage <b>30</b> of the bearing assembly <b>5</b>. The biasing member <b>6</b> thus biases the bearing assembly <b>5</b> towards the first position.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The drive assembly <b>7</b> is mounted on the axle <b>21</b> and comprises a motor mount <b>40</b>, an electric motor <b>41</b>, a circuit assembly <b>42</b> for controlling the electric motor <b>41</b>, and a coupling element <b>43</b>. The motor mount <b>40</b> comprises a generally cylindrical body that houses the circuit assembly <b>42</b>. The motor mount <b>40</b> is secured at one end to the axle <b>21</b> and at an opposite end to the electric motor <b>41</b>. The electric motor <b>41</b> is secured to the motor mount <b>40</b> such that the shaft <b>44</b> of the electric motor <b>41</b> is co-axial with the axle <b>21</b> and thus with the bearing assembly <b>5</b>. The coupling element <b>43</b> is secured to the shaft <b>44</b> of the electric motor <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The agitator <b>8</b> comprises a cylindrical body <b>50</b> to which bristles, flicker strips, or other means <b>51</b> for agitating a surface are secured. The agitator <b>8</b> further comprises a coupling element <b>52</b> located inside and formed integrally with the body <b>50</b>. The agitator <b>8</b> is mounted at one end on the bearing assembly <b>5</b>, and at the opposite end on a bearing <b>13</b> seated within the first end cap <b>3</b>. The agitator <b>8</b> is thus rotatably mounted within the agitator chamber <b>10</b>. The agitator <b>8</b> pushes the bearing assembly <b>5</b> along the axle <b>21</b> against the biasing member <b>6</b> towards the second position. The teeth <b>35</b> of the carriage <b>30</b> then engage with the sprocket <b>22</b>. The agitator <b>8</b> surrounds the drive assembly <b>7</b>, and the coupling element <b>43</b> of the drive assembly <b>7</b> engages with the coupling element <b>52</b> of the agitator <b>8</b> such that the torque generated by the electric motor <b>41</b> is transferred to the agitator <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">During operation, the torque generated by the drive assembly <b>7</b> is transferred to the agitator <b>8</b>, thereby causing the agitator <b>8</b> to rotate. The biasing member <b>6</b> biases the bearing assembly <b>5</b> towards the first position, i.e. in a direction towards the first end cap <b>3</b>. The agitator <b>8</b>, which is mounted between the bearing assembly <b>5</b> and the first end cap <b>3</b>, is therefore held relatively tightly within the agitator chamber <b>10</b>. Consequently, movement of the agitator <b>8</b> in an axial direction (i.e. in a direction parallel to the rotational axis of the agitator <b>8</b>) is significantly reduced. Indeed, axial movement is possible only by overcoming the bias force of the biasing member <b>6</b>, which is already in a compressed or charged state.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">An end of the agitator <b>8</b> comprises a conical inner surface <b>53</b> which mates with the conical section <b>38</b> of the mount <b>32</b>. Since the biasing member <b>6</b> biases the bearing assembly <b>5</b> in a direction towards the first end cap <b>3</b>, the conical section <b>38</b> of the mount <b>32</b> is pushed into and mates tightly with the conical surface <b>53</b> of the agitator <b>8</b>. This then has two benefits. First, the agitator <b>8</b> is held tightly at one end against the mount <b>32</b>. The opposite end of the agitator is held tightly against the bearing <b>13</b> seated within the first end cap <b>3</b>. Consequently, movement of the agitator <b>8</b> in a radial direction (i.e. in a direction normal to the rotational axis of the agitator <b>8</b>) is prevented. Second, by employing conical surfaces, the concentricity of the agitator <b>8</b> relative to the bearing <b>31</b> is improved. Consequently, as the agitator <b>8</b> rotates, radial loading of the bearing <b>31</b> is reduced. In particular, radial loading due to out-of-balance forces are reduced and thus the lifespan of the bearing <b>31</b> is prolonged.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The outer diameter of the cylindrical section <b>37</b> of the mount <b>32</b> is slightly larger than that of the drive assembly <b>7</b>. Consequently, should the agitator <b>8</b> slip off or otherwise find itself unsupported by the conical section <b>38</b>, the agitator <b>8</b> is nevertheless prevented from contacting the drive assembly <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The teeth <b>35</b> of the carriage <b>30</b> engage the sprocket <b>22</b> of the second end cap <b>4</b> such that rotation of the carriage <b>30</b> relative to the axle <b>21</b> is prevented. Consequently, as the agitator <b>8</b> rotates, the mount <b>32</b> and the outer race of the bearing <b>31</b> rotate, whilst the carriage <b>30</b> and inner race of the bearing <b>31</b> remain static. This then ensures that the carriage <b>30</b> does not rotate relative to the axle <b>21</b>, which would otherwise generate significant noise and eventually lead to wear and potential failure of the carriage <b>30</b> and/or axle <b>21</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The agitator <b>8</b> is removable from the main body <b>2</b> in order that a user may more easily remove hair, fibre, and other debris that have become trapped around the agitator <b>8</b>. In order to remove the agitator <b>8</b>, the first end cap <b>3</b> is released from the main body <b>2</b> by twisting the first end cap <b>3</b> relative to the main body <b>2</b>. The biasing member <b>6</b> biases the bearing assembly <b>5</b> and thus the agitator <b>8</b> in a direction towards the first end cap <b>3</b>. Consequently, on releasing the first end cap <b>3</b>, the biasing member <b>6</b> pushes the agitator <b>8</b> out of the side opening <b>12</b>. The agitator <b>8</b> thus protrudes from the main body <b>2</b> allowing a user to grasp the agitator <b>8</b> and pull it through the side opening <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Once cleaned, the agitator <b>8</b> is returned to the main body <b>2</b> by inserting the agitator <b>8</b> through the side opening <b>12</b>. As the agitator <b>8</b> is pushed through the side opening <b>12</b>, the agitator <b>8</b> slides over the drive assembly <b>7</b> like a sleeve. The end of the agitator <b>8</b> then contacts the bearing assembly <b>5</b>. More specifically, the conical inner surface <b>53</b> of the agitator <b>8</b> mates with the conical section <b>38</b> of the mount <b>32</b>. As the agitator <b>8</b> is pushed further into the main body <b>2</b>, the agitator <b>8</b> pushes the bearing assembly <b>5</b> against the biasing member <b>6</b> towards the second position. The coupling element <b>52</b> of the agitator <b>8</b> then engages with the coupling element <b>43</b> of the drive assembly <b>7</b>, and the teeth <b>35</b> of the carriage <b>30</b> engage with sprocket <b>12</b> of the second end cap <b>3</b>. Finally, the first end cap <b>3</b>, which is carried by the agitator <b>8</b> by virtue of the bearing <b>13</b>, is secured to the main body <b>2</b> so as to close the side opening <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">
        <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate a cleaning appliance <b>60</b> comprising the cleaner head <b>1</b>. In this particular example, the cleaning appliance <b>60</b> is a stick vacuum cleaner. However, the cleaner head <b>1</b> may equally be used with other types of cleaning appliance. The cleaner head <b>1</b> is rotatably attached to a duct <b>61</b> of the cleaning appliance <b>60</b>. More particularly, the cleaner head <b>1</b> rotates relative to the duct <b>61</b> about a rotational axis <b>62</b>. This rotational axis <b>62</b> is then orthogonal to the axis of rotation of the agitator <b>8</b>. The two axes may be spaced from one another, which is to say that the two axes do not necessary intersect. Nevertheless, the two axes are orthogonal, i.e. the unit vectors are orthogonal.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The drive assembly <b>7</b> forms a relatively heavy component of the cleaner head <b>1</b> and thus has a large influence on the location of the centre of gravity of the cleaner head <b>1</b>. The drive assembly <b>7</b> is mounted along the axle <b>21</b> such that the centre of gravity of the cleaner head <b>1</b> lies in a vertical plane <b>63</b> containing the rotational axis <b>62</b> of the cleaner head <b>1</b>. This then has the advantage that, when the cleaner head <b>1</b> is lifted off the floor (e.g. in order to manoeuvre the cleaner head <b>1</b> over or around an object), the cleaner head <b>1</b> does not rotate relative to the duct <b>61</b>. This then makes handling of the cleaner head <b>1</b> easier. In contrast, the centre of gravity of most conventional cleaner heads is offset relative to the axis of rotation. Consequently, when the cleaner head is lifted off the floor, the cleaner head rotates to one side, thus making handling more difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">A weight-balanced cleaner head <b>1</b> is made possible by having a motor mount <b>40</b> that spans the vertical plane <b>63</b> containing the rotational axis <b>62</b> of the cleaner head <b>1</b>. Consequently, the electric motor <b>41</b>, which represents a relatively heavy component of the drive assembly <b>7</b> and thus of the cleaner head <b>1</b>, is mounted to the main body <b>2</b> on one side of the vertical plane <b>63</b> but is then physically located on the opposite side of the vertical plane <b>63</b>. It is not at all obvious to locate the electric motor <b>41</b> in this manner, particular when the agitator <b>8</b> is removable, since the weight of the electric motor <b>41</b> generates a relatively large moment of force that acts on the axle <b>21</b>. Moreover, if there is any radial play in the agitator <b>8</b>, the weight of the electric motor <b>41</b> acting on the agitator <b>8</b> will cause the rotational axis of the agitator <b>8</b> to precess, thereby generating significant out-of balance forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The centre of gravity of the cleaner head <b>1</b> need not lie directly on the rotational axis <b>62</b> of the cleaner head <b>1</b>. Rotation of the cleaner head <b>1</b> relative to the duct <b>61</b> will also be prevented by having a centre of gravity that is located directly above or below the rotational axis <b>62</b>. It is for this reason that reference is made to a vertical plane <b>63</b> containing the rotational axis <b>62</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In the embodiment described above, the agitator <b>8</b> is removable from the main body <b>2</b>. This then has the advantage that debris trapped around the agitator <b>8</b> may be more easily removed. Nevertheless, it is not essential that the agitator <b>8</b> is removable from the main body <b>2</b>, and trapped debris may be removed by accessing the agitator <b>8</b> via the opening <b>11</b> in the base of the main body <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The drive assembly <b>7</b> comprises an electric motor <b>41</b>, which generates the torque necessary to drive the agitator <b>8</b>. Conceivably, the drive assembly <b>7</b> might comprise alternative means for generating the necessary torque. For example, where the cleaner head <b>1</b> is intended to form part of a vacuum cleaner, the drive assembly <b>7</b> may comprise an air turbine. The suction generated by the vacuum cleaner may then cause air to be drawn in through an opening in a side of the main body <b>2</b>, through the centre of the axle <b>21</b>, through the drive assembly <b>7</b> to thereby power the air turbine, and then out through an end of the agitator <b>8</b> and into the agitator chamber <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the embodiment described above, the drive assembly <b>7</b> is located wholly within the agitator <b>8</b>. This then has the advantage of providing a relatively compact cleaner head <b>1</b>. Nevertheless, the drive assembly <b>7</b>, or part thereof, may be located outside the agitator <b>8</b>. For example, the electric motor <b>41</b> and the circuit assembly <b>42</b> may be located elsewhere in the main body <b>2</b>, and torque may be transferred from the electric motor <b>41</b> to the agitator <b>8</b> via a transmission arrangement. Moreover, depending on the type of cleaning appliance, the drive assembly <b>7</b> could conceivably be located within the body of the cleaning appliance.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The mount <b>32</b> has been described as having a cylindrical section <b>37</b> and a conical section <b>38</b>. The conical section <b>38</b> then mates with a conical surface <b>53</b> of the agitator <b>8</b>, and the cylindrical section <b>37</b> provides a safeguard for supporting the agitator <b>8</b> should the agitator <b>8</b> slip from the conical section <b>38</b>. In should nevertheless be appreciated that the mount <b>32</b> may have any shape capable of supporting the agitator <b>8</b>. That being said, there are advantages in providing the mount <b>32</b> with a ramped surface that mates with a corresponding ramped surface in the agitator <b>8</b>. In particular, movement of the agitator <b>8</b> in a radial direction may be prevented or significantly reduced. Additionally, relatively good concentricity may be achieved between the agitator <b>8</b> and the bearing <b>31</b>. Consequently, radial loading of the bearing <b>31</b> by the agitator <b>8</b> is reduced and thus the lifespan of the bearing <b>31</b> is prolonged.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Remaining with the bearing assembly <b>7</b>, it is not necessary that the carriage <b>30</b> of the bearing assembly <b>7</b> has teeth <b>35</b> or that the first end cap <b>3</b> has a sprocket <b>22</b>. Indeed, it is not essential that the bearing assembly <b>7</b> comprises a carriage <b>30</b> at all. For example, the carriage <b>30</b> may be omitted and the inner race of the bearing <b>31</b> may contact and slide up and down the axle <b>21</b>. The disadvantage of this arrangement, however, is that the inner race of the bearing <b>31</b> may rotate relative to the axle <b>21</b> during use. As a further alternative, the teeth <b>35</b> and the sprocket <b>22</b> may be omitted and rotation of the carriage <b>30</b> relative to the axle <b>21</b> may be prevented by other means. For example, the axle <b>21</b> may have a non-circular cross-section or the carriage <b>30</b> may have projections that engage with grooves in the axle <b>21</b>. However, since the bearing <b>31</b> is circular, the use of a non-circular axle <b>21</b> is likely to increase the outer diameter of the bearing assembly <b>7</b>. Furthermore, the inside of the axle <b>21</b> may be used to carry an airflow to the drive assembly <b>7</b>, e.g. in order to cool or drive components of the drive assembly <b>7</b>. Employing an axle <b>21</b> having a non-circular cross-section or grooves is likely to reduce the cross-sectional area inside the axle and thus impede the flow of air to the drive assembly <b>7</b>.</p>
