      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention a self-propelled surface cleaning machine is provided that has high driving safety together with high maneuverability.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the self-propelled surface cleaning machine comprises: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>a floor cleaning device;</li><li>a steerable front wheel;</li><li>a steering device associated with the front wheel;</li><li>a rear wheel device having at least one left rear wheel and at least one right rear wheel;</li><li>a first drive device for driving the front wheel;</li><li>a second drive device for driving the rear wheel device; and</li><li>a differential device for the rear wheel device that allows different speeds of rotation for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0017">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, both the front wheel and the rear wheel device including the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel are driven. It is thereby possible to accomplish high driving velocities together with high driving safety. The self-propelled surface cleaning machine has high traction together with high climbing ability. By way of example, this makes it possible for the surface cleaning machine to be also used as a towing vehicle or as a pushing vehicle.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0018">The differential device at the rear wheel device allows different rotational speeds to be achieved for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel. It is thereby possible to achieve high agility and maneuverability of the surface cleaning machine. The differential device allows for different velocities at the rear wheel device.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0019">The first drive device and the second drive device result in a wide range of control options in order to obtain favourable driving characteristics (with respect to agility and maneuverability, velocity, climbing ability etc.) for existing driving parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0020">It is advantageous for the first drive device to comprise a wheel motor and to comprise in particular a wheel hub motor. It is thereby possible for the front wheel to be driven directly and the expense for a gear, for example, is minimized.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0021">It is then advantageous if, in a steering, pivoting motion of the front wheel, the first drive device is co-pivoted therewith. It is thereby possible to eliminate the need for a gear which transmits to the front wheel a drive torque of for example a motor arranged in fixed relation to the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0022">It is advantageous for the first drive device to comprise an electric motor. This provides a simple way of realizing an emission-free surface cleaning machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0023">Advantageously, the second drive device comprises a common drive for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel. The number of motors needed can thereby be reduced. The differential device then still permits different rotational speeds or path velocities for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel, despite the common drive.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0024">It is advantageous for the second drive device to comprise an electric motor. It is thereby possible for an emission-free surface cleaning machine to be realized that is also suitable for use in closed locations.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0025">In an embodiment, the differential device is an axle differential device. It allows different speeds of rotation for the left rear wheel and the right rear wheel. High agility and maneuverability are thereby achieved for the surface cleaning machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0026">In particular, the differential device is or comprises a mechanical differential gear. This makes it possible for example to use a common motor for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel, while it is still possible to provide different speeds of rotation for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0027">It is particularly advantageous for a control device to be provided which is operatively connected for signal communication with a steering angle sensor device, the first drive device and the second drive device, wherein the control device controls, and in particular individually controls, the first drive device and the second drive device depending on signals from the steering angle sensor device. It is thereby possible to adjust optimum driving conditions for particular steering angles (preset by an operator). For example, the maximum driving velocity is limited depending on a detected steering angle so that cornering too fast can be avoided.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0028">It is advantageous for a sensor device for detecting a velocity presetting to be provided, said sensor device being operatively connected for signal communication with the control device, in particular wherein the control device controls, and in particular individually controls, the first drive device and the second drive device depending on signals from the steering angle sensor device and the sensor device for detecting a velocity presetting. In the control, the velocity presetting is then detected in addition to the steering angle. The velocity presetting need not necessarily correspond to the actual velocity caused by the control device. By way of example, if it is detected that the velocity presetting is too high for the preset steering angle, then the maximum velocity is limited.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0029">The sensor device for detecting a velocity presetting is in particular a sensor device for detecting a position of one or more actuating elements. One actuating element is for example an accelerator pedal for velocity presetting. By way of example, the position of the brake pedal can also be taken into account.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0030">In an exemplary embodiment, the control device comprises a first operational mode which blocks the second drive device at a steering angle of about 90Â° or close to 90Â° (for example with a deviation of +/â5Â° from 90Â°) relative to a straight ahead travel position of the front wheel. At such a steering angle, drive to the rear wheel device will cease. By way of the blocking action, different speeds of rotation are realized at the rear wheel device. It is thereby possible that, when cornering, the outside rear wheel and the inside rear wheel have opposite speeds of rotation. A high level of maneuverability is realized.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0031">In particular, when in the first operational mode, the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel then have rotational speeds of different signs in order to achieve a high level of agility.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0032">Furthermore, the control device can comprise a second operational mode in which the front wheel, the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel have the same velocity. High climbing ability of the surface cleaning machine can thereby be realized, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0033">In particular, the surface cleaning machine has a middle plane with respect to which the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel have mirror symmetry and at which is positioned the front wheel, in particular in parallel relationship, in the straight ahead travel position thereof. It is thereby possible for a three-wheeled surface cleaning machine to be realized that has high agility.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0034">In particular, a pivot point of the surface cleaning machine is located at a middle point of an axis of the rear wheel device when cornering. In this way, a high level of agility can be realized. This results in optimized floor (ground) cleaning capabilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0035">In an embodiment, provision is made for at least one trailer coupling to be present on the surface cleaning machine, said trailer coupling being in particular arranged at a body. By driving the front wheel and the rear wheel device, it is in principle possible for the surface cleaning machine to be utilized as a towing machine or as a pushing machine. The at least one trailer coupling allows trailers to be coupled. By way of example, it is thereby possible for the surface cleaning machine to be used to realize a transport system, wherein a transport operation using the surface cleaning machine as a towing or pushing machine can be accomplished simultaneously with a floor (ground) cleaning operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0036">In particular, the surface cleaning machine is configured as a scrubbing machine or as a scrubber vacuum machine or as a sweeping machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0037">Provision may be made for the floor cleaning device to comprise one or more scrubbing elements which are in particular rotatable. It is advantageous for these scrubbing elements to be arranged between the front wheel and the rear wheel device. This results in a construction of the surface cleaning machine that is simple in structure and yet can provide optimized cleaning results.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0038">It is further advantageous for the surface cleaning machine to comprise an application device for cleaning liquid via which a cleaning liquid is capable of being applied to a floor. This allows for effective cleaning of smooth surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0039">Advantageously, the application area is located between the front wheel and the rear wheel device. In this way, the front wheel can ride in âdry areaâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0040">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a method for operating a self-propelled surface cleaning machine is provided, said method resulting in a wide range of applications for the surface cleaning machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0041">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a steered front wheel is driven by a first drive device and a rear wheel device having at least one left rear wheel and at least one right rear wheel is driven by a second drive device, wherein the rear wheel device has associated with it a differential device for the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel by way of which the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel can have different speeds of rotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0042">The method in accordance with the invention has the advantages that have already been explained in conjunction with the surface cleaning machine constructed in accordance with the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0043">Further advantageous embodiments of the method in accordance with the invention have likewise already been explained in conjunction with the surface cleaning machine constructed in accordance with the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0044">In particular, control of the first drive device for the front wheel and of the second drive device for the rear wheel device is realized depending on a detected steering angle for the front wheel. This results in optimized driving safety; for example, it provides a simple way of accomplishing velocity limitation when cornering.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0045">In particular, control is also realized depending on a detected velocity presetting preset by an operator by, for example, a foot pedal (accelerator pedal) and/or a brake pedal.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0046">A simple construction is obtained if the differential device comprises a mechanical axle differential. By way of example, it is thereby possible to provide a common motor for both the at least one left rear wheel and the at least one right rear wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0047">In an embodiment, when the steering angle of 90Â° or close to 90Â° relative to a straight ahead travel position is detected, drive to the rear wheel device is blocked and a rotational speed of the at least one left rear wheel and a rotational speed of the at least one right rear wheel can occur with different signs. This results in optimized cornering capabilities and in particular results in high agility and maneuverability.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0053">An exemplary embodiment of a self-propelled surface cleaning machine constructed in accordance with the invention, shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and designated therein by the reference numeral <b>10</b>, is attendant-controlled. The surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> has a body <b>12</b>. Mounted to the body <b>12</b> are a front wheel <b>14</b> and a rear wheel device <b>16</b>. Via the front wheel <b>14</b> and the rear wheel device <b>16</b>, the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> can drive on a floor <b>18</b> that is to be cleaned.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0054">The front wheel <b>14</b> is connected to a steering device designated generally at <b>20</b>. By way of the steering device <b>20</b>, an angular position of the front wheel <b>14</b> with respect to a middle plane <b>22</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> can be adjusted. In straight ahead travel (indicated by the reference numeral <b>24</b> in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>), the front wheel <b>14</b> is oriented parallel to the middle plane <b>22</b> and a corresponding steering angle is a zero angle.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0055">Straight ahead travel <b>24</b> comprises forward travel and reverse travel. Forward travel is indicated by the reference numeral <b>26</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and reverse travel is indicated by the reference numeral <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0056">The steering device <b>20</b> defines a steering axis <b>30</b>. Preferably, said steering axis <b>30</b> lies in the middle plane <b>22</b>. The steering axis <b>30</b> is oriented transversely and for example perpendicularly to a wheel axis <b>32</b> of the front wheel <b>14</b>. The front wheel <b>14</b> is capable of rotating about the wheel axis <b>32</b> which is transverse to the middle plane <b>22</b>. When travelling straight ahead in the straight ahead travel direction <b>24</b>, the wheel axis <b>32</b> is oriented perpendicularly to the middle plane <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0057">Arranged on the body <b>12</b> is a seat <b>34</b> for a driver. A driver sitting on the seat <b>34</b> can operate a steering wheel <b>36</b> of the steering device <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0058">The surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> comprises a steering angle sensor device <b>38</b>. Said steering angle sensor device <b>38</b> enables a steering angle at the front wheel <b>14</b> and in particular an angular position of the front wheel <b>14</b> relative to the middle plane <b>22</b> to be detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0059">By way of example, the steering device <b>20</b> comprises a mechanical steering rod which connects the front wheel <b>14</b> and the steering wheel <b>36</b>. In particular, the sensor device <b>38</b> then senses an angular position of the steering wheel <b>36</b> or of the steering rod.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0060">Alternatively, it is for example also possible for the steering device <b>20</b> to comprise steering rods with a gear interposed therebetween. One steering rod is connected to the steering wheel <b>36</b> and another steering rod is connected to the front wheel <b>14</b>. A gear interposed therebetween provides for rotational angle reduction or rotational angle increase. It is also possible for the gear to be connected to the steering wheel <b>36</b> directly or to be connected to the front wheel <b>14</b> directly.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0061">It is, for example, also possible for the steering device <b>20</b> to comprise a steering motor, and a steering position of the front wheel <b>14</b> is then motor-controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0062">The front wheel <b>14</b> has a first drive device <b>40</b> associated with it which drives the front wheel <b>14</b> in its rotational motion in a controlled manner. The first drive device <b>40</b> comprises a wheel hub motor <b>42</b>. The wheel hub motor <b>42</b> is in particular an electric motor.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0063">In a steering movement of the front wheel <b>14</b>, the wheel hub motor <b>42</b> co-moves therewith.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0064">The first drive device <b>40</b> for the front wheel <b>14</b> is controlled by a control device <b>44</b>. The steering angle sensor device <b>38</b> sends its signals for the detected steering angle to the control device <b>44</b> and to this end, these components are operatively connected together for signal communication.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0065">In one embodiment, the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> comprises an accelerator pedal <b>46</b> and a brake pedal as an actuating element. By actuating (in particular by foot-actuating) said accelerator pedal <b>46</b> and possibly the brake pedal, a user presets the velocity of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the velocity presetting need not necessarily correspond to the actual target speed; for example, provision may be made that when too high a velocity is preset for a particular steering angle position, the control device <b>44</b> provides for velocity limitation (âupper limit speed regulationâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0066">To this end, a sensor device <b>48</b> (<figref>FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>) is provided which detects a velocity presetting by the operator. In the exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the sensor device <b>48</b> detects a position of the accelerator pedal <b>46</b> and of the brake pedal. The sensor device <b>48</b> is operatively connected for signal communication with the control device <b>44</b> and provides its signals thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0067">The rear wheel device <b>16</b> comprises (at least) one left rear wheel <b>50</b> and (at least) one right rear wheel <b>52</b>. Here, the terms âleftâ and ârightâ refer to the forward travel direction <b>26</b> in straight ahead travel <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0068">The left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> are capable of rotating about a common wheel axis <b>54</b>. The wheel axis <b>54</b> is fixed relative to the middle plane <b>22</b> and is perpendicular thereto; the rear wheel device <b>16</b> is unsteered.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0069">In principle, the rear wheel device <b>16</b> can be of multi-axle configuration. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the rear wheel device <b>16</b> is a single-axle configuration. The surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> is then three-wheeled.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0070">In cornering, a pivot point <b>56</b> (the piercing point of the axis of rotation) of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> as a whole is located at a middle point <b>56</b> of the wheel axis <b>54</b>, on the middle plane <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0071">The rear wheel device <b>16</b> has a differential device <b>58</b> associated with it. Said differential device <b>58</b> permits different speeds of rotation for the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>. To this end, the left rear wheel <b>50</b> is mounted on a first shaft <b>60</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> is mounted on a second shaft <b>62</b>, for example. The first shaft <b>60</b> and the second shaft <b>62</b> are coupled to an axle differential gear <b>64</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0072">The rear wheel device <b>16</b> has a second drive device <b>66</b> associated with it which drives the rear wheel device <b>16</b>, and thus the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>, in rotation about the wheel axis <b>54</b>. As mentioned above, the differential device <b>58</b> permits different speeds of rotation for the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0073">In an exemplary embodiment, the second drive device <b>66</b> comprises a common motor <b>68</b> for the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>. The combination of second drive device <b>66</b> and differential device <b>58</b> then forms a differential motor.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0074">The second drive device <b>66</b> is operatively coupled for signal communication with the control device <b>44</b>, which controls the second drive device <b>66</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0075">In particular, the second drive device <b>66</b> comprises an electric motor. In the exemplary embodiment, electric motors are provided for the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b>. The surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> then comprises a battery device for supplying energy to the electric motors, said battery device being in particular rechargeable.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0076">The electric motors may be ones in which the rotational speeds thereof are fixed by presetting an electric voltage, as in electric motors having permanent magnet rotors. The control device <b>44</b> can then preset the rotational speeds at the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b> by corresponding control commands.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0077">Other types of motors, such as motors of the asynchronous type, may also be employed. In this case, corresponding sensors at the drive devices detect the actual speeds of rotation and transmit these to the control device <b>44</b>. Such an embodiment is indicated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> by signal lines <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>represented by broken lines.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0078">In the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b>, both the front wheel <b>14</b> and the rear wheel device <b>16</b> including the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> are driven. Depending on a detected steering position (detected by the steering angle sensor device <b>38</b>) and a velocity presetting (transmitted via the sensor device <b>48</b>), the control device <b>44</b> provides for an adjustment of the velocities of the front wheel <b>14</b> and the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>, wherein again, through the action of the differential device <b>58</b>, different velocities may be present at the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> of the rear wheel device <b>16</b>. This will be explained in more detail hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0079">In an exemplary embodiment, the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> is configured as a scrubbing machine and is configured in particular as a scrubber vacuum machine. It comprises a floor cleaning device <b>72</b> which in the exemplary embodiment of the scrubbing machine or scrubber vacuum machine is a scrubbing type floor cleaning device. It has scrubbing elements <b>74</b> which are arranged on an underside <b>76</b> of the body <b>12</b>. A scrubbing element <b>74</b> is arranged, for example rotatably, between the rear wheel device <b>16</b> and the front wheel <b>14</b> in facing relation to the floor <b>18</b> on which the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> stands.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0080">The floor cleaning device <b>72</b> further comprises an application device <b>78</b> for cleaning liquid via which cleaning liquid is capable of being applied in an application area to the floor <b>18</b> to be cleaned. The cleaning liquid is for example a mixture of water and added chemical. The application device <b>78</b> comprises a plurality of nozzles through which the cleaning liquid is capable of being applied to the application area. The nozzles can be arranged in one or more rows.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0081">The nozzles are arranged and configured such that spray is applied directly to the one or more scrubbing elements <b>74</b>, which are cleaning tools, or cleaning liquid gets to the floor <b>18</b> from there, and/or such that spray is applied directly to the floor <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0082">The application area for cleaning liquid from the application device <b>78</b> is located between the front wheel <b>14</b> and the rear wheel device <b>16</b>. The result is that in cleaning travel, the front wheel <b>14</b> does not travel in an area that has cleaning liquid applied thereto, i.e. it rides in dry area, while the rear wheel device <b>16</b> travel across the area of the floor <b>18</b> that has cleaning liquid applied thereto, i.e. rides in wet area.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0083">A tank for cleaning liquid is arranged at the body <b>12</b>. The tank can comprise a portion for holding for example water and a portion for holding chemical additives. Via the tank or a mixing portion thereof, the nozzles are supplied with cleaning liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0084">In an exemplary embodiment, the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> comprises a suction device <b>80</b> via which excess liquid is capable of being sucked up from the floor <b>18</b>. To this end a suction bar <b>82</b> is provided, for example, which is in contact with the floor <b>18</b> when operating in cleaning mode. Said suction bar <b>82</b> is arranged rearwardly of the rear wheel device <b>16</b> relative to the forward travel direction <b>26</b>. Liquid is sucked up via said suction bar <b>82</b> and is received in a dirty water tank.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0085">A trailer coupling <b>84</b> is arranged at the body <b>12</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown, a trailer coupling <b>84</b> is positioned at a rear end <b>86</b> of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b>. A trailer can thereby be drawn (when in forward travel <b>26</b>) or pushed (when in reverse travel <b>28</b>) by the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b>. By the trailer coupling <b>84</b>, the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> can be employed as a towing machine which at the same time performs a floor cleaning operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0086">It is also possible for a trailer coupling to be arranged at the body <b>12</b> of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> at a front end <b>88</b> thereof. It is thereby possible for the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> to be employed as a pushing machine (in forward travel <b>26</b>) or as a towing machine (in reverse travel <b>28</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0087">The self-propelled surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> works as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0088">Both the front wheel <b>14</b> and the rear wheel device <b>16</b> are driven, namely via the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b> respectively. The control device <b>44</b> (compare <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) controls the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b>. Driving both the front wheel <b>14</b> and the rear wheel device <b>16</b> results in an improvement of traction and climbing ability and braking ability, together with high maneuverability. For example, it provides the ability to negotiate steep ramps and to accomplish a higher maximum velocity on a level floor <b>18</b> together with high driving safety.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0089">The trailer coupling <b>84</b> allows the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> to be used as a towing machine. By way of example, it is thereby possible for the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> to be integrated into a production process in which it transports workpieces by one or more trailers, while also being capable of performing floor cleaning.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0090">The control device <b>44</b> controls the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b> depending on signals from the steering angle sensor device <b>38</b> and the sensor device <b>48</b> for detecting velocity presettings.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0091">By way of example, it is thereby possible to perform velocity limitation depending on a steering angle. For example, if the control device <b>44</b> recognizes that for a particular steering angle, as detected via the steering angle sensor device <b>38</b>, a velocity presetting by an operator (detected via the sensor device <b>48</b>) is too high, then the control device <b>44</b> controls the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b> correspondingly in order to achieve a limited velocity of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0092">The control device <b>44</b> controls the first drive device <b>40</b> and the second drive device <b>66</b> individually. It is thereby possible to obtain different rotational speeds or path velocities for the front wheel <b>14</b> and for the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>. In principle, it is thereby possible to improve traction, and a high level of maneuverability is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0093">In particular, a first operational mode is provided which is at a steering angle of about 90Â° or close to 90Â° (with a deviation of +/â5Â°, for example), where the 90Â° angle is related to the straight ahead travel direction <b>24</b>. When such a steering angle is detected (via the steering angle sensor device <b>38</b>), then the control device <b>44</b> sends to the second drive device <b>66</b> a blocking signal which blocks the corresponding motor of the second drive device <b>66</b>. By the differential device <b>58</b>, the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> are then capable of rotating freely in opposite directions with respect to the wheel axis <b>54</b>. This makes it possible for a wheel on the outside of the curve to rotate forward and for a wheel at the inside of the curve to rotate backward. This results in maximum agility, wherein in the first operational mode, the driving of the surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> as a whole is realized via the first drive device <b>40</b> by driving the front wheel <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0094">In a second operational mode for forward travel <b>26</b> or reverse travel <b>28</b>, the left rear wheel <b>50</b>, the right rear wheel <b>52</b> and the front wheel <b>14</b> are at the same path velocity.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0095">As mentioned above, the control device <b>44</b> provides that in cornering, the highest possible velocity is limited, in particular depending on the steering angle, in order to ensure safe driving behaviour.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0096">The differential device <b>58</b> makes possible different speeds of rotation for the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>. It is thereby possible to achieve high traction which enables differences in floor (ground) situations at the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b> to be taken into account.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0097">The differential device <b>58</b> allows safe driving behaviour to be achieved when cornering, wherein safe cornering is possible even at a 90Â° steering angle. This in turn provides for the high level of maneuverability as above mentioned. Using a mechanical differential device <b>58</b> affords in particular the possibility of employing a common motor <b>28</b> for driving both the left rear wheel <b>50</b> and the right rear wheel <b>52</b>, with the mechanical differential device permitting different speeds of rotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0098">The self-propelled surface cleaning machine <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the invention can drive faster, has a higher climbing ability and exhibits enhanced traction. It can be utilized as a towing machine or as a pushing machine.</p>
