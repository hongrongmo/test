      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention, relates to domestic cooking appliances, and more particularly to a domestic sous vide device.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention has been developed primarily for use as a domestic sous vide device and will be described hereinafter with reference to this application. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular field of use.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A sous vide device (French for âunder vacuumâ) is a method of cooking food in sealed plastic bags in a water bath. The purpose of sous vide cooking is too cook an item, evenly, but over cook it and to retain, moisture and flavour. Sous Vide uses temperature considerably lower then covenantal cooking. Sous Vide cooking of meet is capable of hydrolysing tough connective tissue into gelatine without heating the protein in the meat to the point that they denature and become tough. Sous vide cooking of vegetables allows the vegetables to be cooked below the boiling point of water while maintain a firm texture. Food places in a sous vide water bath, cannot become hotter than the bath, it is in. Accordingly, sous vide prevents overcooking and promotes even cooking with irregularly shaped or thick items.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Because of the long cooking times, it would be an advantage is sous vide cooking to cook multiple and different food items simultaneously. Because sous vide cooking requires submersion of the food in a bag from which, the air the air has been excluded, it would be advantageous to provide a sous vide cooker with a built in or integral vacuum pump. Further, because the exclusion of the air in the bag is sometimes incomplete, it is an advantage to provide a sous vide cooker that can submerge bags that tend to float.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">It is an object of the invention in its preferred form to provide a sous vide cooker.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It is an object of the invention in its preferred form to provide a sous vide cooker for cooking eggs.</p>

The user display <b>631</b> enables the user to select any one or more of egg type using input element <b>621</b>, egg temperature using input element <b>622</b> and egg quantity using input element <b>623</b>. Based on these user inputs, processor element determines or calculates available egg yolk texture and egg white texture using stored data <b>640</b>. The display then presents (at <b>632</b>) options of egg yolk texture for user selection <b>624</b>. The display then presents (at <b>633</b>) options of egg white texture for user selection <b>625</b>. With user selection of the yolk texture and white texture, a cooking time and temperature can be determined and/or calculated, which is presented in the display (at <b>634</b>). The cooking time and cooking temperature can be further modified by the user, using user inputs <b>626</b> and <b>627</b> respectively. For or at commencement of cooking, the user can then select auto-start <b>628</b> or start/cancel <b>629</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0128">In this embodiment, by way of example only, an LCD type display and user input for controlling a sous vide cooker. The LCD display provides a list of food types. The user scrolls through the food types until the arrow or cursor Is adjacent to the user's selection. The user then makes the selection. The display then depicts three input selections which include a list or array of egg types, egg temperature and egg quantity based on the prior selection of eggs. The user scrolls through the egg type list using the arrow or cursor and makes a selection, in this example, âbrownâ. Based on the egg type selection the user then cycles through the egg temperature list and makes a selection, in this example âroom tempâ followed by making a selection of egg quantity in this example â6 eggsâ. The controller utilises the data from a matrix or look up table based on the users selection and displays another selection variable being yolk texture. The display then provides a selection of yolk textures or âlevel of donenessâ. The user scrolls through the yolk textures until the arrow or cursor is adjacent to the user's selection. The user then makes the selection, in this example ârunnyâ. The display then provides a selection of white textures or âlevel of donenessâ. The user scrolls through the white textures until the arrow or cursor is adjacent to the user's selection. The user then, makes the selection, in this example âmediumâ. Once all variables have been selected, the controller utilises the various data inputs from the selection process (food type, egg type, egg temp, egg qty, yolk texture and white texture) to determine (for example, from an algorithm, matrix or look up table) a selected cooking time and temperature. These values are displayed on the interface's display. The user can modify the suggested values of both time and temperature prior to initiating the cooking operation based upon the above mentioned input selections. However, once either Lime or temperature has been adjusted the display typically reverts to a âcustomâ selection for both yolk and white input texture doneness variables. It will be appreciated that the above input sequence can be performed in a different order.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0129">In an embodiment, by way of example only, a start/cancel functionality allows the above mentioned, sequence to begin. The user interface may also offer a delayed start or auto start functionality. For example, the device can be configured with an input of time in hours &amp; minutes both (AM or PM) selection. This functionality allows for the controller to communicate with the device to wake up from standby mode and perform the inputted cooking selection by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0130">It will be appreciated, that the device of <figref>FIG. 27</figref> and <figref>FIG. 28</figref> can automatically lower the basket, or rack apparatus, which lowers the eggs into the body of water. Alternatively a rack can be used which would be manually lowered Into the body of water by the user prior to pressing start. It will be appreciated that, on completion of a cooking operation, the eggs would typically be removed and placed in cold water to achieve the most accurate results, which would gestured or displayed on the display (for example âremove eggs and place in cold waterâ). An audible alarm or beeps can be sounded on starting and/or completion and/or lowering the automatic basket or rack and/or raising of the automatic basket or rack.</p>
