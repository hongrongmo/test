    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">As structural materials capable of being used under a high-temperature and high-pressure environment such as 600Â°C or higher, an Ni-based alloy and an Fe-Ni-based alloy having excellent high-temperature strength may be mentioned. An Ni-based alloy has an excellent high-temperature tensile strength and creep characteristics and the alloy capable of being used even at a high temperature of 700Â°C or higher has been developed and used in power generation plants and jet engine components. However, since an Ni-based alloy tends to cause macroscopic segregation during ingot production, it is considered difficult to produce a large ingot free from segregation. As heat-resistant alloys from which it is relatively easy to produce a large ingot, for example, Inconel (trademark, the same shall apply hereinafter) Alloy 718, Inconel Alloy 706, A286, and the like may be mentioned. These alloys are excellent in productivity of a relatively large ingot and a gas turbine disk or a rotor shaft material for power generation has been produced from an ingot of about 10 tons.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Furthermore, in the case of the use under a high-pressure hydrogen environment, it is necessary to use a material having low susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement as a structural material of a pressure vessel. Since strength and ductility are remarkably lowered upon hydrogen embrittlement, the lowering of safety becomes a big problem. In general, a material having higher strength exhibits increased susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement and, in particular, when a harmful precipitated phase is present, it is known that the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement greatly increases. As alloys achieving both of hydrogen embrittlement resistance and high strength, there are, for example, those proposed in PTLs 1 and 2. In PTL 1, it is considered that it becomes possible to attain high strength without increasing the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement by subjecting JIS SUH 660 steel (hereinafter, A286 alloy) to cold-working. In PTL 2, it is reported that the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement can be reduced by defining the upper limit of the area ratio of NbC in an FeNi-based alloy.</p>

      <b>Summary of Invention</b>

      <b>Technical Problem</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">As mentioned above, since the Ni-based alloy tends to cause macroscopic segregation during ingot production, it is difficult to produce a large ingot free from segregation and an ingot size capable of being produced is limited depending on the alloy composition. Therefore, the application to a relatively large structural component is difficult in the current steel making technology.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Although an Fe-Ni-based alloy is inferior to an Ni-based alloy in short-time high-temperature characteristics, there is a possibility that the Fe-Ni-based alloy can be applied to a large structural component to be used at high temperature since the alloy is excellent in productivity of a large ingot. On the other hand, with regard to the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, the characteristics are different among alloys. As for principal alloys, for example, Inconel Alloy 718 is excellent in high-temperature strength but, since a Î´ phase is precipitated on grain boundaries, it has high susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. Since Inconel Alloy 706 has a high Nb content and a precipitated phase harmful to the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is precipitated when aged for a long time, its use as a structural material to be heated at a high temperature for a long time is no suitable. Since A286 does not contain any precipitated phase harmful to the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, it is known to be a material having low susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. However, since it is inferior to the aforementioned alloys in high-temperature strength, there is a problem that the use as a structural component leads to a weight increase and a cost increase.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Also, with regard to the high strength attained by cold-working as proposed in PTL 1, since the effect is considered to be lost in the case where it is used in a high-temperature environment, its use is limited to the use at a relatively low temperature. With regard to the method proposed in PTL 2, its effect is not clear in the case where hydrogen concentration exceeds 25 ppm and in the case of the use at a high temperature.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention has been made to solve the problems of the above-mentioned conventional ones, and an object thereof is to provide an Fe-Ni-based alloy having excellent high-temperature characteristics and hydrogen embrittlement resistance, which can be used as a structural component of a large pressure vessel and the like to be used in a high-temperature and high-pressure environment or a high-pressure hydrogen environment, or an environment where the both are superposed, and a method for producing the alloy.</p>

      <b>Description of Embodiments</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The following will explain the contents defined in the present invention together with reasons for the limitation. Incidentally, the content of each component in the composition is shown in terms of % by mass. Moreover, "% by mass" and "% by weight" have the same meaning.</p>
    <heading id="h-00011-en">Alloy Composition</heading>
    <heading id="h-00012-en">C: 0.005% to 0.10%</heading>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">C is an additive element that forms carbides to suppress coarsening of crystal grains of an alloy and precipitates on the grain boundaries to improve high-temperature strength but, since a sufficient effect for improving the strength is not exhibited when the content is small, it is necessary to contain C in an amount of at least 0.005% or more. However, when the content is too large, there is a concern that the volume fraction of the other effective precipitated phases such as a Î³' phase is lowered by excessive carbide formation or the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is adversely affected, so that the upper limit is set at 0.10%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 0.01% and the upper limit at 0.08%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00013-en">Si: 0.01% to 0.10%</heading>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Si is a component effective for deoxidation and the like and, in order to obtain the effect, it is necessary to contain it in an amount of at least 0.01 % or more. However, since Si promotes the macrosegregation characteristics and is a constituent element of a precipitated phase harmful to the toughness and the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, the upper limit of the content is set at 0.10%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 0.01% and the upper limit at 0.08%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00014-en">P: 0.015% or less</heading>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">When P is excessively contained, there is a possibility that the segregation of P on the grain boundaries becomes excessive to lower the consistency of the grain boundaries and thus the effect of reducing the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is lost. Therefore, the content of P is limited to 0.015% or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Moreover, in addition to the case where P is inevitably contained, P can be intentionally contained for the following reason. That is, when P is contained in an appropriate amount, it is considered that there is an effect of suppressing excessive accumulation of hydrogen on the grain boundaries and lowering the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement by increasing the consistency of the grain boundaries. In order to obtain the effect, it is necessary to contain P in an amount of 0.003% or more. Therefore, it is desirable to contain P in the range of 0.003 to 0.015%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00015-en">S: 0.003% or less</heading>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The content of S is set at 0.003% that is industrially realizable, as an upper limit.</p>
    <heading id="h-00016-en">Ni: 23.0% to 27.0%</heading>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Ni is an austenite stabilization element and also is an element that becomes necessary for precipitating the Î³' phase. However, when Ni is excessively contained, there is a concern that nickel hydride is formed, so that the lower limit of the content is set at 23.0% and the upper limit thereof is set at 27.0%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 23.5% and the upper limit at 26.0%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00017-en">Cr: 12.0% to 16.0%</heading>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Cr is effective for improving corrosion resistance and oxidation resistance and also contributes the improvement of the high-temperature strength through carbide formation. However, since Cr causes the lowering of the toughness by the precipitation of Î±-Cr in the case where Cr is excessively contained, the lower limit of the content is set at 12.0% and the upper limit thereof is set at 16.0%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 13.0% and the upper limit at 15.0%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00018-en">Mo: 0.01% or less</heading>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Mo is effective for improving strength as a solid solution strengthening element and also is an element that suppresses the diffusion of the alloy elements to improve structural stability. On the other hand, since Mo is a constituent element of a harmful precipitated phase and also worsens the macrosegregation characteristics, the productivity of a large ingot is greatly lowered. Therefore, in the present invention, the content thereof is limited to 0.01% or less.</p>
    <heading id="h-00019-en">Nb: 0.01% or less</heading>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Nb is an element that is effective for strength improvement through precipitation strengthening. However, on the other hand, since Nb is a constituent element of a harmful precipitated phase and also worsens the macrosegregation characteristics, the productivity of a large ingot is greatly lowered. Therefore, in the invention, the content thereof is limited to 0.01% or less.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The above-described S, Mo, and Nb are positioned as unavoidable impurities in the invention, so that it is not essential to contain them.</p>
    <heading id="h-00020-en">W: 2.5% to 6.0%</heading>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">W is an element having effects similar to those of Mo and improves the structural stability together with solution strengthening but the influence on the deterioration of the macrosegregation characteristics, the formation of a harmful precipitated phase, and the like is small as compared with Mo. As a content effective for the structural stability, the lower limit value is set at 2.5%. On the other hand, when W is excessively added, there is a possibility of causing the lowering of the structural stability and the deterioration of the hot-workability resulting from the precipitation of an Î±-W phase and a Laves phase, so that the upper limit is set at 6.0%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 3.0% and the upper limit at 5.5%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00021-en">Al: 1.5% to 2.5%</heading>
    <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Al combines with Ni and Ti in the present alloy system to precipitate a Î³' phase, thereby improving the high-temperature strength. Since an increase in the Î³' phase volume ratio is required in order to attain high strength by the Î³' phase, it is necessary to contain Al in an amount of 1.5% or more. However, when Al is excessively contained, there is a concern of coarse aggregation of the Î³' phase on the grain boundaries or the deterioration of hot-workability, so that the upper limit of the content is set at 2.5%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 1.7% and the upper limit at 2.3%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00022-en">Ti: 1.5% to 2.5%</heading>
    <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Ti is an element constituting the Î³' phase similarly to Al and is an element effective for strength improvement. It is necessary to increase the Î³' phase volume ratio in order to improve the high-temperature strength and hence the Ti content is set at 1.5% or more in consideration of the balance with Al. However, since an excessive content thereof causes coarse aggregation of carbides to lower the toughness and also has an adverse influence on the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement, the upper limit is set at 2.5%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 1.7% and the upper limit at 2.3%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00023-en">B: 0.0020% to 0.0050%, Zr: 0.02% to 0.05%</heading>
    <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">B is effective for high-temperature strength improvement through the segregation mainly on the crystal grain boundaries and can be contained as desired. However, since a borate is formed and makes the grain boundaries brittle when B is excessively contained, in the case where it is contained as desired, the lower limit of the content is set at 0.0020% and the upper limit thereof is set at 0.0050%. For the same reason, it is desirable to set the lower limit at 0.0025% and the upper limit at 0.0045%.</p>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Zr is effective for high-temperature strength improvement through the segregation mainly on the crystal grain boundaries and can be contained as desired. However, since the hot-workability is lowered when Zr is excessively contained, in the case where it is contained as desired, the lower limit of the content is set at 0.025% and the upper limit thereof is set at 0.045%.</p>
    <heading id="h-00024-en">Metal Structure</heading>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Î· phase: not contained</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Î³' phase: volume ratio of 15% or more</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In an Fe-Ni-based alloy, in the case where the Î· phase is precipitated, the toughness and the high-temperature characteristics are lowered and the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement is deteriorated. The Î· phase in the Fe-Ni-based alloy is precipitated through the diffusion of the intraparticle Î³' phase that is metastable, resulting from elevated temperature holding. In order to suppress the precipitation of the Î· phase, it is effective to add Mo that has an effect of suppressing the diffusion. However, since Mo is an element that forms harmful precipitated phases such as Laves phases (Fe<sub>2</sub>(Ti, Mo)) and an X phase (Mo<sub>5</sub>Cr<sub>6</sub>Fe<sub>18</sub>), Mo is desirably not contained in order to improve the structural stability for a long time. In the present alloy, the precipitation of the harmful precipitated phases is prevented by restricting Mo to 0.01% or less in terms of % by mass and the precipitation of the Î· phase is suppressed by containing W that is effective similarly to Mo in an amount of 2.5 to 6.0% in terms of % by mass. Thereby, the Î· phase is not contained in the structure and the precipitation of the Î· phase can be avoided in the high-temperature and long-time use or precipitation initiation time can be shifted to a long time side.</p>
    <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Moreover, in order to improve the high-temperature strength, precipitation strengthening by a finely precipitated phase is effective but, since specific precipitated phases such as a Ï phase and the Laves phase in addition to the aforementioned Î· phase increase the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement though the influence is small as compared with the Î· phase, these phases are desirably not contained. Therefore, in the present alloy, precipitation strengthening is performed only by the Î³' phase that has small influence on the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement and is also effective for the improvement of the high-temperature strength. In order to obtain high strength only by the Î³' phase, it is necessary to increase the volume ratio of the Î³' phase. As a result of investigation, high-temperature strength more excellent than that of the conventional A286 steel is obtained when the Î³' phase volume ratio is 15% or more.</p>
    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">When the volume ratio is less than 15%, the precipitation strength is insufficient and strength almost equal to that of A286 is only obtained.</p>
    <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As mentioned above, the Î³' phase changes to the Î· phase through high-temperature long-time holding and it is known that the change is accelerated under a stress loading state. Since the susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement greatly increases when the Î· phase is precipitated, in order to use the present alloy safely in a high-temperature and high-pressure environment and in a high-pressure hydrogen environment, these structural characteristic features should be maintained even in the case where the alloy is held at a high temperature for a long period of time.</p>
    <heading id="h-00025-en">Hydrogen Embrittlement Resistance Index (reduction of area ratio in the tensile test at 625Â°C: hydrogen-charged material/As material): 0.4 or more</heading>
    <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the case where the alloy is used in a high-temperature and high-pressure hydrogen environment, it is surmised that hydrogen solves in the alloy during the use. For indicating the hydrogen embrittlement resistance in such a use situation, a hydrogen embrittlement resistance index is defined.</p>
    <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">When the index is 0.4 or more, the alloy is judged to have good resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. When the index is less than 0.4, a decrease in reduction of area by hydrogen charging is large, so that it is judged that the resistance to hydrogen embrittlement is insufficient.</p>
    <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Incidentally, at the measurement of the hydrogen embrittlement resistance index, hydrogen is forcibly charged into the alloy by holding the material under a hydrogen environment at a high temperature under a high pressure using a high-temperature and high-pressure autoclave (hereinafter referred to as hydrogen charging). The hydrogen embrittlement resistance index at a high temperature can be determined by performing a tensile test of a hydrogen-charged material and a material as received, at 625Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The hydrogen charging is performed under the conditions of 450Â°C, 25 MPa, and 72 hours. By the hydrogen charging, about 60 ppm of hydrogen is added in terms of mass ratio.</p>
    <heading id="h-00026-en">Solution Treatment: 950Â°C or higher</heading>
    <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The solution temperature is set at 950Â°C or higher where a recrystallization structure is obtained. The upper limit of the solution temperature is not particularly defined but the treatment is carried out at a temperature where remarkable grain growth occurs or a temperature lower than the temperature (e.g., 1100Â°C or lower).</p>
    <heading id="h-00027-en">Aging Heat Treatment Conditions</heading>
    <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">First stage: 700 to 800Â°C</p>
    <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Second stage: 700 to 800Â°C (provided that a temperature lower than the temperature at the first stage)</p>
    <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">After the solution treatment, subsequently to the aging heat treatment at a first stage, by performing aging at a second stage at a temperature lower than the temperature at the first stage, the volume fraction of the Î³' phase can be increased without coarsening the Î³' phase that has precipitated at the first stage. As a result of investigating the age hardening behavior, most suitable aging temperature is between 700Â°C and 800Â°C and the highest strength is obtained by performing the aging between 700Â°C and 800Â°C at both of the first stage and the second stage. Incidentally, the aging heat treatment at the second stage is performed at a temperature lower than the temperature at the first stage.</p>
    <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">When the temperature at the first stage and at the second stage is lower than 700Â°C, a peak of hardness exists at a long time side and thus sufficient hardness is not obtained within a practical time range. When the temperature at the first stage and at the second stage is higher than 800Â°C, the hardness decreases owing to over aging.</p>

    <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The following will describe one example of the embodiment of the invention.</p>
    <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The Fe-Ni-based alloy of the invention is prepared so as to have a composition containing, in terms of% by mass, C: 0.005% to 0.10%, Si: 0.01% to 0.10%, P: 0.015% or less (preferably 0.003 to 0.015%), S: 0.003% or less, Ni: 23.0% to 27.0%, Cr: 12.0% to 16.0%, Mo: 0.01% or less, Nb: 0.01% or less, W: 2.5% to 6.0%, Al: 1.5% to 2.5%, and Ti: 1.5% to 2.5% and further containing one or two kinds of B: 0.0020% to 0.0050% and Zr: 0.02% to 0.05% as desired, the balance being Fe and other unavoidable impurities. The Fe-Ni-based alloy of the invention can be melted by usual methods and the method for melting is not particularly limited in the invention. In the above composition, for example, a large ingot having more than 10 tons can be produced without causing the macroscopic segregation problem.</p>
    <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The Fe-Ni-based alloy can be subjected to processing such as forging as desired and also can be subjected to a solution treatment and a heat treatment by aging.</p>
    <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The solution treatment can be performed, for example, under conditions of 950Â°C to 1100Â°C and 1 to 20 hours.</p>
    <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Moreover, the aging heat treatment is desirably a two-stage treatment within a temperature range of 700 to 800Â°C at each stage, the temperature at the second stage being lower than the temperature at the first stage. By adopting the conditions, tensile strength of 900 MPa or more in the tensile strength test at 625Â°C and reduction of area of 25% or more can be secured.</p>
    <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Incidentally, when the former temperature is lower than 650Â°C or higher than 825Â°C, the Î³' phase cannot sufficiently grow and the above tensile strength cannot be secured.</p>
    <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The Fe-Ni-based alloy obtained above can be suitably utilized for power generation plants, jet engine materials, and the like to be used under a high-temperature and high-pressure environment of 600Â°C or higher.</p>

When the temperature exceeds 800Â°C, the hardness decreases owing to over aging and, when it is lower than 700Â°C, since a peak of hardness exists at a long time side, sufficient hardness is not obtained within a practical time range. <tables id="tables-00002-en" num="0002"><table frame="all"><title>[Table 2]</title><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="23mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="31mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="55mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="30mm" /><thead><row><entry morerows="1" align="center" valign="middle">Test material</entry><entry namest="col2" nameend="col3" align="center" valign="middle">Heat treatment conditions</entry><entry morerows="1" align="center" valign="middle">Hardness (HV10)</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">Solution treatment</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Aging heat treatment</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry morerows="2" align="center" valign="middle">Example 1</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">980Â°CÃ3 hours</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">780Â°CÃ 10 hours+750Â°CÃ24 hours</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">323</entry></row><row><entry morerows="1" align="center" valign="middle">1060Â°CÃ3 hours</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">725Â°CÃ24 hours+650Â°CÃ 16 hours</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">285</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">780Â°CÃ10 hours+750Â°CÃ24 hours</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">321</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>

In all alloys, the treatments were carried out under heat treatment conditions where the hardness became maximum hardness. In Comparative Example 2 where no W is contained, a large number of the Î· phases are observed on the grain boundaries (the portion indicated by an arrow). Also, in Comparative Example 3 where W is contained in an amount of 2.45% by mass, the Î· phase is observed on the grain boundaries though the precipitation amount is smaller than that in Comparative Example 2 (the portion indicated by an arrow). In Example 1, the precipitation of the Î· phase was not observed on the grain boundaries. Therefore, it is judged that W should be contained in an amount of 2.5% by mass or more for suppressing the precipitation of the Î· phase.</p>
    <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Table 3 shows precipitated phases in the case where the test materials are held at 650Â°C. Since the test for evaluating long-time structural stability requires a huge amount of time, the Î³' phase volume ratio and the precipitated phases upon long-time and elevated temperature holding were determined by a thermodynamic calculation program (Thermo-Calc Software AB, Thermo-Calc version S) in which an equilibrium state can be predicted. Since it is surmised that the Î· phase is not contained even when the material reaches an equilibrium state by the long-time and elevated temperature holding in the case of Example 1 where the volume ratio of the Î³' phase is 15% or more, it is expected that a change in material characteristics is small. On the other hand, it is surmised that the Î· phase is precipitated in Comparative Examples 1 and 3, and it is surmised that the Laves phase is precipitated in Comparative Example 4, so that it is expected that the material characteristics are deteriorated in both cases. Incidentally, in the prediction results by the above program, including Example 1, the precipitation of a small amount of the Ï phase (volume ratio of less than 5%) is predicted but, in Example 1, the Î· phase is not precipitated and satisfactory material characteristics are maintained even upon the long-term and elevated temperature holding. <tables id="tables-00003-en" num="0003"><table frame="all"><title>[Table 3]</title><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="36mm" /><colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="12mm" /><colspec colnum="3" colname="col3" colwidth="39mm" /><colspec colnum="4" colname="col4" colwidth="42mm" /><thead><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="center" valign="middle">Test material</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Î³' phase volume ratio (%)</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Other precipitated phases</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry namest="col1" nameend="col2" align="center" valign="middle">Example 1</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">20</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Ï</entry></row><row><entry morerows="2" align="center" valign="middle">Comparative Example</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">1</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">3</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Î·, Ï</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">3</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">18</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Î·, Ï</entry></row><row><entry align="center" valign="middle">4</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">17</entry><entry align="center" valign="middle">Ï, Laves</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p>

      <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows results of a creep rupture test. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in Comparative Examples 2 and 3 where the Î· phase was precipitated, a rupture was caused with a short period of time as compared with the case of Example 1 and thus a decrease in high-temperature characteristics caused by the precipitation of the Î· phase was observed. Particularly in Comparative Example 3, although the tensile strength at 625Â°C is equal to that of Examples, the creep rupture time is shortened by 2000 hours or more as compared to the case of Example 1. Thus, it is obvious from the result that the creep characteristics are remarkably deteriorated when the Î· phase is precipitated. In Comparative Example 1, the precipitation of the Î· phase was not observed but the creep strength is lower than that of Example 1, so that an increase in thickness may be invited, for example, in the case of the use as a pressure vessel.</p>

The hydrogen charging was carried out using a high-temperature and high-pressure autoclave and a test specimen was held under a hydrogen gas atmosphere of 450Â°C and 25 MPa for 72 hours. After the hydrogen charging, hydrogen concentration of the test specimen was measured and it was confirmed that about 60 ppm of hydrogen was added in terms of mass ratio.</p>

It was confirmed that the hydrogen embrittlement resistance index was large in Example 1 as compared with Comparative Examples. Particularly, it was confirmed that the hydrogen embrittlement resistance was greatly improved in Example 1 as compared with Comparative Example 1 that was a material equal to A286. In Example 1, in addition to the suppression of precipitation of the Î· phase, since the Î³' phase finely dispersed in the grains acts as a trapping site of hydrogen, the degree of embrittlement caused by hydrogen can be reduced.</p>
