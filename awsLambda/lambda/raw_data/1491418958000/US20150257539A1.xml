      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The invention relates generally to computer components and accessories, and in particular to a two-part computer keyboard with office chair. Carpal tunnel syndrome is only the most well-known of a family of repetitive motion injuries, which have become the bane of workman's compensation insurance adjusters across the country. The search is on for office furnishings and accessories which will prevent these injuries. An ergonomic keyboard, featuring a one-piece keyboard with the key array divided into two halves positioned at an obtuse angle with each other, appeared in the 1990s but did not gain broad acceptance. The problem addressed by the ergonomic keyboard was the unnatural position of the typist's hands and arms when using a conventional keyboard, which contributes substantially to repetitive motion injuries. By taking the concept of the ergonomic keyboard several steps farther, the problem can be solved. The keyboard is divided into two separate components, and mounted on the arms of an office chair. The arms of the chair may be separately rotated and revolved by the typist to whatever angles are comfortable, addressing the source of many repetitive motion injuries. The two-part computer keyboard with office chair solves these problems.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,612,718, issued Mar. 18, 1997 to Bryan (hereinafter âBryanâ) discloses an office chair with integral split keyboards. Bryan, however, is subject to several significant shortcomings. Bryan teaches an overly complex and expensive office chair structure from which the keyboards are inseparable. Moreover, Bryan teaches no dedicated integral surface for supporting a pointing device of the user's choice (e.g., mouse, touchpad, track ball, etc.), and instead indicates a track ball, which may be internal to the keyboard structure or an external track ball to be placed on a provided integral surface that is not pivotable relative to the arm rest. Additionally, Bryan teaches the keyboard halves being fixed to the arm rest such that it pivots in the horizontal plane only about its own center, and not about the pivot of the user's wrist, forcing the user to rely upon the provided pivoting armrest. These and other drawbacks are addressed by the extensibility of the invention disclosed herein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, the invention is directed to a two-part computer keyboard with office chair. The keys are separated into two keyboard halves for the right and left hands. The two separate components are preferably wireless and battery-powered, and may be temporarily affixed to office chair armrests, optionally with a mousing surface or alternate pointing device located laterally on the side of the user's dominant hand. An office chair, designed for use with the two-part keyboard and enabling the user to independently rotate and revolve the articulated armrests, is available and may be purchased separately, or with the two-part keyboard as a kit.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Referring now to the invention in more detail, the invention is directed to a two-part computer keyboard with office chair. The keys are separated into two keyboard halves <b>10</b> for the right and left hands. The two separate components are preferably wireless and battery-powered, and may be temporarily affixed to the armrests <b>13</b> of an office chair <b>12</b>, optionally with a mousing surface <b>11</b> or alternate pointing device located laterally on the side of the user's dominant hand. An office chair <b>12</b>, designed for use with the two-part keyboard and enabling the user to independently rotate and revolve the articulated armrests, is available and may be purchased separately, or with the two-part keyboard as a kit.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The first exemplary embodiment may be summarized as a kit for retrofitting an existing, off-the-shelf, or otherwise not purpose-built office chair with arms and comprises two keyboard halves <b>10</b>: the left keyboard half <b>10</b>A, and the right keyboard half <b>10</b>B. A pair of small padded C-clamps <b>16</b> is affixed permanently to the bottom surface of a small turntable <b>15</b>, which in turn is mounted on the bottom surface of each keyboard half <b>10</b>. The C-clamps <b>16</b> enable the user to mount each keyboard half <b>10</b> securely to the outer end of the armrest <b>13</b> of an office chair <b>12</b>, or another type of chair such as a wheelchair, without scratching or otherwise damaging the armrest <b>13</b>. The turntable <b>15</b> enables the user to turn the keyboard half <b>10</b> relative to the armrest <b>13</b> with rotation about a point approximately below the expected position of the user's wrist pivot point.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Mounting brackets <b>14</b> on the lateral surface of each keyboard half <b>10</b> enables the user to attach a mousing surface <b>11</b>, which is provided, to the keyboard half <b>10</b> which is used by the user's dominant hand. Thus, if the user is right-handed, the mousing surface <b>11</b> should be attached to the lateral surface of the right keyboard half <b>10</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Each keyboard half <b>10</b> is preferably wireless and battery-powered. The electronic components of each keyboard half <b>10</b> preferably include one or more replaceable batteries, and a radio frequency (RF) transmitter or other short-range wireless transmitter, for example a transmitter and receiver conforming to the popular Bluetooth wireless protocol. The keyboard halves <b>10</b> are configured to operate as a single logical keyboard input to a computer workstation or other computing device. Alternate embodiments, featuring a trackball or other cursor manipulation device to replace the mousing surface <b>11</b>, are contemplated.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The second exemplary embodiment may be summarized as a purpose-built chair incorporating the invention and features the keyboard halves <b>10</b> and the mousing surface <b>11</b>, with a specialized reclining office chair <b>12</b> which is designed for use with the two-part keyboard. The armrests <b>13</b> are articulated beneath the user's elbows, enabling the user to horizontally rotate each armrest <b>13</b>, and vertically revolve each armrest <b>13</b>, independently from the other armrest <b>13</b> and from the back and seat of the office chair <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The user's wrists may be secured to and supported by the armrests <b>13</b> with removable wrist devices which are provided, such as padded hooks, stirrups, or nylon straps with hook-and-loop fasteners. When used in conjunction with an articulated mount for a computer monitor or laptop, the two-part keyboard and the office chair <b>12</b> enable the user to operate all features of a desktop or laptop computer from a reclined position. Thus the user may be severely disabled or recovering from a severe injury or illness, and remain fully productive. The wrist devices are such that the user may easily and immediately gain release from them without assistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">An alternate embodiment, wherein the armrests <b>13</b> of the office chair <b>12</b> are more fully articulated from ball joints beneath and behind the user's armpits, and each armrest <b>13</b> provides a more complete carriage or cradle for the user's arm, is also contemplated.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">To use the first and second exemplary embodiments, the user affixes the left keyboard half <b>10</b>A to the armrest <b>13</b> on the left side of the office chair <b>12</b>, and the right keyboard half <b>10</b>B to the armrest <b>13</b> on the right side of the office chair <b>12</b>, using the C-clamps. The user then attaches the mousing surface <b>11</b> to the lateral side surface of the keyboard half <b>10</b> which will be used by the dominant hand, using the mounting brackets. The user may then sit in the office chair <b>12</b> and, if using the second exemplary embodiment, may optionally secure the wrists to the armrests <b>13</b> using the wrist devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The keyboards <b>10</b> and the mousing surface <b>11</b> are preferably manufactured from a rigid, durable material such as plastic. The office chair <b>12</b> and the armrests <b>13</b> are preferably manufactured from rigid, durable materials such as steel, aluminum alloy, and high-impact plastic, featuring padding which is preferably manufactured from a flexible, durable material such as foam rubber, covered by a flexible, durable fabric such as cotton, nylon, or a cotton-polyester blend. The wrist devices, if provided in the form of padded hooks, are preferably manufactured from rigid, durable materials such as steel, aluminum alloy, and high-impact plastic, featuring padding which is preferably manufactured from a flexible, durable material such as foam rubber or silicone. If provided in the form of stirrups or straps with hook-and-loop fasteners, the wrist devices are preferably manufactured from a flexible, durable material, such as leather or nylon webbing. Components, component sizes, and materials listed above are preferable, but artisans will recognize that alternate components and materials could be selected without alter</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is presently considered to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should, therefore, not be limited by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
