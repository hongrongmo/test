    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Provided is a method of representing a pressure variation in an object on an image of the object. The method includes: measuring all velocity components of the object; selecting a first position on the image of the object; estimating a pressure variation between the first position and a second position that is separate from the selected first position; and displaying an estimated pressure variation on the image of the object by using a predetermined indicator.</p>

      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and apparatus for representing a pressure variation in an object, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for representing a relative pressure variation in an object at predetermined points on an image of the object.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An ultrasound diagnosis apparatus transmits an ultrasound signal from a body surface of an object to a target region in the body and acquires an image of soft tissue tomography or blood flow by using information on an ultrasound signal reflected from tissue in the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An ultrasound diagnosis apparatus irradiates an ultrasound signal generated by a transducer of a probe onto an object and receives information on an echo signal reflected from the object to acquire an image of an interior region of the object. Such an ultrasound diagnosis apparatus may display information on the object in real time. Furthermore, an ultrasound diagnosis apparatus has high safety because an object is not exposed to X-ray radiation. Hence, an ultrasound diagnosis apparatus is widely used along with other image diagnosis apparatuses, such as an X-ray diagnosis apparatus, a computerized tomography (CT) scanner, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, and a nuclear medicine diagnosis apparatus.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">A flow, such as blood flow, occurs due to a pressure difference. The pressure difference may be calculated by using a Doppler effect. A diagnosis or analysis may be hemodynamically performed on an object by using the pressure difference. The present invention may allow a user to grasp an entire pressure variation in an object at a glance by using an image of a pressure variation, thus making a diagnosis of the object quickly and precisely. For example, vascular closure, normality, and abnormality in heart valves, and so on may be easily determined through a blood flow analysis using an image of a pressure difference.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart of a method of representing a relative pressure variation in an object on an image of the object, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The method of representing the pressure variation in the object on the image of the object, according to the embodiment of the present invention, may include measuring all velocity components of the object (S<b>100</b>), selecting a first position on an image of the object (S<b>200</b>), estimating a pressure variation between the first position and a second position that is separate from the selected first position (S<b>300</b>), and displaying the estimated pressure variation on the image of the object by using a predetermined indicator (S<b>400</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The measuring of all velocity components of the object (S<b>100</b>) may include acquiring velocity components at respective positions of the interior of the object. The velocity components at respective positions of the object may be acquired by using the well-known Doppler method.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In addition, the measuring of all velocity components of the object (S<b>100</b>) may include acquiring velocity components for an entire region of the object by using, for example, multicouple volume Doppler technology based on ultrasound data obtained through plane waves transmitted and received with respect to the object. By using the plane waves, the velocity components of all the points of the object may be acquired. In addition, by using multicouple volume Doppler technology, velocity components between multipoints may be calculated. In order words, the measuring of all velocity components of the object (S<b>100</b>) may include acquiring velocity components at respective positions of the interior of the object by using the plane waves at one time.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the velocity components for the object are acquired at one time by using plane waves, and a relative pressure at a point or region of the object may be estimated based on the acquired velocity components. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the relative pressure of the object may be estimated quickly and precisely.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the object may be a blood vessel or a heart.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the selecting of the first position on the image of the object (S<b>200</b>) may include selecting the first position on the image of the object through a predetermined external input obtained through, for example, a user input unit (not illustrated).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The first position according to the embodiment may be a predetermined point or region of the interior of the object. For example, when the object is a blood vessel, a predetermined point of the interior of the blood vessel may be selected as the first position. In addition, a region including a predetermined cross-section of the blood vessel, for example, a transverse section or a longitudinal section may be selected as the first position.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The first position as described above may be included in a current ultrasound image of the object which a user is looking at or in a previous ultrasound image of the object. For example, the first position may be included in an ultrasound image of the blood vessel which the user is currently looking at. The first position may be included in a previous frame of the ultrasonic image which the user is currently looking at.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">According to the embodiment of the present invention, the estimating of the pressure variation between the first position and the second position that is separate from the selected first position may include estimating a pressure variation value Îp at the second position with respect to the first position, based on the velocity component at the first position and the velocity component at the second position.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">For example, a relative pressure variation at the second position with respect to the first position may be estimated by using the velocity component at the first position and the velocity component at the second position. According to the embodiment, the pressure variation value Îp may be estimated by using ÎP=4*(v<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>âv<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>). A relevant description will be given with reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3A</figref> to <b>3</b>C.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In addition, the method according to the embodiment of the present invention may include displaying the pressure variation that is estimated through operation S<b>300</b> on the image of the object by using a predetermined indicator (S<b>400</b>). According to the embodiment of the present invention, the predetermined indicator may include at least one of characters, numbers, symbols, colors, graphs, and images.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a method of estimating a relative pressure variation at respective positions of an object, based on measured velocity components.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">According to the embodiment of the present invention, when all velocity components of the object are measured, a pressure variation may be estimated by using Equation 1.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an example of a representation of a pressure variation in an object, according to an embodiment of the present invention. When the object is a blood vessel, an ultrasound image <b>300</b> of the blood vessel may be displayed as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>. All velocity components of the blood vessel may be measured by using a Doppler method. A predetermined region <b>310</b> of the ultrasound image <b>300</b> may be selected as a first position. For example, a predetermined cross-section <b>310</b> of the blood vessel as seen on the ultrasound image <b>300</b> may be selected as the first position. Alternatively, a predetermined cross-section (not illustrated) of the blood vessel that is not seen on the ultrasound image currently may be selected as the first position. According to the embodiment, the first position may include a predetermined point <b>311</b>. For example, the predetermined point <b>311</b> included in the predetermined region <b>310</b> may be selected as the first position.</p>

A region of interest (not illustrated) outside the blood vessel may be selected as the second position.</p>

In order words, a pressure variation value at the second position with respect to the first position may be estimated by using Equation 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0061">The estimated pressure variation value may be displayed on the ultrasound image <b>300</b> by using a predetermined indicator including characters, numbers, symbols, colors, graphs, or images. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, the relative pressure variation value on a blood vessel wall <b>320</b> with respect to the first position <b>310</b> or <b>311</b> may be represented through a predetermined color by using a color bar in which different colors are assigned depending on the pressure variation. For example, when a blood vessel becomes narrow due to, for example, deposits, the pressure thereof increases, resulting in an increase in the pressure variation. Therefore, a color assigned to represent that a pressure variation is large at a portion at which the blood vessel becomes narrow may be displayed on the blood vessel wall <b>320</b>. The pressure variation may be represented by a numerical value. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, when the pressure variation value is 8 or 9, the pressure variation is small, and when the pressure variation value is 48 or 49, the pressure variation is large.</p>

When a predetermined point <b>311</b> is selected as the first position, a pressure variation value at the second position (for example, <b>312</b> or <b>313</b>) may be represented on a predetermined indicator having the form of a dart board. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, the center of the dart board represents a large pressure variation and the pressure variation decreases from the center toward the edges of the dart board. Since the pressure variation at the point <b>312</b> is larger than that at the predetermined point <b>311</b> that is the reference position, the pressure variation at the point <b>312</b> may be displayed on the center of the dart board. Since the pressure variation at the point <b>313</b> is small, the pressure variation at the point <b>313</b> may be displayed on the edge of the dart board that is far from the center as compared to the point <b>312</b>.</p>

The velocity component may include a blood flow velocity component. A pressure variation value may be estimated based on the acquired velocity components at the respective positions of the object. Referring to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, when blood flows into a heart by opening of the valves of the heart, a pressure variation at a portion of a wall of the heart at which blood first contacts may be large with respect to the first position <b>310</b> or <b>311</b>. The pressure variation at the wall of the heart may be represented by using a color bar in which predetermined colors are assigned according to a pressure variation value.
