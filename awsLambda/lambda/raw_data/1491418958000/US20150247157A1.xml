      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of plant molecular biology, more particularly to regulation of gene expression in plants.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Expression of heterologous DNA sequences in a plant host is dependent upon the presence of operably linked regulatory elements that are functional within the plant host. Choice of the promoter sequence will determine when and where within the organism the heterologous DNA sequence is expressed. Where expression in specific tissues or organs is desired, tissue-preferred promoters may be used. Where gene expression in response to a stimulus is desired, inducible promoters are the regulatory element of choice. In contrast, where continuous expression is desired throughout the cells of a plant, constitutive promoters are utilized. Additional regulatory sequences upstream and/or downstream from the core promoter sequence may be included in the expression constructs of transformation vectors to bring about varying levels of expression of heterologous nucleotide sequences in a transgenic plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Frequently it is desirable to express a DNA sequence in particular tissues or organs of a plant. For example, increased resistance of a plant to infection by soil- and air-borne pathogens might be accomplished by genetic manipulation of the plant's genome to comprise a tissue-preferred promoter operably linked to a heterologous pathogen-resistance gene such that pathogen-resistance proteins are produced in the desired plant tissue. Alternatively, it might be desirable to inhibit expression of a native DNA sequence within a plant's tissues to achieve a desired phenotype. In this case, such inhibition might be accomplished with transformation of the plant to comprise a tissue-preferred promoter operably linked to an antisense nucleotide sequence, such that expression of the antisense sequence produces an RNA transcript that interferes with translation of the mRNA of the native DNA sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Additionally, it may be desirable to express a DNA sequence in plant tissues that are in a particular growth or developmental phase such as, for example, cell division or elongation. Such a DNA sequence may be used to promote or inhibit plant growth processes, thereby affecting the growth rate or architecture of the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Isolation and characterization of somatic ovule tissue-preferred promoters, particularly promoters that can serve as regulatory elements for expression of isolated nucleotide sequences of interest early in seed development, are needed for impacting various traits in plants and for use with scorable markers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Compositions and methods for regulating gene expression in a plant are provided. Compositions comprise novel nucleotide sequences for a promoter active in somatic ovule tissues before, during, and after pollination. Such preferred expression is particularly desirable for a screen for adventitious embryony. More particularly, the promoter is active in the ovule, predominantly in the micropylar end of the inner integuments of <i>Arabidopsis </i>around and before fertilization and up to globular embryo formation. Certain embodiments of the disclosure comprise the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3-8 and 33 and functional fragments thereof, which drive ovule-preferred expression of an operably-linked nucleotide sequence. Embodiments of the disclosure also include DNA constructs comprising a promoter operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest, wherein said promoter is capable of driving expression of said nucleotide sequence in a plant cell and said promoter comprises one of the nucleotide sequences disclosed herein. Embodiments of the disclosure further provide expression vectors, and plants or plant cells having stably incorporated into their genomes a DNA construct as is described above. Additionally, compositions include transgenic seed of such plants. A promoter with this preferred spatial and temporal expression is particularly desirable for adventitious embryony in dicots. Adventitious embryony is a component of aposporous apomixis (asexual reproduction through seed) which would be of use in maintenance of stable, hybrid-based heterosis through multiple generations.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Further embodiments comprise a means for selectively expressing a nucleotide sequence in a plant, comprising transforming a plant cell with a DNA construct, and regenerating a transformed plant from said plant cell, said DNA construct comprising a promoter of the disclosure and a heterologous nucleotide sequence operably linked to said promoter, wherein said promoter initiates ovule-preferred transcription of said nucleotide sequence in the regenerated plant. In this manner, the promoter sequences are useful for controlling the expression of operably linked coding sequences in a tissue-preferred manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Downstream from the transcriptional initiation region of the promoter will be a sequence of interest that will provide for modification of the phenotype of the plant. Such modification includes modulating the production of an endogenous product as to amount, relative distribution, or the like, or production of an exogenous expression product, to provide for a novel or modulated function or product in the plant. For example, a heterologous nucleotide sequence that encodes a gene product that confers resistance or tolerance to herbicide, salt, cold, drought, pathogen, nematodes or insects is encompassed.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a further embodiment, a method for modulating expression of a gene in a stably transformed plant is provided, comprising the steps of (a) transforming a plant cell with a DNA construct comprising the promoter of the disclosure operably linked to at least one nucleotide sequence; (b) growing the plant cell under plant growing conditions and (c) regenerating a stably transformed plant from the plant cell wherein expression of the linked nucleotide sequence alters the phenotype of the plant.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">Compositions of the disclosure include the nucleotide sequences for the native ovule specific promoter and fragments and variants thereof. The promoter sequences of the disclosure are useful for expressing sequences. In specific embodiments, the promoter sequences of the disclosure are useful for expressing sequences of interest in an early-embryo formation, particularly an ovule somatic tissue-preferred manner. The promoter demonstrates an expression pattern in the micropylar inner integument and chalazal inner integument and/or nucellus, and expression appears present from several days before pollination to several days after pollination. The nucleotide sequences of the disclosure also find use in the construction of expression vectors for subsequent expression of a heterologous nucleotide sequence in a plant of interest or as probes for the isolation of other ovule somatic tissue-like promoters. In particular, the present disclosure provides for isolated DNA constructs comprising the ovule specific promoter nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3-8 and 33 operably linked to a nucleotide sequence of interest. The expression pattern of ovule specific is particularly desirable for apospory and adventitious embryony and other means for generating self reproducing hybrids in dicot crops such as soybean and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">The disclosure encompasses isolated or substantially purified nucleic acid compositions. An âisolatedâ or âpurifiedâ nucleic acid molecule or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of other cellular material or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. An âisolatedâ nucleic acid is substantially free of sequences (including protein encoding sequences) that naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5â² and 3â² ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences that naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. The ovule specific promoter sequences of the disclosure may be isolated from the 5â² untranslated region flanking their respective transcription initiation sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Fragments and variants of the disclosed promoter nucleotide sequences are also encompassed by the present disclosure. In particular, fragments and variants of the ovule specific promoter sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3-8 and 33 may be used in the DNA constructs of the disclosure. As used herein, the term âfragmentâ refers to a portion of the nucleic acid sequence. Fragments of an ovule specific promoter sequence may retain the biological activity of initiating transcription, more particularly driving transcription in an ovule somatic tissue-preferred manner. Alternatively, fragments of a nucleotide sequence that are useful as hybridization probes may not necessarily retain biological activity. Fragments of a nucleotide sequence for the ovule specific promoter region may range from at least about 20 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides, about 100 nucleotides and up to the full length of SEQ ID NO: 3-8 and 33.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">A biologically active portion of an ovule specific promoter can be prepared by isolating a portion of the ovule specific promoter sequence of the disclosure, and assessing the promoter activity of the portion. Nucleic acid molecules that are fragments of an ovule specific promoter nucleotide sequence comprise at least about 16, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700 or 800 nucleotides or up to the number of nucleotides present in a full-length ovule specific promoter sequence disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">As used herein, the term âvariantsâ is intended to mean sequences having substantial similarity with a promoter sequence disclosed herein. A variant comprises a deletion and/or addition of one or more nucleotides at one or more internal sites within the native polynucleotide and/or a substitution of one or more nucleotides at one or more sites in the native polynucleotide. As used herein, a ânativeâ nucleotide sequence comprises a naturally occurring nucleotide sequence. For nucleotide sequences, naturally occurring variants can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, such as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">Variant nucleotide sequences also include synthetically derived nucleotide sequences, such as those generated, for example, by using site-directed mutagenesis. Generally, variants of a particular nucleotide sequence of the embodiments will have at least 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, to 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular nucleotide sequence as determined by sequence alignment programs described elsewhere herein using default parameters. Biologically active variants are also encompassed by the embodiments. Biologically active variants include, for example, the native promoter sequences of the embodiments having one or more nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions. Promoter activity may be measured by using techniques such as Northern blot analysis, reporter activity measurements taken from transcriptional fusions, and the like. See, for example, Sambrook, et al., (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.), hereinafter âSambrook,â herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, levels of a reporter gene such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) or the like produced under the control of a promoter fragment or variant can be measured. See, for example, Matz, et al., (1999) <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>17:969-973; U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,050, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety; Nagai, et al., (2002) <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>20(1):87-90. Variant nucleotide sequences also encompass sequences derived from a mutagenic and recombinogenic procedure such as DNA shuffling. With such a procedure, one or more different ovule specific nucleotide sequences for the promoter can be manipulated to create a new ovule specific promoter. In this manner, libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of related sequence polynucleotides comprising sequence regions that have substantial sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. Strategies for such DNA shuffling are known in the art. See, for example, Stemmer, (1994) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>91:10747-10751; Stemmer, (1994) <i>Nature </i>370:389 391; Crameri, et al., (1997) <i>Nature Biotech. </i>15:436-438; Moore, et al., (1997) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>272:336-347; Zhang, et al., (1997) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>94:4504-4509; Crameri, et al., (1998) <i>Nature </i>391:288-291 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,605,793 and 5,837,458, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">Methods for mutagenesis and nucleotide sequence alterations are well known in the art. See, for example, Kunkel, (1985) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>82:488-492; Kunkel, et al., (1987) <i>Methods in Enzymol. </i>154:367-382; U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,192; Walker and Gaastra, eds. (1983) Techniques in Molecular Biology (MacMillan Publishing Company, New York) and the references cited therein, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">The nucleotide sequences of the disclosure can be used to isolate corresponding sequences from other organisms, particularly other plants, more particularly other monocots. In this manner, methods such as PCR, hybridization and the like can be used to identify such sequences based on their sequence homology to the sequences set forth herein. Sequences isolated based on their sequence identity to the entire ovule specific sequences set forth herein or to fragments thereof are encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">In a PCR approach, oligonucleotide primers can be designed for use in PCR reactions to amplify corresponding DNA sequences from cDNA or genomic DNA extracted from any plant of interest. Methods for designing PCR primers and PCR cloning are generally known in the art and are disclosed in, Sambrook, supra. See also, Innis, et al., eds. (1990) PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications (Academic Press, New York); Innis and Gelfand, eds. (1995) PCR Strategies (Academic Press, New York); and Innis and Gelfand, eds. (1999) PCR Methods Manual (Academic Press, New York), herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Known methods of PCR include, but are not limited to, methods using paired primers, nested primers, single specific primers, degenerate primers, gene-specific primers, vector-specific primers, partially-mismatched primers and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">In hybridization techniques, all or part of a known nucleotide sequence is used as a probe that selectively hybridizes to other corresponding nucleotide sequences present in a population of cloned genomic DNA fragments or cDNA fragments (i.e., genomic or cDNA libraries) from a chosen organism. The hybridization probes may be genomic DNA fragments, cDNA fragments, RNA fragments, or other oligonucleotides and may be labeled with a detectable group such as <sup>32</sup>P or any other detectable marker. Thus, for example, probes for hybridization can be made by labeling synthetic oligonucleotides based on the ovule specific promoter sequences of the disclosure. Methods for preparation of probes for hybridization and for construction of genomic libraries are generally known in the art and are disclosed in Sambrook, supra.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">For example, the entire ovule specific promoter sequence disclosed herein, or one or more portions thereof, may be used as a probe capable of specifically hybridizing to corresponding dicot CYP86C1 promoter sequences and messenger RNAs. To achieve specific hybridization under a variety of conditions, such probes include sequences that are unique among ovule specific promoter sequences and are generally at least about 10 nucleotides in length or at least about 20 nucleotides in length. Such probes may be used to amplify corresponding ovule specific promoter sequences from a chosen plant by PCR. This technique may be used to isolate additional coding sequences from a desired organism or as a diagnostic assay to determine the presence of coding sequences in an organism. Hybridization techniques include hybridization screening of plated DNA libraries (either plaques or colonies, see, for example, Sambrook, supra).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">Hybridization of such sequences may be carried out under stringent conditions. The terms âstringent conditionsâ or âstringent hybridization conditionsâ are intended to mean conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target sequence to a detectably greater degree than to other sequences (e.g., at least 2-fold over background). Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences that are 100% complementary to the probe can be identified (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing). Generally, a probe is less than about 1000 nucleotides in length, optimally less than 500 nucleotides in length.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1.5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30Â° C. for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60Â° C. for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37Â° C. and a wash in 1 times to 2 times SSC (20 times SSC=3.0 M NaCl/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55Â° C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1.0 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37Â° C. and a wash in 0.5 times to 1 times SSC at 55 to 60Â° C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37Â° C., and a final wash in 0.1 times SSC at 60 to 65Â° C. for a duration of at least 30 minutes. Duration of hybridization is generally less than about 24 hours, usually about 4 to about 12 hours. The duration of the wash time will be at least a length of time sufficient to reach equilibrium.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the thermal melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl, (1984) <i>Anal. Biochem </i>138:267 284: T<sub>m</sub>=81.5Â° C.+16.6 (log M)+0.41 (% GC)â0.61 (% form)â500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, % GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. The T<sub>m </sub>is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. T<sub>m </sub>is reduced by about 1Â° C. for each 1% of mismatching, thus, T<sub>m</sub>, hybridization, and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with 90% identity are sought, the T<sub>m </sub>can be decreased 10Â° C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m </sub>for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1, 2, 3 or 4Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m</sub>; moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m</sub>; low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 20Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m</sub>. Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired T<sub>m</sub>, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a T<sub>m </sub>of less than 45Â° C. (aqueous solution) or 32Â° C. (formamide solution), it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher temperature can be used. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyâHybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York); and Ausubel, et al., eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 2 (Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York), herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. See also, Sambrook.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">Thus, isolated sequences that have early-endosperm-preferred promoter activity, particularly ovule somatic tissue-preferred promoter activity and which hybridize under stringent conditions to the ovule specific promoter sequences disclosed herein or to fragments thereof, are encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">In general, sequences that have promoter activity and hybridize to the promoter sequences disclosed herein will be at least 40% to 50% homologous, about 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% to 98% homologous or more with the disclosed sequences. That is, the sequence similarity of sequences may range, sharing at least about 40% to 50%, about 60% to 70%, and about 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% to 98% sequence similarity.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more nucleic acids or polynucleotides: (a) âreference sequenceâ, (b) âcomparison windowâ, (c) âsequence identityâ, (d) âpercentage of sequence identityâ and (e) âsubstantial identityâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">As used herein, âreference sequenceâ is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence or the complete cDNA or gene sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">As used herein, âcomparison windowâ makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a polynucleotide sequence, wherein the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100 or longer. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the polynucleotide sequence, a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0060">Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Thus, the determination of percent sequence identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Non-limiting examples of such mathematical algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller, (1988) <i>CABIOS </i>4:11-17; the algorithm of Smith, et al., (1981) <i>Adv. Appl. Math. </i>2:482; the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, (1970) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>48:443-453; the algorithm of Pearson and Lipman, (1988) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>85:2444-2448; the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, (1990) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>872:264, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, (1993) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:5873-5877, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0061">Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA and TFASTA in the GCG Wisconsin Genetics Software PackageÂ®, Version 10 (available from Accelrys Inc., 9685 Scranton Road, San Diego, Calif., USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins, et al., (1988) <i>Gene </i>73:237-244 (1988); Higgins, et al., (1989) <i>CABIOS </i>5:151-153; Corpet, et al., (1988) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>16:10881-90; Huang, et al., (1992) <i>CABIOS </i>8:155-65; and Pearson, et al., (1994) <i>Meth. Mol. Biol. </i>24:307-331, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The ALIGN program is based on the algorithm of Myers and Miller, (1988) supra. A PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used with the ALIGN program when comparing amino acid sequences. The BLAST programs of Altschul, et al., (1990) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, (1990) supra. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTN program, score=100, word length=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein of the disclosure. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTX program, score=50, word length=3, to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein or polypeptide of the disclosure. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized as described in Altschul, et al., (1997) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>25:3389, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. See, Altschul, et al., (1997) supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTN for nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used. See, the web site for the National Center for Biotechnology Information on the World Wide Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Alignment may also be performed manually by inspection.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">Unless otherwise stated, sequence identity/similarity values provided herein refer to the value obtained using GAP Version 10 using the following parameters: % identity and % similarity for a nucleotide sequence using GAP Weight of 50 and Length Weight of 3, and the nwsgapdna.cmp scoring matrix; % identity and % similarity for an amino acid sequence using GAP Weight of 8 and Length Weight of 2, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix; or any equivalent program thereof. As used herein, âequivalent programâ is any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by GAP Version 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">The GAP program uses the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, supra, to find the alignment of two complete sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. GAP considers all possible alignments and gap positions and creates the alignment with the largest number of matched bases and the fewest gaps. It allows for the provision of a gap creation penalty and a gap extension penalty in units of matched bases. GAP must make a profit of gap creation penalty number of matches for each gap it inserts. If a gap extension penalty greater than zero is chosen, GAP must, in addition, make a profit for each gap inserted of the length of the gap times the gap extension penalty. Default gap creation penalty values and gap extension penalty values in Version 10 of the GCG Wisconsin Genetics Software PackageÂ® for protein sequences are 8 and 2, respectively. For nucleotide sequences the default gap creation penalty is 50 while the default gap extension penalty is 3. The gap creation and gap extension penalties can be expressed as an integer selected from the group of integers consisting of from 0 to 200. Thus, for example, the gap creation and gap extension penalties can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or greater.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0064">GAP presents one member of the family of best alignments. There may be many members of this family, but no other member has a better quality. GAP displays four figures of merit for alignments: Quality, Ratio, Identity and Similarity. The Quality is the metric maximized in order to align the sequences. Ratio is the quality divided by the number of bases in the shorter segment. Percent Identity is the percent of the symbols that actually match. Percent Similarity is the percent of the symbols that are similar. Symbols that are across from gaps are ignored. A similarity is scored when the scoring matrix value for a pair of symbols is greater than or equal to 0.50, the similarity threshold. The scoring matrix used in Version 10 of the GCG Wisconsin Genetics Software PackageÂ® is BLOSUM62 (see, Henikoff and Henikoff, (1989) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:10915, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">As used herein, âsequence identityâ or âidentityâ in the context of two nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences makes reference to the residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have âsequence similarityâ or âsimilarityâ. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of one and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and one. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">As used herein, âpercentage of sequence identityâ means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">The term âsubstantial identityâ of polynucleotide sequences means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has at least 70% sequence identity, optimally at least 80%, more optimally at least 90% and most optimally at least 95%, compared to a reference sequence using an alignment program using standard parameters. One of skill in the art will recognize that these values can be appropriately adjusted to determine corresponding identity of proteins encoded by two nucleotide sequences by taking into account codon degeneracy, amino acid similarity, reading frame positioning and the like. Substantial identity of amino acid sequences for these purposes normally means sequence identity of at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% and at least 95%.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0068">Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m </sub>for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. However, stringent conditions encompass temperatures in the range of about 1Â° C. to about 20Â° C. lower than the T<sub>m</sub>, depending upon the desired degree of stringency as otherwise qualified herein. Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides they encode are substantially identical. This may occur, e.g., when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. One indication that two nucleic acid sequences are substantially identical is when the polypeptide encoded by the first nucleic acid is immunologically cross reactive with the polypeptide encoded by the second nucleic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0069">The ovule specific promoter sequence disclosed herein, as well as variants and fragments thereof, are useful for genetic engineering of plants, e.g. for the production of a transformed or transgenic plant, to express a phenotype of interest. As used herein, the terms âtransformed plantâ and âtransgenic plantâ refer to a plant that comprises within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. Generally, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome of a transgenic or transformed plant such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant DNA construct. It is to be understood that as used herein the term âtransgenicâ includes any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant the genotype of which has been altered by the presence of heterologous nucleic acid including those transgenics initially so altered as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">A transgenic âeventâ is produced by transformation of plant cells with a heterologous DNA construct, including a nucleic acid expression cassette that comprises a transgene of interest, the regeneration of a population of plants resulting from the insertion of the transgene into the genome of the plant and selection of a particular plant characterized by insertion into a particular genome location. An event is characterized phenotypically by the expression of the transgene. At the genetic level, an event is part of the genetic makeup of a plant. The term âeventâ also refers to progeny produced by a sexual cross between the transformant and another plant wherein the progeny include the heterologous DNA.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">As used herein, the term plant includes whole plants, plant organs (e.g., leaves, stems, roots, etc.), plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds, leaves, flowers, branches, fruit, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers and the like. Grain is intended to mean the mature seed produced by commercial growers for purposes other than growing or reproducing the species. Progeny, variants and mutants of the regenerated plants are also included within the scope of the disclosure, provided that these parts comprise the introduced polynucleotides.</p>

In specific embodiments, plants of the present disclosure are crop plants (for example, corn, alfalfa, sunflower, <i>Brassica</i>, soybean, cotton, safflower, peanut, sorghum, wheat, millet, tobacco, etc.). In other embodiments, corn and soybean plants are optimal, and in yet other embodiments corn plants are optimal.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0075">Other plants of interest include grain plants that provide seeds of interest, oil-seed plants and leguminous plants. Seeds of interest include grain seeds, such as corn, wheat, barley, rice, sorghum, rye, etc. Oil-seed plants include cotton, soybean, safflower, sunflower, <i>Brassica</i>, maize, alfalfa, palm, coconut, etc. Leguminous plants include beans and peas.

      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0076">Heterologous coding sequences expressed by an ovule specific promoter of the disclosure may be used for varying the phenotype of a plant. Various changes in phenotype are of interest including modifying expression of a gene in a plant, altering a plant's pathogen or insect defense mechanism, increasing a plant's tolerance to herbicides, altering plant development to respond to environmental stress, modulating the plant's response to salt, temperature (hot and cold), drought and the like. These results can be achieved by the expression of a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest comprising an appropriate gene product. In specific embodiments, the heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest is an endogenous plant sequence whose expression level is increased in the plant or plant part. Results can be achieved by providing for altered expression of one or more endogenous gene products, particularly hormones, receptors, signaling molecules, enzymes, transporters or cofactors or by affecting nutrient uptake in the plant. Tissue-preferred expression as provided by the ovule specific promoter can target the alteration in expression to plant parts and/or growth stages of particular interest, such as developing seed tissues, particularly the ovule somatic tissue. These changes result in a change in phenotype of the transformed plant. In certain embodiments, since the expression pattern is primarily at the micropylar end of the embryo sac, where the embryo forms, the expression patterns of ovule specific promoters are particularly useful for screens for apomixis, adventitious embryony, artificial apospory and the generation of self reproducing hybrids. Indeed, the expression pattern envelops the synergids and egg cell and is very near to, although not within, the egg sac.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0077">General categories of nucleotide sequences of interest for the present disclosure include, for example, those genes involved in information, such as zinc fingers, those involved in communication, such as kinases and those involved in housekeeping, such as heat shock proteins. More specific categories of transgenes, for example, include genes encoding important traits for agronomics, insect resistance, disease resistance, herbicide resistance, environmental stress resistance (altered tolerance to cold, salt, drought, etc) and grain characteristics. Still other categories of transgenes include genes for inducing expression of exogenous products such as enzymes, cofactors, and hormones from plants and other eukaryotes as well as prokaryotic organisms. It is recognized that any gene of interest can be operably linked to the promoter of the disclosure and expressed in the plant.</p>

      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0083">Commercial traits can also be encoded on a gene or genes that could increase for example, starch for ethanol production, or provide expression of proteins. Another important commercial use of transformed plants is the production of polymers and bioplastics such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,602,321, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Genes such as 13-Ketothiolase, PHBase (polyhydroxybutyrate synthase), and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (see, Schubert, et al., (1988) <i>J.

      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">In one embodiment, the promoter is used to express transgenes involved in organ development, stem cells, initiation and development of the apical meristem, such as the Wuschel (WUS) gene; see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,348,468 and 7,256,322 and United States Patent Application Publication Number 2007/0271628 published Nov. 22, 2007, by Pioneer Hi-Bred International; Laux, et al., (1996) <i>Development </i>122:87-96 and Mayer, et al., (1998) <i>Cell </i>95:805-815. Modulation of WUS is expected to modulate plant and/or plant tissue phenotype including cell growth stimulation, organogenesis and somatic embryogenesis. WUS may also be used to improve transformation via somatic embryogenesis. Expression of <i>Arabidopsis </i>WUS can induce stem cells in vegetative tissues, which can differentiate into somatic embryos (Zuo, et al., (2002) <i>Plant J </i>30:349-359). Also of interest in this regard would be a MYB118 gene (see, U.S. Pat. No. 7,148,402), MYB115 gene (see, Wang, et al., (2008) <i>Cell Research </i>224-235), BABYBOOM gene (BBM; see, Boutilier, et al., (2002) <i>Plant Cell </i>14:1737-1749) or CLAVATA gene (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,179,963). The ability to stimulate organogenesis and/or somatic embryogenesis may be used to generate an apomictic plant. Apomixis has economic potential because it can cause any genotype, regardless of how heterozygous, to breed true. It is a reproductive process that bypasses female meiosis and syngamy to produce embryos genetically identical to the maternal parent. With apomictic reproduction, progeny of specially adaptive or hybrid genotypes would maintain their genetic fidelity throughout repeated life cycles. In addition to fixing hybrid vigor, apomixis can make possible commercial hybrid production in crops where efficient male sterility or fertility restoration systems for producing hybrids are not available. Apomixis can make hybrid development more efficient. It also simplifies hybrid production and increases genetic diversity in plant species with good male sterility. Furthermore, apomixis may be advantageous under stress (drought, cold, high-salinity, etc.) conditions where pollination may be compromised.</p>

      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0132">The heterologous nucleotide sequence operably linked to the ovule specific promoter and its related biologically active fragments or variants disclosed herein may be an antisense sequence for a targeted gene. The terminology âantisense DNA nucleotide sequenceâ is intended to mean a sequence that is in inverse orientation to the 5â²-to-3â² normal orientation of that nucleotide sequence. When delivered into a plant cell, expression of the antisense DNA sequence prevents normal expression of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. The antisense nucleotide sequence encodes an RNA transcript that is complementary to and capable of hybridizing to the endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by transcription of the DNA nucleotide sequence for the targeted gene. In this case, production of the native protein encoded by the targeted gene is inhibited to achieve a desired phenotypic response. Modifications of the antisense sequences may be made as long as the sequences hybridize to and interfere with expression of the corresponding mRNA. In this manner, antisense constructions having 70%, 80%, 85% sequence identity to the corresponding antisense sequences may be used. Furthermore, portions of the antisense nucleotides may be used to disrupt the expression of the target gene. Generally, sequences of at least 50 nucleotides, 100 nucleotides, 200 nucleotides or greater may be used. Thus, the promoter sequences disclosed herein may be operably linked to antisense DNA sequences to reduce or inhibit expression of a native protein in the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0133">âRNAiâ refers to a series of related techniques to reduce the expression of genes (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,506,559, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Older techniques referred to by other names are now thought to rely on the same mechanism, but are given different names in the literature. These include âantisense inhibition,â the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target protein and âco-suppressionâ or âsense-suppression,â which refer to the production of sense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of identical or substantially similar foreign or endogenous genes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,231,020, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Such techniques rely on the use of constructs resulting in the accumulation of double stranded RNA with one strand complementary to the target gene to be silenced. The ovule specific promoters of the embodiments may be used to drive expression of constructs that will result in RNA interference including microRNAs and siRNAs.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0134">As used herein, the terms âpromoterâ or âtranscriptional initiation regionâ mean a regulatory region of DNA usually comprising a TATA box capable of directing RNA polymerase II to initiate RNA synthesis at the appropriate transcription initiation site for a particular coding sequence. A promoter may additionally comprise other recognition sequences generally positioned upstream or 5â² to the TATA box, referred to as upstream promoter elements, which influence the transcription initiation rate. It is recognized that having identified the nucleotide sequences for the promoter regions disclosed herein, it is within the state of the art to isolate and identify further regulatory elements in the 5â² untranslated region upstream from the particular promoter regions identified herein. Additionally, chimeric promoters may be provided. Such chimeras include portions of the promoter sequence fused to fragments and/or variants of heterologous transcriptional regulatory regions. Thus, the promoter regions disclosed herein can comprise upstream regulatory elements such as, those responsible for tissue and temporal expression of the coding sequence, enhancers and the like. In the same manner, the promoter elements, which enable expression in the desired tissue such as reproductive tissue, can be identified, isolated and used with other core promoters to confer early-endosperm-preferred expression. In this aspect of the disclosure, âcore promoterâ is intended to mean a promoter without promoter elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0135">As used herein, the term âregulatory elementâ also refers to a sequence of DNA, usually, but not always, upstream (5â²) to the coding sequence of a structural gene, which includes sequences which control the expression of the coding region by providing the recognition for RNA polymerase and/or other factors required for transcription to start at a particular site. An example of a regulatory element that provides for the recognition for RNA polymerase or other transcriptional factors to ensure initiation at a particular site is a promoter element. A promoter element comprises a core promoter element, responsible for the initiation of transcription, as well as other regulatory elements that modify gene expression. It is to be understood that nucleotide sequences, located within introns or 3â² of the coding region sequence may also contribute to the regulation of expression of a coding region of interest. Examples of suitable introns include, but are not limited to, the maize IVS6 intron, or the maize actin intron. A regulatory element may also include those elements located downstream (3â²) to the site of transcription initiation, or within transcribed regions, or both. In the context of the present disclosure a post-transcriptional regulatory element may include elements that are active following transcription initiation, for example translational and transcriptional enhancers, translational and transcriptional repressors and mRNA stability determinants.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0136">The regulatory elements or variants or fragments thereof, of the present disclosure may be operatively associated with heterologous regulatory elements or promoters in order to modulate the activity of the heterologous regulatory element. Such modulation includes enhancing or repressing transcriptional activity of the heterologous regulatory element, modulating post-transcriptional events or either enhancing or repressing transcriptional activity of the heterologous regulatory element and modulating post-transcriptional events. For example, one or more regulatory elements or fragments thereof of the present disclosure may be operatively associated with constitutive, inducible or tissue specific promoters or fragment thereof, to modulate the activity of such promoters within desired tissues in plant cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0137">The regulatory sequences of the present disclosure or variants or fragments thereof, when operably linked to a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest can drive ovule somatic tissue-preferred expression, of the heterologous nucleotide sequence in the reproductive tissue of the plant expressing this construct. The term âovule somatic tissue-preferred expression,â means that expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence is most abundant in the somatic cells of the ovule tissue. While some level of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence may occur in other plant tissue types, expression occurs most abundantly in the ovule somatic tissue.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0138">A âheterologous nucleotide sequenceâ is a sequence that is not naturally occurring with the promoter sequence of the disclosure. While this nucleotide sequence is heterologous to the promoter sequence, it may be homologous or native or heterologous or foreign to the plant host.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0139">The isolated promoter sequences of the present disclosure can be modified to provide for a range of expression levels of the heterologous nucleotide sequence. Thus, less than the entire promoter region may be utilized and the ability to drive expression of the nucleotide sequence of interest retained. It is recognized that expression levels of the mRNA may be altered in different ways with deletions of portions of the promoter sequences. The mRNA expression levels may be decreased, or alternatively, expression may be increased as a result of promoter deletions if, for example, there is a negative regulatory element (for a repressor) that is removed during the truncation process. Generally, at least about 20 nucleotides of an isolated promoter sequence will be used to drive expression of a nucleotide sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0140">It is recognized that to increase transcription levels, enhancers may be utilized in combination with the promoter regions of the disclosure. Enhancers are nucleotide sequences that act to increase the expression of a promoter region. Enhancers are known in the art and include the SV40 enhancer region, the 35S enhancer element and the like. Some enhancers are also known to alter normal promoter expression patterns, for example, by causing a promoter to be expressed constitutively when without the enhancer, the same promoter is expressed only in one specific tissue or a few specific tissues.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0141">Modifications of the isolated promoter sequences of the present disclosure can provide for a range of expression of the heterologous nucleotide sequence. Thus, they may be modified to be weak promoters or strong promoters. Generally, a âweak promoterâ means a promoter that drives expression of a coding sequence at a low level. A âlow levelâ of expression is intended to mean expression at levels of about 1/10,000 transcripts to about 1/100,000 transcripts to about 1/500,000 transcripts. Conversely, a strong promoter drives expression of a coding sequence at a high level, or at about 1/10 transcripts to about 1/100 transcripts to about 1/1,000 transcripts.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0142">It is recognized that the promoters of the disclosure may be used with their native ovule specific coding sequences to increase or decrease expression, thereby resulting in a change in phenotype of the transformed plant. The nucleotide sequences disclosed in the present disclosure, as well as variants and fragments thereof, are useful in the genetic manipulation of any plant. The ovule specific promoter sequences are useful in this aspect when operably linked with a heterologous nucleotide sequence whose expression is to be controlled to achieve a desired phenotypic response. The term âoperably linkedâ means that the transcription or translation of the heterologous nucleotide sequence is under the influence of the promoter sequence. In this manner, the nucleotide sequences for the promoters of the disclosure may be provided in expression cassettes along with heterologous nucleotide sequences of interest for expression in the plant of interest, more particularly for expression in the reproductive tissue of the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0143">In one embodiment of the disclosure, expression cassettes will comprise a transcriptional initiation region comprising one of the promoter nucleotide sequences of the present disclosure, or variants or fragments thereof, operably linked to the heterologous nucleotide sequence. Such an expression cassette can be provided with a plurality of restriction sites for insertion of the nucleotide sequence to be under the transcriptional regulation of the regulatory regions. The expression cassette may additionally contain selectable marker genes as well as 3â² termination regions.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0144">The expression cassette can include, in the 5â²-3â² direction of transcription, a transcriptional initiation region (i.e., a promoter, or variant or fragment thereof, of the disclosure), a translational initiation region, a heterologous nucleotide sequence of interest, a translational termination region and optionally, a transcriptional termination region functional in the host organism. The regulatory regions (i.e., promoters, transcriptional regulatory regions, and translational termination regions) and/or the polynucleotide of the embodiments may be native/analogous to the host cell or to each other. Alternatively, the regulatory regions and/or the polynucleotide of the embodiments may be heterologous to the host cell or to each other. As used herein, âheterologousâ in reference to a sequence is a sequence that originates from a foreign species or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. For example, a promoter operably linked to a heterologous polynucleotide is from a species different from the species from which the polynucleotide was derived or, if from the same/analogous species, one or both are substantially modified from their original form and/or genomic locus or the promoter is not the native promoter for the operably linked polynucleotide.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0145">While it may be preferable to express a heterologous nucleotide sequence using the promoters of the disclosure, the native sequences may be expressed. Such constructs would change expression levels of the ovule specific protein in the plant or plant cell. Thus, the phenotype of the plant or plant cell is altered.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0146">The termination region may be native with the transcriptional initiation region, may be native with the operably linked DNA sequence of interest, may be native with the plant host, or may be derived from another source (i.e., foreign or heterologous to the promoter, the DNA sequence being expressed, the plant host, or any combination thereof). Convenient termination regions are available from the Ti-plasmid of <i>A. tumefaciens</i>, such as the octopine synthase and nopaline synthase termination regions.

      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0147">The expression cassette comprising the sequences of the present disclosure may also contain at least one additional nucleotide sequence for a gene to be cotransformed into the organism. Alternatively, the additional sequence(s) can be provided on another expression cassette.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0148">Where appropriate, the nucleotide sequences whose expression is to be under the control of the early-endosperm-tissue-preferred promoter sequence of the present disclosure and any additional nucleotide sequence(s) may be optimized for increased expression in the transformed plant. That is, these nucleotide sequences can be synthesized using plant preferred codons for improved expression. See, for example, Campbell and Gowri, (1990) <i>Plant Physiol. </i>92:1-11, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, for a discussion of host-preferred codon usage. Methods are available in the art for synthesizing plant-preferred genes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,380,831, 5,436,391 and Murray, et al., (1989) <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>17:477-498, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0149">Additional sequence modifications are known to enhance gene expression in a cellular host. These include elimination of sequences encoding spurious polyadenylation signals, exon-intron splice site signals, transposon-like repeats and other such well-characterized sequences that may be deleterious to gene expression. The G-C content of the heterologous nucleotide sequence may be adjusted to levels average for a given cellular host, as calculated by reference to known genes expressed in the host cell. When possible, the sequence is modified to avoid predicted hairpin secondary mRNA structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0150">The expression cassettes may additionally contain 5â² leader sequences. Such leader sequences can act to enhance translation. Translation leaders are known in the art and include, without limitation: picornavirus leaders, for example, EMCV leader (Encephalomyocarditis 5â² noncoding region) (Elroy-Stein, et al., (1989) <i>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86:6126-6130); potyvirus leaders, for example, TEV leader (Tobacco Etch Virus) (Allison, et al., (1986) <i>Virology </i>154:9-20); MDMV leader (Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus); human immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP) (Macejak, et al., (1991) <i>Nature </i>353:90-94); untranslated leader from the coat protein mRNA of alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV RNA 4) (Jobling, et al., (1987) <i>Nature </i>325:622-625); tobacco mosaic virus leader (TMV) (Gallie, et al., (1989) <i>Molecular Biology of RNA</i>, pages 237-256) and maize chlorotic mottle virus leader (MCMV) (Lommel, et al., (1991) <i>Virology </i>81:382-385), herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0151">The DNA constructs of the embodiments can also include further enhancers, either translation or transcription enhancers, as may be required. These enhancer regions are well known to persons skilled in the art, and can include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. The initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire sequence. The translation control signals and initiation codons can be from a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. Translational initiation regions may be provided from the source of the transcriptional initiation region, or from the structural gene. The sequence can also be derived from the regulatory element selected to express the gene, and can be specifically modified so as to increase translation of the mRNA. It is recognized that to increase transcription levels enhancers may be utilized in combination with the promoter regions of the embodiments. Enhancers are known in the art and include the SV40 enhancer region, the 35S enhancer element, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0152">In preparing the expression cassette, the various DNA fragments may be manipulated, so as to provide for the DNA sequences in the proper orientation and, as appropriate, in the proper reading frame. Toward this end, adapters or linkers may be employed to join the DNA fragments or other manipulations may be involved to provide for convenient restriction sites, removal of superfluous DNA, removal of restriction sites or the like. For this purpose, in vitro mutagenesis, primer repair, restriction, annealing, resubstitutions, for example, transitions and transversions, may be involved.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0153">Reporter genes or selectable marker genes may also be included in the expression cassettes of the present disclosure.

      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0161">In specific embodiments, the DNA constructs comprising the promoter sequences of the disclosure can be provided to a plant using a variety of transient transformation methods. Such transient transformation methods include, but are not limited to, viral vector systems and the precipitation of the polynucleotide in a manner that precludes subsequent release of the DNA. Thus, transcription from the particle-bound DNA can occur, but the frequency with which it is released to become integrated into the genome is greatly reduced. Such methods include the use of particles coated with polyethylimine (PEI; Sigma #P3143).</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0162">In other embodiments, the polynucleotide of the disclosure may be introduced into plants by contacting plants with a virus or viral nucleic acids. Generally, such methods involve incorporating a nucleotide construct of the disclosure within a viral DNA or RNA molecule. Methods for introducing polynucleotides into plants and expressing a protein encoded therein, involving viral DNA or RNA molecules, are known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,889,191, 5,889,190, 5,866,785, 5,589,367, 5,316,931 and Porta, et al., (1996) <i>Molecular Biotechnology </i>5:209-221, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0163">Methods are known in the art for the targeted insertion of a polynucleotide at a specific location in the plant genome. In one embodiment, the insertion of the polynucleotide at a desired genomic location is achieved using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example, WO 1999/25821, WO 1999/25854, WO 1999/25840, WO 1999/25855 and WO 1999/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Briefly, the polynucleotide of the disclosure can be contained in transfer cassette flanked by two non-identical recombination sites. The transfer cassette is introduced into a plant having stably incorporated into its genome a target site which is flanked by two non-identical recombination sites that correspond to the sites of the transfer cassette. An appropriate recombinase is provided and the transfer cassette is integrated at the target site. The polynucleotide of interest is thereby integrated at a specific chromosomal position in the plant genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0164">The cells that have been transformed may be grown into plants in accordance with conventional ways. See, for example, McCormick, et al., (1986) <i>Plant Cell Reports </i>5:81-84, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. These plants may then be grown, and either pollinated with the same transformed strain or different strains, and the resulting progeny having expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic identified. Two or more generations may be grown to ensure that expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic is stably maintained and inherited and then seeds harvested to ensure expression of the desired phenotypic characteristic has been achieved. In this manner, the present disclosure provides transformed seed (also referred to as âtransgenic seedâ) having a nucleotide construct of the disclosure, for example, an expression cassette of the disclosure, stably incorporated into its genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0165">There are a variety of methods for the regeneration of plants from plant tissue. The particular method of regeneration will depend on the starting plant tissue and the particular plant species to be regenerated. The regeneration, development and cultivation of plants from single plant protoplast transformants or from various transformed explants is well known in the art (Weissbach and Weissbach, (1988) In: Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, (Eds.), Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif., herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). This regeneration and growth process typically includes the steps of selection of transformed cells, culturing those individualized cells through the usual stages of embryonic development through the rooted plantlet stage. Transgenic embryos and seeds are similarly regenerated. The resulting transgenic rooted shoots are thereafter planted in an appropriate plant growth medium such as soil. Preferably, the regenerated plants are self-pollinated to provide homozygous transgenic plants. Otherwise, pollen obtained from the regenerated plants is crossed to seed-grown plants of agronomically important lines. Conversely, pollen from plants of these important lines is used to pollinate regenerated plants. A transgenic plant of the embodiments containing a desired polynucleotide is cultivated using methods well known to one skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0166">The embodiments provide compositions for screening compounds that modulate expression within plants. The vectors, cells and plants can be used for screening candidate molecules for agonists and antagonists of the ovule specific promoter. For example, a reporter gene can be operably linked to an ovule specific promoter and expressed as a transgene in a plant. Compounds to be tested are added and reporter gene expression is measured to determine the effect on promoter activity.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Identification of the Ovule Specific Promoter</heading>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0170">The <i>Arabidopsis </i>cytochrome P450 CYP86C1 (AT-CYP86C1) promoter was identified by a BLAST search of the <i>Arabidopsis </i>genome using the AT-NUC1 promoter and DS-RED Express. The <i>Arabidopsis </i>putative pectin methylesterase promoter (AT-PPM) was identified using <i>Arabidopsis </i>expression angler with AT-NUC1 PRO and ZS-Green. The <i>Arabidopsis </i>endo-xyloglucan transferase promoter (AT-EXT) was identified using ZS-Green. The <i>Arabidopsis </i>gamma interferon responsive lysosomal thiol reductase (AT-GILT1) promoter was identified using ZS-GREEN. The <i>Arabidopsis </i>Transparent Testa 2 Promoter (AT-TT2) was identified using ZS-Green.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">Example 2</heading>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">Activity of the Expression Cassette Comprising the AT-NUC1(ALT1) Promoter Linked to the GUS Reporter (PHP42329)</heading>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0171">A transgenic ovule was created to test the expression pattern of the AT-ovule specific promoters with a GUS reporter. Expression was found exclusively in the ovule, and predominantly in the micropylar end. Expression also appeared to occur in the inner integuments. Further work confirmed that expression was specific in the inner integument at the micropylar end prior to fertilization and then moved to the chalazal end after fertilization. Expression was observed as early as the 4-8 nucleate stage of the egg sac.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0172">Micropylar expression is advantageous for adventitious embryony since the native embryo forms at the micropylar end of the embryo sac. The ovule specific expression pattern envelopes the synergids and egg cell and is very near to, although not within, the egg sac. To demonstrate that the DNA sequence isolated as the ovule specific promoter functions as a promoter, transgenic <i>Arabidopsis </i>assays were performed. These assays provided a rapid assessment of whether the DNA sequence tested is able to direct gene expression (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Activity of the Expression Cassette Comprising the AT-CYP86C1 Promoter Linked to DS-Red Reporter (PHP43541)</heading>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0173">PHP43541 was created to test the expression pattern of the AT-CYP86C1 promoter with a red fluorescent protein reporter. The promoter AT CYP86C1 (AT1G24540) demonstrates an expression pattern in the micropylar tip of the inner integument surrounding the micropylar half of the embryo sac at the egg stage. The outer integument at the extreme micropylar end of the outer integuments also shows expression. Expression appears present from several days before pollination to several days after pollination. During development from the zygote stage to the late globular embryo stage, expression progressively spreads through the endothelial layer (innermost layer of the inner integument) towards the chalazal end of the ovule. By the heart-shaped embryo stage, the entire endothelial layer shows expression (<figref>FIGS. 2 through 10</figref>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Activity of the Expression Cassette Comprising the AT-PPM1 Promoter Linked to ZS-GREEN (PHP48047)</heading>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0174">The promoter AT PPM1 (AT5G49180) demonstrates two different types of expression patterns. First, the AT-PPM1 promoter demonstrates an expression pattern in the extreme micropylar end of the inner and outer integuments, but not the epidermal layer of the outer integument; the second type of expression pattern is an extension of the first. Not only does the extreme micropylar inner and outer integuments (except for the epidermal layer) show expression, but expression extends chalazally to completely surround the entire embryo sac. The chalazal nucellus does not show expression. The latter expression pattern is most common in early stages of ovule development. No expression was noted within the embryo sac (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Activity of the Expression Cassette Comprising the AT-EXT Promoter Linked to ZS-Green (PHP48049)</heading>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0175">The promoter AT EXT (AT3G48580) demonstrates an expression pattern in the inner integuments and innermost layer of the outer integument surrounding the micropylar end of the embryo sac. In addition, in one example, a single cell (innermost layer of outer integument at the micropylar end) shows strong expression. No expression was noted within the embryo sac (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0000">Activity of the AT-CYP86C1 Promoter Comprising the AT-RKD2 Polynucleotide and Characterization of the Same when Expressed in <i>Arabidopsis </i></p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0176">The RKD expression cassette was molecularly stacked with AT-DD45-DSRED reporter construct (PHP50088 AT-CYP86C1 PRO:AT-RKD2-AT-DD45 PRO:DsRed) and (PHP50089 AT-NUC1 PRO (ALT1) AT-RKD2-AT-DD45 PRO:DsRed).</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0177">Ovules of the transformed lines demonstrated multiple cells expressing the AT-DD45Pro-Red Express reporter in somatic cells in the ovule. Co-expression of the reporter construct with the RKD2 polypeptide in an ovule preferred manner demonstrated an egg-cell like transcriptional state induced in tissues and substructures suitable for adventitious embryony. (<figref>FIGS. 13 through 18</figref>).</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Activity of the Expression Cassette Comprising the AT-TT2 Promoter Linked to ZS-Green (PHP49217)</heading>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0179">
        <figref>FIG. 20</figref>. Expression is ovule maternal tissue-specific, not observed in the embryo sac. Expression of AT-TT2 Pro::ZsGreen is in the inner integuments (endothelium and 2<sup>nd </sup>layer) covering and surrounding the entire micropylar end of the embryo sac like a glove. This latter pattern was observed at the egg through globular embryo stage. Some weaker expression in the micropylar outer integuments can also be observed at the globular stage. At the late globular embryo, heart-shaped embryo stages, and later, the expression pattern extends chalazally through the inner integuments and now in the outer integuments, as well. Expression is still very strong at the micropylar end. Pattern is reminiscent of the AT-NUC1 promoter expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0180">
        <figref>FIG. 21</figref>. TT2 promoter expression is shown initially at the micropylar end and expands toward the chalazal end during the globular embryo stage.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 22</figref>. AT-GILT1 Pro::ZsGreen expression is ovule maternal tissue-specific, not observed in the embryo sac. Expression pattern is consistent, but strength can be variable. Expression is in the inner integuments (endothelium and 2<sup>nd </sup>layer) covering and surrounding a portion of or the entire micropylar end of the embryo sac. This latter pattern was observed at the egg through globular embryo stage. Little to no expression was observed in the outer integuments. At the heart-shaped embryo stage and later, the expression is highly reduced and only a few inner integument cells opposite the micropylar end of the embryo sac can be observed with expression.</p>
