      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Single serve beverage brewing is popular among consumers due to the convenience and flexibility that it provides. Many single serve beverage brewers have entered the market. Traditional brewers typically produce between four and twenty cups of beverage at a time. The beverage sits on a hot plate until it is consumed. As time passes, the taste of the beverage may decline. Single serve brewing allows a consumer to enjoy beverages, such as coffee and tea, in an efficient fashion and without a decline in the taste profile of the beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, coffee or tea grounds for use in a single serving brewer may be packaged in a disposable single use beverage package <b>100</b>. A disposable single use beverage package <b>100</b> may include a basket <b>110</b>, which may be a permeable basket and barrier <b>112</b>, which may be a disposable impermeable barrier.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The barrier <b>112</b> may have a first side <b>114</b> and a second side <b>116</b>. The first side <b>114</b> may include a score, a tab, a zip, an embedded string, or otherwise provide a means for assisting a user to open the barrier <b>112</b>. The barrier <b>112</b> may be sealed at the second side <b>116</b> or other sides by gusseting, pinching, heat sealing, stapling, or otherwise. Alternatively or additionally, the barrier <b>112</b> may be a shrink wrap barrier or a wax barrier, among others.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The barrier <b>112</b> may be substantially resistant to the passage of liquids, gases, and solids. For example, the barrier <b>112</b> may be hermetically sealed to block moisture and oxygen from entering the pouch and to retain the aroma of the coffee. Additionally or alternatively, several baskets may be prefilled and packaged together in an egg crate type configuration, a tube, or other packaging, to maintain freshness during shipping and storing. The barrier <b>112</b> may be made of materials such as foil laminate, metalized films, EVOH films, polyolefin based material, parafilm, plastics, and combinations of these, among others.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A user may open the package <b>100</b>, for example, by tearing the barrier <b>112</b> along the first side <b>114</b> to reveal the basket <b>110</b>. The user may remove the basket <b>110</b> from the barrier <b>112</b> and place the basket <b>110</b> into a single serve brewer. The basket <b>110</b> may be prefilled with grounds, or alternatively, the user may add grounds to the basket <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The basket <b>110</b> may be a single-wall permeable basket including a first end <b>118</b>, which may be reversibly closed or an open end, and a second end <b>120</b>, which may be a closed end. The basket <b>110</b> may be a cup shaped basket and may be used with a lid <b>122</b>. The basket <b>110</b> may also have a side wall <b>124</b> and a rim <b>126</b>. The side wall <b>124</b> may connect the second end <b>120</b> and the rim <b>126</b>. The side wall <b>124</b> may include a frame <b>128</b> and a filter medium <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The frame <b>128</b> may provide structure, stability, and integrity to the filter medium <b>130</b>. The frame <b>128</b> may be formed by injection molding or by a different process suitable for manufacturing a rigid form around a relatively flexible filter medium. The frame <b>128</b> may be made of any one of many commercially available materials, such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polyamide or Nylon, or other synthetic or natural plastics or combinations thereof The frame may be made from other materials such as a bio-based polymer, such as polylacticacid (PLA), poly hydroxybutaric acid (PHA) or a starch based polymer. The frame <b>128</b> may be made of other materials known to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the side walls <b>124</b> of the basket <b>110</b> may be defined by the frame <b>128</b> and a filter medium <b>130</b>. The filter medium <b>130</b> may be secured to the basket <b>110</b>, for example, at the second end <b>120</b>, the rim <b>126</b>, and/or at that frame <b>128</b>. The filter medium <b>130</b> may be secured for example, by thermal bonding of the plastic used for the frame <b>128</b>, or with an adhesive, by crimping, by heat sealing, or any other way. The filter medium <b>130</b> may be secured in the frame <b>128</b> in insert-injection molding of the plastic frame around a filter medium insert. For example, a pre-die cut blank of filter medium may be placed on a mandrel which has channels around the shape of the pre die-cut blank. Molten plastic may flow in and bond to the blank of the filter medium <b>130</b> during inert-injection molding. The plastic may solidify into the frame <b>128</b>, for example, upon cooling. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, in an alternative embodiment the filter medium <b>700</b> and <b>705</b> may be first formed into a generally cylindrical and tapered portion <b>700</b> and an optional bottom circular filter medium <b>705</b> herein after referred to as the circular portion <b>705</b>. The filter medium <b>700</b> and <b>705</b> may then be placed or inserted onto a mold for insert injection molding to form the basket <b>710</b> with the filter media <b>700</b> and <b>705</b> supported by the frame of the basket <b>710</b>. The bottom end <b>715</b> of the frame of the basket <b>710</b> may be substantially open and a circular filter portion <b>705</b> may cover the open portions.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The filter medium <b>130</b> may be a porous material and may be permeable to liquids and some oils. It may be formed of many materials, for example, non-woven materials such as polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polylactic acid, cellulosic fibers, polyhydroxyalkanoates, thermoplastic starch, filter paper, other paper materials, polymer materials, a combination of these or any other material. The filter medium <b>130</b> may also be formed from a polymer or plastic filtration mesh, or microporous or apertured films made of various plastic materials, such as polypropylene, Nylon 6 and high density polyethylene or other materials known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the filter medium <b>130</b> may be formed from a bio-based polymer, such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly hydroxybutaric acid (PHA) or starch based polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Characteristics of the filter medium <b>130</b> may be selected to meet the filtration needs of different products, such as ground coffee, tea powders or leaves, or other brewed products. For example, the basis weight, thickness, strand count, mesh size, flow rate and strength of the filter medium <b>130</b> may be selected based on the product to be brewed.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The filter medium <b>130</b> may be compostable, biodegradable, recycled, and/or recyclable. If the filter medium <b>130</b> is a non-woven material, it may have a greater resistance than, for example, a woven material or a metal filter. A non-woven filter medium <b>130</b> may retain water in the basket for longer than, for example, a woven or metal filter. The length of time that the water is retained in the basket with the grounds may influence the strength and therefore the taste profile of the resulting beverage. This may be because a woven material or a metal material may have technological limitations on the size of the openings there through. A non-woven material may not have the same technological limitations. Therefore, the difference may be that, in a woven material or metal material, the path of the water may be straight through the wall and in the non-woven material, the path may be indirect and convoluted.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The basket <b>110</b> may include a lid <b>122</b>. The lid <b>122</b> may include a rim <b>202</b> and a cover <b>200</b>. The cover <b>200</b> may be disposed below the rim <b>202</b> for secure fitting with the basket <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the cover <b>200</b> may not include a rim <b>202</b>. The cover <b>200</b> may be made from a material that may be punctured to allow a liquid to enter into the basket. For example, the cover <b>200</b> may be a material, such as a foil, film, coated film, or multilayer laminate, which is sealed to or across the rim <b>126</b> of the permeable basket <b>110</b> to maintain contents therein.

        <figref>FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref>FIG. 11B</figref> illustrate beverage basket embodiments <b>1100</b> and <b>1150</b> configured to be stacked. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11A</figref>, the beverage basket <b>1100</b> includes a frame <b>128</b> and filter material <b>903</b>, as described above. For example, the frame includes a rim <b>126</b>, a bottom portion <b>120</b>, and a group of ribs <b>906</b>. The rim <b>126</b> defines an opening that corresponds to the top a top of the frame <b>128</b>. The rim <b>126</b> may be continuous and have a circular shape, oval shape, or a different shape. The bottom portion <b>120</b> is a closed surface that corresponds to the bottom of the frame <b>128</b>. The ribs <b>906</b> extend from the rim <b>126</b> to the edge of the bottom portion <b>120</b>. The ribs <b>906</b>, rim <b>126</b>, and bottom portion <b>120</b> define a group of openings that facilitate fluid flow, such as coffee, tea, or a different beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Each rib <b>906</b> includes a ledge <b>1105</b> and <b>1110</b> (<figref>FIG. 118</figref>) positioned in a center region. The ledges <b>1105</b> and <b>1110</b> are configured to limit an amount by which respective baskets <b>1100</b> and <b>1150</b> are insertable into one another. Limiting the insertion amount results in a space <b>1210</b> (<figref>FIGS. 128</figref>) between respective bottoms <b>120</b> of the baskets <b>1100</b> and <b>1150</b>. The space <b>1210</b> may be sized to facilitate storage of beverage grounds, such as coffee ground, tea grounds, or other grounds, which the baskets <b>1100</b> and <b>1150</b> are stacked. That is, the position of the ledges <b>1105</b> and <b>1210</b> along the ribs <b>906</b> may be configured to result in a desired amount of space <b>1210</b> between respective baskets. Thus, several baskets may be advantageously filled with grounds and then stacked to save space.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In some configurations, the ledge <b>1105</b> extends outwardly away from the center of the basket. (See <figref>FIG. 11A</figref>). Referring to <figref>FIG. 12A</figref>, in this configuration, the ledge <b>1105</b> of a top basket <b>1205</b> rests upon the rim <b>126</b> of a lower basket <b>1207</b>. In this regard, the distance between opposing ledges <b>1105</b> (i.e., ledges <b>1105</b> on opposite sides of the basket <b>1100</b>) may be equal to about the inner diameter of the rim <b>126</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In other configurations, the ledge <b>1110</b> extends inwardly towards the center of the basket. (See <figref>FIG. 11B</figref>). Referring to <figref>FIG. 12B</figref>, in this configuration, the bottom portion <b>120</b> of the top basket <b>1205</b> rests upon the ledge <b>1110</b> of the lower basket <b>1207</b>. In this regard, the distance between opposing ledges <b>1110</b> (i.e., ledges <b>1105</b> on opposite sides of the basket <b>1100</b>) may be equal to about the outer diameter of the bottom portion <b>120</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 13A-13C</figref> illustrate perspective, side, and bottom views, respectively, of yet another beverage basket embodiment <b>1300</b>. The beverage basket <b>1300</b> is configured to be placed into a brewer (not shown) without the need for a cartridge <b>400</b>. Such brewers typically include a receiving member sized to receive a basket with a similar although not identical shape. A protruded membrane-piercing needle is positioned in the lower portion of the receiving member and is configured to pierce the lower portion of a typical plastic cup (e.g., a generally cylindrically shaped cup with a flat and closed bottom surface) so as to facilitate fluid flow out of the basket, through the needle, and then into a cup.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The beverage basket embodiment <b>1300</b> includes a frame <b>1305</b>. The frame <b>1305</b> includes a rim <b>1310</b>, a bottom portion <b>1315</b>, and a group of ribs <b>1320</b>. The rim <b>1310</b> defines an opening that corresponds to the top of the frame <b>1305</b> when the frame <b>1305</b> is in an upright position. The rim <b>1310</b> may be continuous and have a circular shape, oval shape, or a different shape. The bottom portion <b>1315</b> is a closed surface that corresponds to the bottom of the frame <b>1305</b>. The ribs <b>1320</b> extend from the rim <b>1310</b> to the edge of the bottom portion <b>1315</b>. The ribs <b>1320</b>, rim <b>1310</b>, and bottom portion <b>1315</b> define a group of openings that facilitate fluid flow, such as coffee, tea, or a different beverage. The beverage basket embodiment <b>1300</b> also includes a filter material that covers the openings, such as any of the filter materials described above, which is not shown in this instance for clarity.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">A first portion <b>1325</b> (<figref>FIG. 13C</figref>) of the bottom portion <b>1315</b> is substantially flat. Whereas a second portion <b>1330</b> of the bottom portion <b>1315</b> defines an indentation <b>1335</b>, which can be either fully enclosed or semi enclosed. The first portion <b>1325</b> may occupy % or more of the surface area of the bottom portion <b>1315</b>. The second portion <b>1330</b> may occupy the remaining area. The indentation <b>1335</b> is sized so that when the basket <b>1300</b> is inserted into the receiving member, the membrane-piercing needle fits within the indentation <b>1335</b> and does not pierce the bottom portion <b>1315</b>. For example, a depth D of the indentation <b>1335</b> relative to the lower surface of first portion <b>1325</b> of the bottom surface may be, for example but not limited to, about 0.388 inches. The width of the indentation <b>1330</b> may be, for example but not limited to, about 0.287 inches, and the indentation <b>1335</b> may be offset towards a side edge of the bottom portion <b>1315</b>, which corresponds to the location of the membrane-piercing needle in some brewer implementations. However, the indentation <b>1335</b> may be located in a different location when the membrane-piercing needle is positioned differently. Limiting the space occupied by the indentation <b>1335</b> (i.e., maximizing the space occupied by the first portion) results in more space within the basket <b>1300</b> for grounds, such as coffee grounds. This in turn facilitates the production of stronger blends.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">
        <figref>FIGS. 14A-168</figref> illustrate various exemplary lids for covering the beverage basket embodiment <b>1300</b>. The respective lids are configured to selectively substantially seal the opening defined at the top of the frame <b>1305</b>. <figref>FIGS. 14A and 148</figref> illustrate a first exemplary lid <b>1400</b>. The lid <b>1400</b> includes an opening <b>1402</b> in a center region through which a liquid flows into the basket <b>1300</b>. The lid <b>1400</b> also includes an annular ring <b>1405</b> configured to be friction fit against an inner surface of the rim <b>1310</b> of the frame <b>1305</b> to thereby form a seal between the lid <b>1400</b> and the beverage basket <b>1300</b>. That is, a seal between the outer surface of the annular ring <b>1405</b> and the inner surface of the rim <b>1310</b>. The diameter of the annular ring <b>1405</b> may be sized to provide a tight fit between the lid <b>1400</b> and the basket <b>1300</b> while still facilitating removal of the lid <b>1400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">
        <figref>FIGS. 15A and 18</figref> illustrate a second exemplary lid <b>1500</b>. The lid <b>1500</b> includes an opening <b>1502</b> in a center region through which a liquid flows into the basket <b>1300</b>. The lid <b>1500</b> includes a sidewall <b>1505</b> configured to be snap fit over an outer edge of the rim <b>1310</b>. In other words, the seal between the lid <b>1500</b> and the beverage basket <b>1300</b> is formed between the inner surface of the sidewall <b>1505</b> and the outer surface of the rim <b>1310</b>. The diameter of the sidewall <b>1505</b> may be sized to provide a tight fit between the lid <b>1500</b> and the basket <b>1300</b> while still facilitating removal of the lid <b>1500</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">
        <figref>FIGS. 16A and 168</figref> illustrate another exemplary beverage basket <b>1600</b> and lid <b>1610</b>. The beverage basket <b>1600</b> includes the features of the beverage basket <b>1300</b> described above. However, the rim <b>1605</b> defines one or more cutouts <b>1612</b>. The lid <b>1610</b> includes one or more tracks <b>1615</b> configured to cooperate with the one or more cutouts <b>1612</b> to facilitate twist locking of the lid <b>1610</b> to the beverage basket <b>1600</b>. In this regard, the thickness of the rim <b>1605</b> may gradually increase with a distance away from the cutouts <b>1612</b> so that the tightness between the lid <b>1610</b> and the beverage basket <b>1600</b> increases with further twisting of the lid <b>1610</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The configurations above may be varied. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, the basket <b>1700</b> and lid <b>1705</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref> may be formed together so that in an open configuration the lid <b>1705</b> is attached to the basket <b>1700</b>. The lid <b>1705</b> may then be folded over the basket <b>1700</b> to close the top opening of the basket <b>1700</b> defined by the rim <b>1710</b>. A cutout <b>1715</b> may be formed in the rim <b>1710</b> to expose an underside of the lid <b>1705</b> when the lid <b>1400</b> is in the closed configuration. The cutout <b>1715</b> facilitates removal of the lid <b>1705</b> from the basket <b>1700</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, liquid distribution fins <b>1810</b> may be formed on the underside of the lid <b>1805</b>. During operation, liquid flowing into the lid opening will, through capillary pressure, be drawn over the liquid distribution fins <b>1810</b> and then drop onto the grounds in the basket <b>1800</b>. The liquid distribution fins <b>1810</b> distribute the liquid over a larger portion of the grounds in the basket <b>1800</b> than would occur without the use of fins <b>1810</b>. This in turn facilitates more even brewing of the beverage. It is understood that the shape and number of fins <b>1810</b> are only exemplary.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Accordingly, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are within the scope of the claims. Therefore, the embodiments described are only provided to aid in understanding the claims and do not limit the scope of the claims.</p>
