      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of apparatus and methods for vaporizing essential oils and waxes</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A vaporizer is a device used to vaporize the active ingredients of plant material for the purpose of inhalation. Vaporization is an alternative to burning (smoking) that avoids the inhalation of many irritating toxic and carcinogenic by-products. In some forms, the plant material that is vaporized is an extract in the form of an oil or a wax. In some vaporization processes, the oil or wax is vaporized in a water pipe. The user uses a handheld blowtorch to heat a metal surface until the metal surface reaches a desired temperature, which may be indicated by a glowing orange hue. The user then places a drop of oil or wax on the hot surface with an implement, such as a glass rod or a dental pick. The oil or wax then melts, boils, and vaporizes. The user then inhales through the water pipe to draw the vapor into the user's lungs. This process is not only cumbersome, but also potentially dangerous, since it involves use of a handheld blowtorch and an exposed, glowing hot titanium surface.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There is a need in the art for a simpler and safer alternative for vaporizing essential oils and waxes.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In accordance with one embodiment, the present specification describes a vaporizing apparatus, comprising a tubular housing, a heating surface, a heat source and a vapor path. The tubular housing has an upper end and a lower end. The heating surface is arranged adjacent the upper end of the housing. The heat source is disposed adjacent the heating surface. The vapor path is defined within the housing between the heating surface and a lower opening at the lower end of the housing. The vaporizing apparatus is configured so that a combustible material on the heating surface generates a vapor when the heat source is activated, and such vapor follows the vapor path to exit the vaporizing apparatus through the lower opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some such embodiments, a tapered part of the housing has a tapered outer diameter that decreases moving toward the lower end of the housing.</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In further embodiments, the controller is configured so that a user can select between the plurality of control modes by actuating the actuator button according to a preset pattern.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In yet further embodiments, the controller is configured to prevent energizing of the heating element beyond an elapsed time.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In still further embodiments, in a first mode the controller is configured to energize the heating elements for a specified time period when the actuator button is actuated.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Some embodiments additionally comprise a battery assembly that extends through and out of the lower end of the housing when the battery assembly is engaged and electrically connected to the vaporizing apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Yet additional embodiments additionally comprise a lid (carb cap) configured to be removably attached to the upper end of the housing so as to define a vaporizing chamber between the lid and the heating surface when the lid is attached.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In accordance with yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of using a vaporizing apparatus. The method includes placing a combustible material on a heating surface defined in a cavity formed in a body placed in a tubular housing of the vaporizing apparatus. The method further includes placing the vaporizing apparatus into a downstem of a water pipe so that a portion of the tubular housing of the vaporizing apparatus extends into the downstem and a portion of the tubular housing engages an inner surface of the downstem, and actuating a heat source so that at least a portion of the combustible material is vaporized into a vapor. The vapor is drawn along a vapor path from the heating surface, through the tubular housing and into the downstem, and further through the water pipe.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Some such amendments can additionally comprise selecting between a plurality of modes of operation of the heating element.</p>

      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">During use, vapor from the vaporizing apparatus <b>10</b> is drawn through the flared upper opening <b>30</b> through the lower opening <b>24</b> and into the water <b>16</b>, from which it is further drawn through the stem <b>26</b> before being inhaled by the user. The water <b>16</b> in the reservoir <b>14</b> filters and cools the vapor from the vaporizing apparatus <b>10</b> prior to the vapor passing into the user's lungs, as described in further detail below. The reservoir <b>14</b> is typically filled only partially with water <b>16</b>, with sufficient water <b>16</b> being added to submerge the lower opening <b>24</b> of the downstem <b>18</b> but with a substantial volume of air filling the remainder of the reservoir <b>14</b> above the waterline.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the illustrated vaporizing apparatus comprises a lower portion <b>32</b> and an upper portion <b>34</b>. As shown, the upper portion <b>34</b> has a greater diameter than the lower portion <b>32</b>. More specifically, the lower portion <b>32</b> is sized so that at least a portion of the lower portion <b>32</b> fits through the upper opening <b>30</b> of the downstem <b>18</b>, and extends into the downstem <b>18</b>, while the upper portion <b>34</b> has a diameter greater than that of the downstem <b>18</b>. While in some embodiments the diameter of the lower portion may be constant, in the illustrated embodiment, a portion of the lower portion <b>32</b> is tapered so that part of the lower portion <b>32</b> fits into the downstem <b>18</b>, and another part of the lower portion <b>32</b> engages the upper end <b>28</b> of the downstem.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A typical downstem <b>18</b> has a length within the range of about 2″ to about 6″, and an inner diameter within the range of about 10 mm to about 20 mm, with variations outside these ranges for manufacturing tolerances, and with shorter, longer, narrower, and wider downstems also being available. Thus, in some embodiments the lower portion <b>32</b> of the vaporizing apparatus <b>10</b> may have a length within the range of about 2″ to about 5″, and an outer diameter within the range of about 9.5 mm to about 19.5 mm, with variations outside these ranges for manufacturing tolerances. The vaporizing apparatus <b>10</b> is thus configured to be compatible with off-the-shelf water pipes that are manufactured according to industry standards. However, it should be understood that the present embodiments are not limited by any of the dimensions specified herein.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a vaporizing apparatus <b>40</b> in combination with a typical water pipe <b>12</b>. The vaporizing apparatus <b>40</b> includes a housing <b>42</b> that is generally tubular and includes an upper portion <b>44</b> and a lower portion <b>46</b>. The upper portion <b>44</b> defines a first, larger diameter, and the lower portion <b>46</b> defines a second, smaller diameter. The upper and lower portions <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> converge in a flared region <b>48</b> of the housing <b>42</b>. The exterior surface of the lower portion <b>46</b> may include a taper angle so that the housing <b>42</b> is snugly received within the downstem <b>18</b>. For example, the exterior taper angle may be within the range of about 4° to about 6°, with variations outside this range for manufacturing tolerances.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The upper portion <b>44</b> of the housing <b>42</b> defines an interior chamber <b>50</b> that receives a body portion <b>52</b>. At its lower end, the body portion <b>52</b> seats against an interior shoulder <b>54</b> of the housing <b>42</b> that is located at the junction of the upper housing portion <b>44</b> and the lower housing portion <b>46</b>. The body <b>52</b> may be secured within the interior chamber <b>50</b> of the housing <b>42</b> by any desired means, such as, without limitation, threads and/or magnets (not shown). The illustrated body portion <b>52</b> is generally cylindrical and defines an interior space <b>56</b> that is open at either end. The upper end of the body <b>52</b> includes in inwardly extending flange <b>58</b> defining an upper opening <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, an annular spacer <b>62</b> seats beneath the flange <b>58</b>, and a heating surface <b>64</b> seats beneath the spacer <b>62</b>. The heating surface <b>64</b>, which may also be referred to as a tray, dish or bowl, includes a flat, disk-shaped interior plate <b>66</b> and a rim portion <b>68</b> circumscribing the plate <b>66</b>. The rim portion <b>68</b> has a greater thickness than the plate <b>66</b>, and together the plate <b>66</b> and the rim <b>68</b> form a shallow flat-bottomed bowl for receiving combustible material, such as essential oils and/or waxes, as described in further detail below. The heating surface <b>64</b> is advantageously recessed within the vaporizing apparatus <b>40</b>, located beneath the flange <b>58</b> and the spacer <b>62</b>. During use, the heating surface <b>64</b> gets hot enough to vaporize combustible material placed thereon. Thus, the recessed location for the heating surface <b>64</b> reduces the likelihood that a user will suffer a burn from inadvertently touching the hot heating surface <b>64</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a sidewall of the body <b>52</b> includes at least one longitudinally extending passage <b>70</b>, and in some embodiments may include a plurality of radially spaced longitudinal passages <b>70</b>. The passages <b>70</b>, which are open at either end, provide flow paths for vapor produced adjacent the heating surface <b>64</b>, as described below. In alternative embodiments, the longitudinal passages <b>70</b> may be omitted, and one or more longitudinally extending flutes or grooves (not shown) may be provided along the outer surface of the body <b>52</b>, such as a plurality of radially spaced longitudinal flutes or grooves.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> further includes a heat source (not shown). The heat source may comprise any device or apparatus capable of producing heat, such as a flame producing device, a resistive heating coil, etc. The heat source may be located at least partially within the body <b>52</b>, such as beneath the heating surface <b>64</b>. When activated, the heat source generates heat that is transferred to the heating surface <b>64</b>. Combustible material, such as essential oils and/or waxes, located on the upper surface of the heating surface <b>64</b> are heated through conduction from the heating surface <b>64</b>. The essential oils and/or waxes are vaporized, and the vapor is drawn through the vaporizing apparatus <b>40</b> and into the user's lungs, as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">During use, the user places combustible material, such as essential oils and/or waxes, on the upper surface <b>72</b> of the heating surface <b>64</b>.

(In alternative embodiments, according to user preference, the user may activate the heat source to heat the heating surface <b>64</b> prior to placing the combustible material on the heating surface <b>64</b>.) The user places his or her mouth on the upper rim <b>74</b> of the water pipe's stem <b>26</b> with sufficient force to create a substantially airtight seal around the rim <b>74</b>.

A biasing member (not shown) biases the ignition button <b>162</b> toward the upper end of the housing <b>152</b>, such that when the ignition button <b>162</b> is slid downward along the housing <b>152</b> and released it returns to the at rest position shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The ignition button <b>162</b> includes a radial extension <b>164</b> that extends radially inward through openings <b>166</b> in the housing <b>152</b>, the body <b>154</b>, and the flame chamber <b>160</b>. An inward end <b>168</b> of the radial extension <b>164</b> protrudes into the interior space of the flame chamber <b>160</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The radial extension <b>164</b> transmits motion of the ignition button <b>162</b> to a piezoelectric lighter <b>170</b> to activate the vaporizing apparatus <b>150</b>, as described below.</p>

When the piezoelectric lighter <b>170</b> is activated, fuel is carried from the fuel reservoir <b>174</b> through the fuel line <b>186</b> and to the discharge port <b>182</b> where it is expelled and burned. A lead <b>188</b> of the piezoelectric igniter <b>172</b> is positioned adjacent the discharge port <b>182</b> to facilitate igniting the fuel as it is expelled through the discharge port <b>182</b>.</p>

The rod <b>190</b> is translatable within the casing <b>176</b> in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis A<sub>L </sub>of the vaporizing apparatus <b>150</b>. When the user slides the ignition button <b>162</b> downward along the exterior of the housing <b>152</b>, the radial extension <b>164</b> also moves downward, forcing the rod <b>190</b> downward. Motion of the rod <b>190</b> toward the piezoelectric igniter <b>172</b> activates the igniter <b>172</b>, producing a spark at the lead <b>188</b> within the flame chamber <b>160</b> and activating the flow of fuel from the reservoir <b>174</b> through the fuel line <b>186</b> and out the discharge port <b>182</b>.

The user then depresses the ignition button <b>94</b>, <b>162</b> of the piezoelectric lighter <b>96</b>, <b>170</b>, which produces a flame inside the flame chamber <b>124</b>, <b>160</b>. The flame causes the heating surface <b>88</b>/<b>89</b>, <b>158</b> to get hot, thereby vaporizing at least a portion of the combustible material. (In alternative embodiments, according to user preference, the user may depress the ignition button <b>94</b>, <b>162</b> to cause the heating surface <b>88</b>/<b>89</b>, <b>158</b> to get hot prior to placing the combustible material on the heating surface <b>88</b>/<b>89</b>, <b>158</b>.)

The user then inhales, creating suction that draws air inward through the vaporizing apparatus <b>80</b>, <b>150</b>. The air, along with the vapor produced at the heating surface <b>88</b>/<b>89</b>, <b>158</b>, flows through the passages <b>98</b> in the body <b>84</b>, downward through the downstem <b>18</b>, through the water <b>16</b> in the reservoir <b>14</b>, upward through the stem <b>26</b>, and ultimately into the user's mouth and lungs.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In the embodiments discussed herein that employ a flame to heat the heating surface, the flame produced by the integrated piezoelectric lighter is advantageously contained within the flame chamber, and heat produced by the flame is transferred to the combustible material via conduction through the heating surface of the bowl. Thus, the flame is never exposed outside of the housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In additional embodiments, other methods and apparatus can be employed to heat the heating surface so as to vaporize the combustible material. For example, with reference next to <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, another embodiment of a vaporizing apparatus <b>200</b> is depicted, which vaporizing apparatus employs electric power to vaporize the combustible material.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The illustrated vaporizer <b>200</b> comprises a housing <b>202</b> which, as in other embodiments, has a lower portion <b>203</b> and an upper portion <b>205</b>.

The illustrated body <b>204</b> includes a cavity defining a bowl <b>206</b> that defines a heating surface <b>208</b>. The bowl <b>206</b> is configured to receive and contain combustible material such as essential oils and waxes. As discussed above, when the heating surface <b>208</b> is heated, the combustible material will vaporize. As in other embodiments, longitudinally-extending passages <b>210</b> can be formed in the body <b>204</b> so as to provide a path for vapor generated at the bowl <b>206</b> to travel through the body <b>204</b>. Notably, the body <b>204</b> can include features of other embodiment discussed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, an electric-powered heating element <b>212</b> is sized and configured to fit within a hollow portion of the body <b>204</b> just below the bowl <b>206</b> so as to abut the bowl <b>206</b> opposite the heating surface <b>208</b>. The heating element <b>212</b> can be configured in many ways. In a preferred embodiment the heating element employs one or more resistive coils embedded in a ceramic or quartz material. The heating element <b>212</b> can also have various shapes. For example, in one embodiment the heating element can be substantially flat. In the illustrated embodiment the heating element <b>212</b> is generally bowl-shaped so as to fit complementarily about at least part of the bowl <b>206</b> and to maximize the heated surface area. In some embodiments, only the portion of the heating element <b>212</b> abutting opposite the heating surface <b>208</b> is heated. In other embodiments the heating element may direct heat to the heating surface <b>208</b> and also side surfaces of the bowl <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, an insulative heating element cover (not shown) may be employed about an outer surface of the heating element so that heat from the heating element is directed only to the bowl <b>206</b>, and other parts of the body <b>204</b> and surrounding components can be protected from the heat generated by the heating element.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In the illustrated embodiment, a housing cap <b>214</b> fits atop the housing <b>202</b>.

When the lid <b>216</b> is in place, an enclosed vaporizing chamber is defined between the bowl <b>206</b> and lid <b>216</b>. By enclosing the vaporizing chamber, vaporizing heat can be conserved, leading to more complete vaporization. Also, vapor losses to the atmosphere can be reduced, as the only path for vapor to exit the vaporizing apparatus will be to flow through the passages <b>210</b>.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment the battery assembly comprises a battery <b>222</b>, such as a conventional AAA-sized battery, disposed within a battery sleeve <b>224</b>, which provides electrical connections. A secondary battery sleeve <b>226</b> can encompass the battery sleeve <b>224</b>, and preferably has a decorative role. A battery cap <b>228</b> encloses the lower end of the battery assembly <b>220</b>. A battery crown cap <b>230</b> is disposed atop the battery <b>222</b>. Preferably the crown cap <b>230</b> includes a mount portion <b>232</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">A circuit board housing <b>234</b> includes a mount portion <b>236</b> that is configured to engage the crown cap mount portion <b>232</b>, such as through a threaded engagement. Preferably, physical engagement of the circuit board housing <b>234</b> and crown cap <b>230</b> via their respective mount portions <b>236</b>, <b>232</b> also provides an electrical connection so that power from the battery assembly <b>220</b> is communicated to the circuit board housing <b>234</b>. Preferably, the connection between the battery assembly <b>22</b><i>o </i>and the circuit board housing <b>234</b> is within the housing <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As best shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, when the battery assembly <b>220</b> is engaged with the circuit board housing <b>234</b>, a portion of the battery assembly <b>220</b> extends out of the lower portion <b>203</b> of the housing <b>202</b>. The battery assembly <b>220</b> is shaped and configured so that there is a space between the outer surface of the battery assembly <b>220</b> and the inner surface of the housing lower portion <b>203</b> so as to provide a vapor flow path through the lower portion <b>203</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the illustrated embodiment, the battery assembly <b>220</b> is detachable from the vaporizer <b>200</b> so that the user may, for example, replace the AAA battery <b>222</b>. It is to be understood that, in other embodiments, the battery assembly may include a rechargeable battery. It is also to be understood that battery assemblies can be removed and replaced with other battery assemblies.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In a preferred embodiment, the circuit board housing is attachable to the body <b>204</b>, such as via a threaded connection. In additional embodiments the circuit board housing can be incorporated into the body. In still further embodiments, the circuit board housing and body may not be in any abutting connection, and the circuit board housing can be separately supported within the housing <b>202</b>, such as within a portion of the lower part <b>203</b> of the housing. Also, in some embodiments the cap <b>214</b> threadingly engages the upper end of the housing <b>202</b>. In some embodiments the cap engages part of the body <b>204</b> so as to constrain the body within the housing, and perhaps to securely hold the body sandwiched against an internal shoulder of the housing. In other embodiments the body is separately mounted within the housing, such as by a friction fit, and the cap simply aligns with the body.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Continuing with reference particularly to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, a circuit board <b>240</b> is configured to fit within the circuit board housing <b>234</b>, preferably being securely held in place by tracks <b>238</b> formed in a wall of the housing <b>234</b>. The illustrated circuit board <b>240</b> includes an actuator button <b>242</b> that communicates with electronic control componentry <b>244</b>. The circuit board <b>240</b> is in electric communication with the heating element <b>212</b>, such as via wires (not shown). The electronic control componentry <b>244</b> is configured to control electric power delivery to the heating element <b>212</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the actuator button includes a lamp (not shown)</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">A button <b>250</b> is connected to an elongate rod <b>252</b> having a distal end <b>254</b>. Preferably aligned holes (not shown) are formed in the housing <b>202</b> and circuit board housing <b>234</b>, which holes accommodate the elongate rod <b>252</b> extending therethrough, with the button <b>250</b> being accessible from outside the housing <b>202</b>. As such, when a user pushes the button <b>250</b>, the distal end <b>254</b> of the rod <b>252</b> contacts and depresses the actuator button <b>242</b>, which in turn triggers the electronic control componentry <b>244</b> to supply electric power to the heating element <b>212</b>, which electric power preferably is provided in accordance with a control routine.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In some embodiments in which the actuator button includes a lamp, the button <b>250</b> can be configured to communicate light from the actuator button <b>242</b> to the outside of the housing <b>202</b>, such as by the button <b>250</b> having a translucent portion that is lit up by the light. Further, in a preferred embodiment, the actuator button lamp is lit when power is being delivered to the heating element <b>212</b>. Thus, the button light serves as a visual indicator that the heating element <b>212</b> is energized, whether or not the button <b>250</b> is currently depressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic componentry <b>244</b> controls power delivery in accordance with one of two operational modes, which are herein referred to as a manual mode and an automatic mode. In the manual mode, depressing the button <b>250</b> triggers power delivery to the heating element <b>212</b>, and power is delivered until the button is released. Thus, in manual mode, the user directly controls the length of time the heating element <b>212</b> is energized by holding the button <b>250</b> in the depressed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Preferably the control componentry is configured to not allow the heating element to be energized for too long of a time. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the control componentry <b>244</b> is configured to track and limit the length of time the heating element <b>212</b> is continuously energized. More specifically, if the user holds the button <b>250</b> down for longer than 10 seconds, the control componentry <b>244</b> will trigger the device to reset, thus terminating power delivery to the heating element. Also, in some embodiments the control componentry may be linked to sensors that track the temperature of the heating surface <b>208</b>, and if the temperature exceeds a trigger value the control componentry will reset the device or, in another embodiment, reduce the current supplied to the heating element <b>212</b> so as to correspondingly reduce the temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In the automatic mode, depressing the button <b>250</b> signals the control componentry to energize the heating element for a set time period of 10 seconds, regardless of whether the button is held down or not.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The button can be used to change the vaporizer <b>200</b> from the automatic mode to the manual mode, and vice versa. In the illustrated embodiment, quickly depressing the button <b>5</b> times within a time period of 2 seconds will effect a change from one mode to the other. Also, upon a change in mode, a visual indicator is provided to signal the change in mode and to signal which mode is set. For example, 3 blinks of the lamp indicate that the vaporizer has been set to the manual mode, and 6 blinks of the lamp indicate that it has been set to the automatic mode.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">It is to be understood that, in additional embodiments, more (or less) modes may be employed, and differing methods may be employed for switching between modes. Also, in some additional embodiments, supplemental modes may be provided for controlling factors other than time of operation. For example, in another embodiment, a first supplemental mode will operate the heating element <b>212</b> at a first temperature, while second and third supplemental modes operate the heating element at successively higher temperatures. This can be in addition to the manual and automatic primary modes discussed above. In order to set supplemental modes, the user can depress the button in accordance with a preset pattern (such as, for example, two quick presses followed by a long press of more than 1 second), at which time the device will enter a programming condition in which the user can switch between supplemental modes by clicking the button. After each click the lamp will blink to indicate the identified supplemental mode (i.e., 1 long blink for the first supplemental mode, 2 or the second, 3 for the third). When the desired supplemental mode is identified, the user can signal a selection (such as by holding the button down for two seconds), and the indicated supplemental mode will be selected. Once set, the supplemental mode can remain selected, even as the user toggles back and forth between the primary modes (here, manual and automatic).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The embodiments of vaporizing apparatus discussed herein provide numerous advantages. For example, embodiments of the present vaporizing apparatus are sized and configured to be used with typical, or “off-the-shelf,” water pipes. Further, the user doesn't need to operate a handheld blowtorch in order to produce the heat necessary to vaporize the combustible material. The user simply pushes the ignition button, which is conveniently integrated into the vaporizing apparatus. Further, the heating surface is advantageously recessed within the vaporizing apparatus, thereby reducing the likelihood that a user will inadvertently touch the hot heating surface.</p>
