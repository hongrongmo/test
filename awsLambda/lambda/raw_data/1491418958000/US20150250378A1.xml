      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the past, there has been known a connector mechanically and electrically connected to a counterpart connector, such as a plug and a receptacle (see JP2010-287560A, for example).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The connector described in JP2010-287560A includes multiple contacts arranged side by side in a row. The multiple contacts include multiple pairs of differential contacts and multiple ground contacts. To the multiple pairs of differential contacts, multiple pairs of differential signals are respectively allocated. Each of the multiple ground contacts, to which ground is allocated, is placed between a pair of differential contacts and another pair of differential contacts.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thus, in the connector described in JP2010-287560A, crosstalk is prevented by placing each ground contact at the position.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, the connector described in JP2010-287560A has a problem of difficulty in downsizing since the arrangement of multiple contacts arranged side by side in a row increases width dimension in the side-by-side arrangement direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present disclosure is made in view of the above. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a wire connection device, a camera head and an endoscopic device which are capable of preventing signal deterioration while achieving downsizing.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a wire connection device including an outer frame that has a tubular shape, and a plurality of contacts that are provided in the outer frame, and that have a plurality of pairs of differential contacts to which a plurality of pairs of differential signals are respectively allocated, and a plurality of ground contacts each to which ground is allocated. When viewed from a direction along a central axis of the outer frame, the plurality of contacts are arranged side by side in two rows in a manner that the differential contacts of each pair can be adjacent to each other and in a manner that the number of the ground contacts adjacent to one of the differential contacts of each pair is equal to the number of the ground contacts adjacent to the other one of the differential contacts of the pair.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, when viewed from the direction along the central axis of the outer frame, the plurality of contacts may be arranged so as to constitute part of an equilateral triangular lattice where intervals of mutually adjacent lattice points are identical.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of pairs of differential contacts may be arranged in a manner that one of the differential contacts of each pair is arranged in a first row of the two rows while the other one of the differential contacts of the pair is arranged in a second row of the two rows.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of pairs of differential contacts may be arranged in a manner that both the differential contacts of each pair are arranged in either of a first row and a second row of the two rows.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, when viewed from the direction along the central axis of the outer frame, each of the plurality of contacts may be formed of a female contact including a first contact portion that has an L shape and that has a first sidewall portion extending in a side-by-side arrangement direction of either of a first row and a second row of the two rows, and a second sidewall portion crossing the first sidewall portion. The plurality of contacts may be arranged in a manner that separation distances between each two of the second sidewall portions mutually adjacent in the side-by-side arrangement direction are identical.</p>

      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, when viewed from the direction along the central axis of the outer frame, each of the plurality of contacts may be formed of a female contact including a third contact portion that has a U shape and that has a base portion extending in a side-by-side arrangement direction of either of a first row and a second row of the two rows, and a pair of third sidewall portions erecting from the base portion and facing to each other in the side-by-side arrangement direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of pairs of differential contacts may be arranged in a manner that one of the differential contacts of each pair is arranged in the first row while the other one of the differential contacts of the pair is arranged in the second row. The one differential contact and the other differential contact may be arranged symmetrically with respect to a point positioned at a center between the one differential contact and the other differential contact.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, when viewed from the direction along the central axis of the outer frame, the plurality of contacts may be arranged in a manner that the number of the ground contacts adjacent to one of the differential contacts of each pair and the number of the ground contacts adjacent to the other one of the differential contacts of the pair are set to one.</p>

Thus, an increase in width dimension in the side-by-side arrangement direction can be avoided as compared to a wire connection device (the connector described in JP2010-287560A, for example) in which multiple contacts are arranged side by side in a row.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Furthermore, in the wire connection device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the multiple contacts are arranged so that the differential contacts of each pair can be adjacent to each other and so that the number of the ground contacts adjacent to one of the differential contacts of each pair can be equal to the number of the ground contacts adjacent to the other one of the differential contacts of the pair. Thus, the number of so-called ground guards for each differential signal can be fixed, and consequently signal deterioration can be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Therefore, the wire connection device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure has an effect of preventing signal deterioration while achieving downsizing.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The camera head according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the wire connection device, thus having a similar effect.</p>

      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings. Note that, in this specification and the appended drawings, structural elements that have substantially the same function and structure are denoted with the same reference numerals, and repeated explanation of these structural elements is omitted.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">[Schematic Configuration of Endoscopic Device]</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic configuration of an endoscopic device <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The endoscopic device <b>1</b> is an apparatus used in medical fields to observe the interior of an observation object (interior of a living body) such as a human being. Note that, though an endoscopic device using a rigid scope (insertion part <b>2</b>) will be described as the endoscopic device <b>1</b> in this embodiment, the endoscopic device <b>1</b> is not limited thereto, but may be an endoscopic device using a flexible scope (not shown). As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the endoscopic device <b>1</b> includes the insertion part <b>2</b>, a light source device <b>3</b>, a light guide <b>4</b>, a camera head <b>5</b>, a composite cable <b>6</b>, a display <b>7</b> and a controller <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The insertion part <b>2</b>, being rigid and having an elongated shape, is inserted into an observation object. An optical system for condensing light to form an object image is provided inside the insertion part <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The light source device <b>3</b> is connected to one end of the light guide <b>4</b>, and supplies the one end of the light guide <b>4</b> with light to illuminate the interior of the observation object.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">While the one end of the light guide <b>4</b> is detachably connected to the light source device <b>3</b>, the other end is detachably connected to the insertion part <b>2</b>. The light guide <b>4</b> transmits light supplied from the light source device <b>3</b> from the one end to the other end, thereby supplying the light to the insertion part <b>2</b>. The light supplied to the insertion part <b>2</b> is emitted from the distal end of the insertion part <b>2</b>, and thereby the interior of the observation object is irradiated with the light. The light (object image) with which the interior of the observation object is irradiated is condensed by the optical system in the insertion part <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The camera head <b>5</b> is detachably connected to the base end of the insertion part <b>2</b>. Under control of the controller <b>8</b>, the camera head <b>5</b> images the object image formed with light condensed by the insertion part <b>2</b>, then photoelectrically converts imaging signals (electrical signals) obtained by the imaging into optical signals, and outputs the optical signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In this embodiment, a differential transmission system is employed. Accordingly, information (imaging signals (electrical signals and optical signals)) obtained by imaging by the camera head <b>5</b> is transmitted to the controller <b>8</b> through the composite cable <b>6</b> as multiple pairs of differential signals (+) and differential signals (â). Here, the differential signal (+) and the differential signal (â) of each pair are signals having mutually opposite phases.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The detailed configuration of the camera head <b>5</b> will be described later.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The composite cable <b>6</b> has multiple optical fibers <b>61</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>) and multiple electrical signal cables <b>62</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>) inside a jacket <b>6</b>A (see <figref>FIG. 7</figref>), which is the outermost layer. One end of the composite cable <b>6</b> is detachably connected to the controller <b>8</b> while the other end is detachably connected to the camera head <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The multiple optical fibers <b>61</b> are arranged at a center position of the composite cable <b>6</b> in a cross sectional view of the composite cable <b>6</b>, and used for transmitting optical signals between the camera head <b>5</b> and the controller <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The multiple electrical signal cables <b>62</b> are arranged around the multiple optical fibers <b>61</b> in a cross sectional view of the composite cable <b>6</b>, and used for transmitting electrical signals between the camera head <b>5</b> and the controller <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The display <b>7</b> displays an image under control of the controller <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The controller <b>8</b> acquires optical signals (differential signals (+) and differential signals (â)) outputted from the camera head <b>5</b> through the multiple optical fibers <b>61</b>, and photoelectrically converts the optical signals to electrical signals. Then, the controller <b>8</b> performs predetermined processing on the photoelectrically converted electrical signals, thereby causing the display <b>7</b> to display an image imaged by the camera head <b>5</b>. Meanwhile, the controller <b>8</b> outputs control signals and the like (electrical signals) to the camera head <b>5</b> through the multiple electrical signal cables <b>62</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">These two second printed circuit boards <b>93</b> have the same configuration. Hereinafter, one of the second printed circuit boards <b>93</b> will be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the second printed circuit board <b>93</b> includes a first contact part <b>931</b>, a second contact part <b>932</b> and an installation part <b>933</b>, installed between the first and second contact parts <b>931</b> and <b>932</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The first contact part <b>931</b> has a shape corresponding to one of the second areas Ar<b>2</b>â². Additionally, in the first contact part <b>931</b>, there are formed multiple holes <b>931</b>A (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) respectively corresponding to the multiple second female contacts <b>915</b> (second pin-shaped portions <b>915</b>B) arranged in the second area Ar<b>2</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">The first contact part <b>931</b> is fitted to the receptacle <b>91</b>, by putting the first contact part <b>931</b> on the base-end side end surface of the insulator <b>912</b> with the second female contacts <b>915</b> inserted through the respective holes <b>931</b>A, and then by soldering the second pin-shaped portions <b>915</b>B to lands <b>931</b>B (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) provided on the peripheries of the holes <b>931</b>A, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">The second contact part <b>93</b> is arranged at a position overlapping the first printed circuit board <b>92</b>, in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, by bending the installation part <b>933</b> with respect to the first contact part <b>931</b> fitted to the receptacle <b>91</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, on a surface of the second contact part <b>932</b>, there is formed multiple lands <b>932</b>A each having a substantially rectangular shape. The second contact part <b>932</b> is electrically connected to the multiple electrical signal cables <b>62</b> by soldering the multiple electrical signal cables <b>62</b> to the multiple land <b>932</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">In the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment, the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> are arranged side by side in two rows when viewed from the direction along the central axis Axâ² of the first outer frame <b>911</b>. Consequently, an increase in width dimension in the side-by-side arrangement direction can be avoided as compared to the configuration in which the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> are arranged side by side in a row.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Furthermore, the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> are arranged so that the female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> of each pair can be adjacent to each other and so that the number of the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> adjacent to the female-side first differential contact <b>916</b> of each pair can be equal to the number of the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> adjacent to the female-side second differential contact <b>917</b> of the pair. Thus, the number of so-called ground guards for each differential signal can be fixed, and consequently signal deterioration can be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">Accordingly, the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment has an effect of preventing signal deterioration while achieving downsizing. Note that the hermetic connector <b>522</b> also has a similar effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">In addition, in the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment, the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> are arranged so as to constitute part of an equilateral triangular lattice when viewed from the direction along the central axis Axâ² of the first outer frame <b>911</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">Accordingly, the distances between each female-side ground contact <b>918</b> and its adjacent pair of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> are the same as each other. Thus, the balance between differential signals of each pair with respect to ground can be secured, and consequently signal deterioration can be further prevented. Note that the hermetic connector <b>522</b> also has a similar effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">In addition, in the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment, the four pairs of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> are arranged so as to exhibit a substantially W shape as viewed from the direction along the central axis Axâ² of the first outer frame <b>911</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">Accordingly, the number of the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> can be relatively small (three). Thus reducing the number of the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> enables downsizing of the receptacle <b>91</b>. Note that the hermetic connector <b>522</b> also has a similar effect.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">Furthermore, in the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment, each of the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> includes the first contact portion <b>914</b>A, which has the first and second sidewall portions <b>914</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>914</b>A<b>2</b> and which thus have an L shape as viewed from the direction along the central axis Axâ² of the first outer frame <b>911</b>. In addition, the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b> are arranged so that the separation distance D between each two second sidewall portions <b>914</b>A<b>2</b> mutually adjacent in the side-by-side arrangement direction can be fixed.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">Accordingly, a sufficiently large distance can be secured as the separation distance D between each two second sidewall portions <b>914</b>A<b>2</b> mutually adjacent in the side-by-side arrangement direction. In other words, a sufficiently large distance can be secured as the separation distance D between the second sidewall portions <b>914</b>A<b>2</b> of the female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> of different pairs (the female-side second differential contact <b>917</b> at the leftmost position and the female-side first differential contact <b>916</b> at the second position from the left, in the second row, which is the lower one, in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, for example). This enables reduction of a coupling degree (electric field interference) between a differential signal (+) and a differential signal (â) of different pairs, thus suppressing crosstalk and thereby even further preventing signal deterioration. In addition, forming each first contact portion <b>914</b>A in an L shape enables the first contact portion <b>914</b>A to maintain sufficient strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">In addition, in the receptacle <b>91</b> according to this embodiment, as to each of the four pairs of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b>, one of the differential contacts is arranged in the first row, which is the upper one, while the other one of the differential contacts is arranged in the second row, which is the lower one, in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. Additionally, the one differential contact and the other differential contact are arranged symmetrically with respect to the point O positioned at the center therebetween.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">Thus, the balance between differential signals of each pair with respect to the point O can be secured, and consequently signal deterioration can be further prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">In a hermetic connector of related art, multiple openings through which multiple male contacts are inserted are all formed in the same opening area size (diameter) in a plate body. Accordingly, insulating members respectively sealing the multiple openings are also formed in the same size.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">Here, in raising the frequencies of differential signals, the opening area size (diameter) of the multiple openings has to be increased in order to secure an insulation distance between the plate body and each male contact.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">Thus, in the hermetic connector of related art, the opening area size (diameter) of all the openings has to be increased so as to be compatible with the above case. This consequently increases the area size occupied by all the openings (insulating members) in the plate body, thus increasing the outer diameter size of the hermetic connector.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">On the other hand, in this embodiment, the openings <b>522</b>B <b>1</b> through which the male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G are inserted are formed in the same opening area size (diameter) that is larger than the opening area size (diameter) of the openings <b>522</b>B<b>1</b> through which the male-side ground contacts <b>522</b>H are inserted, in the plate body <b>522</b>B. In addition, each of the insulating members <b>522</b>B<b>2</b> is formed in a size in accordance with the opening area size (diameter) of the corresponding one of the openings <b>522</b>B<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">In other words, in this embodiment, only the minimum insulation distance that may be necessary to be compatible with the case of raising the frequencies of differential signals is secured between the plate body <b>522</b>B and each of the male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G. Thus, by minimizing the opening area size (diameter) of each of the openings <b>522</b>B <b>1</b> through which the male-side ground contacts <b>522</b>H and the second male contacts <b>522</b>E are inserted as much as possible, the area size occupied by all the openings <b>522</b>B<b>1</b> (insulating members <b>522</b>B<b>2</b>) in the plate body <b>522</b>B is minimized as much as possible. Consequently, diameter reduction (downsizing) of the hermetic connector <b>522</b> can be achieved.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows a modification of the embodiment according to the present disclosure. Specifically, <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows the first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) as viewed from the direction along the central axis Axâ² (central axis Ax) of the first outer frame <b>911</b> (second outer frame <b>522</b>A).</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">Note that, in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, each of the first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) is indicated virtually by ââ¯,â for convenience of explanation. The letters of â+â, âââ and âGâ added inside the ââ¯â respectively indicate allocation of a differential signal (+), a differential signal (â) and ground. In addition, each pair of the first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) to which a pair of a differential signal (+) and a differential signal (â) is allocated is surrounded by the dashed line.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">The number of the first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) may be fourteen, as shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. Even in such a case, the fourteen first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) are preferably arranged side by side in two rows so as to constitute part of an equilateral triangular lattice, as similar to the embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Specifically, in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the seven first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) in the first row, which is the upper one, are arranged side by side in the following order from left to right in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>: a pair of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> (male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G), the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> (male-side ground contact <b>522</b>H), a pair of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> (male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G), the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> (male-side ground contacts <b>522</b>H) and the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> (male-side ground contact <b>522</b>H). Meanwhile, the seven first female contacts <b>914</b> (first male contacts <b>522</b>D) in the second row, which is the lower one, are arranged side by side in the following order from left to right in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>: the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> (male-side ground contact <b>522</b>H), the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> (male-side ground contact <b>522</b>H), a pair of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> (male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G), the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> (male-side ground contact <b>522</b>H) and a pair of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> (male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G).</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">Thus, each of the four pairs of female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> (male-side first and second differential contacts <b>522</b>F and <b>522</b>G) is arranged either in the first row or in the second row.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">In the embodiment, there may be employed a contact portion (second contact portion <b>914</b>Aâ² and third contact portion <b>914</b>Aâ³, described below, for example) having another shape different from that of the first contact portion <b>914</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">
        <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show modifications of the embodiment according to the present disclosure. Specifically, each of <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> is a diagram corresponding to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, there may be employed second contact portions <b>914</b>Aâ² each having a plate shape obtained by omitting the second sidewall portion <b>914</b>A<b>2</b> from the first contact portion <b>914</b>A described in the embodiment. Even this configuration still enables reduction of a coupling degree (electric field interference) between a differential signal (+) and a differential signal (â) of different pairs, and thus suppresses crosstalk, thereby preventing signal deterioration.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">Furthermore, as shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, there may be employed third contact portions <b>914</b>Aâ³ each having a U shape obtained by adding a third sidewall portion <b>914</b>A<b>3</b>, facing the second sidewall portion <b>914</b>A<b>2</b>, to the first contact portion <b>914</b>A described in the embodiment, for example. This configuration enables the third contact portions <b>914</b>Aâ³ to have an increased strength.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">In the embodiment, the female-side ground contact <b>918</b> at the third position from the left in the second row, which is the lower one, <figref>FIG. 10</figref> may be omitted. Note that this is also applicable to the hermetic connector <b>522</b> and the configurations shown in <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. When such a configuration is employed, the number of ground guards between the female-side first and second differential contacts <b>916</b> and <b>917</b> is fixed to one. Thus, the number of the female-side ground contacts <b>918</b> can be minimized as much as possible, and thereby the receptacle <b>91</b> can be downsized.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">In the embodiment, still another configuration may be employed where the receptacle <b>91</b> is omitted and where, instead, the first and second printed circuit boards <b>92</b> and <b>93</b> are connected directly, from outside of the airtight part <b>52</b>, to the hermetic connector <b>522</b> mounted on the base-end side of the airtight part <b>52</b>. In this case, each of the multiple male contacts <b>522</b>C of the hermetic connector <b>522</b> is preferably formed in a shape similar to the first pin-shaped portions <b>914</b>B of the receptacle <b>91</b> (elastically deformable in a leaf spring shape) in consideration of fitting work of the first printed circuit board <b>92</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">In the embodiment, as the wire connection devices according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, round connectors (receptacle <b>91</b> and hermetic connector <b>522</b>) are employed, but connectors each having a non-round shape may be employed. When connectors each having a non-round shape is employed, a first printed circuit board may be arranged at a position other than a center position of each connector (center position when viewed from the direction along the central axis of the connector) as long as a pitch of multiple contacts electrically connected to the first printed circuit board can be secured sufficiently large.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">In the embodiment, the pitch (second pitch P<b>2</b>) of the multiple second female contacts <b>915</b> is set smaller than the pitch (first pitch P<b>1</b>) of the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b>, but the pitch length is not limited thereto. The pitch of the multiple second female contacts <b>915</b> may set to larger than that of the multiple first female contacts <b>914</b>.</p>
