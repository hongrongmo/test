    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is directed to an antimicrobial polymeric film and to an antimicrobial polymeric composition. Particularly, the antimicrobial film and composition may serve to prolong the shelf life of food products without the use of preservatives.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Active packaging can be defined as a system in which the package, the product and the environment interact together for extending the shelf life of the product by changing the conditions inside the package, while maintaining the quality of the packaged product. Antimicrobial packaging is an active packaging that acts against proliferation of bacteria and fungus on the food surface. The activity of the active substance in the system can take place in three different ways: absorption, immobilization or release system, wherein the release system allows the migration or diffusion of the antimicrobial agent to the food surface through the headspace of the package or through the media that the food is found in. In order to improve the performance of the packaging it is essential to develop control of the active agent diffusion. If the concentration of the active agent is equal or above the minimum inhibitory concentration in the headspace of the package, the system will effectively decrease the proliferation of the bacterium and fungus.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In recent years, antibacterial food packaging, based on natural materials, have been developed. Among the natural antimicrobial agents that can be incorporated in the antimicrobial release system are essential oils (EOs) prepared from plant extracts. Essential oils (EOs) are known to have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Most EOs are approved for contact with food and are classified as generally recognized as safeâ (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Various studies have examined the implementation of various EOs for the development of films with antibacterial properties, including thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, cinnamaldehyde and rosemary in different polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Thymol, for example, is a component found in EOs of oregano and thyme; it has a phenolic structure and is known as very active against proliferation of different bacteria and fungi. The antibacterial properties of thymol and similar compounds are associated with their lipophilic character enabling the accumulation in cell membranes of microorganisms leading to the disruption of cell structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In certain instances, EOs may be readily integrated in various polymers, including polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), polycaprolactone, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and the like. The integration of the EOs into the polymers may be performed using a variety of methods, including solvent casting, extrusion film blowing, extrusion casting, compression molding, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">However, EOs are highly volatile compounds and therefore, the high processing temperature of polymeric films causes a high percentage of the EOs to evaporate. Thus, the incorporation thereof into polymeric films is hindered. Further, over time and use, especially when the storage environment is not optimal, it is possible that a certain percentage of the EOs incorporated in the polymeric sheet evaporate therefrom. In addition, blooming (the migration of additives to the polymer surface, such that those additives are accumulated on the surface, rather than being evenly distributed throughout the polymer) is a common phenomena when preparing polymer sheets with additives such as EOs. Therefore, there is a need in the art of a polymeric film in which EOs may be incorporated, without hindrance caused by the high processing temperature. There is further a need in the art for a polymeric film in which the EOs will remain incorporated over time, use and changing storage environment. In addition, there is a further need in the art for a polymer sheet in which the blooming phenomenon is reduced to a minimum.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Nano-clays (NCs) have been used in various polymers for improving polymeric mechanical and barrier properties. In addition, it was found that chemically treated NCs may provide higher adsorption capacity, depending on the chemical moieties used. Clay minerals have been modified with quaternary amine cations, replacing the exchangeable inorganic sodium, potassium, or calcium ions on the clay surface. The chemical treatment changes the hydrophilic nature of the NCs into hydrophobic. NCs are also known to increase the porosity of the polymeric film in which they are incorporated.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Another aspect of active packaging relates to antimicrobial compositions that are coated onto any appropriate type of packaging material. Existing solutions are based mainly on silver ions, quaternary ammonium cation, nisin, triclosan, and zeolite (generally prepared using the ion-exchange method). EOs may also be used in antimicrobial coatings. Incorporation of antimicrobial EO substances within the bulk or coating of the packaging may be more efficient if inhibitory concentrations are maintained by slow release of the active agents to the headspace of the food package.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Han et al. (2000) disclosed that a polymer-based solution coating would be the most desirable method in terms of stability and adhesiveness of attaching a bacteriocin to a plastic film. LDPE film was successfully coated with nisin using methylcellulose (MC)/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a carrier. The production of a multilayered antimicrobial film by solution coating of Grapefruit seeds extract (GFSE) coated films in polyamide (Versamid 750) also presented antimicrobial effects in ground beef packaging. However, commercial active compositions are not known in the art. Further, EOs are known to modify the flavor of the food and therefore, the control of the amount of EO released from the antibacterial coating is essential for the preparation of commercial antimicrobial packaging, based on coating antimicrobial materials on prepared packages.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The terms âsheetâ and âfilmâ as used herein are to be understood as having their customary meanings as used in the thermoplastic and packaging arts. Those terms, as well as other equivalent terms, are interchangeable throughout.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The term âaboutâ as used herein is to be understood to refer to a 10% deviation in the value related to.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Some embodiments of the invention are directed to an antimicrobial sheet comprising a polymer, a nanoparticle, an antimicrobial material, such as an EO, and a foaming agent. As detailed herein, the addition of a foaming agent may aid in creating a micro-porous structure that allows the absorption of the antimicrobial material into the antimicrobial sheet. Accordingly, in the films detailed herein, the layer comprising the antimicrobial material, e.g., the EO, further comprises a foaming agent. According to some embodiments, the nanoparticle is a nanoclay. According to some embodiments, the nano-particle is not a nano clay. According to some embodiments, any of the nano particles related to herein may be treated, e.g., exfoliated, in order to achieve desired properties. It is further noted that, unless specifically noted otherwise, or unless it would be clear to a person skilled in the art that it would not be feasible, whenever nanoclays are mentioned, the term may be broadened to include other types of nanoparticles as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">According to some embodiments, the polymer is a polyolefin (PO) polymer, a co-polystyrene, a polyamide, a co-polyamide or any immiscible blend thereof. It is noted that herein and throughout, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the reference to âthe polymerâ may relate to the first polymer, the second polymer or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">According to some embodiments, the antimicrobial sheet further comprises a compatibilizer, an additional nano-particle, an emulsifier, an additional functional component, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">According to some embodiments, the additional nano-particle is a nano-clay. According to some embodiments, the additional nano-particle is not a nano clay. According to some embodiments, any of the nano particles related to herein may be treated, e.g., exfoliated, in order to achieve desired properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">According to some embodiments, the antimicrobial sheet is used in packaging any product that requires the control of the development of microbes therein/thereon, such as food and drink products, as well as cosmetics. Such antimicrobial sheets may be used in order to prolong the shelf life of any desired product.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">According to some embodiments, the antimicrobial polymeric sheet is prepared from a concentrate of a highly porous granule nanocomposite comprising a first polymer, a foaming agent and a nano-particle. According to some embodiments, the concentrate may further include a compatibilizer, an additional nano-particle, an emulsifier, an additional functional component, or any combination thereof. According to some embodiments, the concentrate is prepared using a twin screw extruder, thus providing a highly porous granule nano-composite.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Once the highly porous granule nano-composite is prepared, at least one antimicrobial material, e.g., an EO, is incorporated therein. According to some embodiments, the antimicrobial material is incorporated into the pores of the granules as well as the polymer free space by dry mixing. According to some embodiments, the dry mixing is performed in a high speed mixer. According to some embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of about 50Â° C. According to further embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of between about 50-70Â° C. According to further embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of between about 40-50Â° C. According to further embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of between about 50-60Â° C. According to further embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of between about 60-70Â° C. According to further embodiments, the dry mixing is performed at a temperature of between about 70-80Â° C. According to some embodiments, the dry mixing temperature is selected so that it is at least the melting point of the EO, so that the EO is in liquid state. According to some embodiments, the dry mixing temperature is further set according to the polymer utilized in the concentrate. If the EO is thymol, the dry mixing temperature may be between about 50-70Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">After the antimicrobial material is incorporated into the highly porous nano-composite, the polymeric sheet is prepared therefrom, with the addition of an appropriate amount of a second polymer, by any appropriate means, including single screw cast extrusion or blow extrusion. According to some embodiments, the additional amount of polymer, i.e., the second polymer, is the same type of polymer used to prepare the highly porous nano-composite, i.e., the first polymer. According to other embodiments, the additional amount of the polymer, i.e., second polymer, is not the same type of the polymer used to prepare the highly porous nano-composite, i.e., the first polymer. According to some embodiments, the antimicrobial sheet is prepared implementing only one intensive thermal process, thereby minimizing the percentage of EOs evaporating.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The use of nanoparticles, such as nanoclays, in the concentrate allows the formation of highly porous granules, which, as detailed herein, enables the incorporation of the antimicrobial material, e.g., the EO, into the porous granules, such that a relatively high amount of the antimicrobial material may be incorporated into the granules. Further, the EO is not readily released form the granules, even when preparing the polymeric sheet under relatively high temperatures. Further, when the prepared antimicrobial polymeric sheet is used for packaging any type of product, the incorporation of the antimicrobial material into the porous granules controls the release rate of the antimicrobial material from the polymeric sheet packaging into the packaged product and/or its surroundings. In addition, as presented in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> (1% wt NC), <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D (5% wt NC), and lE and <b>1</b>F (10% wt NC), the use of nano-particles inhibits the blooming phenomenon, i.e., the migration of additives, such as antimicrobial materials, to the surface of the polymeric sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">According to some embodiments, the PO polymer may be a low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), metallocene linear low density polyethylene (mLLDPE), linear medium density polyethylene (LMDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE) ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVA), ethylene methyl acrylate (EMA), ethylene ethyl acrylate (EEA), ethylene butyl acrylate (EBA) or a polypropylene (PP) copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">According to further embodiments, the polymer may be a polyamide, such as PA6, PA66, PA6/66 or PA6/12. According to further embodiments, the polymer may be a styrene co-polymer, such as styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS), styrene butadiene (SB) and styrene butadiene styrene (SBS)</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">According to further embodiments, the polymer in the concentrate is substituted with an immiscible blend of a PO polymer and a polymide or a PO polymer and a styrene, such as PO/co-polyamide (PO/coPA). According to some embodiments, the polymer is a co-polyamide nylon 6/66, nylon 6/12, or any combination thereof. According to some embodiments, the formation of a two-phase concentrate enables the antimicrobial material to be highly incorporated into one phase, while, during heat treatment and/or use, the antimicrobial material may diffuse into the other phase, thus allowing the antimicrobial material to remain in the prepared polymeric sheet throughout the different preparation and usage stages.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">According to some embodiments, the polymer density and its degree of crystallinity is controlled, so as to affect the diffusion kinetics of the antimicrobial material through the polymer matrix. The polymer density and crystallinity of the final antimicrobial sheet is determined according to the types of polymers utilized in the preparation of the antimicrobial sheet, and further influenced by the manufacturing conditions. In general, increasing the degree of crystallinity causes the diffusion of the antimicrobial material through the polymer matrix to be slower. On the other hand, since crystals are impermeable, they do not absorb the antimicrobial material, thus, in the impregnation stage, a higher degree of crystallinity can lead to a decrease in absorption rate. Therefore, the degree of crystallinity is controlled such that it is low enough for the antimicrobial material to be absorbed in the polymeric matrix, though high enough so that the antimicrobial material does not immediately diffuse out of the polymeric matrix.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">According to some embodiments, the type of polymer matrix, e.g., the polarity thereof, is set according to the affinity thereof with the particular antimicrobial material to be absorbed therein. The higher the affinity between the antimicrobial material and the polymeric matrix, the higher the absorption of the antimicrobial material into the matrix; however, the diffusion rate of the antimicrobial material from the matrix in lowered. Therefore, the interaction between the antimicrobial material and the polymeric matrix may be used to control the initial absorption of the antimicrobial material into the matrix, as well as the release profile of the antimicrobial material therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">According to some embodiments, the nano-clay is selected from montmorillonite or other types of bentonites. According to some embodiments, the nano-particles are chemically treated, e.g., with quaternary amine cations, to replace inorganic ions, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, on the clay surface. Such chemical treatment of the nano-particles may change the nano-particles nature from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, increasing the distribution of the nano-particles particles throughout the polymer. According to some embodiments, the nano-particles are exfoliated using a quaternary ammonium organic modifier.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">According to some embodiments, the compatibilizer is added to the polymer by grafting, such as a PO polymer grafted maleic anhydride (g-MAH), ethylene grafted methacrylic acid, sodium ionomer of ethylene grafted methacrylic acid or any other appropriate polymer grafted with a compatibilizer. The grafting with a compatibilizer may aid in dispersion of the nanoclays throughout the polymeric matrix. According to some embodiments, the additional nano-particle is a silicate.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">According to some embodiments, the foaming agent is in the form of a concentrate. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is more than about 0.5% w/w. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is about 0.2-2.0% w/w. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is about 0.2-0.5% w/w. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is about 0.5-1.0% w/w. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is about 1.0-1.5% w/w. According to some embodiments, the amount of the foaming agent concentrate is about 1.5-2.0% w/w. The foaming agent may be endothermic, based on citric acid or agents comprising the same. The foaming agent may be exothermic, based on diazocarbonamide or agents comprising the same. As used herein the terms foaming agent, foaming agent concentrate, foaming concentrate and the like are interchangeable. According to some embodiments, the foaming agent is added in order to increase the ability of the prepared concentrate to absorb the antimicrobial material by creating micro-cavities in the nano-composite concentrate. According to further embodiments, the foaming agent reduces the loss of EOs during processing under heat. The use of the foaming agent may also exfoliate the nano-particles particles, which could also contribute to a higher ability of absorbing an antimicrobial material into the granules. According to some embodiments, the combined implementation of a foaming agent and an EO allows nano-particles, such as nano-clays, to be uniformly dispersed throughout the prepared antimicrobial film. According to further embodiments, the foaming agent delays the release of the EO from the antimicrobial film. According to some embodiments, the foaming agent is endothermic. According to other embodiments, the foaming agent is exothermic. Generally, an endothermic foaming agent produces closed cavities, while an exothermic foaming agent produces opened cavities. Opened cavities could more readily absorb the antimicrobial material into the granules; however, closed cavities may improve the stability of the antimicrobial material being incorporated in the granules, even when undergoing extrusion under heat. Closed cavities may also be advantageous in obtaining a slow release profile of the antimicrobial material from the polymeric sheet over time and use. Accordingly, it is possible to use at least two foaming agents, one endothermic and one exothermic.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">According to some embodiments, the polymer sheet includes a single polymeric layer. According to further embodiments, the polymeric sheet includes at least two layers, wherein each layer may be designed to have different properties, all of which, together, bring to an optimum (1) the absorption of the antimicrobial material into the concentrate from which the sheet is prepared; (2) the remaining of the antimicrobial material in the prepared sheet, even after heat treatment; and (3) the release profile of the antimicrobial material over time and use of the sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">According to some embodiments, when a multilayered sheet is prepared, only one layer includes an antimicrobial material. According to other embodiments, more than one layer includes an antimicrobial material. According to some embodiments, any two layers may comprise different antimicrobial materials. According to some embodiments, two or more different antimicrobial materials may be used in the same layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">According to some embodiments, a layer containing an antimicrobial material may be prepared between two polymeric layers that do not include an antimicrobial material, such that diffusion rate of the antimicrobial material may be controlled depending on the density, porosity, crystallinity and/or polarity of the polymers in any one of the layers adjacent to the layer comprising the antimicrobial material.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">According to some embodiments, in single layer films less EO is evaporated during processing when in the polymer's density is increased, and therefore, single layered films may be prepared from relatively dense polymers. According to some embodiments, the preparation of multilayer sheets decreases the affect of crystallinity (density) of the polymers on the EO desorption/absorption.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">According to some embodiments, the polymer in the single layered sheet is a polar polymer. The polarity of the polymer may affect the interaction thereof with the EO, such that polar polymers having a stronger interaction with the EO may decrease the desorption rate thereof. According to some embodiments, the layer in the multilayered sheet comprising the EO is prepared from a polar polymer. According to some embodiments, the outer layers in a multilayered sheet (that do not include an EO) comprise polar polymers, which may also inhibit the desorption of the EO from the sheet. According to further embodiments, the outer layers in a multilayered sheet (that do not include an EO) comprise non-polar polymers, thereby increasing the antimicrobial properties of the sheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The preparation of single or multi layered sheets may be achieved, using co-extrusion or a combination of hot lamination and extrusion coating.</p>

      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0132">The solubility parameters of the film components (polymers, nanoclays, and thymol) were calculated using a computer program HSPiP software (http://www.hansen-solubility.com). The HSPiP v4 program enables one to assess the level of interactivity between the materials. The program takes into account all types of interaction; dispersion forces, polar forces, and hydrogen bonds, which may be formed between any two different materials. The program was used to plot the polymers in a form of a 3D-sphere. Thymol was spatially located in the polymer sphere and the relative energy difference (RED) number was calculated. The RED number may help predict and understand the theoretical chemical affinity between the materials in the films, thereby predicting the desorption kinetics.</p>

      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0133">The antibacterial activity of the films was evaluated and compared with both untreated bacteria using <i>E. coli </i>ATCC 8739 as the experimental model and to a reference polyethylene control film, not comprising an antimicrobial EO. The <i>E. coli </i>bacteria were grown over night in Nutrient Broth (NB, Sigma) media under shaking (250 rpm) at 37Â° C. On the following day, the overnight culture was diluted in a fresh NB medium to OD=0.1, which approximately corresponds to 10Ì8 colony forming units (CFU) per mL, and grown for 1.5 h to allow the cells to enter a logarithmic state until OD=0.6 was reached. Then, the bacteria were diluted into NB 1% (1:100) to obtain a stock solution with a working concentration of 10Ì5 CFU/mL. 3 mL of the stock solution were taken into each well in a 6-well plate (DE-GROOTH). Each of the various films was laid on top of the well in a way that there was no direct contact between the film and the bacterial solution, thus the antibacterial activity, if achieved, would be due to the migration of the EO from the film to the bacterial solution. In light of the EO evaporation, there was a separation between the films, thus each plate received one film and the empty wells were filled with an equal volume of water. The plates were then incubated on a shaker (100 rpm) at 37Â° C. for 20-24 h. On the next day, serial dilutions were carried out and the cells were spotted onto NB agar plates. The NB plates were incubated at 37Â° C. for 20 h. Cell growth was monitored and determined by viable cell count.</p>

      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0135">This study is divided into two parts. In the first part, (samples 1-3) nano composites based on polymers with different levels of crystallinity were studied (the name given to each sample relates to the density of the polymer). Samples 4-10 are related to the second part of the study, wherein the influence of the outer layer in a multilayered film was determined (the name given to each sample relates to the three layers â3Lâ and to the specific polymer used in the outer layer of the filmââEVA9â for ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer with vinyl acetate content of 9.4 wt %, âEVA18â for ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer with vinyl acetate content of 18 wt %, VLD and VLDPE for very low density polyethylene, LD and LLDPE for low density polyethylene, MD and MDPE for medium density polyethylene, EMA for ethylene methyl acrylate etc. Sample 10 is a mono layer film, for comparison purposes. In each of the above films having three layers, both external layers were identical to one another; however, it is noted that this is not essential and that sheets could have been prepared otherwise, taking into account the change in properties caused by the different types of polymers used.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0136">Quantitative Analysis of EO concentration in the Film Cast extrusion was performed at 230Â° C. This temperature may lead to a severe evaporation of the EO, which can be reduced according to the composition of the film. As presented in the results, as the polymer's density increased, less EO evaporated during processing. The nominal concentration of the EO in the film was 3% w/w, as provided and mixed with the polymeric concentrate. However, the final concentrations of the EO were dependent on the ability of the film to delay EO desorption due to tortuosity or polarity. As shown in Table II and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the polymer density has an influence on the ability of the film to protect the EO during processing.</p>

      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0139">Migration depends upon the conditions in which the test is performed and on the type of media the migration occurs in (different simulants, air, etc.). Volatile antimicrobial substances, such as EOs, may protect products without direct contact, through migration of EO molecules to the headspace of the package. For this reason, it is of great importance to determine the concentration of the active compound in the headspace. In an open container, the large osmotic pressure gradient will result in fast migration. However, when stored in a closed container the migration rate will be reduced and limited by the state of equilibrium and partitioning. For this reason, two different tests were performed. First, the amount of EO in films exposed to air for different periods of times was measured (<figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) using extraction and colorimetric tests. In the second test, the amount of EO released to the headspace of a closed glass vial was evaluated by an auto sampler headspace GC-MS (<figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>). In this test, the vials with samples were kept at room temperature, and the conditioning time of each sample was 2 minutes at 40Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0140">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the EO migrates very fast from the VLDPE film. However, samples with a higher density and higher crystalinity (LLDPE and MDPE) show a delay in EO desorption, leading to the conclusion that the polymer crystals create a high tortuosity, resulting in a barrier for the EO migration. <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> depict the external layer influence on the EO desorption from multilayer films. In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the external layers are prepared from polymers with different densities. No significant effect on the EO desorption is noticed.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0141">The effect of external layer (related to herein also as the âouter layerâ) density on desorption to air at room temperature can be seen in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. The crystallinity degree affects the ability of the film to hold the EO. As the crystallinity is higher, the ability to hold the EO for longer periods of time increases. In <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the outer layers are based on polymers having different polarities. These results are correlated with the results shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, wherein file EVA18 shows greater ability to control the EO release. It is noted that the shape of the obtained curve depends on various coefficients affecting the diffusion predicted by various models. According to diffusion models, diffusion coefficient affects the diffusion rate until the equilibrium, while the partition coefficient affects the equilibrium concentration in the headspace. Cran et al. studied the migration of EO from LDPE containing 0, 10, and 50% (w/w) EVA. EVA has shown two opposite effects. However, it increased the affinity between the polymer matrix and the EO causing a desorption delay, and even though it reduced the crystallinity, it accelerated the desorption. In this study, no reduction of crystallinity could be noticed, since the layer containing EO did not contain EVA. It could be noticed that the polarity has a significant influence on the EO desorption, the change in curve shape represents the ratio of the migrant concentration in the packaging to the migrant concentration in the food simulant at equilibrium, which reflects the effect in partition coefficient. An attempt to use a diffusion model based on the Crank model showed that there is a large gap between the empirical results obtained and the model.</p>

As shown therein, the most intense peaks, found at 738 and 807 cm<sup>â1</sup>, are assigned to the ring vibrations of the thymol. The peaks around 3400 cm<sup>â1 </sup>are assigned to hydrogen bonds, wherein free hydrogen bonds are narrower compared to peaks of bonded hydrogen bonds, and can be seen at higher wavelength (3580-3650 cm<sup>â1 </sup>and 3200-3550 cm<sup>â1</sup>, respectively). <figref>FIGS. 11-13</figref> depict the increase in hydrogen bond peaks at 3450 cm<sup>â1 </sup>as a result of thymol affinity to the polar polymers EVA9, EVA18, and EMA18. This peak was not found in <figref>FIG. 10</figref> (PE spectra with and without EO).</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0143">In <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, different polymers with EO spectra are shown. The hydrogen bonds peak, around 3450 cm<sup>â1</sup>, represents the interaction of thymol and the polymers. When comparing the copolymers EVA9 and EVA18, the main difference between them is the polar comonomer percentage. As the polar comonomer percentage increases the interaction between the polymer and the EO becomes stronger. In addition, when comparing two copolymers with different functional groups and the same percentage of polar comonomer group, i.e., EVA18 and EMA18, the functional group influences the degree of interaction of the polymer with the EO. The interaction between EVA18 and the EO is stronger than that of EMA18. As a result; as the outer layer polymer is more polar, the desorption rate is slower due to strong interactions.</p>

However, the type of interactions that might occur with the various polymers can differ, as can also be seen in <figref>FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. While polyethylene leads to dispersion forces based on Van der Waals interactions only, polar polymers like PMA and PVA can lead to interactions based on polar forces and even hydrogen bonds (as shown in the FTIR <figref>FIGS. 10-14</figref>), which are able to overcome the gap in solubility parameters of the components. According to Camacho et al., the solubility parameters of EVA with different vinyl acetate content are closer to the solubility parameters of pure vinyl acetate [8.99 (cal/cm<sup>3</sup>)<sup>0.5 </sup>@30Â° C.], as the vinyl acetate content increases. That means that when comparing the solubility parameters of EVA9 and EVA18, the solubility parameter of EVA18 is closer to the solubility parameter of PVA. That can explain the lower desorption rate properties of 3LEVA18 compared to 3LEVA9.</p>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="2">Thermal Properties</heading>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0149">Thermal properties of polymers with different crystallinity (MDPE, LLDPE, and VLDPE samples), were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), (<figref>FIGS. 17-19</figref>). A comparison was made between the neat polymer (green), a film comprising nano-clays (NCs) and an EO (blue), and a film comprising NCs without an EO (red). As shown in <figref>FIGS. 17-19</figref>, the EO has no effect on the polymer crystallization temperature (Tc). Clay particles may provide heterogeneous surface increasing the crystals nucleation rate. The interfacial interactions between the surface treatment of the NCs and the active polymer groups can reduce molecule mobility, lowering the crystal growing rate. In other words, the NC may act as nucleator, leading to a higher uniformity in polymer crystals shape, which is presented by a sharper melting peak.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0150">In the current study, Cloisite 15A-2M2HT: dimethyl, dehydrogenated tallow, the use of a quaternary ammonium organic modifier increased the possible interactions between the NC and the polymer molecules, affecting the crystal size and leading to a decrease in the spherulite extent. Further, the addition of NCs to MDPE and LLDPE affected the melting peak shape and crystallization peak shape from broad and small to narrow and sharp. In addition, the presence of NCs affects the melting temperature of the polymer, as presented in <figref>FIG. 20</figref>. Melting temperature of MDPE and LLDPE decreased in Ë4Â° C. as a result of NCs addition. In contrast, when adding NCs to VLDPE, the melting peak shape and melting temperature remained unchanged. From <figref>FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, it can be seen that the NC does not influence VLDPE crystallinity. Zhang et al. and Persico and Ambrogi studied the addition of the nanoclay Cloisite 20A to LLDPE and Nanomer 1.28 to LDPE, respectively, and concluded that no change in the melting temperature could be noticed. However in Dadbin et al. it was noted that the addition of the nanoparticles Nanolin DK4, to a blend of LLDPE/LDPE increased the melting temperature of the polymer. Apparently, the difference in melting temperature varies according to the polymer and NC studied.</p>
      <heading id="h-00025-en" level="2">Antimicrobial Activity of the Films</heading>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0151">The antimicrobial properties of the various thymol containing films were tested against <i>E. coli, </i>a common food-born bacterial pathogen. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>, when nonpolar polymers (VLD, LD, and MD) are present in the outer layer of multilayered film, the ability of the film to inhibit bacterial proliferation is relatively high; however, when polar polymers (EVA09, EVA18, and EMA) are present in the outer layer of the film, this ability decreased. These results can be correlated to the FTIR results that show that thymol forms hydrogen bond interactions with the polar groups of EVA and EMA, increasing the partition coefficient and leading to a low EO concentration in the headspace. This concentration is lower than the minimal concentration needed to inhibit bacterial proliferation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="2">Conclusions</heading>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0152">The influence of the crystallinity and polarity of polyethylene copolymers on the thermal stability and controlled release of thymol in single and multilayer antimicrobial films was studied. The films were prepared using a three stage melt compounding procedure, which included the addition of a foaming agent and a NC (Cloisite 15A). The antimicrobial active agent chosen was thymol. The study on the migration behavior of thymol from the different films revealed that the PE crystallinity has a considerable effect on desorption from the film surface when the oil is stored in the bulk of a single layer film structure. As the density of the polyethylene increased (higher degree of crystallinity), a higher thymol concentration was found in the film after processing. The thermal properties have shown that the partially exfoliated nano-clays dispersed in the polyethylene matrix, affect the polymer crystallization behavior. In MDPE and LLDPE, the NC addition affects both melting and crystallization peak shapes from broad and small to narrow and sharp, while in VLDPE no effect could be seen. In multilayer films the crystallinity (density) of the polyethylene showed no significant effect on desorption, even when the higher crystalline layer is the external layer of the multilayer film. Chemical affinity between a polar PE copolymer and thymol was observed through FTIR spectroscopy (hydrogen bonds). As a result of the strong interactions, the desorption rate of the EO from the film decreased; resulting in a decrease in the antimicrobial properties of the film. Interactions between the various polar polymers and thymol differed depending on the polymer and its polar group. The antimicrobial activity of the films could be related not only to the thymol concentration in the film, but also to the capability of the film to desorb EO molecules into the headspace. This understanding can enable the prediction of the potential antimicrobial film activity, based on measured desorption properties obtained by chromatography and spectroscopy techniques.</p>

      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0154">Different formulations were obtained using a three stage process for minimal loss of the active substance during melt processing: (i) master batch compounds (referred to herein also as concentrates) were produced by melt mixing in a EUROLAB Digital 16 (âPrismâ) twin screw co-rotating extruder (D=16 mm, L/D=24), using a uniform temperature profile of 200, 220,220,220,220 and 230Â° C. at the die, and operated at a screw speed of 250 rpm. The materials were physically mixed in a plastic bag, and were added to the extruder at the same upstream feed port. The melt compound strands were continuously cooled down to solidify under water at 23Â° C., which were then cut to granules with a granulating machine. Different concentrations of NCs and foaming agent were introduced into the polymer using a maleic anhydride based compatibilizer; (ii) the impregnation of thymol (the EO) into the foamed pellets was performed by mixing the pellets with the thymol in a closed tank at 70Â° C. for 24 hr. (iii) antimicrobial films were produced by dry mixing the EO containing master batches with neat LLDPE in MICROTRUDER (âRandCastleâ) Cast-film single screw extruder (D=13 mm, L/D=20), using a temperature profile of 200, 210, 220, 220, 220 and 230Â° C. at the die. The machine was operated at a screw speed of 70 rpm, to obtain film of 100 micron wall thickness and width of 150 mm. Samples without the active ingredient, i.e., the thymol, were also prepared and used as a control.</p>

      <heading id="h-00031-en" level="2">Quantitative Analysis of EO Concentration in the Film</heading>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0156">The amount of thymol in the samples was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy. The EO containing films were cut into small pieces and immersed in 2-propanol (1 ml 2-propanol for every 20 mg of film) for extraction. Thymol was then extracted by refluxing for 60 minutes. To 100 ml volumetric flasks containing 10 ml of a Standard Buffer Solution of Boric Acid+Potassium Chloride, 0.2 M, 1 ml of the extraction solution and 4 ml of 2-propanol were added. The solution was mixed and then, 1 ml of chloroimide solution (Gibbs reagent) was added. After gentle mixing the solution turned blue as a result of the chemical reaction between the thymol and the Gibbs reagent. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 15 minutes and then distilled water was added to the volumetric flasks making up a 100 ml solution. The absorbance of the various solutions was measured at X=590 nm, using a UV-visible 1650PC spectrophotometer, Shimadzu. The thymol content was calculated from a calibration curve.</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0157">The migration characterization was performed using two different techniques: (i) quantification of the extracted antimicrobial EO from the film by UV-visible spectroscopy (as detailed in section 2.3.1) and (ii) by headspace analysis, using an auto sampler headspace GC-MS to evaluate the time dependent migration of EO to the headspace of glass vials. The headspace was analyzed by gas chromatography using a Thermo GC-MS system (Finnigan Trace GC ultra, Finnigan Trace DSQ) equipped with HTA HT200H headspace auto sampler; RESTEK column, RTX-5MS Phase. Column length was 30 m, the inner diameter was 0.25 mm and the film thickness was 0.25 Î¼m. Each sample was held in the auto sampler conditioning oven for incubation in 40Â° C. for 2 min before 0.5 Î¼l was injected. The GC temperature profile was: initial temperature was 100Â° C., ramped to 200Â° C. at 15Â°/min for a total run time of 8.17 min. Helium was the mobile gas phase; the carrier constant flow was 0.7 ml/min, split flow was 10 ml/min, the split ratio was 14:1. MS transfer line was at 200Â° C. MS: ion source temp was 250Â° C., mass range was 30-650, scan mode was full scan, and scan per second was 2.5. The retention time of thymol was 4.96 minutes. 50 mm<sup>2 </sup>film samples were incubated in 20 ml headspace vials for 2 minutes at 40Â° C. before extraction. Quantitative analysis of EO was carried out using a calibration curve.</p>

      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0164">The antibacterial activity of the various films was evaluated and compared using <i>Escherichia coli </i>ATCC 8739 as the experimental model. <i>E. coli </i>bacteria were grown overnight in Nutrient Broth media (NB, Sigma) under shaking (250 rpm) at 37Â° C. On the following day, the overnight culture was diluted in a fresh NB medium to OD=0.1, which approximately corresponds to 10Ì8 colony forming units (CFU) per ml, and grown for 1.5 hours to allow the cells to enter a logarithmic state until OD=0.6 was reached. Then, the bacteria were diluted into NB 1% (1:100) to obtain a stock solution with a working concentration of 10Ì5 CFU/ml. 3 ml from the stock solution were taken into each well in a 6-well plate (DE-GROOTH). Each of the various films was laid on top of the well in a way that there was no direct contact between the film and the bacterial solution, thus the antibacterial activity if achieved would be due to the migration of the oil from the film to the bacterial solution through the headspace of the well. In light of the EO's evaporation, there was a separation between the films, thus each plate received one film and the empty wells were filled with an equal volume of water. The plates were then incubated on a shaker (100 rpm) at 37Â° C. for 20-24 h. On the day after and in order to determine the CFU in each treatment, serial dilutions were carried out and the cells were spotted onto NB agar plates. The NB plates were incubated at 37Â° C. for 20 h. Cell growth was monitored and determined by viable cell count.</p>

      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0166">The selection of the optimal NCs was performed after TGA analysis. The most significant factor is the interaction between the nano particles with the EO, which, in this study, was chosen to be thymol. Such interaction is related to the surface treatment affecting the chemical affinity between the different materials. TGA results can be used as an indication for the chemical affinity. In order to study the interactions between thymol and different surface treated NCs, samples were prepared by the mechanical mixing of thymol with NCs at a ratio of 50-50 at 70Â° C. in a closed container. The results shown in <figref>FIG. 22</figref> indicate the chemical affinity between the EO and the NC. While Cloisite Na (without surface treatment) does not affect the thymol's evaporation rate, Cloisite 15A, with a non-polar surface treatment (organic modifier of dimethyl, dihydrogenated tallow, quaternary ammonium) interacts with thymol, leading to a delay in the evaporation rate. Cloisite 30B (organic modifier of methyl, tallow, bis-2-hydroxyethyl, quaternary ammonium) also affects the thymol evaporation rate but is considered less appropriate due to the high polarity of its surface treatment, enabling a poor dispersion in polyethylene matrices.</p>
      <heading id="h-00043-en" level="2">Parallel Plate Rheometery</heading>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0167">The rheology of various polymer/NC systems was analyzed using a parallel plate rheometer. Storage modulus (Gâ²). vs. time or frequency was determined in order to estimate the degree of dispersion of NCs in the polymer matrix. Storage modulus (Gâ²) is a rheological function sensitive to the nano particles dispersion in the polymer matrix. It is assumed that better NCs dispersions could lead to enhanced diffusion of the EO in the polymer. Different combinations of a foaming agent, NC and EO were analyzed as a function of angular frequency. <figref>FIG. 23</figref> presents the results of storage modulus for samples with a fixed NC concentration (10 wt %). High values of Gâ² at lower frequencies are obtained for samples containing EO and a foaming agent, indicating a synergism between the two, leading probably, to better dispersion of NCs. <figref>FIG. 24</figref> presents the Gâ² values at a fixed frequency of 0.1987 rad/sec, as a function of the NC concentration. No significant difference is noticed for low NC concentrations. For high concentrations, agglomerates seem to be formed in the polymer matrix. According to Durmus et al., high Gâ² values at low frequencies indicate improved NC dispersions. Therefore, it can be concluded that the addition of a foaming agent together with the EO results in a better dispersion of the NC in the polymer matrix, leading to a solid-like behavior, which is confirmed by the increase of the Gâ² values.</p>
      <heading id="h-00044-en" level="2">Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM)</heading>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0168">The addition of NCs leads to a visible change in the morphology of the material. The porosity degree rises and the texture becomes coarser, as shown in <figref>FIG. 25</figref>. The films produced from a master batch containing a foaming agent present micro porosity. Films without the addition of an EO have shown NC agglomerates.</p>
      <heading id="h-00045-en" level="2">Wide Angle X-Ray Diffraction Analysis</heading>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0169">The ordered arrangement of the silicate layers of the NCs can be discerned from X-ray diffraction patterns. When polymer penetrates the clay inter-layers (intercalation) it results in an increase in interlayer spacing and a shift of XRD peaks toward lower angles. Partial or complete exfoliation of the ordered clay structure usually can be seen as a further shift to lower angles and a broadening or disappearance of the characteristic XRD peaks. As shown in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>, the addition of an EO to the master batch causes a decrease in the intensity of the peak, indicating an increase in the interlayer spacing of the NCs. According to Persico et al., the EO positively interacts with the NC, leading to a good dispersion of the EO into the clay galleries. As a result, the swelling of the NC stacks also promotes and enables a larger polymer/clay interfacial area. The higher path tortuosity obtained improves the barrier properties of the film and delays the release of the EO. According to the results exhibited in <figref>FIGS. 27 and 28</figref> it is concluded that the addition of a foaming agent to the master batch results in a decrease of the peak intensity and a broadening of the peak, indicating a possible expansion of the clay galleries. This probably occurred as a result of shear forces generated during the foaming. A synergistic effect between the foaming agent and the EO is presented, leading to better NC dispersion in the polymer matrix, improving the intimacy between the different components in the film.</p>
      <heading id="h-00046-en" level="2">Quantitative Analysis of EO Concentration in the Film</heading>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0170">The films were obtained using extrusion cast at 230Â° C. However, high temperature processing is known to cause significant loss of EO. Nonetheless, the presence of additives in the film has shown to significantly affect the degree of loss. When comparing films with different clay concentrations, it was found that as the clay content increased the loss of EO during processing decreased significantly. In addition, when the clay concentration was above 5 wt %, foaming the master batch by using a foaming agent increased the amount of EO absorbed and reduced its loss during processing. The initial concentration of the EO was 3 wt %. The final concentration depended on the interactions between the EO, the NCs and the polymer. An important factor that was considered was the solubility parameter of the blend components. The information regarding the solubility parameters was obtained from HSPiP (Hansen Solubility Parameters in Practice) software v4 (http://www.hansensolubility.com). The solubility parameters of the selected hydrophobic polymer, the EO and the NCs are as follows: Î´=8.16, 10.22, 9.125 (cal/cmÌ3)Ì0.5, respectively. When the solubility parameters of the blended components are similar, or, when the interactions between the components are strong enough to overcome the solubility parameters gap, the system will be miscible. The present system significantly delays the EO desorption from the antimicrobial film. This can lead to less antimicrobial activity since the EO may not diffuse out of the film. However, if the solubility parameters gap cannot be bridged, a noncompatible system will be obtained, and, the EO will quickly evaporate from the film. In order to obtain a controlled migration system, the solubility parameter gap should be low, leading to a compatible system. Results of the EO concentration in the film after processing are shown in Table VI and <figref>FIG. 29</figref>.</p>

      <heading id="h-00047-en" level="2">Migration Phenomenon</heading>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0171">Migration depends on the conditions in which the test is being performed and on the type of media it occurs in (different simulants, air, etc.). Volatile antimicrobial substances, such as EOs, may act on foods even without direct contact between the food and the package, due to the presence of EO molecules in the headspace of the package. For this reason it is of great importance to determine the kinetics of the migration to the headspace. If a film is inserted in an open container, the large osmotic pressure gradient will result in fast migration. However, when the film is stored in a closed container the migration rate will slow down until the equilibrium. Two different migration tests were performed. In the first test the amount of EO in films exposed to air for different periods of time, was measured, using extraction and colorimetric tests (<figref>FIG. 30</figref>). In the second test the amount of EO released to the headspace of a closed glass vial was evaluated by an auto sampler headspace GC-MS (<figref>FIG. 31</figref>). In this test the vials were kept at room temperature, and the samples were conditioned for 2 minutes at 40Â° C. prior to injection.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0172">A fast initial release is demonstrated in the results presented in <figref>FIG. 30</figref>. This phenomenon is typically referred to as âburst releaseâ. The burst release leads to a high initial active substance delivery, reducing the controlled release effectiveness.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0173">The presence of the NCs affects the EO migration kinetics, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>. The migration rate is reduced as the amount of the NC in the film increases. However, although the initial rate of migration depends on the NC concentration, the equilibrium concentration reached was the same for all tested samples. According to Helmroth, the migration prediction of a specific combination of migrant, polymer and food simulant can be obtained by the model parameter values: the diffusion coefficient (D), which represents the migration rate; and the partition coefficient (K), which represents the ratio of the migrant concentration in the film to the migrant concentration in the food simulant at equilibrium. When the diffusion coefficient decreases, the time to reach the equilibrium increases. The diffusion coefficient of three different films: NC1FAEO, NC5FAEO and NC10FAEO was calculated, using the equations below:</p>

The calculated diffusion coefficients in combination with the results presented in <figref>FIG. 31</figref> show that the change in the curve shape as well as the difference in diffusion coefficients results from the NC concentration in the different films. As the NC concentration in the film increases, the diffusion coefficient and the migration rate decrease.</p>
      <heading id="h-00048-en" level="2">Antibacterial Activity of the Films</heading>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0176">The antibacterial properties of the various films were tested against <i>E. coli, </i>a common food-born bacterial pathogen. As presented in <figref>FIG. 32</figref>, all of the films completely eradicated the bacteria except for NC10FAEO, which only caused partial elimination. This result can be explained by a strong interaction between the EO, the NCs and the foaming agent. The presence of the EO and a foaming agent in the NC10FAEO film aided in providing a better dispersion of the NC within the polymeric matrix; however, it also led to a better interaction between the EO and the NCs, which resulted in a lower antibacterial activity, since the EOs did not readily diffuse from the film into the product and therefore, the concentration of EO in the product was not sufficient to eliminate the bacteria completely.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0177">Upon review of the results it appeared that there was no difference between films containing increasing concentrations of NCs and films containing both NCs and a foaming agent, wherein all such films were successful in completely eliminating the bacteria. Therefore, it was decided to challenge the system by loading 10<sup>5 </sup>bacteria (the initial bacteria quantity) each day until the films fail to prevent bacterial growth.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0178">As presented in Table VII below, the NC1EO film managed to eliminate all of the bacteria only on the first day of the experiment, while films containing increased concentrations of NC (i.e. NC5EO and NC10EO) still retained their antibacterial activity. Moreover, films containing increasing concentrations of NCs with the addition of a foaming agent exerted a prolonged antibacterial activity in comparison to the ones containing NCs alone (Table VII), suggesting that the foaming agent aided in dispersing and exfoliating the NCs in the polymer matrix, increasing the interaction between the EO and the NCs. As a result, a controlled release of the EO was obtained. Nevertheless, in agreement with the results obtained and presented in <figref>FIG. 32</figref>, the NC10FAEO film was shown to be much less effective, further corroborating the assumption that the EO might be âlockedâ within the film.</p>

      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0179">To further establish that the addition of a foaming agent and NCs slows down the release of the EO into the head space of the well, and that the results obtained in Table VII are indeed due to a controlled release of the EO throughout the experiment period and not due to the higher amounts of EO in the films, the NC5EO and NC5FAEO films were treated with bacteria in the same manner as presented in <figref>FIG. 32</figref> and Table VII. The only exception was that following the first incubation, one plate for each film was replaced with a new cover plate and the film was removed (designated as ânewâ in the table) while a second plate was left with the film (designated as âsameâ in the table). Both NC5EO and NC5FAEO managed to cope with two bacterial loading cycles no matter whether the film was taken out after the first day of the experiment or not (Table VIII). After the third loading cycle, the ânewâ NC5EO failed to kill the bacteria while the âsameâ NC5EO provided only a 2log reduction compared to the control (Table VIII). This suggests that the NC5EO film did not maintain major amounts of EO within the film to provide a slow release advantage and it is likely that most of the EO was released to the medium in the first 24 h. However, for the NC5FAEO film a clear difference between the ânewâ NC5FAEO and the âsameâ NC5FAEO was observed on the fourth day, where the ânewâ film almost did not affect the tested bacteria (Ë1 log less than the control, i.e. untreated bacteria), while the âsameâ film still presented excellent antibacterial activity, eradicating all of the bacteria in the medium (Table VIII). This highlights that in the presence of the foaming agent the EO was still maintained in the film and not completely released in the first loading cycles. Taken together, the results provide evidence that the EO release was delayed by the addition of a foaming agent, which enhanced the interaction between the EO and the clays, culminating in a gradual oil-releasing system.</p>

      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0181">The thermal properties of three antimicrobial films were examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in order to evaluate the influence of the EO and/or NC on the thermal properties of the films, compared to neat polymer (LLDPE). The results are presented in Table X. As provided therein, the presence of the EO and/or NC caused the crystallization temperature (Tc) increased by 2-4Â° C. and the Tm decreased by 4-5Â° C., on average. The influence of the NCs on the crystallization temperature (Tc) may be caused by the effect of the NCs on the nucleation of the polymer matrix crystals. The clay can provide heterogeneous surface, increasing the crystals nucleation rate. The interfacial interactions between the surface treatment of the NCs and active groups of polymer chains can reduce molecule mobility, reducing the crystals growth rate. The addition of NCs to the polymer probably led to a crystallization mechanism characterized by a fast primary process during the initial stages and by a slower secondary process, resulting in a higher number of smaller crystals. According to Persico et al., the diffusional chain mobility promoted by the EO enhances the ability of the PE to be self nucleated, resulting in an increase of the Tc. At the same time, the plasticization effect of the EO can be observed in decreasing ÎHTm values, meaning that less energy is needed for breaking the crystalline arrangement.</p>

      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0182">Antimicrobial layered silicate nano composite films were prepared by a three stage melt compounding procedure of LLDPE in the presence of Cloisite 15A organo-modified MMT, Tracel 2201 (foaming agent) and thymol (EO). According to parallel plate and XRD results it was shown that the presence of thymol facilitates the organo-clay dispersion in the film; moreover, the incorporation of a foaming agent creates a synergistic effect leading to a better dispersion of the additives in the film. As a result of the improved dispersion of clays in the polymer matrix, as well as the improved chemical affinity between the nano composite and the EO, desorption of the EO was delayed and further, a controlled release thereof was obtained. Depending on the concentration of clays in the film, the desorption delay caused a decrease in the antimicrobial activity. It can be concluded that the antimicrobial activity of the films is related not only to the EO concentration in the film, but also to the ability of the film to desorb the EO to the headspace.</p>
