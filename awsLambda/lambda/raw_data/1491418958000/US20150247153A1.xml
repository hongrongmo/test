      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) are a group of copper-binding proteins, widely distributed phylogenetically from bacteria to mammals, that catalyze the oxidation of phenolics to quinones which produce brown pigments in wounded tissues. PPO has been implicated in the formation of pigments, oxygen scavanging and defense mechanism against plant pathogens and herbivorous insects. The oxidation of phenolic substrates by PPO is thought to be the major cause of browning coloration of many fruits and vegetables during ripening, handling, storage and processing. This problem is of considerable importance to the food industry as it affects the nutritional quality and appearance, reduces the consumer's acceptability and can therefore also cause significant economic impact, both to the food producers and to the food processing industry.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Provided herein are compositions and methods that provide for improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses that results from suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) expression. In certain embodiments, improved fruit and/or vegetable shelf life and reduced postharvest losses that results from suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) expression is obtained by topical applications of compositions comprising polynucleotides and transfer agents to plants. For the purpose of improved fruit and/or vegetable shelf life and reduced postharvest losses, the ability to control the timing of application so that Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes are suppressed only during desired times or conditions makes the compositions and methods provided herein particularly useful. Many crops will derive benefit from this method, including but not limited to, corn, wheat, rice, soybean, cotton, Canola, tomato, alfalfa, melon, lettuce, cucumber and broccoli.</p>

      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0039">Unless otherwise stated, nucleotide sequences in the text of this specification are given, when read from left to right, in the 5â² to 3â² direction. The nomenclature used herein is that required by Title 37 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations Â§1.822 and set forth in the tables in WIPO Standard ST.25 (1998), Appendix 2, Tables 1 and 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0040">As used herein, a âplant surfaceâ refers to any exterior portion of a plant. Plant surfaces thus include, but are not limited to, the surfaces of flowers, stems, tubers, fruit, anthers, pollen, leaves, roots, or seeds. A plant surface can be on a portion of a plant that is attached to other portions of a plant or on a portion of a plant that is detached from the plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0041">As used herein, the phrase âpolynucleotide is not operably linked to a promoterâ refers to a polynucleotide that is not covalently linked to a polynucleotide promoter sequence that is specifically recognized by either a DNA dependent RNA polymerase II protein or by a viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase in such a manner that the polynucleotide will be transcribed by the DNA dependent RNA polymerase II protein or viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide that is not operably linked to a promoter can be transcribed by a plant RNA dependent RNA polymerase.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0042">As used herein, any polynucleotides displayed in SEQ ID NO:24-295 or 3 in the form of ssDNA, encompass dsDNA equivalents, dsRNA equivalents, ssRNA equivalents, ssRNA complements, ssDNA as shown, and ssDNA complements.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0043">As used herein, a first nucleic-acid sequence is âoperablyâ connected or âlinkedâ with a second nucleic acid sequence when the first nucleic acid sequence is placed in a functional relationship with the second nucleic acid sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to an RNA and/or protein-coding sequence if the promoter provides for transcription or expression of the RNA or coding sequence. Generally, operably linked DNA sequences are contiguous and, where necessary to join two protein-coding regions, are in the same reading frame.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0044">As used herein, the phrase âorganosilicone preparationâ refers to a liquid comprising one or more organosilicone compounds, wherein the liquid or components contained therein, when combined with a polynucleotide in a composition that is topically applied to a target plant surface, enable the polynucleotide to enter a plant cell. Exemplary organosilicone preparations include, but are not limited to, preparations marketed under the trade names âSilwetÂ®â or âBREAK-THRUÂ®â and preparations provided in the following Table. In certain embodiments, an organosilicone preparation can enable a polynucleotide to enter a plant cell in a manner permitting a polynucleotide mediated suppression of target gene expression in the plant cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0045">As used herein, the phrases âimproved shelf life and reduced postharvest lossesâ or âimproving shelf life and reducing postharvest lossesâ refer to any measurable increase in shelf life or reduction in postharvest loss. In certain embodiments, an increase in shelf life or reduction in postharvest loss in a plant or plant part can be determined in a comparison to a control plant or plant part that has not been treated with a composition comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent. When used in this context, a control plant is a plant that has not undergone treatment with polynucleotide and a transfer agent. Such control plants would include, but are not limited to, untreated plants or mock treated plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0046">As used herein, the phrase âprovides for a reductionâ, when used in the context of a transcript or a protein in a plant or plant part, refers to any measurable decrease in the level of transcript or protein in a plant or plant part. In certain embodiments, a reduction of the level of a transcript or protein in a plant or plant part can be determined in a comparison to a control plant or plant part that has not been treated with a composition comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent. When used in this context, a control plant or plant part is a plant or plant part that has not undergone treatment with polynucleotide and a transfer agent. Such control plants or plant parts would include, but are not limited to, untreated or mock treated plants and plant parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0047">As used herein, the phrase âwherein said plant does not comprise a transgeneâ refers to a plant that lacks either a DNA molecule comprising a promoter that is operably linked to a polynucleotide or a recombinant viral vector.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0048">As used herein, the phrase âsuppressing expressionâ or âsuppressionâ, when used in the context of a gene, refers to any measurable decrease in the amount and/or activity of a product encoded by the gene. Thus, expression of a gene can be suppressed when there is a reduction in levels of a transcript from the gene, a reduction in levels of a protein encoded by the gene, a reduction in the activity of the transcript from the gene, a reduction in the activity of a protein encoded by the gene, any one of the preceding conditions, or any combination of the preceding conditions. In this context, the activity of a transcript includes, but is not limited to, its ability to be translated into a protein and/or to exert any RNA-mediated biologic or biochemical effect. In this context, the activity of a protein includes, but is not limited to, its ability to exert any protein-mediated biologic or biochemical effect. In certain embodiments, a suppression of gene expression in a plant or plant part can be determined in a comparison of gene product levels or activities in a treated plant to a control plant or plant part that has not been treated with a composition comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent. When used in this context, a control plant or plant part is a plant or plant part that has not undergone treatment with polynucleotide and a transfer agent. Such control plants or plant parts would include, but are not limited to, untreated or mock treated plants and plant parts.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0049">As used herein, the term âtranscriptâ corresponds to any RNA that is produced from a gene by the process of transcription. A transcript of a gene can thus comprise a primary transcription product which can contain introns or can comprise a mature RNA that lacks introns.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0050">As used herein, the term âliquidâ refers to both homogeneous mixtures such as solutions and non-homogeneous mixtures such as suspensions, colloids, micelles, and emulsions.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">II. Overview</heading>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0051">Provided herein are certain methods and polynucleotide compositions that can be applied to living plant cells/tissues to suppress expression of target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes and that provide improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses to a crop plant in need of the benefit. Also provided herein are plants and plant parts exhibiting improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses as well as processed products of such plants or plant parts. The compositions may be topically applied to the surface of a plant, such as to the surface of a leaf, and include a transfer agent. Aspects of the method can be applied to various crops, for example, including but not limited to: i) row crop plants including, but not limited to, corn, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beet, alfalfa, sugarcane, rice, and wheat; ii) vegetable plants including, but not limited to, tomato, potato, sweet pepper, hot pepper, melon, watermelon, cucumber, eggplant, cauliflower, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, onion, peas, carrots, sweet corn, Chinese cabbage, leek, fennel, pumpkin, squash or gourd, radish, Brussels sprouts, tomatillo, garden beans, dry beans, or okra; iii) culinary plants including, but not limited to, basil, parsley, coffee, or tea; iv) fruit plants including but not limited to apple, pear, cherry, peach, plum, apricot, banana, plantain, table grape, wine grape, citrus, avocado, mango, or berry; v) a tree grown for ornamental or commercial use, including, but not limited to, a fruit or nut tree; or, vi) an ornamental plant (e.g., an ornamental flowering plant or shrub or turf grass). The methods and compositions provided herein can also be applied to plants produced by a cutting, cloning, or grafting process (i.e., a plant not grown from a seed) that include fruit trees and plants. Fruit trees produced by such processes include, but are not limited to, citrus and apple trees. Plants produced by such processes include, but are not limited to, avocados, tomatoes, eggplant, cucumber, melons, watermelons, and grapes as well as various ornamental plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0052">Without being bound by theory, the compositions and methods of the present invention are believed to operate through one or more of the several natural cellular pathways involved in RNA-mediated gene suppression as generally described in Brodersen and Voinnet (2006), <i>Trends Genetics, </i>22:268-280; Tomari and Zamore (2005) <i>Genes </i>&amp; <i>Dev., </i>19:517-529; Vaucheret (2006) <i>Genes Dev., </i>20:759-771; Meins et al. (2005) <i>Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol., </i>21:297-318; and Jones-Rhoades et al. (2006) <i>Annu. Rev. Plant Biol., </i>57:19-53. RNA-mediated gene suppression generally involves a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediate that is formed intra-molecularly within a single RNA molecule or inter-molecularly between two RNA molecules. This longer dsRNA intermediate is processed by a ribonuclease of the RNAase III family (Dicer or Dicer-like ribonuclease) to one or more shorter double-stranded RNAs, one strand of which is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (âRISCâ). For example, the siRNA pathway involves the cleavage of a longer double-stranded RNA intermediate to small interfering RNAs (âsiRNAsâ). The size of siRNAs is believed to range from about 19 to about 25 base pairs, but the most common classes of siRNAs in plants include those containing 21 to 24 base pairs (See, Hamilton et al. (2002) <i>EMBO J., </i>21:4671-4679).</p>

In certain embodiments of the methods, the polynucleotides include double-stranded DNA formed by intramolecular hybridization, double-stranded DNA formed by intermolecular hybridization, double-stranded RNA formed by intramolecular hybridization, or double-stranded RNA formed by intermolecular hybridization. In certain embodiments where the polynucleotide is a dsRNA, the anti-sense strand will comprise at least 18 nucleotides that are essentially complementary to the target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene. In certain embodiments the polynucleotides include single-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA that self-hybridizes to form a hairpin structure having an at least partially double-stranded structure including at least one segment that will hybridize to RNA transcribed from the gene targeted for suppression. Not intending to be bound by any mechanism, it is believed that such polynucleotides are or will produce single-stranded RNA with at least one segment that will hybridize to RNA transcribed from the gene targeted for suppression. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides can be operably linked to a promoterâgenerally a promoter functional in a plant, for example, a pol II promoter, a pol III promoter, a pol IV promoter, or a pol V promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0056">The polynucleotide molecules of the present invention are designed to modulate expression by inducing regulation or suppression of an endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene in a plant and are designed to have a nucleotide sequence essentially identical or essentially complementary to the nucleotide sequence of an endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene of a plant or to the sequence of RNA transcribed from an endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene of a plant, which can be coding sequence or non-coding sequence. These effective polynucleotide molecules that modulate expression are referred to herein as âa trigger, or triggersâ. By âessentially identicalâ or âessentially complementaryâ it is meant that the trigger polynucleotides (or at least one strand of a double-stranded polynucleotide) have sufficient identity or complementarity to the endogenous gene or to the RNA transcribed from the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene (e.g., the transcript) to suppress expression of the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene (e.g., to effect a reduction in levels or activity of the gene transcript and/or encoded protein). In certain embodiments, the trigger polynucleotides provided herein can be directed to a Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) transgene present in the plant. Polynucleotides of the methods and compositions provided herein need not have 100 percent identity to a complementarity to the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene or to the RNA transcribed from the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene (i.e., the transcript) to suppress expression of the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene (i.e., to effect a reduction in levels or activity of the gene transcript or encoded protein). Thus, in certain embodiments, the polynucleotide or a portion thereof is designed to be essentially identical to, or essentially complementary to, a sequence of at least 18 or 19 contiguous nucleotides in either the target gene or messenger RNA transcribed from the target gene (e.g., the transcript). In certain embodiments, an âessentially identicalâ polynucleotide has 100 percent sequence identity or at least about 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent sequence identity when compared to the sequence of 18 or more contiguous nucleotides in either the endogenous target gene or to an RNA transcribed from the target gene (e.g., the transcript). In certain embodiments, an âessentially complementaryâ polynucleotide has 100 percent sequence complementarity or at least about 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent sequence complementarity when compared to the sequence of 18 or more contiguous nucleotides in either the target gene or RNA transcribed from the target gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0057">In certain embodiments, polynucleotides used in the methods and compositions provided herein can be essentially identical or essentially complementary to any of: i) conserved regions of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes of both monocot and dicot plants; ii) conserved regions of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes of monocot plants; or iii) conserved regions of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes of dicot plants. Such polynucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to such conserved regions can be used to improve shelf life and reduce postharvest losses by suppressing expression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes in various dicot and/or monocot plants.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0058">Polynucleotides containing mismatches to the target gene or transcript can thus be used in certain embodiments of the compositions and methods provided herein. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide can comprise at least 19 contiguous nucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to said gene or said transcript or comprises at least 19 contiguous nucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the target gene or target gene transcript. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of 19 continuous nucleotides that is essentially identical or essentially complementary to the endogenous target gene or to a RNA transcribed from the target gene (e.g., the transcript) can have 1 or 2 mismatches to the target gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of 20 or more nucleotides that contains a contiguous 19 nucleotide span of identity or complementarity to the endogenous target gene or to an RNA transcribed from the target gene can have 1 or 2 mismatches to the target gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of 21 continuous nucleotides that is essentially identical or essentially complementary to the endogenous target gene or to an RNA transcribed from the target gene (e.g., the transcript) can have 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the target gene or transcript. In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide of 22 or more nucleotides that contains a contiguous 21 nucleotide span of identity or complementarity to the endogenous target gene or to an RNA transcribed from the target gene can have 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the target gene or transcript. In designing polynucleotides with mismatches to an endogenous target gene or to an RNA transcribed from the target gene, mismatches of certain types and at certain positions that are more likely to be tolerated can be used. In certain exemplary embodiments, mismatches formed between adenine and cytosine or guanosine and uracil residues are used as described by Du et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 1671-1677. In certain exemplary embodiments, mismatches in 19 base pair overlap regions can be at the low tolerance positions 5, 7, 8 or 11 (from the 5â² end of a 19 nucleotide target) with well tolerated nucleotide mismatch residues, at medium tolerance positions 3, 4, and 12-17, and/or at the high tolerance nucleotide positions at either end of the region of complementarity (i.e., positions 1, 2, 18, and 19) as described by Du et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 2005, Vol. 33, No. 5 1671-1677. It is further anticipated that tolerated mismatches can be empirically determined in assays where the polynucleotide is applied to the plants via the methods provided herein and the treated plants assayed for suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression or appearance of improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses.</p>

In certain embodiments, methods of systemically suppressing expression of a gene in a plant, the methods comprising treating said plant with a composition comprising at least one polynucleotide and a transfer agent, wherein said polynucleotide comprises at least 18 or at least 19 contiguous nucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to a gene or a transcript encoding a Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene of the plant are provided, whereby expression of the gene in said plant or progeny thereof is systemically suppressed in comparison to a control plant that has not been treated with the composition.</p>

In another embodiment, the polynucleotide includes two or more copies of a nucleotide sequence (of 18 or more nucleotides) where the copies are arranged in inverted repeat fashion (forming an at least partially self-complementary strand). The polynucleotide can include both tandem and inverted-repeat copies. Whether arranged in tandem or inverted repeat fashion, each copy can be directly contiguous to the next, or pairs of copies can be separated by an optional spacer of one or more nucleotides. The optional spacer can be unrelated sequence (i.e., not essentially identical to or essentially complementary to the copies, nor essentially identical to, or essentially complementary to, a sequence of 18 or more contiguous nucleotides of the endogenous target gene or RNA transcribed from the endogenous target gene). Alternatively the optional spacer can include sequence that is complementary to a segment of the endogenous target gene adjacent to the segment that is targeted by the copies. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide includes two copies of a nucleotide sequence of between about 20 to about 30 nucleotides, where the two copies are separated by a spacer no longer than the length of the nucleotide sequence.</p>

Multiple gene target sequences can be aligned and polynucleotide sequence regions with homology in common are identified as potential trigger molecules for multiple targets. Multiple target sequences can be aligned and sequence regions with poor homology are identified as potential trigger molecules for selectively distinguishing targets. To selectively suppress a single gene, trigger sequences may be chosen from regions that are unique to the target gene either from the transcribed region or the non-coding regions, e.g., promoter regions, 3â² untranslated regions, introns and the like.</p>

These fragments are applied topically (as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA) to determine the relative effectiveness in providing the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses phenotype. Fragments providing the desired activity may be further subdivided into 50-60 polynucleotide fragments which are evaluated for providing the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses phenotype.

Treated plants that exhibit suppression of the Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene and/or exhibit an improvement in improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses are identified, thus identifying a preferred polynucleotide that improves improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses in a plant. Suppression of the Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene can be determined by any assay for the levels and/or activity of a Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene product (i.e., transcript or protein).

When a pool of polynucleotides provides for suppression of the Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene and/or an improvement in improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses are identified, the pool can be de-replicated and retested as necessary or desired to identify one or more preferred polynucleotide(s) that improve improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses in a plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0069">Methods of making polynucleotides are well known in the art. Such methods of making polynucleotides can include in vivo biosynthesis, in vitro enzymatic synthesis, or chemical synthesis. In certain embodiments, RNA molecules can be made by either in vivo or in vitro synthesis from DNA templates where a suitable promoter is operably linked to the polynucleotide and a suitable DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is provided. DNA-dependent RNA polymerases include, but are not limited to, <i>E. coli </i>or other bacterial RNA polymerases as well as the bacteriophage RNA polymerases such as the T7, T3, and SP6 RNA polymerases. Commercial preparation of oligonucleotides often provides two deoxyribonucleotides on the 3â² end of the sense strand. Long polynucleotide molecules can be synthesized from commercially available kits, for example, kits from Applied Biosystems/Ambion (Austin, Tex.) have DNA ligated on the 5â² end that encodes a bacteriophage T7 polymerase promoter that makes RNA strands that can be assembled into a dsRNA. Alternatively, dsRNA molecules can be produced from expression cassettes in bacterial cells that have regulated or deficient RNase III enzyme activity. Long polynucleotide molecules can also be assembled from multiple RNA or DNA fragments. In some embodiments design parameters such as Reynolds score (Reynolds et al. <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>22, 326-330 (2004) and Tuschl rules (Pei and Tuschl, Nature Methods 3(9): 670-676, 2006) are known in the art and are used in selecting polynucleotide sequences effective in gene silencing. In some embodiments random design or empirical selection of polynucleotide sequences is used in selecting polynucleotide sequences effective in gene silencing. In some embodiments the sequence of a polynucleotide is screened against the genomic DNA of the intended plant to minimize unintentional silencing of other genes.</p>

The concentrations can be adjusted in consideration of the volume of spray or treatment applied to plant leaves or other plant part surfaces, such as flower petals, stems, tubers, fruit, anthers, pollen, leaves, roots, or seeds. In one embodiment, a useful treatment for herbaceous plants using 25-mer polynucleotide molecules is about 1 nanomole (nmol) of polynucleotide molecules per plant, for example, from about 0.05 to 1 nmol polynucleotides per plant. Other embodiments for herbaceous plants include useful ranges of about 0.05 to about 100 nmol, or about 0.1 to about 20 nmol, or about 1 nmol to about 10 nmol of polynucleotides per plant. In certain embodiments, about 40 to about 50 nmol of a ssDNA polynucleotide is applied. In certain embodiments, about 0.5 nmol to about 2 nmol of a dsRNA is applied. In certain embodiments, a composition containing about 0.5 to about 2.0 mg/mL, or about 0.14 mg/mL of dsRNA or ssDNA (21-mer) is applied. In certain embodiments, a composition of about 0.5 to about 1.5 mg/mL of a long dsRNA polynucleotide (i.e., about 50 to about 200 or more nucleotides) is applied. In certain embodiments, about 1 nmol to about 5 nmol of a dsRNA is applied to a plant. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide composition as topically applied to the plant contains the at least one polynucleotide at a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10 milligrams per milliliter, or about 0.05 to about 2 milligrams per milliliter, or about 0.1 to about 2 milligrams per milliliter. Very large plants, trees, or vines may require correspondingly larger amounts of polynucleotides. When using long dsRNA molecules that can be processed into multiple oligonucleotides, lower concentrations can be used.

As used herein, a transfer agent is an agent that, when combined with a polynucleotide in a composition that is topically applied to a target plant surface, enables the polynucleotide to enter a plant cell. In certain embodiments, a transfer agent is an agent that conditions the surface of plant tissue, e.g., seeds, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, or fruits, to permeation by the polynucleotide molecules into plant cells. The transfer of polynucleotides into plant cells can be facilitated by the prior or contemporaneous application of a polynucleotide-transferring agent to the plant tissue. In some embodiments the transferring agent is applied subsequent to the application of the polynucleotide composition. The polynucleotide transfer agent enables a pathway for polynucleotides through cuticle wax barriers, stomata and/or cell wall or membrane barriers into plant cells. Suitable transfer agents to facilitate transfer of the polynucleotide into a plant cell include agents that increase permeability of the exterior of the plant or that increase permeability of plant cells to oligonucleotides or polynucleotides. Such agents to facilitate transfer of the composition into a plant cell include a chemical agent, or a physical agent, or combinations thereof. Chemical agents for conditioning or transfer include (a) surfactants, (b) an organic solvent or an aqueous solution or aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, (c) oxidizing agents, (d) acids, (e) bases, (f) oils, (g) enzymes, or combinations thereof. Embodiments of the method can optionally include an incubation step, a neutralization step (e.g., to neutralize an acid, base, or oxidizing agent, or to inactivate an enzyme), a rinsing step, or combinations thereof. Embodiments of agents or treatments for conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include emulsions, reverse emulsions, liposomes, and other micellar-like compositions. Embodiments of agents or treatments for conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include counter-ions or other molecules that are known to associate with nucleic acid molecules, e.g., inorganic ammonium ions, alkyl ammonium ions, lithium ions, polyamines such as spermine, spermidine, or putrescine, and other cations. Organic solvents useful in conditioning a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include DMSO, DMF, pyridine, N-pyrrolidine, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, dioxane, polypropylene glycol, other solvents miscible with water or that will dissolve phosphonucleotides in non-aqueous systems (such as is used in synthetic reactions). Naturally derived or synthetic oils with or without surfactants or emulsifiers can be used, e.g., plant-sourced oils, crop oils (such as those listed in the 9<sup>th </sup>Compendium of Herbicide Adjuvants, publicly available on the worldwide web (internet) at herbicide.adjuvants.com can be used, e.g., paraffinic oils, polyol fatty acid esters, or oils with short-chain molecules modified with amides or polyamines such as polyethyleneimine or N-pyrrolidine.

In certain embodiments, the second polynucleotide does not comprise a polynucleotide that is essentially identical or essentially complementary to a transcript encoding a protein of a target plant that confers resistance to said herbicidal molecule. Thus, in an exemplary and non-limiting embodiment, the second polynucleotide could be essentially identical or essentially complementary to a transcript encoding a protein that confers resistance to a herbicide in a weed (such as an EPSPS encoding transcript) but would not be essentially identical or essentially complementary to a transcript encoding a protein that confers resistance to that same herbicide in a crop plant.</p>

      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0090">An aspect of the invention provides a method for modulating expression of an Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene in a plant including (a) conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides and (b) treatment of the plant with the polynucleotide molecules, wherein the polynucleotide molecules include at least one segment of 18 or more contiguous nucleotides cloned from or otherwise identified from the target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene in either anti-sense or sense orientation, whereby the polynucleotide molecules permeate the interior of the plant and induce modulation of the target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene. The conditioning and polynucleotide application can be performed separately or in a single step. When the conditioning and polynucleotide application are performed in separate steps, the conditioning can precede or can follow the polynucleotide application within minutes, hours, or days. In some embodiments more than one conditioning step or more than one polynucleotide molecule application can be performed on the same plant. In embodiments of the method, the segment can be cloned or identified from (a) coding (protein-encoding), (b) non-coding (promoter and other gene related molecules), or (c) both coding and non-coding parts of the target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene. Non-coding parts include DNA, such as promoter regions or the RNA transcribed by the DNA that provide RNA regulatory molecules, including but not limited to: introns, 5â² or 3â² untranslated regions, and microRNAs (miRNA), trans-acting siRNAs, natural anti-sense siRNAs, and other small RNAs with regulatory function or RNAs having structural or enzymatic function including but not limited to: ribozymes, ribosomal RNAs, t-RNAs, aptamers, and riboswitches. In certain embodiments where the polynucleotide used in the composition comprises a promoter sequence essentially identical to, or essentially complementary to at least 18 contiguous nucleotides of the promoter of the endogenous target Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene, the promoter sequence of the polynucleotide is not operably linked to another sequence that is transcribed from the promoter sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0091">Compositions comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent provided herein can be topically applied to a plant or plant part by any convenient method, e.g., spraying or coating with a powder, or with a liquid composition comprising any of an emulsion, suspension, or solution. Such topically applied sprays or coatings can be of either all or of any a portion of the surface of the plant or plant part. Similarly, the compositions comprising a transfer agent or other pre-treatment can in certain embodiments be applied to the plant or plant part by any convenient method, e.g., spraying or wiping a solution, emulsion, or suspension. Compositions comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent provided herein can be topically applied to plant parts that include, but are not limited to, flowers, stems, tubers, meristems, ovules, fruit, anthers, pollen, leaves, roots, or seeds.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0092">Application of compositions comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent to seeds is specifically provided herein. Seeds can be contacted with such compositions by spraying, misting, immersion, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0093">In certain embodiments, application of compositions comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent to plants, plant parts, or seeds in particular can provide for the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses in progeny plants, plant parts, or seeds derived from those treated plants, plant parts, or seeds. In certain embodiments, progeny plants, plant parts, or seeds derived from those treated plants, plant parts, or seeds will exhibit improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses that result from suppressing expression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene. In certain embodiments, the methods and compositions provided herein can provide for improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses in progeny plants or seeds as a result of epigenetically inherited suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression. In certain embodiments, such progeny plants exhibit improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses from epigenetically inherited suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression that is not caused by a transgene where the polynucleotide is operably linked to a promoter, a viral vector, or a copy of the polynucleotide that is integrated into a non-native location in the chromosomal DNA of the plant. Without seeking to be limited by theory, progeny plants or seeds derived from those treated plants, plant parts, or seeds can exhibit an improvement in improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses through an epigenetic mechanism that provides for propagation of an epigenetic condition where suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression occurs in the progeny plants, plant parts, or plant seeds. In certain embodiments, progeny plants or seeds exhibiting improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses as a result of epigenetically inherited suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression can also exhibit increased methylation, and in particular, increased methylation of cytosine residues, in the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene of the plant. Plant parts, including seeds, of the progeny plants that exhibit improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses as a result of epigenetically inherited suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression, can also in certain embodiments exhibit increased methylation, and in particular, increased methylation of cytosine residues, in the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene. In certain embodiments, DNA methylation levels in DNA encoding the endogenous Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene can be compared in plants that exhibit the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses and control plants that do not exhibit the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses to correlate the presence of the improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses to epigenetically inherited suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression and to identify plants that comprise the epigenetically inherited improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0094">Various methods of spraying compositions on plants or plant parts can be used to topically apply to a plant surface a composition comprising a polynucleotide that comprises a transfer agent. In the field, a composition can be applied with a boom that extends over the crops and delivers the composition to the surface of the plants or with a boomless sprayer that distributes a composition across a wide area. Agricultural sprayers adapted for directional, broadcast, or banded spraying can also be used in certain embodiments. Sprayers adapted for spraying particular parts of plants including, but not limited to, leaves, the undersides of leaves, flowers, stems, male reproductive organs such as tassels, meristems, pollen, ovules, and the like can also be used. Compositions can also be delivered aerially, such as by a crop dusting airplane. In certain embodiments, the spray can be delivered with a pressurized backpack sprayer calibrated to deliver the appropriate rate of the composition. In certain embodiments, such a backpack sprayer is a carbon dioxide pressurized sprayer with a 11015 flat fan or equivalent spray nozzle with a customized single nozzle assembly (to minimize waste) at a spray pressure of about 0.25 MPa and/or any single nozzle sprayer providing an effective spray swath of 60 cm above the canopy of 3 to 12 inch tall growing plants can be used. Plants in a greenhouse or growth chamber can be treated using a track sprayer or laboratory sprayer with a 11001XR or equivalent spray nozzle to deliver the sample solution at a determined rate. An exemplary and non-limiting rate is about 140 L/ha at about 0.25 MPa pressure.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0095">In certain embodiments, it is also contemplated that a plant part can be sprayed with the composition comprising a polynucleotide that comprises a transfer agent. Such plant parts can be sprayed either pre- or post-harvest to provide improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses in the plant part that results from suppression of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene expression. Compositions can be topically applied to plant parts attached to a plant by a spray as previously described. Compositions can be topically applied to plant parts that are detached from a plant by a spray as previously described or by an alternative method. Alternative methods for applying compositions to detached parts include, but are not limited to, passing the plant parts through a spray by a conveyor belt or trough, or immersing the plant parts in the composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0096">Compositions comprising polynucleotides and transfer agents can be applied to plants or plant parts at one or more developmental stages as desired and/or as needed. Application of compositions to pre-germination seeds and/or to post-germination seedlings is provided in certain embodiments. Seeds can be treated with polynucleotide compositions provided herein by methods including, but not limited to, spraying, immersion, or any process that provides for coating, imbibition, and/or uptake of the polynucleotide composition by the seed. Seeds can be treated with polynucleotide compositions using seed batch treatment systems or continuous flow treatment systems. Seed coating systems are at least described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,582,516, 5,891,246, 4,079,696, and 4,023,525. Seed treatment can also be effected in laboratory or commercial scale treatment equipment such as a tumbler, a mixer, or a pan granulator. A polynucleotide composition used to treat seeds can contain one or more other desirable components including, but not limited to liquid diluents, binders to serve as a matrix for the polynucleotide, fillers for protecting the seeds during stress conditions, and plasticizers to improve flexibility, adhesion and/or spreadability of the coating. In addition, for oily polynucleotide compositions containing little or no filler, drying agents such as calcium carbonate, kaolin or bentonite clay, perlite, diatomaceous earth or any other adsorbent material can be added. Use of such components in seed treatments is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,876,739. Additional ingredients can be incorporated into the polynucleotide compositions used in seed treatments. Such ingredients include but are not limited to: conventional sticking agents, dispersing agents such as methylcellulose (Methocel A15LV or Methocel A15C, for example, serve as combined dispersant/sticking agents for use in seed treatments), polyvinyl alcohol (e.g., Elvanol 51-05), lecithin (e.g., Yelkinol P), polymeric dispersants (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone/vinyl acetate PVPNA S-630), thickeners (e.g., clay thickeners such as Van Gel B to improve viscosity and reduce settling of particle suspensions), emulsion stabilizers, surfactants, antifreeze compounds (e.g., urea), dyes, colorants, and the like that can be combined with compositions comprising a polynucleotide and a transfer agent. Further ingredients used in compositions that can be applied to seeds can be found in McCutcheon's, vol. 1, âEmulsifiers and Detergents,â MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock, N.J., U.S.A., 1996 and in McCutcheon's, vol. 2, âFunctional Materials,â MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock, N.J., U.S.A., 1996. Methods of applying compositions to seeds and pesticidal compositions that can be used to treat seeds are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20080092256, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

The SEQ ID NOS:24-295 describe polynucleotide sequences from a variety of dicot and monocot plants as indicated that are useful for downregulating Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) expression using methods described here. The SEQ ID NO:24-295 SEQ ID NOS: describe polynucleotide sequences that can be applied to plants as ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA, dsRNA, and/or as DNA/RNA hybrids to provide for improved shelf life and reduced post-harvest losses. Subfragments of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides of the SEQ ID NOS:61-334 polynucleotide sequences can also be applied to plants as ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA, dsRNA, and/or as DNA/RNA hybrids to provide for improved shelf life and reduced postharvest losses. Other regions of Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes can also be targeted to modify expression including the use of antisense DNA oligonucleotides against coding regions and/or targeting promoter regions using sense/antisense dsRNA, sense or antisense ssDNA as well as sense/antisense double stranded DNA. For example, a polynucleotide that comprises at least 18 contiguous nucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to any of the SEQ ID NO:1-23 PPO genes can be used to downregulate expression of those Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) genes.</p>

      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0101">A method for testing the entire sequence of each gene for selecting effective trigger molecules is described. Polynucleotides fragments are designed to cover the full length coding and untranslated regions of the gene in SEQ ID NO:1-23 as full-length sequences or as contiguous overlapping fragments of 200-300 bases length. These fragments are applied topically as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA to determine the relative effectiveness in providing the trait phenotype. Fragments providing the desired activity are further subdivided into 50-60 polynucleotide fragments which are evaluated for providing the trait phenotype. The 50-60 base fragments with the desired activity are subdivided into 19-30 base fragments which are evaluated for providing the trait phenotype. Fragments are tested singly, or in combination in one or more pools to determine effective trigger formulations for generation of the trait phenotype. Exemplary triggers developed in this manner are provided herewith in SEQ ID NO:24-295.</p>

      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0102">Triggers can also be developed to simultaneously suppress multiple Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene family members by alignment of coding and/or non-coding sequences of gene families in the crop of interest (SEQ ID NO:1-23), and choosing 200-300 base fragments from the most similar regions of the aligned sequences for evaluation in the topical application method (as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA) to determine their relative effectiveness in inducing the trait phenotype. The effective segments are subdivided into 50-60 base fragments, prioritized by greatest similarity, and re-evaluated in a topical application method. The effective 50-60 base fragments are subdivided into 19-30 base fragments, prioritized by greatest similarity, and again evaluated for induction of the trait/benefit phenotype. Once relative effectiveness is determined, the fragments may be utilized singly, or in combination with one or more other fragments to determine the trigger formulation for providing the trait phenotype. SEQ ID NO:296-303 provides some conserved PPO trigger sequences.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0117">The effect of compositions comprising triggers targeting PPO8 or pooled PPO9, PPO10 and PPO11 triggers on browning of field-grown Romaine lettuce (<i>Lactuca sativa</i>, SVR3606) was assayed.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0118">An eight by eight plot of SVR3606 was over seeded and then thinned to two rows of 10 plants in a single bed so that each plot contained 20 plants. The experiment design was a randomized complete block (RCB) design (9 blocks and 5 plots per block) with a single factor (Treatment) tested per block. See <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, where the numbers in the blocks represent the treatment (1-5 as outlined below) applied. With the exception of the untreated control plants, the treatment compositions were applied to the plants at the 4-5 leaf stage using a 2-step process. First, two leaves per plant were marked with puff paint (for future identification) then a solution of 0.1% (vol/vol) Silwet L-77 was applied evenly across each leaf with a paint brush. The pretreated leaves were allowed to dry for approximately 15 minutes before applying a 1Ã treatment solution, as described (Treatments 2-5) below: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>Treatment 1 (Null): Untreated control.

      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0124">The plants were grown to maturity, at which time; eight (8) market mature heads were harvested from each block by trained field workers by cutting at the base. Heads affected by big-vein virus or other defects were not be sampled. Lettuce heads were pooled within a single designated block and were placed into white bags (three heads/bag) for transport to the locations where the heads were processed and evaluated for shelf-life by (1) visual inspection and (2) image analysis. The total number of lettuce heads delivered in this study: 8 heads/treatmentÃ5 treatments/blockÃ9 blocks=360 heads. Transportation was kept to within 4 hours from time of harvest and the samples were transferred to a cold room kept at 4-7Â° C. for 12-24 hours prior to processing.</p>
      <heading id="h-00034-en" level="2">Shelf Life Evaluation</heading>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0125">The lettuce heads were removed from their bags and any exterior leaves that showed damage were removed before processing (usually 5-7 leaves/head). Individual leaves were then removed by slicing from the bottom of the plant until the inner heart section was reached. The color of the leaves changed from a dark green on the outside of the head transitioning to a light lime green color for interior leaves. Leaves with a light green color were not included in the shelf-life evaluation. The total number of leaves collected ranged from 18-20 leaves per head. Excess leafy material was removed around the midrib leaving midrib pieces that were 1 inch in length and 2-3 inches wide. The chopped leaves were washed in ice cold de-ionized water for approximately 5-10 seconds and dried in a salad spinner. For each designated plot, 200-250 grams of dried leaves were placed into a 32 oz. clear plastic deli container, commonly referred to as a clamshell (Genpak, Glen Falls, N.Y. cat# AD32F). Processed lettuce samples were stored at 4Â° C. for 5-7 days and monitored daily for signs of discoloration. When approximately 50% of the clamshells showed browning, the lettuce leaves were scored for discoloration. See <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, which shows examples of âdiscoloredâ and âgreenâ leaves.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0126">For the visual assay, browning was quantified by dividing the number of discolored lettuce pieces by total number of counted pieces to give the percentage of discolored leaves. The two positive test applications (asDNA PPO 9,10, 11 and dsRNA PPO 9,10,11) were compared to the 3 negative controls (null, buffer, and PPO8). After the clamshells were scored visually, the lettuce was spread out in a black tray and photographed using an imaging station at three different time points, Day 5, 7 and 9. Image analysis software quantified the number of discolored vs green pixels in the imaged lettuce pieces. Statistical analyses of the image data was performed using established methods. The mean component values of each treatment were compared to the performance of the control and null treatments for statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05).</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0127">The ANOVA results of the shelf-life evaluation of individual heads processed by chopping indicate a trend in decreased discoloration for the plants treated with ssDNA oligonucleotides to PPO9,10 and 11 (Table 5 and <figref>FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
