    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention relates to footwear and, particularly, footwear for any of various sports and/or for hiking. More particularly, footwear of the invention include those having a double upper, in the sense that the upper includes an outer envelope and an inner envelope. Footwear of this type can include athletic footwear for use in fields such as hiking, racing on flat or mountainous terrain, skateboarding, ball-playing sports, cross-country or telemark skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">For the intended use, each article of footwear, i.e., each boot or shoe (hereafter, âshoeâ for convenience), must have a certain flexibility and a good damping capability. Flexibility must be understood as the ability to closely follow certain deformations of the foot. This involves, for example, enabling good foot rolling movement when walking. Damping serves to reduce, or even prevent, fatigue or injuries that can result from supports or impacts on the ground, or from various forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A shoe must also fulfill a variety of functions, sometimes contradictory, such as ensuring adequate support and/or tightening of the foot, while also providing it with satisfactory comfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Thus, it is known to manufacture shoes as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. These two figures illustrate, in total and partial transverse cross section, respectively, an outer sole assembly <b>2</b> and an upper <b>3</b>. The upper includes a first envelope <b>4</b> and a second envelope <b>5</b>, both being adapted to cover the foot directly or indirectly. The first envelope <b>4</b> is associated with a first lasting sole <b>6</b> to form a first fitting element <b>7</b>. The second envelope <b>5</b> is associated with a second lasting sole <b>8</b> to form a second fitting element <b>9</b>, the latter being mounted inside the first fitting element <b>7</b>. The second fitting element <b>9</b> is typically a slipper, i.e., a liner. Consequently, the lasting soles <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> are part of an inner sole assembly <b>10</b>. The first envelope <b>4</b> of the shoe <b>1</b> extends in the area of a lateral side <b>11</b> and a medial side <b>12</b>, as well as in the area of a substantial portion of the first lasting sole <b>6</b>. This structure is conventional, because the first envelope <b>4</b> is mounted upon the lasting sole <b>6</b> by means of an adhesive, or cement, layer <b>13</b>. The sole <b>6</b> is relatively rigid in order to withstand the assembly process, also referred to as the lasting process. The adhesive process is carried by pulling the envelope <b>4</b> so as to press it flat upon the sole <b>6</b>, a last being inserted in the fitting element <b>7</b>. This is referred to as the conventional lasting. This makes it possible to exert sufficient pressure while the adhesive is being heated in order to obtain the first fitting element <b>7</b>. The second fitting element <b>9</b> is obtained, for example, by affixing the second envelope <b>5</b> to the second lasting sole <b>8</b> using stitching <b>14</b>. This is referred to as strobel lasting. The sole <b>8</b>, which is flexible and can be stitched, is called the strobel sole. Alternatively, a molded, unitary structure, or any equivalent, could be provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It is to be understood that the first fitting element <b>7</b> is adapted to ensure support and tightening of the foot, while the second fitting element <b>9</b> fulfills other functions, such as providing a certain comfort. In addition, the first fitting element <b>7</b> is affixed to the outer sole assembly <b>2</b> via an adhesive layer <b>15</b>. In the end, the shoe <b>1</b> according to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> has a certain flexibility and a certain damping capability.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Generally speaking, flexible shoes provided with two fitting elements according to the prior art have the following disadvantage: they still hinder the foot rolling movement, at least partially, due to the rigid lasting board, especially for racing; and the transmission of supports, impacts, and other forces is overly intense. In other words, known shoes lack flexibility, and their damping capability is insufficient, because the folded portion of the envelope <b>4</b>, associated with the adhesive layer <b>13</b>, creates an extra thickness that increases the rigidity of the shoe.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another disadvantage is that of thermal insulation. Indeed, under difficult conditions of use, such as walking in snow, the user's feet can become cold. This is due to the formation of a thermal bridge at the junction between the upper and the outer sole assembly, such bridge being created by the crushing of the material during the conventional lasting operation. Indeed, during this operation, it is necessary to heat and pull very hard on the constituent materials of the envelope <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Another disadvantage is that of the conventional lasting, rendering the manufacturing process difficult. Indeed, adhesively positioning of an envelope on a lasting sole is a relatively difficult process. Powerful and precise machines are necessary for pulling, positioning, and gluing the envelope.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Another disadvantage inherent in certain known flexible shoes, is the poor positional stability of the second fitting element in the first. For example, removing the foot sometimes causes an undesired displacement of the second element with respect to the first.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In view of the preceding, the invention provides an improved article of footwear, such as a shoe or a boot. In particular, the invention facilitates the rolling movement of the foot in an article of footwear provided with a plurality of fitting elements, and improves its damping capability.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The invention also guarantees the positional stability of one fitting element with respect to the other.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The invention also provides good thermal insulation, in particular at the junction between the upper and the outer sole assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The invention also simplifies the shoe manufacturing process, and lowers the production costs.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">To this end, the invention is directed to an article of footwear that includes a sole assembly and an upper, the article of footwear extending lengthwise from a rear end to a front end, widthwise between a lateral side and a medial side, and heightwise from the sole assembly up to an upper end, the article of footwear including a first fitting element as well as a second fitting element.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The first fitting element of the article of footwear according to the invention furthermore includes a first envelope and a first sole of the strobel type, the first envelope being affixed to the first strobel sole at least by means of stitching, and the second fitting element includes a second envelope and a second sole of the strobel type, the second envelope being fixed to the second strobel sole by means of at least stitching.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Using stitching to affix an envelope and a strobel sole preserves the structure of these elements. This means in particular that the envelopes and the strobel soles are not, or are only slightly, stretched, compressed, or modified overall during manufacture. Thus, for example, the thickness of an envelope or of a strobel sole remains uniform, or substantially uniform, along its entire surface. Also, the stitching technique involves using a sole of the strobel type, which is more flexible than it would be with the adhesive technique. Indeed, in this latter case, a lasting sole is structured to withstand the pressures from applying and adhering the envelope on the sole, as well as keeps the envelope in place after the adhesion. These constraints are inexistent in the footwear of the invention, which provides greater flexibility to the lower portion of the upper and/or the sole assembly than in an article of footwear according to the prior art. The strobel soles, which can be stitched, are made out of flexible and/or damping materials. Consequently, the greater flexibility of the shoe of the invention enables a better dissipation of the energy related to impulses, impacts, and various forces.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The resulting advantages include better foot rolling movement and, overall, better damping.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">A good positional stability of the second fitting element in the first is also noted. Indeed, the stitching technique makes it possible to use precise patterns, thus providing the fitting elements with precise configurations. Therefore, it is easy to provide an adjustment without play and constraint of the second element in the first. One of the resulting advantages is a better foot support in the upper.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The article of footwear according to the invention has a better thermal insulation, in particular at the junction between the upper and the outer sole assembly. This results from preserving the constituent materials of the envelopes and/or of the strobel soles. This preservation results from using the stitching technique. It is not necessary to stretch or heat the materials. The technique of the invention simplifies and lowers the cost of the manufacturing process for the article of footwear.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The first embodiment, which is described hereinafter, relates by way of example to articles of footwear, such as boots or shoes, for walking or hiking on hard ground or in snow, or with regard to other surfaces. The invention relates to footwear particularly for use in other fields of endeavor and for various purposes, such as those mentioned above. Although reference to shoes and boots is made herein, such terms are not to be construed as a limitation on the types of footwear that are encompassed by the invention. As one example, footwear having various types of uppers are embraced by the invention, such as footwear having low uppers, high uppers, and mid-uppers.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A first embodiment is described hereinafter with reference to <figref>FIGS. 3 to 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a hiking boot <b>21</b> is adapted to receive the foot of a wearer. In a known fashion, the boot <b>21</b> includes an outer sole assembly <b>22</b> and an upper <b>23</b> arranged on the sole assembly. The boot extends lengthwise, along a longitudinal direction L, between a rear end, or heel <b>24</b>, and a front end, or tip <b>25</b>; and widthwise, along a transverse direction W, between a lateral side <b>26</b> and a medial side <b>27</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As shown, the upper <b>23</b> includes a lower portion <b>30</b>, adapted to surround the foot, as well as an upper portion <b>31</b>, adapted to surround the ankle and possibly the lower leg. However, as described below, the invention also encompasses footwear having only the low portion, i.e., an article of footwear, or shoe, having a low upper, i.e., an upper having an upper edge that extends below the ankle of the wearer. In addition, the invention encompasses footwear having a mid-upper, i.e., an upper having an upper edge that extends at the ankle, or substantially at the ankle.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">According to the first illustrated embodiment, the boot <b>21</b> extends heightwise from the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> to an upper end <b>32</b>, or collar, i.e., up to the free end of the upper portion <b>31</b> of the boot or of the upper <b>23</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The boot <b>21</b> is structured to allow good foot rolling movement when walking, transmissions of sensory information and impulse forces for supports or jump landings. For this reason, the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> and the upper <b>23</b> are relatively flexible.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The boot <b>21</b> further includes a first tightening device <b>35</b>, adapted to reversibly tighten the upper <b>23</b>, i.e., selectively both to tighten the upper and to loosen the forces of the upper relative to the foot therewithin. The tightening device <b>35</b> is not described further here as it is well-known to the one of ordinary skill in the art. It is however noted, still within the scope of the invention, that the boot <b>21</b> can be provided with a different tightening device or not to include a tightening device. In the latter case, the upper <b>23</b> is continuous from the lateral side <b>26</b> to the medial side <b>27</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As can be understood from <figref>FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, in particular, the boot <b>21</b> includes a first fitting element <b>41</b>, as well as a second fitting element <b>42</b>. Explained further below, the first fitting element <b>41</b> is an external element, directly exposed to possible contact with objects and obstacles. The first tightening device <b>35</b> is in fact arranged on the first fitting element <b>41</b>. The second fitting element <b>42</b> is an internal element, adapted to be inserted within the first element <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">According to the invention, the first fitting element <b>41</b> includes a first envelope <b>43</b> and a first sole <b>44</b> of the strobel type, the first envelope <b>43</b>, in an edge area, that is, an area of the bottom extremity, being fixed to the first strobel sole <b>44</b> by an arrangement, or connection, that includes stitching <b>45</b> extending along the periphery of the first strobel sole. The second fitting element <b>42</b> includes a second envelope <b>46</b> and a second sole <b>47</b> of the strobel type, the second envelope <b>46</b>, in an edge area, that is, an area of the bottom extremity, being fixed to the second strobel sole <b>47</b> by an arrangement, or connection, that includes stitching <b>48</b> extending along the periphery of the second strobel sole.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">With respect to the terms employed, a rigorous respect for tradition requires reference to first and second strobel soles <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, designated as such because they are adapted to be sewn to the envelopes <b>43</b>, <b>46</b>, respectively. For convenience of this description, reference will be simply made to the first strobel <b>44</b> and the second strobel <b>47</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The stitching <b>45</b> between the first envelope <b>43</b> and the first strobel <b>44</b> provides the first fitting element <b>41</b> with great flexibility. This means that the flexibility of the first element <b>41</b> is greater than it would be with the conventional adhesive lasting technique. The second fitting element <b>42</b> is also very flexible, because it is also constructed using a technique other than the adhesive lasting technique. Consequently, the shoe <b>21</b> has great flexibility, in particular in the area of the junction between the upper <b>23</b> and the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. As a result, foot rolling movement when walking or running is facilitated.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The aforementioned advantage is obtained with envelopes <b>43</b>, <b>46</b> having a generally known structure. In this regard, the first envelope <b>43</b>, although illustratively simplified, includes one or more layers, that is, a plurality of layers, depending upon the application. For example, the first envelope <b>43</b> includes an outer layer, a core, an inner layer, and an inner lining. Similarly, the second envelope <b>46</b> includes one or more layers. For example, the second envelope <b>46</b> includes an insulating foam layer, or a waterproof membrane, or a combination of both. Stitching if made on a waterproof membrane, can be covered by a substance or a strip adapted to block the holes made during the stitching. Consequently, the upper <b>23</b> includes at least two envelopes <b>43</b>, <b>46</b> having different mechanical and physical properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The boot <b>21</b> includes an inner sole assembly <b>55</b>, which includes the first strobel <b>44</b> and second strobel <b>47</b>. The inner sole assembly <b>55</b> can be provided to further include an insole, not shown. Such further insole would be in contact with the foot, inasmuch as it would be positioned within the second fitting element <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Taking into account all of the components, the shoe <b>21</b> includes a complete sole assembly <b>56</b> comprised of the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> and the inner sole assembly <b>55</b>. Given that the first fitting element <b>41</b> calls for the stitching technique, the first strobel <b>44</b> selected is very flexible with respect to the lasting sole used in the conventional adhesive lasting. This flexibility enables a stitch to be made. This is the reason why the complete sole assembly <b>56</b> according to the invention is more flexible than a complete sole assembly according to the prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">By way of example, and in a non-limiting manner, the flexibility of the first strobel <b>44</b> is substantially equal to the flexibility of the second strobel <b>47</b>. This means that the flexibility of the first strobel <b>44</b> is equal to more or less than 50% of the flexibility of the second strobel. It could also be said that the rigidity of the first strobel <b>44</b> is equal to more or less than 50% of the rigidity of the second strobel <b>47</b>, even if these rigidities are low. In comparison with the prior art, with respect to adhesive lasting, the rigidity of the first lasting sole is equal to or greater than 150% of the rigidity of the strobel sole of the second fitting element.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">To construct the shoe <b>21</b> according to the first embodiment, with reference to the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>, the stitching <b>45</b>, which affixes the first envelope <b>43</b> to the first strobel <b>44</b>, extends over the entire junction between the envelope <b>43</b> and the first strobel <b>44</b>. In other words, the stitching <b>45</b> makes a complete turn about the first strobel <b>44</b>. This provides the first fitting element <b>41</b> with maximum flexibility. Alternatively, partial stitching could be provided, as well as an adhesive where stitching is not employed. In such a case, certain portions of the element <b>41</b> are more flexible than others.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">According to the same principle, the stitching <b>48</b>, which affixes the second envelope <b>46</b> to the second strobel <b>47</b>, extends over the entire junction between the envelope <b>46</b> and the second strobel <b>47</b>. The stitching <b>48</b> makes a complete turn about the second strobel <b>47</b>. Thus, the flexibility of the second fitting element <b>42</b> is maximum. Alternatively, partial stitching could be provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">To obtain a completely assembled shoe <b>21</b>, the upper <b>23</b> is required to be affixed to the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. More precisely, the first fitting element <b>41</b> is adhesively affixed to the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>, using an adhesive layer <b>60</b>, or cement.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Although not limiting to the invention, the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> includes a plurality of layers, such as, for example, an outsole <b>61</b>, or external sole, adapted to contact the ground, as well as a damping midsole <b>62</b>, inserted between the outsole <b>61</b> and the first fitting element <b>41</b>. In a known fashion, the outsole <b>61</b> includes rubber, or any abrasion-resistant material. The damping midsole <b>62</b> includes an absorbing material, such as foam made of ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) or any equivalent. The outer sole assembly <b>22</b> can include a single layer or, on the contrary, more layers, such as three or more layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">According to the first embodiment, the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> has a lip <b>63</b>, in the area of the junction with the first fitting element <b>41</b>, to increase the surface of contact with the fitting element <b>41</b>. In this case, the lip <b>63</b> originates from the damping midsole <b>62</b>. The lip <b>63</b> is continuous and follows the contour of the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. Alternatively, a sectioned or discontinuous lip could be provided. A continuous lip increases the usable surface for affixing the sole assembly <b>22</b> to the first fitting element <b>41</b>. Consequently, the adhesive layer <b>60</b> extends along the lip <b>63</b> and on the top <b>64</b> of the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. This adhesive layer <b>60</b> extends in the area of the lower portion <b>65</b> of the first strobel <b>44</b>, and in the area of the base of the first envelope <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">According to the first embodiment of the invention, the second fitting element <b>42</b> is affixed to the first fitting element <b>41</b> by a means shown in the form of cement or adhesive layer <b>70</b>. More precisely, the second strobel <b>47</b> is affixed to the first strobel <b>44</b> by means of cement/adhesive. Alternatively, other structures, such as a pair of fabrics having respective hook and loop fastening elements (such as VelcroÂ®), could be provided. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the first strobel <b>44</b> has passages <b>73</b> (three being exemplarily illustrated), adapted to promote the application of the adhesive constituting the two layers <b>60</b>, <b>70</b>, that is, they are adhesive-receiving passages. These passages <b>73</b> are temporary, being created via partial cutouts, i.e., slits, in the strobel sole <b>44</b>, which is otherwise generally continuous within its periphery, as shown. However, permanent passages, obtained by complete cutouts, could alternatively be provided for adhesive. As another alternative, an adhesive could be injected via hollow needles, or using a thermoplastic adhesive. The adhesive/cement <b>70</b> enables a permanent retention of the fitting elements with respect to one another. âPermanent retention,â in this context, means that the fitting elements <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, i.e., first and second strobel soles <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, once adhesively joined, would not retain their integrity, or at least not easily retain their integrity, by attempts to undo the adhesive joining.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">A method of manufacturing the boot <b>21</b> can be summarized as follows. Such a method involves making a first fitting element <b>41</b>, which includes a first envelope <b>43</b> and a first strobel sole <b>44</b> assembled to one another by stitching; making a second fitting element <b>42</b>, which includes a second envelope <b>46</b> and a second strobel sole <b>47</b> assembled to one another by stitching; making an outer sole assembly <b>22</b>; adhesively affixing the second fitting element <b>42</b> to the first fitting element <b>41</b>; and affixing the outer sole assembly <b>22</b> to the first fitting element <b>41</b>, so that the thickness t<b>1</b> of the first envelope <b>43</b> and/or the thickness t<b>2</b> of the second envelope <b>46</b> (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, e.g.), in the area of the junction with the sole assembly <b>22</b>, is between 50% and 100% of the value it has away from this junction, i.e., spaced from the junction.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In fact, the thickness t<b>1</b> of the first envelope <b>43</b> is substantially constant, or uniform, in particular along the lateral side <b>26</b> and/or the medial side <b>27</b>. Particularly near the junction between the first envelope <b>43</b> and the first lasting sole <b>44</b>, as well as in the area of this junction itself, the thickness t<b>1</b> is substantially constant. In other words, the thickness t<b>1</b> is substantially constant in the vicinity and area of the peripheral lip <b>63</b> of the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. This is because the pressure from gluing the first fitting element <b>41</b> on the sole assembly <b>22</b> is low. The constituent materials of the envelope <b>43</b> and of the first sole <b>44</b> are preserved, in the sense that their structure remains the same everywhere. In particular, this structure is not irreversibly crushed. Moreover, in the invention, the envelope is not tensionally stressed in order to be applied on a lasting sole.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The thickness t<b>1</b> of the first envelope <b>43</b>, measured in the area of the stitching <b>45</b>, ranges between 90% and 100% of this same thickness t<b>1</b> when measured in the area of the top <b>75</b> of the lip <b>63</b>. Such a small variation in thickness is found in particular in a snow boot, which is a boot having no device for tightening the upper, i.e., a boot whose upper is continuous from one side <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> to the other. In the area of the stitching <b>45</b>, in different respective embodiments, the thickness t<b>1</b> can range between 50% and 100% of this same thickness t<b>1</b> in the area of the top <b>75</b> of the lip <b>63</b>. This variation, still small compared to that observed in a conventional shoe assembled by gluing the envelope on the lasting sole, is noted in shoes that are more adapted to walking or running on harder surfaces. In any case, preserving all the thickness t<b>1</b>, or at least a substantial portion of the thickness t<b>1</b>, improves thermal insulation. Such insulation is preserved in the area of the junction between the envelope <b>43</b> and the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. There is no obstructing thermal bridge, and comfort with the foot within the boot <b>21</b> is greater, especially in snow.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The preceding also applies to the second fitting element <b>42</b>. The thickness t<b>2</b> of the second envelope <b>46</b> is substantially constant, or uniform, in particular along the lateral side <b>26</b> and/or the medial side <b>27</b>. The thickness t<b>2</b> is substantially constant in the vicinity of the junction between the second envelope <b>46</b> and the second strobel <b>47</b>, as well as in the area of this junction. The thickness t<b>2</b> is substantially constant in the vicinity and area of the peripheral lip <b>63</b> of the outer sole assembly <b>22</b>. Here again, the pressure from gluing the second fitting element <b>42</b> in the first element <b>41</b> is low, even very low. The constituent materials of the envelope <b>46</b> and of the second sole <b>47</b> are preserved, their structure remaining the same everywhere.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The thickness t<b>2</b> of the second envelope <b>46</b>, measured in the area of the stitching <b>48</b>, ranges between 90% and 100% of this same thickness t<b>2</b> when measured in the area of the top <b>75</b> of the lip <b>63</b>. Here again, in the area of the stitching <b>48</b> the thickness t<b>2</b>, in different respective embodiments, the thickness t<b>2</b> can range between 50% and 100% of the thickness t<b>2</b> in the area of the top <b>75</b> of the lip <b>63</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">For certain applications, the second envelope <b>46</b> is provided to include a waterproof layer or membrane, and the second strobel <b>47</b> is also provided to include a waterproof layer or membrane. Thus, in this case, the second fitting element <b>42</b> is a slipper, or sock liner, which is impervious or very resistant to water penetration. It is advantageous to cover the stitching <b>48</b> with a waterproof strip of material glued to both the second envelope <b>46</b> and the sole <b>47</b>. Such a strip renders the stitching <b>48</b> impervious by blocking the passage holes for the threads of the stitching. Waterproofness can be obtained by other means, such as a direct application of a covering material, or the positioning of a waterproof extra sole.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">A second embodiment of the invention is summarily shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. Only the differences with respect to the first embodiment are shown.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">According to this second embodiment, a shoe <b>81</b> includes an outer sole assembly <b>82</b> and an upper <b>83</b>. What is specific to this shoe <b>81</b> is that the upper <b>83</b> is a low upper, in the sense that it includes a lower portion <b>90</b>, excluding any upper portion. In other words, the upper end <b>92</b>, or collar, of the lower portion <b>90</b> is below the area of the ankle when the shoe <b>81</b> is worn. The shoe <b>81</b> is consequently well-adapted for walking or running.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The article of footwear according to the invention can be made from materials and according to implementation techniques and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art of footwear and footwear manufacturing.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The invention is not limited to the particular embodiments herein described and illustrated, and includes all of the technical equivalents that fall within the scope of the claims that follow.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In particular, one can provide to add one or more fitting elements. Thus, the shoe can include a third fitting element.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">One can also provide to leave a free space between two fitting elements. This space could be naturally filled with air, and used as a heat insulator. Alternatively, the space can be filled with other insulating materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In addition, the invention illustratively disclosed herein suitably may be practiced in the absence of any element which is not specifically disclosed herein.</p>
