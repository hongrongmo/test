      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The present invention is summarized as an adjustable shower curtain capable of being installed in a bathtub or another bath enclosure with an existing curtain rod structure. The present invention relates generally to bathtub shower enclosures, and more particularly to an adjustable shower curtain. In the construction of most bathrooms, a shower nozzle is typically mounted on the wall in an enclosure above a bath tub to provide the option of a shower for a resident using the bathroom facility. In defining such enclosures, a shower curtain is used to prevent water from flooding or splashing outside the shower area. A shower curtain is ordinarily constructed and arranged to drape loosely from a curtain rod to prevent water from splashing out of the enclosure. The shower curtain is draped in the bath tub below so that the water is not splashed out of the bathtub. Typically, conventional shower curtain rods are known to have a linear structure. However, it is not uncommon to use a shower curtain rod comprising a central portion curving to create additional bathing space for the resident and prevent the sensation of being cramped. Typically, the shower curtain rod includes two end portions with angled fasteners to enable the shower curtain rod to be operatively coupled between a pair of parallel walls at a bath tub enclosure. In such installations, the center of the relatively heavy shower rod (with a shower curtain) may cause the shower rod to rotate downward, putting significant stress on the fasteners at each end.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> illustrate an adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. The adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> may have a rectangular shape, although its overall shape can be made to vary. The adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> typically has four sides, defined for the purposes of the document as a top side <b>101</b>, a left lateral side <b>102</b>, a right lateral side <b>103</b>, and a bottom side <b>104</b>. The shower curtain <b>100</b> has a width defined as the distance between the top side <b>101</b> and bottom side <b>104</b>, a length defined as the distance between the left lateral side <b>102</b> and the right lateral side <b>103</b>, a diagonal defined by the length and the width of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b>, and a surface <b>105</b> defined by the top side, the bottom side, the left lateral side, and the right lateral side. The length and width of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> may be defined to at least partially cover the enclosure and prevent the water from flooding or splashing out of the bathtub.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> comprises a securing member <b>106</b> positioned along the length of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> in close proximity to the top side <b>101</b> of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b>. In one aspect, the securing member <b>106</b> may be operatively coupled to a curtain rod (not shown) to allow the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> to be positioned along the rod. In some embodiments, the securing member <b>106</b> of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> may be reinforced with one or more layers of vinyl, plastic, or the like. The securing member <b>106</b> may define means to enable the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> to be operatively coupled to a curtain rod. In one aspect, the securing member <b>106</b> may include a hollow portion along the length of the top side <b>101</b> to enable the curtain rod to be inserted along the hollow portion and be operatively coupled between a pair of parallel walls in the bath tub enclosure. In another aspect, the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> is operatively coupled to the curtain rod using one or more fastening members such as a hook, a ring, a clamp or the like, by inserting the one or more fastening members through one or more holes positioned on the securing member along the length of the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In some embodiments, the adjustable shower curtain <b>100</b> comprises an interior portion <b>108</b>. The interior portion <b>108</b> may have a rectangular shape, although its overall shape can be made to vary widely. The interior portion <b>108</b> has four sides defined for the purposes of this document as an interior top side <b>151</b>, an interior bottom side <b>152</b>, an interior left lateral side <b>153</b>, and an interior right lateral side <b>154</b>. Further, the interior portion <b>108</b> defines an interior length as a distance between the interior left later side <b>153</b> and the interior right lateral side <b>154</b>, a width defined as a distance between the interior top side <b>151</b> and interior bottom side <b>154</b>, and an interior diagonal length defined by the interior length and interior width. In some embodiments, the adjustable shower curtain may not comprise an interior portion <b>108</b>.</p>
