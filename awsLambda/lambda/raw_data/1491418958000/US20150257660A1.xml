    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) apparatus and an image processing apparatus which excite nuclear spin of an object magnetically with a RF (radio frequency) signal having the Larmor frequency and reconstruct an image based on an NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) signal generated due to the excitation, and more particularly, to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and an image processing apparatus which can obtain a blood flow image in a shorter period of time without a contrast medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Magnetic resonance imaging is an imaging method which excite nuclear spin of an object set in a static magnetic field with an RF signal having the Larmor frequency magnetically and reconstruct an image based on an NMR signal generated due to the excitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) is known as a technique for obtaining a blood flow image in a field of a magnetic resonance imaging. An MRA without using contrast medium is called a non-contrast-enhanced MRA. In a non-contrast-enhanced MRA, fresh blood imaging (FBI) method is designed, which clearly images a blood vessel by acquiring a high-velocity blood flow pumped out from a heart with ECG (electro cardiogram) synchronization (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2000-5144).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A non-contrast-enhanced MRA under the FBI method can obtain an MRA image with arteriovenous separation by obtaining a difference between pieces of image data acquired with varying a delay time of ECG synchronization. Additionally, the Flow-Spoiled FBI method is designed, which suppresses an artery signal during a systole by applying a spoiler pulse in the FBI method. The Flow-Spoiled FBI method images a difference between artery signals in a diastole and a systole of a myocardium. An ECG-prep scan to decide the optimum delay time of ECG synchronization is designed.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Furthermore, in the FBI method, the Flow-dephasing method is designed in order to image a low-velocity blood flow, which applies a gradient pulse (Gspoil) in a readout (RO) direction and adds a dephasing pulse or a rephasing pulse to a gradient magnetic field pulse (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2002-200054, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2003-135430 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,801,800). The Flow-dephasing method can increase a relative signal difference between a high-velocity blood flow and a low-velocity blood flow by operation of a dephasing pulse or a rephasing pulse. Then, the relative signal difference allows to separate clearly arteries from veins.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">This means it is important to enlarge a signal difference in a diastole and a systole for clear arteriovenous separation. In order to do this, it is necessary to reduce an intensity of a signal from a high-velocity blood flow in a systole. Therefore, a gradient pulse having an appropriate intensity in an RO direction is set and a blood flow signal from an artery in a systole is suppressed by the set gradient pulse. In this state, a blood flow signal in a diastole is acquired. Then, subtraction processing and/or maximum intensity projection (MIP) processing is performed to the blood flow signal acquired in the diastole and thus only arteries are imaged.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The Flow-prep. Scan is designed, which performs a preparation scan with changing parameters including an intensity of a dephasing pulse in an RO direction in the Flow-dephasing method (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2003-70766). The Flow-prep. Scan makes it possible to obtain the optimum parameter by referencing images acquired with changing a parameter by the preparation scan. A report of research about an intensity of a dephasing pulse in an RO direction has been made (see, for example, Miyazaki M, et al., Radiology 227:890-896, 2003).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">An echoshare technique with the use of the Half-Fourier method is designed to obtain a blood flow image in a shorter scanning time (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2001-149341). Scans in a diastole and a systole obtain pieces of data respectively by this technique. By the scan in the systole, only echo data in a low-frequency region important for improving contrast is acquired in a short data acquisition time. Instead, copies of data in a high-frequency region acquired by the scan in the diastole are used as data in the high-frequency region that are not acquired in the systole. Moreover, data in insufficient region even with using copy of data in the diastole is calculated from each K-space data for the diastole and the systole by the Half-Fourier method to be used for image reconstruction.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">A technique to obtain dynamic information of a blood flow simply without contrast medium and measuring a ECG-synchronization timing by an ECG-prep scan is designed (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2004-329614). This technique uses an ECG-prep scan as an imaging scan. Specifically, as in the case of an ECG-prep scan, dynamic information of a blood flow can be obtained by performing subtraction processing to pieces of two-dimensional data acquired more than once by an imaging scan with changing a delay time gradually from an R wave of an ECG signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">
        <figref>FIG. 18</figref> is a diagram showing a conventional imaging scan with use of an ECG-prep scan.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, the abscissa denotes time. As shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, a trigger signal is set initially at a timing of delay time d<b>1</b> from an R wave of an ECG signal. Then, a scan for data acquisition is started in synchronized with the trigger signal. Then, a trigger signal is set at a timing of delay time d<b>2</b> from an R wave of the ECG signal after completion of the scan for data acquisition. Then, a scan for data acquisition is started in synchronized with the trigger signal. In the same way, trigger signals are set at timings of delay times d<b>3</b>, d<b>4</b>, . . . from R waves of the ECG signal respectively, and a scan for data acquisition is started at a different timing in synchronized with each trigger signal. At this time, delay times d<b>1</b>, d<b>2</b>, . . . are set to be changed gradually in a systole of a myocardium showing a great change in velocity of a blood flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">A pulse sequence that consists of a two-dimensional partial FS (flow spoiling) pulse and/or a two-dimensional partial FC (flow compensation) pulse is used as a scan for data acquisition.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The imaging scan as shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref> can reconstruct multiple pieces of image data each corresponding to a mutually different delay time from an R wave of the ECG signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">
        <figref>FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram showing delay times from an R wave of an ECG signal for respective acquisition timings of pieces of image data acquired by the imaging scan shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, the abscissa denotes time and each arrow denotes a timing of an R wave of an ECG signal. As shown in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, multiple pieces of image data each corresponding to a mutually different delay time from an R wave of the ECG signal are generated by an imaging scan. This means multiple pieces of image data each corresponding to a mutually different cardiac time phase are generated. A subtraction image obtained by performing subtraction processing to the pieces of image data generated in this way becomes a blood flow image presenting dynamic information of a blood flow. This blood flow image is called the Time-resolved MRDSA (magnetic resonance digital subtraction angiography) image since it is a subtraction image of a blood flow resolved by time.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A technique is also designed to obtain dynamic information of a blood flow mentioned above by PI (parallel imaging) which is one of high speed imaging methods. PI is a technique for using a PAC (phased array coil) having surface coils as an RF coil for data reception (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application (Laid-Open) No. 2004-329613). By using PI for obtaining dynamic information of a blood flow, a scanning time can be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In the conventional technique for obtaining a Time-resolved MRDSA image, data acquisition time per 1 shot to acquire Time-resolved MRDSA data used for generating a Time-resolved MRDSA image is considerably long in view of an interval between R waves. Therefore, a TR (repetition time) is set to be about 3RR corresponding to 3 times of a distance RR between R waves.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Consequently, an imaging time of about 60 to 90 seconds is necessary to generate different Time-resolved MRDSA images corresponding to 20 to 30 time phases. Therefore, shortening of imaging time is needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In addition to shortening of imaging time, when scanned data is processed simply and appropriately in accordance with the diagnostic purpose and a user can refer to a diagnostic image more easily, working time and diagnostic time of the user can be reduced even if an imaging time might increase.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> includes a static field magnet <b>21</b> for generating a static magnetic field, a shim coil <b>22</b> arranged inside the static field magnet <b>21</b> which is cylinder-shaped, a gradient coil unit <b>23</b> and a RF coil <b>24</b>. The static field magnet <b>21</b>, the shim coil <b>22</b>, the gradient coil unit <b>23</b> and the RF coil <b>24</b> are built in a gantry (not shown).</p>

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The static field magnet <b>21</b> communicates with the static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b>. The static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b> supplies electric current to the static field magnet <b>21</b> to get the function to generate a static magnetic field in a imaging region. The static field magnet <b>21</b> includes a superconductivity coil in many cases. The static field magnet <b>21</b> gets current from the static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b> which communicates with the static field magnet <b>21</b> at excitation. However, once excitation has been made, the static field magnet <b>21</b> is usually isolated from the static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b>. The static field magnet <b>21</b> may include a permanent magnet which makes the static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b> unnecessary.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The static field magnet <b>21</b> has the cylinder-shaped shim coil <b>22</b> coaxially inside itself. The shim coil <b>22</b> communicates with the shim coil power supply <b>28</b>. The shim coil power supply <b>28</b> supplies current to the shim coil <b>22</b> so that the static magnetic field becomes uniform.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The gradient coil unit <b>23</b> includes an X-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>x</i>, a Y-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>y </i>and a Z-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>z</i>. Each of the X-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>x</i>, the Y-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>y </i>and the Z-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>z </i>which is cylinder-shaped is arranged inside the static field magnet <b>21</b>. The gradient coil unit <b>23</b> has also a bed <b>37</b> in the area formed inside it which is an imaging area. The bed <b>37</b> supports an object P. Around the bed <b>37</b> or the object P, the RF coil <b>24</b> may be arranged instead of being built in the gantry.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The gradient coil unit <b>23</b> communicates with the gradient power supply <b>27</b>. The X-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>x</i>, the Y-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>y </i>and the Z-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>z </i>of the gradient coil unit <b>23</b> communicate with the X-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>x</i>, the Y-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>y </i>and the Z-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>z </i>of the gradient power supply <b>27</b> respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The X-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>x</i>, the Y-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>y </i>and the Z-axis gradient power supply <b>27</b><i>z </i>supply currents to the X-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>x</i>, the Y-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>y </i>and the Z-axis gradient coil unit <b>23</b><i>z </i>respectively so as to generate gradient magnetic fields Gx, Gy and Gz in the X, Y and Z directions in the imaging area.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The RF coil <b>24</b> communicates with the transmitter <b>29</b> and the receiver <b>30</b>. The RF coil <b>24</b> has a function to transmit a RF signal given from the transmitter <b>29</b> to the object P and receive an NMR signal generated due to nuclear spin inside the object P which is excited by the RF signal to give to the receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing an example of detail structure of the RF coil <b>24</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional illustration showing an example arrangement of the WB coil <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the phased array coils <b>24</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The RF coil <b>24</b> is structured by a transmission RF coil <b>24</b> and a reception RF coil <b>24</b>, for example. The transmission RF coil <b>24</b> uses a whole-body (WB) coil <b>24</b><i>a </i>while the reception RF coil <b>24</b> uses a phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b </i>has a plurality of surface coils <b>24</b><i>c</i>. The surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>are separately connected to respective reception circuits <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Meanwhile, the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>of the phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b </i>are arranged, symmetric about the Z-axis, in peripheral regions of a section L including a particular region of interest in the object P for example. Furthermore, the WB coil <b>24</b><i>a </i>is provided at the outer of the phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Thus, a radio frequency signal can be transmitted to the object P by the WB coil <b>24</b><i>a </i>while an NMR signal of from the section L including the particular region of interest can be received at multi-channels by the WB coil <b>24</b><i>a </i>or the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>of the phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b </i>and provided to the reception circuits <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">However, the RF coil <b>24</b> may be structured by desired coils suited for various applications or by a single coil.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The sequence controller <b>31</b> of the control system <b>25</b> communicates with the gradient power supply <b>27</b>, the transmitter <b>29</b> and the receiver <b>30</b>. The sequence controller <b>31</b> has a function to storage sequence information describing control information needed in order to make the gradient power supply <b>27</b>, the transmitter <b>29</b> and the receiver <b>30</b> drive and generate gradient magnetic fields Gx, Gy and Gz in the X, Y and Z directions and a RF signal by driving the gradient power supply <b>27</b>, the transmitter <b>29</b> and the receiver <b>30</b> according to a predetermined sequence stored. The control information above-described includes motion control information, such as intensity, impression period and impression timing of the pulse electric current which should be impressed to the gradient power supply <b>27</b></p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The sequence controller <b>31</b> is also configured to give raw data to the computer <b>32</b>. The raw data is complex number data obtained through the detection of an NMR signal and A/D conversion to the NMR signal detected in the receiver <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The transmitter <b>29</b> has a function to give a RF signal to the RF coil <b>24</b> in accordance with control information provided from the sequence controller <b>31</b>. The receiver <b>30</b> has a function to generate raw data which is digitized complex number data by detecting a NMR signal given from the RF coil <b>24</b> and performing predetermined signal processing and A/D converting to the NMR signal detected. The receiver <b>30</b> also has a function to give the generated raw data to the sequence controller <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In addition, an ECG unit <b>38</b> for acquiring an ECG signal of the object P is provided with the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b>. The ECG signal detected by the ECG unit <b>38</b> is outputted to the computer <b>32</b> through the sequence controller <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Furthermore, the bed <b>37</b> is provided with a table drive unit <b>39</b>. The table drive unit <b>39</b> is connected with the computer <b>32</b> so as to move the table of the bed <b>37</b> under the control by the computer <b>32</b> for imaging with moving table method or stepping table method. The moving table method is a technique for obtaining a large FOV (field of view) in a moving direction by continuously moving the table of the bed <b>37</b> during imaging. The stepping table method is a technique for three-dimensional imaging at every station by stepping the table of the bed <b>37</b>. These techniques are used in case of imaging a large area which is unable to be imaged at a time such as whole body imaging. The images acquired with moving the bed <b>37</b> may be combined mutually by compound processing in the computer <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The computer <b>32</b> gets various functions by the operation unit <b>35</b> executing some programs stored in the storage unit <b>36</b> of the computer <b>32</b>. Alternatively, some functions may be provided with the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> by some specific circuits instead of using some of the programs.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a functional block diagram of the computer <b>32</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The computer <b>32</b> functions as a sensitivity distribution database <b>40</b>, an interface unit <b>41</b>, an imaging condition setting unit <b>42</b>, a sequence controller control unit <b>43</b>, a k-space database <b>44</b>, an image reconstruction unit <b>45</b>, an unfolding processing unit <b>46</b>, a real space database <b>47</b>, a blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b>, a display processing unit <b>49</b> and a table control unit <b>50</b> by program.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The sensitivity distribution database <b>40</b> stores each sensitivity distribution of the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>included in the phased array coil <b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The interface unit <b>41</b> has a function to display a window for setting and inputting various information on the display unit <b>34</b> with the GUI (Graphical User Interface) technology and a function to receive instruction from the input device <b>33</b> and provide it to corresponding components. Information such as an imaging condition, an image processing method and an image displaying method can be cited as set information.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Sequences for non-contrast MRA each to be set as an imaging condition includes two-dimensional or three-dimensional FSE (Fast spin echo) sequence, EPI (echo planar imaging) sequence, FASE (fast asymmetric spin echo) sequence and SSFP (steady state free precession) sequence. Using two-dimensional sequence make it possible to reduce imaging period. Further, in case of using two-dimensional FASE sequence, a Partial FS pulse or a Partial FC pulse for controlling a phase of magnetized spin may be added to a gradient magnetic field pulse in a RO (readout) direction according to a blood velocity.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">An FASE sequence with applying a partial FC pulse is suitable for imaging a portion such as a vessel with a high-velocity blood flow. When imaging a portion showing a low-velocity blood flow, an FASE sequence with applying a flow spoiling pulse, an EPI sequence or an SSFP sequence can be used. Since an SSFP sequence has a long TE (echo time) and is sensitive to a flow, it can depict a flow-void image in a systole and/or a bright blood image in a diastole.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Further, a delay time from an R wave of an ECG signal and the number of data acquisition (the number of shots) are set as imaging conditions to generate a Time-resolved MRDSA image. For example, each delay time can be set as a delay time until the first data acquisition, i.e., an initial value of the delay time and an increment value indicating an amount of change of the delay time.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The set imaging conditions including the pulse sequence, the delay time and the number of shots are output from the interface unit <b>41</b> to the imaging condition setting unit <b>42</b> and the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In addition, an imaging mode with the echoshare and/or an imaging mode under PI can be selected as an imaging condition for generating a Time-resolved MRDSA image. Imaging with the echoshare acquires only echo data in a low-frequency region critical for improvement of contrast in a short data acquisition time in a scan in a systole and uses a copy of data in a high-frequency region acquired in a scan in a diastole as data in the high-frequency region that was not acquired in the systole.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">PI receives data with multiple surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>and reduces the number of phase encodes into a value obtained by multiplying the reciprocal of the number of the surface coil <b>24</b><i>c </i>with the number of phase encodes necessary for image reconstruction by skipping at least one phase encode. When the imaging mode under PI is selected, conditions specific to PI are also set.

      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">A pulse sequence for a non-contrast-enhanced MRA can be selected from preset candidates. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows an example in which a two-dimensional FASE sequence is selected. Since data acquisition for a non-contrast-enhanced Time-resolved MRDSA image is performed over plural times with extending a delay time from an R wave of an ECG signal gradually, each delay time and the number of data acquisition, i.e., the number of shots are set. In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, an initial delay time from an R wave for the first data acquisition and an increment value equivalent to an increment of a delay time for the following data acquisition are set to 100 ms and 5 ms, respectively.

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">When the imaging mode with echoshare is selected, the K-space data from the low-frequency region to the high-frequency region necessary for reconstruction of a slice of Time-resolved MRDSA image is acquired at least once, and an imaging condition is set so that only K-space data of the low-frequency region including data that is at least necessary for ensuring contrast is acquired in other data acquisition. The range of K-space data to be acquired in the low-frequency region can be determined by imaging on a trial basis in advance and determining whether the contrast can be sufficiently obtained or not.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">For this reason, in the imaging mode with echoshare, the data acquisition time for acquiring the only K-space data in the low-frequency region can be decreased. Preferably, an imaging condition is set so that the K-space data in the low-frequency region is acquired between consecutive R waves of an ECG signal, i.e., in one heart beat. More preferably, an imaging condition is set so that a time necessary for a longitudinal relaxation (T<b>1</b>) recovery can be secured between the end of data acquisition and the next R wave.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">From the viewpoint that the data acquisition time is made shorter and that the data in the high-frequency region is acquired as higher signal values, the data in the high-frequency region is acquired in the last data acquisition with the longest delay time for practical purposes. A case where the data from the low-frequency region to the high-frequency region is acquired only once in the last data acquisition is described here.</p>

Consequently, a graph relating the delay times to the signal values of the data can be displayed so that a range of delay times for imaging an MRDSA image and the number of time phases (delay times) can be determined with reference to the graph. A graph relating the delay times to the signal values of data can be generated according to the following procedure (algorithm).</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">First, multiple ECG-prep images each corresponding to a mutually different delay time are generated by an ECG-prep scan. Any one of the multiple ECG-prep images is assumed to be the reference image, and then a difference between each ECG-prep image and the reference image is obtained. Alternatively a difference between two ECG-prep images out of multiple ECG-prep images is obtained with regard to all combinations. This generates multiple subtraction images. Then, an MIP image is generated by MIP processing to multiple subtraction images. Then, a mask image is generated by binarizing the MIP image and subsequently the generated mask image is multiplied by each of the multiple ECG-prep images. This enables an amount of characteristic regarding each delay time (time phase) to be calculated. Then, a graph relating each delay time to the amount of characteristic calculated in this way can be generated.</p>

For example, if a range of delay times for imaging is specified, by specifying a reference delay time (an initial vale of a delay time, for example) Delay and a variation width Increment of a delay time through operation of the input device <b>33</b>, the computer <b>32</b> can automatically calculate a repetition frequency of data acquisition and an imaging time. For another example, when an imaging time is specified through operation of the input device <b>33</b>, the computer <b>32</b> can automatically calculate a reference delay time Delay and a variation width Increment of a delay time so that the data acquisition of the specified imaging range is completed within the specified imaging time. The repetition frequency of data acquisition, the imaging time, the reference delay time Delay and the variation width Increment of the delay time, obtained by these calculations or specified, can be displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> for reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">Note that, since an ECG-prep scan is a preparation scan performed to determine an appropriate delay time, a variation width of a delay time for an MRDSA image is ordinarily set shorter than that between respective pieces of image data obtained by the ECG-prep scan.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">Further, when a graph relating delay times concerning an MRDSA image to signal values of data is displayed, a range of delay times and the number of time phases (delay times) for displaying a blood flow image can also be determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">Meanwhile, an imaging condition with echoshare for imaging a three-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image can also be set.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">
        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram showing delay times and data acquisition periods in case of performing data acquisition for selecting the echo share mode on the setting window shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> and generating a three-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image by a three-dimensional pulse sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, data acquisition at a slice S<b>1</b> can be performed similarly to two-dimensional data acquisition shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. Specifically, data in the high-frequency region and the low-frequency region in the last data acquisition of nth at the slice S<b>1</b> is acquired while data only in the low-frequency region is acquired in the other data acquisition. In a similar way, three-dimensional data can be acquired by two-dimensional data acquisition with echoshare repeated for every slice. In other words, each data acquisition for the slices S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, . . . , Sn is performed similarly to the data acquisition for the slice S<b>1</b>. This allows to acquire three-dimensional echo data in a short time and generate a three-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">An imaging time can be reduced by selecting the echoshare mode as mentioned above on a setting window of an imaging condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Moreover, when the imaging mode by PI is selected on a setting window of an imaging condition, an imaging time can be reduced further. PI is a technique for acquiring data by skipping at least one phase encode with multiple surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>as described above. Therefore, the number of phase encodes can be reduced to a value obtained by multiplying a reciprocal of the number of surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>by the number of a phase encodes necessary for image reconstruction. Then, pieces of image data corresponding to the respective surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>are reconstructed from pieces of echo data received simultaneously by the respective surface coil <b>24</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">However, folding occurs in each piece of reconstructed image data for the respective surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>by PI. Therefore, unfolding processing is performed to each of the respective pieces of image data to remove folding by utilizing each sensitivity distribution of the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c</i>. Then conclusive image data for displaying is generated by combining the pieces of image data for the respective surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>after unfolding processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">When imaging by moving table method or stepping-table method, instruction to set a condition such as positional information and an amount of step of the bed <b>37</b> is provided from the input device <b>33</b> to the interface unit <b>41</b> as an imaging condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">When the instruction of the imaging condition as mentioned above is provided from the input device <b>33</b> to the interface unit <b>41</b> through the setting window displayed on the display unit <b>34</b>, the corresponding information is provided form the interface unit <b>41</b> to the respective components. For example, application information of the echoshare mode and/or PI, the number of the surface coil <b>24</b><i>c</i>, the selected pulse sequence, the delay time and the number of shots are provided to the imaging condition setting unit <b>42</b>. Further, application information of the echoshare mode, the pulse sequence, the delay time, the number of shots and application information of PI are provided to the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b>, and application information of PI and the number of the surface coil <b>24</b><i>c </i>are provided to the unfolding processing unit <b>46</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">Then, the image condition setting unit <b>42</b> sets imaging conditions according to the information obtained from the interface unit <b>41</b> and provides them to the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">Next in the step S<b>2</b>, an image processing method and an image displaying method are set through a setting window of an image processing condition and an image displaying condition displayed on the display unit <b>34</b>. As shown in the upper right portion in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the auto subtraction processing mode serving as an image processing method can be selected so as to perform subtraction processing automatically for generating an MRDSA image. When selecting the auto subtraction mode, subtraction processing between pieces of image data is performed automatically to generate an MRDSA image without additionally providing instruction of subtraction processing to the interface unit <b>41</b> after the beginning of imaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">For example, when a three-dimensional sequence is selected as a pulse sequence for data acquisition, the auto-MIP processing mode can be selected so as to perform MIP processing automatically. If the auto-MIP processing mode is selected, MIP processing to three-dimensional image data generated as MRDSA data is performed automatically to generate blood flow image data for displaying without providing instruction of MIP processing to the interface unit <b>41</b> separately after the beginning of imaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">In addition, when a three-dimensional sequence is selected as a pulse sequence for data acquisition, a displaying method of multiple pieces of MIP image data generated as blood flow image data for displaying can be set as shown in the lower right portion in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">
        <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram explaining an order for displaying MIP images which is set on the setting window shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">In <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, the abscissa denotes a display angle representing a projection direction for MIP images and the ordinate denotes time phase. The images laid out as shown in <figref>FIG. 15</figref> are MIP images for displaying acquired by a three-dimensional scan. In <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, a display angle of an MIP image changes toward in the abscissa axis direction, and the time elapses and blood on an MIP image flows gradually toward in the ordinate axis direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">When Phase/Swing is selected as an image displaying method, the MIP images are displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in the image display method for displaying MIP images corresponding to mutually different time phases sequentially, and subsequently displaying MIP images from another display angle with elapse of time phase sequentially after. Specifically, the MIP images are displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in the order of Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, . . . , Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, . . . , Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, . . . . On the other hand, when Swing/Phase is selected as an image displaying method, the MIP images are displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in the image displaying method for displaying MIP images with gradually changing a display angle sequentially, and subsequently displaying MIP images in the next time phase with gradually changing a display angle. Specifically, the MIP images are displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in the order of Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, Ip<b>1</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, . . . , Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, Ip<b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, . . . , Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, Ip<b>3</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>, . . . .</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">In addition, a direction of projection for generating an MIP image can be set as an image displaying method. For example, the number of projection directions can be specified and projection planes obtained by evenly dividing the angle of 180 degrees by the specified number can be set as the projection direction. Moreover, a displaying time of one MIP image can be set. For example, when the scroll bar is scrolled to the minus side in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, a displaying speed of MIP images slows down and the MIP images are displayed in slow motion. On the contrary, when the scroll bar is scrolled to the plus side, the MIP images are run with fast-forward.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">In addition, when imaging by the moving table method or the stepping-table method, an image displaying method of a blood flow image data can be set according to each position of the bed <b>37</b>. In this case in connection with an image displaying method, when an imaging condition is set so that mutually corresponding pieces of data between plural portions serving as imaging targets in positions of the bed <b>37</b> are acquired with the same delay time, blood flow image data can be displayed effectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">For example, when blood flow image data is for a moving image, the blood flow image data can be displayed with matching time phases between pieces of blood flow image data from respective positions.</p>

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">Information indicating an image displaying method and an image processing method that are thus set up is provided from the interface unit <b>41</b> to the blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b> as a blood flow image to be generated, and information indicating the image displaying method is also provided to the display processing unit <b>49</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0170">After completing setting of the imaging condition, the image processing method and the image displaying method, an object P is set on the bed <b>37</b>. Further, a static magnetic field is generated in an imaging area in the static field magnet <b>21</b> (superconducting magnet) excited in advance by the static magnetic field power supply <b>26</b>. An electric current is supplied from the shim coil power supply <b>28</b> to the shim coil <b>22</b> to uniform the static magnetic field generated in the imaging area. The imaging condition, the image processing method and the image displaying method may be set collectively, not separately.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0171">Then in step S<b>3</b>, data acquisition is performed. Specifically, instruction to start a scan is provided through the interface unit <b>41</b> from the input device <b>33</b> to the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b>. Then, the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b> provides a pulse sequence such as an FASE sequence acquired from the imaging condition setting unit <b>42</b> to the sequence controller <b>31</b>. The sequence controller <b>31</b> generates a gradient magnetic field in the imaging area where the object P is set by driving the gradient power supply <b>27</b>, the transmitter <b>29</b> and the receiver <b>30</b> according to the pulse sequence received from the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b> and also generates a radio frequency signal from the RF coil <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0172">Consequently, an NMR signal generated by the nuclear magnetic resonance in the object P is received by the RF coil <b>24</b> and provided to the receiver <b>30</b>. The receiver <b>30</b> performs necessary signal processing in response to the NMR signal from the RF coil <b>24</b>, and then generates raw data that is an NMR signal of digital data by A/D conversion. The receiver <b>30</b> provides the generated raw data to the sequence controller <b>31</b>. The sequence controller <b>31</b> provides the raw data to the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b> and the sequence controller control unit <b>43</b> arranges the raw data as K-space data in the K-space formed in the K-space database <b>44</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0173">The data acquisition like this is performed in synchronization with an ECG according to an ECG signal of the object P acquired by the ECG unit <b>38</b>. That is to say, following triggers set so as to increase a delay time gradually from an R wave of the ECG signal, pieces of data corresponding to the number of shots specified through the setting window shown in the <figref>FIG. 6</figref> are acquired. The delay time increases by the increment value, depending on the number of shots, from the initial delay time set in the setting window in the <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0174">In the echoshare mode, K-space data of a low-frequency region is acquired in each shot other than the nth shot and arranged in the K-space database <b>44</b> while K-space data of a low-frequency region and a high-frequency region is acquired in the nth shot and arranged in the K-space database <b>44</b>. Therefore, the data can be acquired in a short time and data for one shot can be acquired in one heart beat. When the imaging mode by PI is selected, since data is acquired by the specified number of the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>with skipping the number of phase encodes, data acquisition time is reduced further. Consequently, sufficient time can be reserved for T<b>1</b> recovery between the end of data acquisition and the next R wave.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0175">Then in step S<b>4</b>, the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b> generates image data from K-space by retrieving the K-space data from the K-space database <b>44</b> and performing image reconstruction processing such as Fourier transform processing to the K-space data. Note that, a copy of the K-space data of the high-frequency region acquired in the nth data acquisition is used as deficient K-space data, of the high-frequency region in the K-space in the negative direction, among the K-space data acquired in each data acquisition other than nth. Further, the deficient K-space data of the high-frequency region in the positive direction in the K-space is calculated based on the complex conjugate relation under the Half-Fourier method. When the K-space is filled with the copy of data and by the complex conjugate calculation, the image data is generated by image reconstruction processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">When a notice of the imaging mode by PI from the interface unit <b>41</b> is not provided, the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b> writes the image data obtained by reconstruction on the real space database <b>47</b>.

      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0177">The unfolding processing unit <b>46</b> generates unfolded image data by performing unfolding processing on the image data from each surface coil <b>24</b><i>c </i>obtained from the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b>. At this time, each sensitivity distribution of corresponding surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>stored in the sensitivity distribution database <b>40</b> is referred to by the unfolding processing unit <b>46</b> and used for unfolding processing. In addition, a condition such as the number of the surface coils <b>24</b><i>c </i>and NOWRAP obtained from the interface unit <b>41</b> is also used for unfolding processing. Then, the unfolding processing unit <b>46</b> writes the generated image data on the real space database <b>47</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">Then in step S<b>5</b>, according to the instruction from the interface unit <b>41</b>, the blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b> obtains multiple pieces of image data corresponding to mutually different cardiac time phases stored in the real space database <b>47</b> and generates blood flow image data for displaying. For example, the blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b> generates Time-resolved MRDSA image data by subtraction processing between pieces of image data corresponding to mutually near time phase or between a reference image data and image data corresponding to each time phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">When performing subtraction processing of the image data in each time phase to the reference image data, a timing corresponding to a delay time do from an R wave of the ECG signal is set in a diastole and image data acquired in the diastole can be considered to be the reference image data Idn.

      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">This subtraction processing is performed automatically when the auto subtraction processing mode is selected in the setting window shown in the <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. On the contrary, when the auto subtraction processing mode is not selected, a user operates the input device <b>33</b> so that instruction of subtraction processing is provided to the blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b> through the interface unit <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">Alternatively, the image data Id<b>1</b>, Id<b>2</b>, Id<b>3</b>, . . . in each time phase may be set as blood flow image data for displaying without subtraction processing, as it is. In this case, the blood flow image data for displaying becomes black cine image data.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">When acquisition of two-dimensional image data for an ECG-prep is the purpose, no subtraction processing of time-resolved data is also necessary and therefore the image data generated by the image reconstruction unit <b>45</b> or the unfolding processing unit <b>46</b> can be used without modification.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0183">When the auto-MIP processing mode is selected in the setting window shown in the <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the three-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image data after subtraction processing is automatically subjected to MIP processing toward a specified projection plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">The two-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image data and the MIP image data generated by this means are provided as blood flow image data from the blood flow image generating unit <b>48</b> to the display processing unit <b>49</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0185">Then in step S<b>6</b>, the display processing unit <b>49</b> performs display processing to the blood flow image data according to the instruction from the interface unit <b>41</b> so that the blood flow image data can be displayed on the display unit <b>34</b> in the displaying order and the displaying time set in the setting window, and outputs the processed blood flow image data to the display unit <b>34</b>. As a result, a blood flow image is displayed on the display unit <b>34</b>. When the three-dimensional Time-resolved MRDSA image data is especially generated, multiple MIP images are sequentially displayed in a displaying method instructed as Phase/Swing or Swing/Phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0186">When imaging by the moving table method or the stepping-table method has been performed, pieces of blood flow image data corresponding to the respective positions of the bed <b>37</b> are mutually connected. The respective pieces of blood flow image data can be displayed with matching their time phases, and alternatively can be displayed continuously so that the initial time phase in the downstream side can come after the last time phase in the upstream side.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0187">That is to say, the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> as mentioned above is an apparatus which can acquire data in a short time using the echoshare technique and/or PI so that image data of a single slice and multi phases can be acquired effectively. The image data of a single slice and multi phases is aimed at non-contrast-enhanced Time-resolved MRDSA image data and image data acquired by an ECG-prep.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0188">According to the echoshare technique, it is only necessary to perform data acquisition of only low-frequency components in the K-space several times, and perform data acquisition of high-frequency components in the K-space at least once. This can reduce an imaging time per shot. Moreover, an imaging time can be reduced further in combination with PI. Consequently, data can be acquired with a TR as one heart beat (1RR). It is suitable to use an FASE sequence that can acquire data in a shorter time. At this time, data can be acquired with a stable signal value by applying a Partial FC pulse and/or a Partial FS pulse according to a velocity of a blood flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0189">Furthermore, if the echoshare technique and/or PI are applied to a three-dimensional non-contrast-enhanced Time-resolved MRDSA, three-dimensional blood flow function, which is DSA information in a slice direction, can be measured in a short time. Consequently, according to the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b>, imaging of non-contrast-enhanced Time-resolved MRDSA image as functional imaging can be performed in a shorter time.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">In addition, configuration of an interface so that subtraction processing and/or MIP processing are automatically performed to the reconstructed image data can reduce work of a user. At the same time, by providing with an interface in consideration of user's convenience, an MIP image in each time phase and to each projection direction can be automatically and sequentially displayed in a displaying order and a displaying speed specified in advance without the user's operation when MIP images are generated in multiple directions by three-dimensional imaging. This continuous automatic display of MIP images in time series toward multiple projection directions can be performed on blood flow images with contrast medium and/or images other than blood flow images as well as on non-contrast-enhanced blood flow images. An interface can be configured so that auto subtraction processing and/or automatic projection processing can be performed in a three-dimensional Time-resolve MRDSA without the echoshare technique and/or PI.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">Moreover, with the echoshare technique, a method of generating an image using pieces of data acquired in a certain heart beat and in another heart beat respectively can also be used for generating not only a non-contrast-enhanced blood flow image but a blood flow image with contrast medium and a diagnostic image other than a blood flow image. In combination with PI, this method can be applied to generation of various diagnostic images including a non-contrast-enhanced blood flow image and a blood flow image with contrast medium as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">Meanwhile, the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> as mentioned above generates image data in the state where K-space data is filled by using a copy of K-space data in a high-frequency region according to the echoshare technique and performs subtraction processing of the generated image data. However, the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> can also generate image data once from K-space data consisting of only low-frequency components for subtraction processing and perform complementary processing, as display processing, of a part corresponding to a high-frequency component to subtraction image data acquired as blood flow image data before displaying the subtraction image data. In this case, complementary processing to the blood flow image data can be performed by the display processing unit <b>49</b>. In this way, when a copy of a high-frequency component is used as complementary data after subtraction processing, blood flow image data can be also obtained with high resolution.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">In addition, an image processing apparatus can be configured to have image processing functions, such as the subtraction processing and projection processing, of the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> as mentioned above and representational function of various image data. An image processing apparatus can be built in a PACS (picture archiving and communication system) for example, and can connect to the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> via networks. In this case, part of the image processing function and/or the representational processing function can be omitted from the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b>. However, if both of the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> and the image processing apparatus have the image processing function and the representational processing function, a blood flow image can be displayed as a moving image or a still image in a various displaying method on both of the magnetic resonance imaging apparatus <b>20</b> and the image processing apparatus.</p>
