      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">There is an increasing demand for health and fitness monitors and methods for providing health and fitness monitoring. Monitoring heart rate, for example, is important for various reasons. Monitoring heart rate is critical for athletes in understanding their fitness levels and workouts over time. Conventional techniques for monitoring heart rate have numerous drawbacks. Certain conventional heart rate monitors, for example, require the use of a chest strap or other bulky equipment that causes discomfort and prevents continuous wearing and use. This presents a challenge to adoption and use of such monitors because the monitors are too obtrusive and/or are directed to assessing general well-being rather than continuous, around-the-clock monitoring of fitness. Certain conventional heart rate monitors do not enable continuous sensing of heart rate, thereby preventing continuous fitness monitoring and reliable analysis of physiological data. Additionally, a challenge to adoption of fitness monitors by athletes is the lack of a vibrant and interactive online community for displaying and sharing physiological data among users.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There remains a need for improved continuous heart rate monitoring and interpretation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Disclosed herein is a device for continuous physiological monitoring as well as systems and methods for interpreting and sharing data from such a device. The device may include a wearable strap that automatically and continually determines a heart rate of a user and provides continuous heart rate data. In addition, the device may include a communication system for transmitting and sharing the continuous heart rate data subject to a privacy switch operable by the user that can restrict such communication. For example, the privacy switch may include a shared setting where continuous heart rate data is available to a shared data repository, and a private setting where continuous heart rate data is not shared by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In general, embodiments may provide physiological measurement systems, devices, and methods for continuous health and fitness monitoring. A lightweight wearable system with a strap may collect various physiological data continuously from a wearer without the need for additional sensing devices. The systems may also enable monitoring of one or more physiological parameters in addition to heart rate including, but not limited to, body temperature, heart rate variability, motion, sleep, stress, fitness level, recovery level, effect of a workout routine on health, caloric expenditure, and the like. Embodiments may also include computer-executable instructions that, when executed, enable automatic interpretation of one or more physiological parameters to assess the cardiovascular intensity experienced by a user (embodied in an intensity score or indicator) and the user's recovery after physical exertion (embodied in a recovery score). These indicators or scores may be displayed to assist a user in managing the user's health and exercise regimen.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In one aspect, a device includes a strap shaped and sized to fit about an appendage, a heart rate monitoring system coupled to the strap and configured to provide two or more different modes for detecting a heart rate of a wearer of the strap, a sensor coupled to the strap, a memory, and a processor coupled to the strap. The processor may be configured to sense a condition based on a signal from the sensor and to select one of the two or more different modes for detecting the heart rate based on the condition. The processor may be further configured to operate the heart rate monitoring system to obtain continuous heart rate data using one of the two or more different modes and to store the continuous heart rate data in the memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Implementations may have one or more of the following features. The condition may be an accuracy of heart rate detection determined using a statistical analysis to provide a confidence level in the accuracy. The processor may be configured to select a different one of the modes when the confidence level is below a predetermined threshold. The different one of the modes may employ a frequency domain technique. The condition may include a power consumption, a battery charge level, a user activity, or the like. The user activity may include one or more of exercise, rest, and sleep. The condition may include a location of the sensor or a motion of the sensor. The different modes may include at least one mode using light emitted from a light source on the strap and detected by an optical detector on the strap. The at least one mode may employ a peak detection technique applied to signals from the optical detector. The at least one mode may employ a frequency domain technique applied to signals from the optical detector. The different modes may include one or more modes using variable optical characteristics of the light source. The variable optical characteristics may include at least one of a brightness of the light source, a duty cycle of the light source, and a color of the light source. The different modes may include at least one non-optical mode. The sensor may include one or more of a motion sensor, a position sensor, a timer, a temperature sensor, a electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor (also referred to as a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor), and a humidity sensor.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In another aspect, a method includes providing a strap shaped and sized to fit about an appendage, where the strap includes a sensor and a heart rate monitoring system configured to provide two or more different modes for detecting a heart rate of a wearer of the strap. The method may further include detecting a signal from the sensor, determining a condition of the heart rate monitoring system based upon the signal, selecting one of the two or more different modes for detecting the heart rate based on the condition, and storing continuous heart rate data using the one of the two or more different modes.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Implementations may have one or more of the following features. The method may include communicating the continuous heart rate data from the strap to a remote data repository. The method may include detecting a change in the condition, responsively selecting a different one of the two or more different modes, and storing additional continuous heart rate data obtained using the different one of the two or more different modes.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, in which preferred embodiments are shown. The foregoing may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the illustrated embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these illustrated embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will convey the scope to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. References to items in the singular should be understood to include items in the plural, and vice versa, unless explicitly stated otherwise or clear from the text. Grammatical conjunctions are intended to express any and all disjunctive and conjunctive combinations of conjoined clauses, sentences, words, and the like, unless otherwise stated or clear from the context. Thus, the term âorâ should generally be understood to mean âand/orâ and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Recitations of ranges of values herein are not intended to be limiting, referring instead individually to any and all values falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value within such a range is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. The words âabout,â âapproximately,â or the like, when accompanying a numerical value, are to be construed as indicating a deviation as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art to operate satisfactorily for an intended purpose. Ranges of values and/or numeric values are provided herein as examples only, and do not constitute a limitation on the scope of the described embodiments. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (âe.g.,â âsuch as,â or the like) provided herein, is intended merely to better illuminate the embodiments and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the embodiments. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any unclaimed element as essential to the practice of the embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In the following description, it is understood that terms such as âfirst,â âsecond,â âabove,â âbelow,â and the like, are words of convenience and are not to be construed as limiting terms.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Exemplary embodiments provide physiological measurement systems, devices and methods for continuous health and fitness monitoring, and provide improvements to overcome the drawbacks of conventional heart rate monitors. One aspect of the present disclosure is directed to providing a lightweight wearable system with a strap that collects various physiological data or signals from a wearer. The strap may be used to position the system on an appendage or extremity of a user, for example, wrist, ankle, and the like. Exemplary systems are wearable and enable real-time and continuous monitoring of heart rate without the need for a chest strap or other bulky equipment which could otherwise cause discomfort and prevent continuous wearing and use. The system may determine the user's heart rate without the use of electrocardiography and without the need for a chest strap. Exemplary systems can thereby be used in not only assessing general well-being but also in continuous monitoring of fitness. Exemplary systems also enable monitoring of one or more physiological parameters in addition to heart rate including, but not limited to, body temperature, heart rate variability, motion, sleep, stress, fitness level, recovery level, effect of a workout routine on health and fitness, caloric expenditure, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">A health or fitness monitor that includes bulky components may hinder continuous wear. Existing fitness monitors often include the functionality of a watch, thereby making the health or fitness monitor quite bulky and inconvenient for continuous wear. Accordingly, one aspect is directed to providing a wearable health or fitness system that does not include bulky components, thereby making the bracelet slimmer, unobtrusive and appropriate for continuous wear. The ability to continuously wear the bracelet further allows continuous collection of physiological data, as well as continuous and more reliable health or fitness monitoring. For example, embodiments of the bracelet disclosed herein allow users to monitor data at all times, not just during a fitness session. In some embodiments, the wearable system may or may not include a display screen for displaying heart rate and other information. In other embodiments, the wearable system may include one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) to provide feedback to a user and display heart rate selectively. In some embodiments, the wearable system may include a removable or releasable modular head that may provide additional features and may display additional information. Such a modular head can be releasably installed on the wearable system when additional information display is desired, and removed to improve the comfort and appearance of the wearable system. In other embodiments, the head may be integrally formed in the wearable system.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Exemplary embodiments also include computer-executable instructions that, when executed, enable automatic interpretation of one or more physiological parameters to assess the cardiovascular intensity experienced by a user (embodied in an intensity score or indicator) and the user's recovery after physical exertion or daily stress given sleep and other forms of rest (embodied in a recovery score). These indicators or scores may be stored and displayed in a meaningful format to assist a user in managing his health and exercise regimen. Exemplary computer-executable instructions may be provided in a cloud implementation.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Exemplary embodiments also provide a vibrant and interactive online community, in the form of a website, for displaying and sharing physiological data among users. A user of the website may include an individual whose health or fitness is being monitored, such as an individual wearing a wearable system disclosed herein, an athlete, a sports team member, a personal trainer or a coach. In some embodiments, a user may pick his/her own trainer from a list to comment on their performance. Exemplary systems have the ability to stream all physiological information wirelessly, directly or through a mobile communication device application, to an online website using data transfer to a cell phone/computer. This information, as well as any data described herein, may be encrypted (e.g., the data may include encrypted biometric data). Thus, the encrypted data may be streamed to a secure server for processing. In this manner, only authorized users will be able to view the data and any associated scores. In addition, or in the alternative, the website may allow users to monitor their own fitness results, share information with their teammates and coaches, compete with other users, and win status. Both the wearable system and the website allow a user to provide feedback regarding his/her day, exercise and/or sleep, which enables recovery and performance ratings.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In an exemplary technique of data transmission, data collected by a wearable system may be transmitted directly to a cloud-based data storage, from which data may be downloaded for display and analysis on a website. In another exemplary technique of data transmission, data collected by a wearable system may be transmitted via a mobile communication device application to a cloud-based data storage, from which data may be downloaded for display and analysis on a website.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In some embodiments, the website may be a social networking site. In some embodiments, the website may be displayed using a mobile website or a mobile application. In some embodiments, the website may be configured to communicate data to other websites or applications. In some embodiments, the website may be configured to provide an interactive user interface. The website may be configured to display results based on analysis on physiological data received from one or more devices. The website may be configured to provide competitive ways to compare one user to another, and ultimately a more interactive experience for the user. For example, in some embodiments, instead of merely comparing a user's physiological data and performance relative to that user's past performances, the user may be allowed to compete with other users and the user's performance may be compared to that of other users.</p>

In an exemplary embodiment, the pointing device may allow a user to provide input to the computer using physical gestures, for example, pointing, clicking, dragging, and dropping. Exemplary pointing devices may include, but are not limited to, a mouse, a touchpad, a touchscreen, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The term âmulti-chip module,â as used herein, refers to an electronic package in which multiple integrated circuits (IC) are packaged with a unifying substrate, facilitating their use as a single component, i.e., as a higher processing capacity IC packaged in a much smaller volume.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The term âcomputer-readable medium,â as used herein, refers to a non-transitory storage hardware, non-transitory storage device or non-transitory computer system memory that may be accessed by a controller, a microcontroller, a computational system or a module of a computational system to encode thereon computer-executable instructions or software programs. The âcomputer-readable mediumâ may be accessed by a computational system or a module of a computational system to retrieve and/or execute the computer-executable instructions or software programs encoded on the medium. The non-transitory computer-readable media may include, but are not limited to, one or more types of hardware memory, non-transitory tangible media (for example, one or more magnetic storage disks, one or more optical disks, one or more USB flash drives), computer system memory or random access memory (such as, DRAM, SRAM, EDO RAM) and the like.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The term âequal,â as used herein, refers, in a broad lay sense, to exact equality or approximate equality within some tolerance.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">II. Exemplary Wearable Physiological Measurement Systems</heading>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Exemplary embodiments provide wearable physiological measurements systems that are configured to provide continuous measurement of heart rate. Exemplary systems are configured to be continuously wearable on an appendage, for example, wrist or ankle, and do not rely on electrocardiography or chest straps in detection of heart rate. The exemplary system includes one or more light emitters for emitting light at one or more desired frequencies toward the user's skin, and one or more light detectors for received light reflected from the user's skin. The light detectors may include a photo-resistor, a photo-transistor, a photo-diode, and the like. As light from the light emitters (for example, green light) pierces through the skin of the user, the blood's natural absorbance or transmittance for the light provides fluctuations in the photo-resistor readouts. These waves have the same frequency as the user's pulse since increased absorbance or transmittance occurs only when the blood flow has increased after a heartbeat. The system includes a processing module implemented in software, hardware or a combination thereof for processing the optical data received at the light detectors and continuously determining the heart rate based on the optical data. The optical data may be combined with data from one or more motion sensors, e.g., accelerometers and/or gyroscopes, to minimize or eliminate noise in the heart rate signal caused by motion or other artifacts (or with other optical data of another wavelength).</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates front and back perspective views of one embodiment of a wearable system configured as a bracelet <b>100</b> including one or more straps <b>102</b>. <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show various exemplary embodiments of a bracelet according to aspects disclosed herein. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary user interface of a bracelet. The bracelet is sleek and lightweight, thereby making it appropriate for continuous wear. The bracelet may or may not include a display screen, e.g., a screen <b>106</b> such as a light emitting diode (LED) display for displaying any desired data (e.g., instantaneous heart rate), as shown and described below with reference to the exemplary embodiments in <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">As shown in the non-limiting embodiment in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the strap <b>102</b> of the bracelet may have a wider side and a narrower side. In one embodiment, a user may simply insert the narrower side into the thicker side and squeeze the two together until the strap is tight around the wrist, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. To remove the strap, a user may push the strap further inwards, which unlocks the strap and allows it to be released from the wrist. In other embodiments, various other fastening means may be provided. For example, the fastening mechanism may include, without limitation, a clasp, clamp, clip, dock, friction fit, hook and loop, latch, lock, pin, screw, slider, snap, button, spring, yoke, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In some embodiments, the strap of the bracelet may be a slim elastic band formed of any suitable elastic material, for example, rubber. Certain embodiments of the wearable system may be configured to have one size that fits all. Other embodiments may provide the ability to adjust for different wrist sizes. In one aspect, a combination of constant module strap material, a spring-loaded, floating optical system and a silicon-rubber finish may be used in order to achieve coupling while maintaining the strap's comfort for continuous use. Use of medical-grade materials to avoid skin irritations may be utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the wearable system may include components configured to provide various functions such as data collection and streaming functions of the bracelet. In some embodiments, the wearable system may include a button underneath the wearable system. In some embodiments, the button may be configured such that, when the wearable system is properly tightened to one's wrist as shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, the button may press down and activate the bracelet to begin storing information. In other embodiments, the button may be disposed and configured such that it may be pressed manually at the discretion of a user to begin storing information or otherwise to mark the start or end of an activity period. In some embodiments, the button may be held to initiate a time stamp and held again to end a time stamp, which may be transmitted, directly or through a mobile communication device application, to a website as a time stamp.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Time stamp information may be used, for example, as a privacy setting to indicate periods of activity during which physiological data may not be shared with other users. In one aspect, the button may be tapped, double-tapped (or triple-tapped or more), or held down in order to perform different functions or display different information (e.g., display battery information, generate time stamps, etc.). Other implementations may include more or less buttons or other forms of interfaces. More general, a privacy switch such as any of the user inputs or controls described herein may be operated to control restrictions on sharing, distribution, or use of heart rate or other continuously monitored physiological data. For example, the privacy switch may include a toggle switch to switch between a private setting where data is either not gathered at all or where data is stored locally for a user, and between a public, shared, or other non-private setting where data is communicated over a network and/or to a shared data repository. The privacy switch may also support numerous levels of privacy, e.g., using a hierarchical, role-based, and/or identity-based arrangement of permitted users and/or uses. As another example, various levels of privacy may be available for the type and amount of data that is shared versus private. In general, the privacy switch may be a physical switch on the wearable system, or a logical switch or the like maintained on a computer or other local or mobile computing device of the user, or on a website or other network-accessible resource where the user can select and otherwise control privacy settings for monitored physiological data.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">In some embodiments, the wearable system may be waterproof so that users never need to remove it, thereby allowing for continuous wear.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The wearable system may include a heart rate monitor. In one example, the heart rate may be detected from the radial artery, in the exemplary positioning shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. See, Certified Nursing Association, âRegular monitoring of your patient's radial pulse can help you detect changes in their condition and assist in providing potentially life-saving care.â See, http://cnatraininghelp.com/cna-skills/counting-and-recording-a-radial-pulse, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, the wearable system may include a pulse sensor. In one embodiment, the wearable system may be configured such that, when a user wears it around their wrist and tightens it, the sensor portion of the wearable system is secured over the user's radial artery or other blood vessel. Secure connection and placement of the pulse sensor over the radial artery or other blood vessel may allow measurement of heart rate and pulse. It will be understood that this configuration is provided by way of example only, and that other sensors, sensor positions, and monitoring techniques may also or instead be employed without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In some embodiments, the pulse or heart rate may be taken using an optical sensor coupled with one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs), all directly in contact with the user's wrist. The LEDs are provided in a suitable position from which light can be emitted into the user's skin. In one example, the LEDs mounted on a side or top surface of a circuit board in the system to prevent heat buildup on the LEDs and to prevent burns on the skin. The circuit board may be designed with the intent of dissipating heat, e.g., by including thick conductive layers, exposed copper, heatsink, or similar. In one aspect, the pulse repetition frequency is such that the amount of power thermally dissipated by the LED is negligible. Cleverly designed elastic wrist straps can ensure that the sensors are always in contact with the skin and that there is a minimal amount of outside light seeping into the sensors. In addition to the elastic wrist strap, the design of the strap may allow for continuous micro adjustments (no preset sizes) in order to achieve an optimal fit, and a floating sensor module. The sensor module may be free to move with the natural movements caused by flexion and extension of the wrist.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In some embodiments, the wearable system may be configured to record other physiological parameters including, but not limited to, skin temperature (using a thermometer), galvanic skin response (using a galvanic skin response sensor), motion (using one or more multi-axes accelerometers and/or gyroscope), and the like, and environmental or contextual parameters, e.g., ambient temperature, humidity, time of day, and the like. In an implementation, sensors are used to provide at least one of continuous motion detection, environmental temperature sensing, electrodermal activity (EDA) sensing, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensing, and the like. In this manner, an implementation can identify the cause of a detected physiological event. Reflectance PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (RPPG) may be used for the detection of cardiac activity, which may provide for non-intrusive data collection, usability in wet, dusty and otherwise harsh environments, and low power requirements. For example, as explained herein, using the physiological readouts of the device and the analytics described herein, an âIntensity Scoreâ (e.g., 0-21) (e.g., that measures a user's recent exertion), a âRecovery Scoreâ (e.g., 0-100%), and âSleep Scoreâ (e.g., 0-100) may together measure readiness for physical and psychological exertion.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In some embodiments, the wearable system may further be configured such that a button underneath the system may be pressed against the user's wrist, thus triggering the system to begin one or more of collecting data, calculating metrics and communicating the information to a network. In some embodiments, the sensor used for, e.g., measuring heart rate or GSR or any combination of these, may be used to indicate whether the user is wearing the wearable system or not. In some embodiments, power to the one or more LEDs may be cut off as soon as this situation is detected, and reset once the user has put the wearable system back on their wrist.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The wearable system may include one, two or more sources of battery life, e.g., two or more batteries. In some embodiments, it may have a battery that can slip in and out of the head of the wearable system and can be recharged using an included accessory. Additionally, the wearable system may have a built-in battery that is less powerful. When the more powerful battery is being charged, the user does not need to remove the wearable system and can still record data (during sleep, for example).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In some embodiments, an application associated with data from an exemplary wearable system (e.g., a mobile communication device application) may include a user input component for enabling additional contextual data, e.g., emotional (e.g., the user's feelings), perceived intensity, and the like. When the data is uploaded from the wearable system directly or indirectly to a website, the website may record a user's âVibesâ alongside their duration of exercise and sleep.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In exemplary embodiments, the wearable system is enabled to automatically detect when the user is asleep, awake but at rest and exercising based on physiological data collected by the system.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">As shown in the exemplary embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a rotatable wheel <b>108</b> may be provided at the center of the wearable system to control whether the system is displaying the heart rate. For example, when the wheel is turned to the right however, the system continuously shows heart rate, and turns off the heart rate display when the wheel is turned to the right again. In one example, turning the wheel to the right and holding it there creates a time stamp to indicate the duration of exercise. Turning the wheel to the left and holding it there forces data transmission to a cell phone, external computer or the Internet. In other embodiments, the wheel <b>108</b> may be absent in the wearable system. In some embodiments, the functionality of a rotatable wheel described herein may be provided in an application of a mobile communication device that is associated with physiological data collected from a wearable system.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> shows a block diagram illustrating exemplary components of a wearable physiological measurement system <b>600</b> configured to provide continuous collection and monitoring of physiological data. The wearable system <b>600</b> includes one or more sensors <b>602</b>. As discussed above, the sensors <b>602</b> may include a heart rate monitor. In some embodiments, the wearable system <b>600</b> may further include one or more of sensors for detecting calorie burn, distance and activity. Calorie burn may be based on a user's heart rate, and a calorie burn measurement may be improved if a user chooses to provide his or her weight and/or other physical parameters.

      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Exemplary systems include a processing module configured to filter the raw photoplethysmography data received from the light detectors to minimize contributions due to motion, and subsequently process the filtered data to detect peaks in the data that correspond with heart beats of a user. The overall algorithm for detecting heart beats takes as input the analog signals from optical sensors (mV) and accelerometer, and outputs an implied beats per minute (heart rate) of the signal accurate within a few beats per minute as that determined by an electrocardiography machine even during motion.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">In one aspect, using multiple LEDs with different wavelengths reacting to movement in different ways can allow for signal recovery with standard signal processing techniques. The availability of accelerometer information can also be used to compensate for coarse movement signal corruption. In order to increase the range of movements that the algorithm can successfully filter out, an aspect utilizes techniques that augment the algorithm already in place. For example, filtering violent movements of the arm during very short periods of time, such as boxing as exercising, may be utilized by the system. By selective sampling and interpolating over these impulses, an aspect can account for more extreme cases of motion. Additionally, an investigation into different LED wavelengths, intensities, and configurations can allow the systems described herein to extract a signal across a wide spectrum of skin types and wrist sizes. In other words, motion filtering algorithms and signal processing techniques may assist in mitigating the risk caused by movement.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary signal processing algorithm for generating a sequence of heart rates for every detected heartbeat that is embodied in computer-executable instructions stored on one or more non-transitory computer-readable media. In step <b>902</b>, light emitters of a wearable physiological measurement system emit light toward a user's skin. In step <b>904</b>, light reflected from the user's skin is detected at the light detectors in the system. In step <b>906</b>, signals or data associated with the reflected light are pre-processed using any suitable technique to facilitate detection of heart beats. In step <b>908</b>, a processing module of the system executes one or more computer-executable instructions associated with a peak detection algorithm to process data corresponding to the reflected light to detect a plurality of peaks associated with a plurality of beats of the user's heart. In step <b>910</b>, the processing module determines an RR interval based on the plurality of peaks detected by the peak detection algorithm. In step <b>912</b>, the processing module determines a confidence level associated with the RR interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Based on the confidence level associated with the RR interval estimate, the processing module selects either the peak detection algorithm or a frequency analysis algorithm to process data corresponding to the reflected light to determine the sequence of instantaneous heart rates of the user. The frequency analysis algorithm may process the data corresponding to the reflected light based on the motion of the user detected using, for example, an accelerometer. The processing module may select the peak detection algorithm or the frequency analysis algorithm regardless of a motion status of the user. It is advantageous to use the confidence in the estimate in deciding whether to switch to frequency-based methods as certain frequency-based approaches are unable to obtain accurate RR intervals for heart rate variability analysis. Therefore, an implementation maintains the ability to obtain the RR intervals for as long as possible, even in the case of motion, thereby maximizing the information that can be extracted.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">For example, in step <b>914</b>, it is determined whether the confidence level associated with the RR interval is above (or equal to or above) a threshold. In certain embodiments, the threshold may be predefined, for example, about 50%-90% in some embodiments and about 80% in one non-limiting embodiment. In other embodiments, the threshold may be adaptive, i.e., the threshold may be dynamically and automatically determined based on previous confidence levels. For example, if one or more previous confidence levels were high (i.e., above a certain level), the system may determine that a present confidence level that is relatively low compared to the previous levels is indicative of a less reliable signal. In this case, the threshold may be dynamically adjusted to be higher so that a frequency-based analysis method may be selected to process the less reliable signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">If the confidence level is above (or equal to or above) the threshold, in step <b>916</b>, the processing module may use the plurality of peaks to determine an instantaneous heart rate of the user. On the other hand, in step <b>920</b>, based on a determination that the confidence level associated with the RR interval is equal to or below the predetermined threshold, the processing module may execute one or more computer-executable instructions associated with the frequency analysis algorithm to determine an instantaneous heart rate of the user. The confidence threshold may be dynamically set based on previous confidence levels.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In some embodiments, in steps <b>918</b> or <b>922</b>, the processing module determines a heart rate variability of the user based on the sequence of the instantaneous heart rates/beats.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">The system may include a display device configured to render a user interface for displaying the sequence of the instantaneous heart rates of the user, the RR intervals and/or the heart rate variability determined by the processing module. The system may include a storage device configured to store the sequence of the instantaneous heart rates, the RR intervals and/or the heart rate variability determined by the processing module.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">In one aspect, the system may switch between different analytical techniques for determining a heart rate such as a statistical technique for detecting a heart rate and a frequency domain technique for detecting a heart rate. These two different modes have different advantages in terms of accuracy, processing efficiency, and information content, and as such may be useful at different times and under different conditions. Rather than selecting one such mode or technique as an attempted optimization, the system may usefully switch back and forth between these differing techniques, or other analytical techniques, using a predetermined criterion. For example, where statistical techniques are used, a confidence level may be determined and used as a threshold for switching to an alternative technique such as a frequency domain technique. The threshold may also or instead depend on historical, subjective, and/or adapted data for a particular user. For example, selection of a threshold may depend on data for a particular user including without limitation subjective information about how a heart rate for a particular user responds to stress, exercise, and so forth. Similarly, the threshold may adapt to changes in fitness of a user, context provided from other sensors of the wearable system, signal noise, and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">An exemplary statistical technique employs probabilistic peak detection. In this technique, a discrete probabilistic step may be set, and a likelihood function may be established as a mixture of a Gaussian random variable and a uniform. The heart of the likelihood function encodes the assumption that with a first probability (p) the peak detection algorithm has produced a reasonable initial estimate, but with a second probability (1âp) it has not. In a subsequent step, Bayes' rule is applied to determine the posterior density on the parameter space, of which the maximum is taken (that is, the argument (parameter) that maximizes the posterior distribution). This value is the estimate for the heart rate. In a subsequent step, the previous two steps are reapplied for the rest of the sample. There is some variance in the signal due to process noise, which is dependent on the length of the interval. This process noise becomes the variance in the Gaussians used for the likelihood function. Then, the estimate is obtained as the maximum a posteriori on the new posterior distribution. A confidence value is recorded for the estimate which, for some precision measurement, the posterior value is summed at points in the parameter space centered at our estimate+/âthe precision.</p>

      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0122">An exemplary frequency analysis algorithm used in an implementation isolates the highest frequency components of the optical data, checks for harmonics common in both the accelerometer data and the optical data, and performs filtering of the optical data. The algorithm takes as input raw analog signals from the accelerometer (3-axis) and pulse sensors, and outputs heart rate values or beats per minute (BPM) for a given period of time related to the window of the spectrogram.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0123">The isolation of the highest frequency components is performed in a plurality of stages, gradually winnowing the window-sizes of consideration, thereby narrowing the range of errors. In one implementation, a spectrogram of 2Ì15 samples with overlap 2Ì13 samples of the optical data is generated. The spectrogram is restricted to frequencies in which heart rate can lie. These restriction boundaries may be updated when smaller window sizes are considered. The frequency estimate is extracted from the spectrogram by identifying the most prominent frequency component of the spectrogram for the optical data. The frequency may be extracted using the following exemplary steps. The most prominent frequency of the spectrogram is identified in the signal. It is determined if the frequency estimate is a harmonic of the true frequency. The frequency estimate is replaced with the true frequency if the estimate is a harmonic of the true frequency. It is determined if the current frequency estimate is a harmonic of the motion sensor data. The frequency estimate is replaced with a previous temporal estimate if it is a harmonic of the motion sensor data. The upper and lower bounds on the frequency obtained are saved. A constant value may be added or subtracted in some cases. In subsequent steps, the constant added or subtracted may be reduced to provide narrower searches. A number of the previous steps are repeated one or more times, e.g., three times, except taking 2Ì {15âi} samples for the window size and 2Ì{13âi} for the overlap in the spectrogram where i is the current number of iteration. The final output is the average of the final symmetric endpoints of the frequency estimation.</p>

      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0125">The algorithm's performance comes from a combination of a probabilistic and frequency based approach. The three difficulties in creating algorithms for heart rate calculations from the PPG data are 1) false detections of beats, 2) missed detections of real beats, and 3) errors in the precise timing of the beat detection. The algorithms disclosed herein provide improvements in these three sources of error and, in some cases, the error is bound to within 2 BPM of ECG values at all times even during the most motion intense activities.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0126">The exemplary wearable system computes heart rate variability (HRV) to obtain an understanding of the recovery status of the body. These values are captured right before a user awakes or when the user is not moving, in both cases photoplethysmography (PPG) variability yielding equivalence to the ECG HRV. HRV is traditionally measured using an ECG machine and obtaining a time series of R-R intervals. Because an exemplary wearable system utilizes photoplethysmography (PPG), it does not obtain the electric signature from the heart beats; instead, the peaks in the obtained signal correspond to arterial blood volume. At rest, these peaks are directly correlated with cardiac cycles, which enables the calculation of HRV via analyzing peak-to-peak intervals (the PPG analog of RR intervals). It has been demonstrated in the medical literature that these peak-to-peak intervals, the âPPG variability,â is identical to ECG HRV while at rest.

      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0127">Exemplary physiological measurement systems are configured to minimize power consumption so that the systems may be worn continuously without requiring power recharging at frequent intervals. The majority of current draw in an exemplary system is allocated to power the light emitters, e.g., LEDs, the wireless transceiver, the microcontroller and peripherals. In one embodiment, the circuit board of the system may include a boost converter that runs a current of about 10 mA through each of the light emitters with an efficiency of about 80% and may draw power directly from the batteries at substantially constant power. With exemplary batteries at about 3.7 V, the current draw from the battery may be about 40 mW. In some embodiments, the wireless transceiver may draw about 10-20 mA of current when it is actively transferring data. In some embodiments, the microcontroller and peripherals may draw about 5 mA of current.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0128">An exemplary system may include a processing module that is configured to automatically adjust one or more operational characteristics of the light emitters and/or the light detectors to minimize power consumption while ensuring that all heart beats of the user are reliably and continuously detected. The operational characteristics may include, but are not limited to, a frequency of light emitted by the light emitters, the number of light emitters activated, a duty cycle of the light emitters, a brightness of the light emitters, a sampling rate of the light detectors, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0129">The processing module may adjust the operational characteristics based on one or more signals or indicators obtained or derived from one or more sensors in the system including, but not limited to, a motion status of the user, a sleep status of the user, historical information on the user's physiological and/or habits, an environmental or contextual condition (e.g., ambient light conditions), a physical characteristic of the user (e.g., the optical characteristics of the user's skin), and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0130">In one embodiment, the processing module may receive data on the motion of the user using, for example, an accelerometer. The processing module may process the motion data to determine a motion status of the user which indicates the level of motion of the user, for example, exercise, light motion (e.g., walking), no motion or rest, sleep, and the like. The processing module may adjust the duty cycle of one or more light emitters and the corresponding sampling rate of the one or more light detectors based on the motion status. For example, upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a first higher level of motion, the processing module may activate the light emitters at a first higher duty cycle and sample the reflected light using light detectors sampling at a first higher sampling rate. Upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a second lower level of motion, the processing module may activate the light emitters at a second lower duty cycle and sample the reflected light using light detectors sampling at a second lower sampling rate. That is, the duty cycle of the light emitters and the corresponding sampling rate of the light detectors may be adjusted in a graduated or continuous manner based on the motion status or level of motion of the user. This adjustment ensures that heart rate data is detected at a sufficiently high frequency during motion to reliably detect all of the heart beats of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0131">In non-limiting examples, the light emitters may be activated at a duty cycle ranging from about 1% to about 100%. In another example, the light emitters may be activated at a duty cycle ranging from about 20% to about 50% to minimize power consumption. Certain exemplary sampling rates of the light detectors may range from about 50 Hz to about 1000 Hz, but are not limited to these exemplary rates. Certain non-limiting sampling rates are, for example, about 100 Hz, 200 Hz, 500 Hz, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0132">In one non-limiting example, the light detectors may sample continuously when the user is performing an exercise routine so that the error standard deviation is kept within 5 beats per minute (BPM). When the user is at rest, the light detectors may be activated for about a 1% duty cycle-10 milliseconds each second (i.e., 1% of the time) so that the error standard deviation is kept within 5 BPM (including an error standard deviation in the heart rate measurement of 2 BPM and an error standard deviation in the heart rate changes between measurement of 3 BPM). When the user is in light motion (e.g., walking), the light detectors may be activated for about a 10% duty cycle-100 milliseconds each second (i.e., 10% of the time) so that the error standard deviation is kept within 6 BPM (including an error standard deviation in the heart rate measurement of 2 BPM and an error standard deviation in the heart rate changes between measurement of 4 BPM).</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0133">The processing module may adjust the brightness of one or more light emitters by adjusting the current supplied to the light emitters. For example, a first level of brightness may be set by current ranging between about 1 mA to about 10 mA, but is not limited to this exemplary range. A second higher level of brightness may be set by current ranging from about 11 mA to about 30 mA, but is not limited to this exemplary range. A third higher level of brightness may be set by current ranging from about 80 mA to about 120 mA, but is not limited to this exemplary range. In one non-limiting example, first, second and third levels of brightness may be set by current of about 5 mA, about 20 mA and about 100 mA, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0134">In some embodiments, the processing module may detect an environmental or contextual condition (e.g., level of ambient light) and adjust the brightness of the light emitters accordingly to ensure that the light detectors reliably detect light reflected from the user's skin while minimizing power consumption. For example, if it is determined that the ambient light is at a first higher level, the brightness of the light emitters may be set at a first higher level. If it is determined that the ambient light is at a second lower level, the brightness of the light emitters may be set at a second lower level. In some cases, the brightness may be adjusted in a continuous manner based on the detected environment condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0135">In some embodiments, the processing module may detect a physiological condition of the user (e.g., an optical characteristic of the user's skin) and adjust the brightness of the light emitters accordingly to ensure that the light detectors reliably detect light reflected from the user's skin while minimizing power consumption. For example, if it is determined that the user's skin is highly reflective, the brightness of the light emitters may be set at a first lower level. If it is determined that the user's skin is not very reflective, the brightness of the light emitters may be set at a second higher level.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0136">Shorter-wavelength LEDs may require more power than is required by longer-wavelength LEDs. Therefore, an exemplary wearable system may provide and use light emitted at two or more different frequencies based on the level of motion detected in order to save battery life. For example, upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a first higher level of motion (e.g., exercising), one or more light emitters may be activated to emit light at a first wavelength. Upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a second lower level of motion (e.g., at rest), one or more light emitters may be activated to emit light at a second wavelength that is longer than the first wavelength. Upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a third lower level of motion (e.g., sleeping), one or more light emitters may be activated to emit light at a third wavelength that is longer than the first and second wavelengths. Other levels of motion may be predetermined and corresponding wavelengths of emitted light may be selected. The threshold levels of motion that trigger adjustment of the light wavelength may be based on one or more factors including, but are not limited to, skin properties, ambient light conditions, and the like. Any suitable combination of light wavelengths may be selected, for example, green (for a higher level of motion)/red (for a lower level of motion); red (for a higher level of motion)/infrared (for a lower level of motion); blue (for a higher level of motion)/green (for a lower level of motion); and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0137">Shorter-wavelength LEDs may require more power than is required by other types of heart rate sensors, such as, a piezo-sensor or an infrared sensor. Therefore, an exemplary wearable system may provide and use a unique combination of sensorsâone or more light detectors for periods where motion is expected and one or more piezo and/or infrared sensors for low motion periods (e.g., sleep)âto save battery life. Certain other embodiments of a wearable system may exclude piezo-sensors and/or infrared sensors.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0138">For example, upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a first higher level of motion (e.g., exercising), one or more light emitters may be activated to emit light at a first wavelength. Upon determining that the motion status indicates that the user is at a second lower level of motion (e.g., at rest), non-light based sensors may be activated. The threshold levels of motion that trigger adjustment of the type of sensor may be based on one or more factors including, but are not limited to, skin properties, ambient light conditions, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0139">The system may determine the type of sensor to use at a given time based on the level of motion (e.g., via an accelerometer) and whether the user is asleep (e.g., based on movement input, skin temperature and heart rate). Based on a combination of these factors the system selectively chooses which type of sensor to use in monitoring the heart rate of the user. Common symptoms of being asleep are periods of no movement or small bursts of movement (such as shifting in bed), lower skin temperature (although it is not a dramatic drop from normal), drastic GSR changes, and heart rate that is below the typical resting heart rate when the user is awake. These variables depend on the physiology of a person and thus a machine learning algorithm is trained with user-specific input to determine when he/she is awake/asleep and determine from that the exact parameters that cause the algorithm to deem someone asleep.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0140">In an exemplary configuration, the light detectors may be positioned on the underside of the wearable system and all of the heart rate sensors may be positioned adjacent to each other. For example, the low power sensor(s) may be adjacent to the high power sensor(s) as the sensors may be chosen and placed where the strongest signal occurs. In one example configuration, a 3-axis accelerometer may be used that is located on the top part of the wearable system.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0141">In some embodiments, the processing module may be configured to automatically adjust a rate at which data is transmitted by the wireless transmitter to minimize power consumption while ensuring that raw and processed data generated by the system is reliably transmitted to external computing devices. In one embodiment, the processing module determines an amount of data to be transmitted (e.g., based on the amount of data generated since the time of the last data transmission), and may select the next data transmission time based on the amount of data to be transmitted. For example, if it is determined that the amount of data exceeds (or is equal to or greater than) a threshold level, the processing module may transmit the data or may schedule a time for transmitting the data. On the other hand, if it is determined that the amount of data does not exceed (or is equal to or lower than) the threshold level, the processing module may postpone data transmission to minimize power consumption by the transmitter. In one non-limiting example, the threshold may be set to the amount of data that may be sent in two seconds under current conditions. Exemplary data transmission rates may range from about 50 kbytes per second to about 1 MByte per second, but are not limiting to this exemplary range.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0142">In some embodiments, an operational characteristic of the microprocessor may be automatically adjusted to minimize power consumption. This adjustment may be based on a level of motion of the user's body.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0143">More generally, the above description contemplates a variety of techniques for sensing conditions relating to heart rate monitoring or related physiological activity either directly (e.g., confidence levels or accuracy of calculated heart rate) or indirectly (e.g., motion detection, temperature). However measured, these sensed conditions can be used to intelligently select from among a number of different modes, including hardware modes, software modes, and combinations of the foregoing, for monitoring heart rate based on, e.g., accuracy, power usage, detected activity states, and so forth. Thus there is disclosed herein techniques for selecting from among two or more different heart rate monitoring modes according to a sensed condition.</p>

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0144">Exemplary embodiments provide an analytics system for providing qualitative and quantitative monitoring of a user's body, health and physical training. The analytics system is implemented in computer-executable instructions encoded on one or more non-transitory computer-readable media. The analytics system relies on and uses continuous data on one or more physiological parameters including, but not limited to, heart rate. The continuous data used by the analytics system may be obtained or derived from an exemplary physiological measurement system disclosed herein, or may be obtained or derived from a derived source or system, for example, a database of physiological data. In some embodiments, the analytics system computes, stores and displays one or more indicators or scores relating to the user's body, health and physical training including, but not limited to, an intensity score and a recovery score. The scores may be updated in real-time and continuously or at specific time periods, for example, the recovery score may be determined every morning upon waking up, the intensity score may be determined in real-time or after a workout routine or for an entire day.</p>

The intensity score is customized and adapted for the unique physiological properties of the user and takes into account, for example, the user's age, gender, anaerobic threshold, resting heart rate, maximum heart rate, and the like. If determined for an exercise routine, the intensity score provides an indication of the cardiovascular intensities experienced by the user continuously throughout the routine. If determined for a period of including and beyond an exercise routine, the intensity score provides an indication of the cardiovascular intensities experienced by the user during the routine and also the activities the user performed after the routine (e.g., resting on the couch, active day of shopping) that may affect their recovery or exercise readiness.</p>

That is, the unit interval is transformed to have any desired distribution in a scale (e.g., a scale including 21 points from 0 to 21), for example, arctangent, sigmoid, sinusoidal, and the like. In certain distributions, the intensity values increase at a linear rate along the scale, and in others, at the highest ranges the intensity values increase at more than a linear rate to indicate that it is more difficult to climb in the scale toward the extreme end of the scale.

      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0155">To generate an intensity score, the resulting value may be multiplied by a number based on the desired scale of the intensity score. For example, if the intensity score is graduated from zero to 21, then the value may be multiplied by 21.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0156">In step <b>1010</b>, the intensity score values are stored on a non-transitory storage medium for retrieval, display and usage. In step <b>1012</b>, the intensity score values are, in some embodiments, displayed on a user interface rendered on a visual display device. The intensity score values may be displayed as numbers and/or with the aid of graphical tools, e.g., a graphical display of the scale of intensity scores with current score, and the like. In some embodiments, the intensity score may be indicated by audio. In step <b>1012</b>, the intensity score values are, in some embodiments, displayed along with one or more quantitative or qualitative pieces of information on the user including, but not limited to, whether the user has exceeded his/her anaerobic threshold, the heart rate zones experienced by the user during an exercise routine, how difficult an exercise routine was in the context of the user's training, the user's perceived exertion during an exercise routine, whether the exercise regimen of the user should be automatically adjusted (e.g., made easier if the intensity scores are consistently high), whether the user is likely to experience soreness the next day and the level of expected soreness, characteristics of the exercise routine (e.g., how difficult it was for the user, whether the exercise was in bursts or activity, whether the exercise was tapering, etc.), and the like. In one embodiment, the analytics system may automatically generate, store and display an exercise regimen customized based on the intensity scores of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0157">Step <b>1006</b> may use any of a number of exemplary static or dynamic weighting schemes that enable the intensity score to be customized and adapted for the unique physiological properties of the user. In one exemplary static weighting scheme, the weights applied to the HRR values are based on static models of a physiological process. The human body employs different sources of energy with varying efficiencies and advantages at different HRR levels. For example, at the anaerobic threshold (AT), the body shifts to anaerobic respiration in which the cells produce two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules per glucose molecule, as opposed to 36 at lower HRR levels. At even higher HRR levels, there is a further subsequent threshold (CPT) at which creatine triphosphate (CTP) is employed for respiration with even less efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0158">In order to account for the differing levels of cardiovascular exertion and efficiency at the different HRR levels, in one embodiment, the possible values of HRR are divided into a plurality of categories, sections or levels (e.g., three) dependent on the efficiency of cellular respiration at the respective categories. The HRR parameter range may be divided in any suitable manner, such as, piecewise, including piecewise-linear, piecewise-exponential, and the like. An exemplary piecewise-linear division of the HRR parameter range enables weighting each category with strictly increasing values. This scheme captures an accurate indication of the cardiovascular intensity experienced by the user because it is more difficult to spend time at higher HRR values, which suggests that the weighting function should increase at the increasing weight categories.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0159">In one non-limiting example, the HRR parameter range may be considered a range from zero (0) to one (1) and divided into categories with strictly increasing weights. In one example, the HRR parameter range may be divided into a first category of a zero HRR value and may assign this category a weight of zero; a second category of HRR values falling between zero (0) and the user's anaerobic threshold (AT) and may assign this category a weight of one (1); a third category of HRR values falling between the user's anaerobic threshold (AT) and a threshold at which the user's body employs creatine triphosphate for respiration (CPT) and may assign this category a weight of 18; and a fourth category of HRR values falling between the creatine triphosphate threshold (CPT) and one (1) and may assign this category a weight of 42, although other numbers of HRR categories and different weight values are possible. That is, in this example, the weights are defined as:</p>

      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0160">In another exemplary embodiment of the weighting scheme, the HRR time series is weighted iteratively based on the intensity scores determined thus far (e.g., the intensity score accrued thus far) and the path taken by the HRR values to get to the present intensity score. The path may be detected automatically based on the historical HRR values and may indicate, for example, whether the user is performing high intensity interval training (during which the intensity scores are rapidly rising and falling), whether the user is taking long breaks between bursts of exercise (during which the intensity scores are rising after longer periods), and the like. The path may be used to dynamically determine and adjust the weights applied to the HRR values. For example, in the case of high intensity interval training, the weights applied may be higher than in the case of a more traditional exercise routine.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0161">In another exemplary embodiment of the weighting scheme, a predictive approach is used by modeling the weights or coefficients to be the coefficient estimates of a logistic regression model. In this scheme, a training data set is obtained by continuously detecting the heart rate time series and other personal parameters of a group of individuals. The training data set is used to train a machine learning system to predict the cardiovascular intensities experienced by the individuals based on the heart rate and other personal data. The trained system models a regression in which the coefficient estimates correspond to the weights or coefficients of the weighting scheme. In the training phase, user input on perceived exertion and the intensity scores are compared. The learning algorithm also alters the weighs based on the improving or declining health of a user as well as their qualitative feedback. This yields a unique algorithm that incorporates physiology, qualitative feedback, and quantitative data. In determining a weighting scheme for a specific user, the trained machine learning system is run by executing computer-executable instructions encoded on one or more non-transitory computer-readable media, and generates the coefficient estimates which are then used to weight the user's HRR time series.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0162">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that two or more aspects of any of the disclosed weighting schemes may be applied separately or in combination in an exemplary method for determining an intensity score.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0163">In one aspect, heart rate zones quantify the intensity of workouts by weighing and comparing different levels of heart activity as percentages of maximum heart rate. Analysis of the amount of time an individual spends training at a certain percentage of his/her MHR may reveal his/her state of physical exertion during a workout. This intensity, developed from the heart rate zone analysis, motion, and activity, may then indicate his/her need for rest and recovery after the workout, e.g., to minimize delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and prepare him/her for further activity. As discussed above, MHR, heart rate zones, time spent above the anaerobic threshold, and HRV in RSA (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia) regionsâas well as personal information (gender, age, height, weight, etc.) may be utilized in data processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0164">A recovery score or indicator provides an accurate indication of the level of recovery of a user's body and health after a period of physical exertion. The human autonomic nervous system controls the involuntary aspects of the body's physiology and is typically subdivided into two branches: parasympathetic (deactivating) and sympathetic (activating). Heart rate variability (HRV), i.e., the fluctuation in inter-heartbeat interval time, is a commonly studied result of the interplay between these two competing branches. Parasympathetic activation reflects inputs from internal organs, causing a decrease in heart rate. Sympathetic activation increases in response to stress, exercise and disease, causing an increase in heart rate. For example, when high intensity exercise takes place, the sympathetic response to the exercise persists long after the completion of the exercise. When high intensity exercise is followed by insufficient recovery, this imbalance lasts typically until the next morning, resulting in a low morning HRV. This result should be taken as a warning sign as it indicates that the parasympathetic system was suppressed throughout the night. While suppressed, normal repair and maintenance processes that ordinarily would occur during sleep were suppressed as well. Suppression of the normal repair and maintenance processes results in an unprepared state for the next day, making subsequent exercise attempts more challenging.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0165">The recovery score is customized and adapted for the unique physiological properties of the user and takes into account, for example, the user's heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, sleep quality and recent physiological strain (indicated, in one example, by the intensity score of the user). In one exemplary embodiment, the recovery score is a weighted combination of the user's heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate, sleep quality indicated by a sleep score, and recent strain (indicated, in one example, by the intensity score of the user). In an exemplar, the sleep score combined with performance readiness measures (such as, morning heart rate and morning heart rate variability) provides a complete overview of recovery to the user. By considering sleep and HRV alone or in combination, the user can understand how exercise-ready he/she is each day and to understand how he/she arrived at the exercise-readiness score each day, for example, whether a low exercise-readiness score is a predictor of poor recovery habits or an inappropriate training schedule. This insight aids the user in adjusting his/her daily activities, exercise regimen and sleeping schedule therefore obtain the most out of his/her training.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0166">In some cases, the recovery score may take into account perceived psychological strain experienced by the user. In some cases, perceived psychological strain may be detected from user input via, for example, a questionnaire on a mobile device or web application. In other cases, psychological strain may be determined automatically by detecting changes in sympathetic activation based on one or more parameters including, but not limited to, heart rate variability, heart rate, galvanic skin response, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0167">With regard to the user's HRV used in determining the recovery score, suitable techniques for analyzing HRV include, but are not limited to, time-domain methods, frequency-domain methods, geometric methods and non-linear methods. In one embodiment, the HRV metric of the root-mean-square of successive differences (RMSSD) of RR intervals is used. The analytics system may consider the magnitude of the differences between 7-day moving averages and 3-day moving averages of these readings for a given day. Other embodiments may use PoincarÃ© Plot analysis or other suitable metrics of HRV.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0168">The recovery score algorithm may take into account RHR along with history of past intensity and recovery scores.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0169">With regard to the user's resting heart rate, moving averages of the resting heart rate are analyzed to determine significant deviations. Consideration of the moving averages is important since day-to-day physiological variation is quite large even in healthy individuals. Therefore, the analytics system may perform a smoothing operation to distinguish changes from normal fluctuations.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0170">Although an inactive condition, sleep is a highly active recovery state during which a major portion of the physiological recovery process takes place. Nonetheless, a small, yet significant, amount of recovery can occur throughout the day by rehydration, macronutrient replacement, lactic acid removal, glycogen re-synthesis, growth hormone production and a limited amount of musculoskeletal repair. In assessing the user's sleep quality, the analytics system generates a sleep score using continuous data collected by an exemplary physiological measurement system regarding the user's heart rate, skin conductivity, ambient temperature and accelerometer/gyroscope data throughout the user's sleep. Collection and use of these four streams of data enable an understanding of sleep previously only accessible through invasive and disruptive over-night laboratory testing. For example, an increase in skin conductivity when ambient temperature is not increasing, the wearer's heart rate is low, and the accelerometer/gyroscope shows little motion, may indicate that the wearer has fallen asleep. The sleep score indicates and is a measure of sleep efficiency (how good the user's sleep was) and sleep duration (if the user had sufficient sleep). Each of these measures is determined by a combination of physiological parameters, personal habits and daily stress/strain (intensity) inputs. The actual data measuring the time spent in various stages of sleep may be combined with the wearer's recent daily history and a longer-term data set describing the wearer's personal habits to assess the level of sleep sufficiency achieved by the user. The sleep score is designed to model sleep quality in the context of sleep duration and history. It thus takes advantage of the continuous monitoring nature of the exemplary physiological measurement systems disclosed herein by considering each sleep period in the context of biologically-determined sleep needs, pattern-determined sleep needs and historically-determined sleep debt.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0171">The recovery and sleep score values are stored on a non-transitory storage medium for retrieval, display and usage. The recovery and/or sleep score values are, in some embodiments, displayed on a user interface rendered on a visual display device. The recovery and/or sleep score values may be displayed as numbers and/or with the aid of graphical tools, e.g., a graphical display of the scale of recovery scores with current score, and the like. In some embodiments, the recovery and/or sleep score may be indicated by audio. The recovery score values are, in some embodiments, displayed along with one or more quantitative or qualitative pieces of information on the user including, but not limited to, whether the user has recovered sufficiently, what level of activity the user is prepared to perform, whether the user is prepared to perform an exercise routine a particular desired intensity, whether the user should rest and the duration of recommended rest, whether the exercise regimen of the user should be automatically adjusted (e.g., made easier if the recovery score is low), and the like. In one embodiment, the analytics system may automatically generate, store and display an exercise regimen customized based on the recovery scores of the user alone or in combination with the intensity scores.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0172">As discussed above, the sleep performance metric may be based on parameters like the number of hours of sleep, sleep onset latency, and the number of sleep disturbances. In this manner, the score may compare a tactical athlete's duration and quality of sleep in relation to the tactical athlete's evolving sleep need (e.g., a number of hours based on recent strain, habitual sleep need, signs of sickness, and sleep debt). By way of example, a soldier may have a dynamically changing need for sleep, and it may be important to consider the total hours of sleep in relation to the amount of sleep that may have been required. By providing an accurate sensor for sleep and sleep performance, an aspect may evaluate sleep in the context of the overall day and lifestyle of a specific user.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method by which a user may use intensity and recovery scores. In step <b>1102</b>, the wearable physiological measurement system begins determining heart rate variability (HRV) measurements based on continuous heart rate data collected by an exemplary physiological measurement system. In some cases, it may take the collection of several days of heart rate data to obtain an accurate baseline for the HRV. In step <b>1104</b>, the analytics system may generate and display intensity score for an entire day or an exercise routine. In some cases, the analytics system may display quantitative and/or qualitative information corresponding to the intensity score. <figref>FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an exemplary display of an intensity score index indicated in a circular graphic component with an exemplary current score of 19.0 indicated. The graphic component may indicate a degree of difficulty of the exercise corresponding to the current score selected from, for example, maximum all out, near maximal, very hard, hard, moderate, light, active, light active, no activity, asleep, and the like. The display may indicate, for example, that the intensity score corresponds to a good and tapering exercise routine, that the user did not overcome his anaerobic threshold and that the user will have little to no soreness the next day.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0174">In step <b>1106</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, the analytics system may automatically generate or adjust an exercise routine or regimen based on the user's actual intensity scores or desired intensity scores. For example, based on inputs of the user's actual intensity scores, a desired intensity score (that is higher than the actual intensity scores) and a first exercise routine currently performed by the user (e.g., walking), the analytics system may recommend a second different exercise routine that is typically associated with higher intensity scores than the first exercise routine (e.g., running).</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0175">In step <b>1108</b>, at any given time during the day (e.g., every morning), the analytics system may generate and display a recovery score. In some cases, the analytics system may display quantitative and/or qualitative information corresponding to the intensity score. For example, in step <b>1110</b>, in an exemplary embodiment, the analytics system may determine if the recovery is greater than (or equal to or greater than) a first predetermined threshold (e.g., about 60% to about 80% in some examples) that indicates that the user is recovered and is ready for exercise. If this is the case, in step <b>1112</b>, the analytics system may indicate that the user is ready to perform an exercise routine at a desired intensity or that the user is ready to perform an exercise routine more challenging than the past day's routine. Otherwise, in step <b>1114</b>, the analytics system may determine if the recovery is lower than (or equal to or lower than) a second predetermined threshold (e.g., about 10% to about 40% in some examples) that indicates that the user has not recovered. If this is the case, in step <b>1116</b>, the analytics system may indicate that the user should not exercise and should rest for an extended period. The analytics system may, in some cases, the duration of recommended rest. Otherwise, in step <b>1118</b>, the analytics system may indicate that the user may exercise according to his/her exercise regimen while being careful not to overexert him/herself. The thresholds may, in some cases, be adjusted based on a desired intensity at which the user desires to exercise. For example, the thresholds may be increased for higher planned intensity scores.</p>

      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0177">Optionally, in an exemplary embodiment, the analytics system may automatically generate or adjust an exercise routine or regimen based on the user's actual recovery scores (e.g., to recommend lighter exercise for days during which the user has not recovered sufficiently). This process may also use a combination of the intensity and recovery scores.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0178">The analytics system may, in some embodiments, determine and display the intensity and/or recovery scores of a plurality of users in a comparative manner.

The user interface <b>1500</b> may also provide a user input field <b>1592</b> for enabling the user to indicate other facts about his exercise routine, e.g., comments on what the user was doing at a specific point in the exercise routine with a link <b>1594</b> to a corresponding point in the heart rate graph <b>1530</b>. In some embodiments, the user may specify a route and/or location on a map at which the exercise routine was performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0196">Exemplary embodiments also enable a user to compare his/her quantitative and/or qualitative physiological data with those of one or more additional users. A user may be presented with user selection components representing other users who data is available for display. When a pointer is hovered over a user selection component (e.g., an icon representing a user), a snapshot of the user's information is presented in a popup component, and clicking on the user selection component opens up the full user interface displaying the user's information. In some cases, the user selection components include certain user-specific data surrounding an image representing the user, for example, a graphic element indicating the user's intensity score. The user selection components may be provided in a grid as shown or in a linear listing for easier sorting. The users appearing in the user selection components may be sorted and/or ranked based on any desired criteria, e.g., intensity scores, who is experiencing soreness, and the like. A user may leave comments on other users' pages.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0197">Similarly, a user may select privacy settings to indicate which aspects of his/her own data may be viewed by other users. Because the wearable systems described herein support truly continuous monitoring, a user may wish to carefully control whether and when data is transmitted wirelessly, stored in a remote data repository, and shared with others. A privacy switch as described herein may be usefully employed to toggle between various privacy settings or to explicitly select private or restricted times when no monitoring should occur.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> illustrate an exemplary user interface <b>1900</b> rendered on a visual display device for displaying physiological data on a plurality of users. In some cases, a user may freely compare the data of any users whose data is available and accessible, i.e., set to an appropriate privacy level. In some cases, comparative data may correspond to a plurality of users who may be grouped together based on any suitable criteria, e.g., members of a gym, military team, and the like. In some cases, the user may be able to discover other users or comparable data by searching or performing queries on any desired parameters, for example, workouts, activities, age groups, locations, intensities, recoveries and the like. For example, a user may perform a query for âWorkouts above a <b>17</b> Intensity in Boston for runners my age.â</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0199">The exemplary user interface may also identify or suggest users with whom to exchange data based on similar parameters. Data on any number of users may be presented and compared including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0200">In a default option, data from the same time period(s) may be presented for all of the users. In some embodiments, time periods for each user may be selected independently and data from the selected time periods may be displayed in a comparative manner on the same user interface, e.g., in one or more overlaid graphs. <figref>FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a user interface <b>2000</b> that may be used to independently select time periods of data for each of five users so that the data from the selected periods may be displayed together. The user interface <b>2000</b> includes a representation of each user <b>2002</b><i>a</i>-<b>2002</b><i>e</i>, optionally an indication of each user's intensity score, a calendar component <b>2004</b> for selecting the time periods, and a component <b>2006</b><i>a</i>-<b>2006</b><i>e </i>indicating the time periods selected for each user. In some cases, data from different time periods (but, for example, for the same time duration) for the same user may be presented on the same user interface for comparative purpose, for example, to determine training progress.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0201">In <figref>FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, the user interface <b>1900</b> may include a summary panel <b>1902</b> including an identification <b>1904</b><i>a</i>-<b>1904</b><i>b </i>of the users (e.g., a real or account name) with, optionally, a picture or photo corresponding to the user. In some cases, the summary panel <b>1902</b> may also display certain information associated with the users, for example, their intensity scores.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0202">A workout panel <b>1908</b> may present quantitative information on the users' health and exercise routines, for example, an overlaid graph <b>1910</b> of the users' continuous heart rate during the exercise, statistics <b>1912</b> on the users' maximum heart rate, average heart rate, duration of exercise, number of steps taken and calories expended, zones <b>1914</b> in which the users' maximum heart rate fell during the exercise, and an overlaid graph <b>1916</b> of the intensity scores over a period of time (e.g., seven days). A feedback panel <b>1918</b> associated with the workout panel <b>1908</b> may present comparative qualitative information on the users' exercise routines including, but not limited to, whether the users were working out at the same time, which user had a more difficult workout, the comparative efficiencies of the users, and the like. Similarly, a day panel and a sleep panel may present comparative information for the selected users.</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0203">The analytics system may analyze comparative data among a plurality of users and provide rankings of individuals, teams and groups of individuals (e.g., employees of a company, members of a gym) based on, for example, average intensity scores. For each user, the analytics system may calculate and display percentile rankings of the user with respect to all of the users in a community in terms of, for example, intensity scores, quality of sleep, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0204">Exemplary embodiments also provide user interfaces to enable intuitive and efficient monitoring of a plurality of users by an individual with administrative powers to view the users' health data.

        <figref>FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> illustrate an exemplary user interface <b>2100</b> viewable by an administrative user, including a selectable and editable representation or listing <b>2102</b> of the users (e.g., a trainer's clients) whose health information is available for display. When a mouse is hovered over a user selection component (e.g., an icon representing a user), a snapshot of the user's information is presented in a popup component, and clicking on the user selection component opens up the full user interface displaying the user's information. In some cases, the user selection components include certain user-specific data surrounding an image representing the user, for example, a graphic element indicating the user's intensity score. The user selection components in the listing <b>2102</b> may be provided in a grid as shown or in a linear listing for easier sorting. The users appearing in the listing <b>2102</b> may be sorted and/or ranked based on any desired criteria, e.g., intensity scores, who is experiencing soreness, and the like. Selection of any one user causes the user interface specific to that user to be opened, for example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 15A-18B</figref>. The administrative user may leave messages on the user interfaces of the different users. Selection of more than one user causes a user interface comparing the selected users to be opened, for example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0206">The administrative user interface <b>2100</b> may include a listing of users <b>2104</b> who recently performed exercise routines including the time of their last workout and their intensity scores, a listing of users <b>2106</b> who are off-schedule in their exercise regimen and how many days they have not been exercising, a listing of users <b>2108</b> who are experiencing soreness (that may be determined automatically based on intensity scores), a listing of users who are sleep-deprived (that may be determined automatically based on sleep data), and the like. The user interface <b>2100</b> may also display a calendar or portion of a calendar <b>2110</b> indicating training times for different users. The calendar feature enables the administrative user to review exercise schedules over time and understand how well individuals or teams are meeting goals. For example, the administrative user may determine that an individual is undertraining if his intensity for the day was 18 whereas the team average was 14.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0207">In any of the exemplary user interfaces disclosed herein, color coding may be used to indicate categories of any parameter.

        <figref>FIG. 22</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary computing device <b>2200</b> that may be used in to perform any of the methods provided by exemplary embodiments. The computing device may be configured as an embedded system in the integrated circuit board(s) of a wearable physiological measurements system and/or as an external computing device that may receive data from a wearable physiological measurement system.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0211">The computing device <b>2200</b> includes one or more non-transitory computer-readable media for storing one or more computer-executable instructions or software for implementing exemplary embodiments. The non-transitory computer-readable media may include, but are not limited to, one or more types of hardware memory, non-transitory tangible media (for example, one or more magnetic storage disks, one or more optical disks, one or more USB flash drives), and the like. For example, memory <b>2206</b> included in the computing device <b>2200</b> may store computer-readable and computer-executable instructions or software for implementing exemplary embodiments. The computing device <b>2200</b> also includes processor <b>2202</b> and associated core <b>2204</b>, and optionally, one or more additional processor(s) <b>2202</b>â² and associated core(s) <b>2204</b>â² (for example, in the case of computer systems having multiple processors/cores), for executing computer-readable and computer-executable instructions or software stored in the memory <b>2206</b> and other programs for controlling system hardware. Processor <b>2202</b> and processor(s) <b>2202</b>â² may each be a single core processor or multiple core (<b>2204</b> and <b>2204</b>â²) processor.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0212">Virtualization may be employed in the computing device <b>2200</b> so that infrastructure and resources in the computing device may be shared dynamically. A virtual machine <b>2214</b> may be provided to handle a process running on multiple processors so that the process appears to be using only one computing resource rather than multiple computing resources. Multiple virtual machines may also be used with one processor.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0213">Memory <b>2206</b> may include a computer system memory or random access memory, such as DRAM, SRAM, EDO RAM, and the like. Memory <b>2206</b> may include other types of memory as well, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0214">A user may interact with the computing device <b>2200</b> through a visual display device <b>2218</b>, such as a computer monitor, which may display one or more user interfaces <b>2220</b> that may be provided in accordance with exemplary embodiments. The visual display device <b>2218</b> may also display other aspects, elements and/or information or data associated with exemplary embodiments, for example, views of databases, photos, and the like.

The keyboard <b>2208</b> and the pointing device <b>2210</b> may be coupled to the visual display device <b>2218</b>. The computing device <b>2200</b> may include other suitable conventional I/O peripherals.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0215">The computing device <b>2200</b> may also include one or more storage devices <b>2224</b>, such as a hard-drive, CD-ROM, or other computer readable media, for storing data and computer-readable instructions and/or software that implement exemplary methods as taught herein. Exemplary storage device <b>2224</b> may also store one or more databases <b>2026</b> for storing any suitable information required to implement exemplary embodiments. The databases may be updated by a user or automatically at any suitable time to add, delete or update one or more items in the databases.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0216">The computing device <b>2200</b> may include a network interface <b>2212</b> configured to interface via one or more network devices <b>2222</b> with one or more networks, for example, Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) or the Internet through a variety of connections including, but not limited to, standard telephone lines, LAN or WAN links (for example, 802.11, T1, T3, 56 kb, X.25), broadband connections (for example, ISDN, Frame Relay, ATM), wireless connections, controller area network (CAN), or some combination of any or all of the above. The network interface <b>2212</b> may include a built-in network adapter, network interface card, PCMCIA network card, card bus network adapter, wireless network adapter, USB network adapter, modem or any other device suitable for interfacing the computing device <b>2200</b> to any type of network capable of communication and performing the operations described herein. Moreover, the computing device <b>2200</b> may be any computer system, such as a workstation, desktop computer, server, laptop, handheld computer, tablet computer (e.g., the iPadÂ® tablet computer), mobile computing or communication device (e.g., the iPhoneÂ® communication device), or other form of computing or telecommunications device that is capable of communication and that has sufficient processor power and memory capacity to perform the operations described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0217">The wearable physiological measurement system may record and transmit at least the following types of data to an external computing system, mobile communication system or the Internet: raw continuously-detected data (e.g., heart rate data, movement data, galvanic skin response data) and processed data based on the raw data (e.g., RR intervals determined from the heart rate data). Transmission modes may be wired (e.g., using USB stick inserted into a USB port on the system) or wireless (e.g., using a wireless transmitter). The raw and processed data may be transmitted together or separately using different transmission modes. Since a raw data file is typically substantially larger than a processed data file, the raw data file may be transmitted using WiFi or a USB stick, while the processed data file may be transmitted using Bluetooth.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0218">An exemplary wearable system may include a 2G, 3G or 4G chip that wirelessly uploads all data to the website disclosed herein without requiring any other external device. A 3G or 4G chip may be used preferably as a 2G connection on a Nokia 5800 was found to transfer data at a rate of 520 kbps using 1.69 W, while a 3G connection transferred at 960 kbps using 1.73 W. Therefore, the 3G chip would use negligibly more power for almost twice the transfer speed, thereby halving half the transfer time and using much less energy from the battery.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0219">In some cases, the wearable system may opportunistically transfer data when in close proximity to a streaming outlet. For example, the system may avoid data transmission when it is not within close proximity of a streaming outlet, and, when nearby a streaming outlet (e.g., a linked phone), may send the data to the external device via Bluetooth and to the Internet via the external device. This is both convenient and âfreeâ in the sense that it utilizes existing cellular data plans.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0220">Limiting the frequency with which data is streamed increases the wearable system's battery life. In one non-limiting example, the system may be set to stream automatically in the morning and following a time stamp. Regardless of the data transmission scheme, the system stores all the data it collects. Data may also be streamed on demand by a user, for example, by turning a physical component on the system and holding it or by initiating a process on the mobile application or receiving device. In some embodiments, the data transmission frequency may be automatically adjusted based on one or more physiological parameters, e.g., heart rate. For example, higher heart rates may prompt more frequent and real-time streaming transmission of data.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0221">The computing device <b>2200</b> may run any operating system <b>2216</b>, such as any of the versions of the MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® operating systems, the different releases of the Unix and Linux operating systems, any version of the MacOSÂ® for Macintosh computers, any embedded operating system, any real-time operating system, any open source operating system, any proprietary operating system, any operating systems for mobile computing devices, or any other operating system capable of running on the computing device and performing the operations described herein. In exemplary embodiments, the operating system <b>2216</b> may be run in native mode or emulated mode. In an exemplary embodiment, the operating system <b>2216</b> may be run on one or more cloud machine instances.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 23</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary distributed computer system <b>2300</b> in which various aspects and functions may be practiced. The distributed computer system <b>2300</b> may include one or more computer systems. For example, as illustrated, the distributed computer system <b>2300</b> includes three computer systems <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b> and <b>2306</b>. As shown, the computer systems <b>2302</b>, <b>2304</b>, <b>2306</b> are interconnected by, and may exchange data through, a communication network <b>2308</b>. The network <b>2308</b> may include any communication network through which computer systems may exchange data. To exchange data via the network <b>2308</b>, the computer systems and the network may use various methods, protocols and standards including, but not limited to, token ring, Ethernet, wireless Ethernet, Bluetooth, TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, SNMP, SMS, MMS, SS7, JSON, XML, REST, SOAP, CORBA, HOP, RMI, DCOM and Web Services. To ensure data transfer is secure, the computer systems may transmit data via the network using a variety of security measures including, but not limited to, TSL, SSL and VPN. While the distributed computer system <b>2300</b> illustrates three networked computer systems, the distributed computer system may include any number of computer systems, networked using any medium and communication protocol.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0224">Various aspects and functions may be implemented as specialized hardware or software executing in one or more computer systems. As depicted, the computer system <b>2300</b> includes a processor <b>2310</b>, a memory <b>2312</b>, a bus <b>2314</b>, an interface <b>2316</b> and a storage system <b>2318</b>. The processor <b>2310</b>, which may include one or more microprocessors or other types of controllers, can perform a series of instructions that manipulate data. The processor <b>2310</b> may be a well-known commercially-available processor such as an Intel Pentium, Intel Atom, ARM Processor, Motorola PowerPC, SGI MIPS, Sun UltraSPARC or Hewlett-Packard PA-RISC processor, or may be any other type of processor or controller as many other processors and controllers are available. The processor <b>2310</b> may be a mobile device or smart phone processor, such as an ARM Cortex processor, a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor or an Apple processor. As shown, the processor <b>2310</b> is connected to other system placements, including a memory <b>2312</b>, by the bus <b>2314</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0225">The memory <b>2312</b> may be used for storing programs and data during operation of the computer system <b>2300</b>. Thus, the memory <b>2312</b> may be a relatively high performance, volatile, random access memory such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) or static memory (SRAM). However, the memory <b>2312</b> may include any device for storing data, such a disk drive or other non-volatile storage device, such as flash memory or phase-change memory (PCM). Various embodiments can organize the memory <b>2312</b> into particularized and, in some cases, unique structures to perform the aspects and functions disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0226">Components of the computer system <b>2300</b> may be coupled by an interconnection element such as the bus <b>2314</b>. The bus <b>2314</b> may include one or more physical busses (for example, buses between components that are integrated within the same machine) and may include any communication coupling between system placements including specialized or standard computing bus technologies such as IDE, SCSI, PCI and InfiniBand. Thus, the bus <b>2314</b> enables communications (for example, data and instructions) to be exchanged between system components of the computer system <b>2300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0227">Computer system <b>2300</b> also includes one or more interface devices <b>2316</b>, such as input devices, output devices and combination input/output devices. The interface devices <b>2316</b> may receive input, provide output, or both. For example, output devices may render information for external presentation. Input devices may accept information from external sources. Examples of interface devices include, but are not limited to, keyboards, mouse devices, trackballs, microphones, touch screens, printing devices, display screens, speakers, network interface cards, and the like. The interface devices <b>2316</b> allow the computer system <b>2300</b> to exchange information and communicate with external entities, such as users and other systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00242-en" num="0228">Storage system <b>2318</b> may include one or more computer-readable and computer-writeable non-volatile and non-transitory storage media on which computer-executable instructions are encoded that define a program to be executed by the processor. The storage system <b>2318</b> also may include information that is recorded on or in the media, and this information may be processed by the program. More specifically, the information may be stored in one or more data structures specifically configured to conserve storage space or increase data exchange performance. The instructions may be persistently stored as encoded signals, and the instructions may cause a processor to perform any of the functions described herein. A medium that can be used with various embodiments may include, for example, optical disk, magnetic disk or flash memory, among others. In operation, the processor <b>2310</b> or some other controller may cause data to be read from the non-transitory recording media into another memory, such as the memory <b>2312</b>, that allows for faster access to the information by the processor than does the storage medium included in the storage system <b>2318</b>. The memory may be located in the storage system <b>2318</b> and/or in the memory <b>2312</b>. The processor <b>2310</b> may manipulate the data within the memory <b>2312</b>, and then copy the data to the medium associated with the storage system <b>2318</b> after processing is completed. A variety of components may manage data movement between the media and the memory <b>2312</b>, and the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0229">Further, the implementations are not limited to a particular memory system or storage system. Although the computer system <b>2300</b> is shown by way of example as one type of computer system upon which various aspects and functions may be practiced, aspects are not limited to being implemented on the computer system. Various aspects and functions may be practiced on one or more computers having different architectures or components than that shown in the illustrative figures. For instance, the computer system <b>2300</b> may include specially-programmed, special-purpose hardware, such as for example, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) tailored to perform a particular operation disclosed herein. Another embodiment may perform the same function using several general-purpose computing devices running MAC OSÂ® System X with Motorola PowerPCÂ® processors and several specialized computing devices running proprietary hardware and operating systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00244-en" num="0230">The computer system <b>2300</b> may include an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware placements included in computer system <b>2300</b>. A processor or controller, such as processor <b>2310</b>, may execute an operating system which may be, among others, a Windows-based operating system (for example, Windows NT, Windows 2000/ME, Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows Vista) available from the Microsoft Corporation, a MAC OSÂ® System X operating system available from Apple Computer, one of many Linux-based operating system distributions (for example, the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc.), a Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems, or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. The operating system may be a mobile device or smart phone operating system, such as Windows Mobile, Android or iOS. Many other operating systems may be used, and embodiments are not limited to any particular operating system.</p>
      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0231">The processor and operating system together define a computing platform for which application programs in high-level programming languages may be written. These component applications may be executable, intermediate (for example, C# or JAVA bytecode) or interpreted code which communicate over a communication network (for example, the Internet) using a communication protocol (for example, TCP/IP). Similarly, functions may be implemented using an object-oriented programming language, such as SmallTalk, JAVA, C++, Ada, or C# (C-Sharp). Other object-oriented programming languages may also be used. Alternatively, procedural, scripting, or logical programming languages may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0232">Additionally, various functions may be implemented in a non-programmed environment (for example, documents created in HTML, XML or other format that, when viewed in a window of a browser program, render aspects of a graphical-user interface or perform other functions). Further, various embodiments may be implemented as programmed or non-programmed placements, or any combination thereof. For example, a web page may be implemented using HTML while a data object called from within the web page may be written in C++. Thus, the implementations are not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language could also be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00252-en" num="0238">As shown in step <b>2502</b>, the method <b>2500</b> may include providing a strap with a sensor and a heart rate monitoring system. The strap may be shaped and sized to fit about an appendage. For example, the strap may be any of the straps described herein, including, without limitation, a bracelet. The heart rate monitoring system may be configured to provide two or more different modes for detecting a heart rate of a wearer of the strap. The modes may include the use of optical detectors (e.g., light detectors), light emitters, motion sensors, a processing module, algorithms, other sensors, a peak detection technique, a frequency domain technique, variable optical characteristics, non-optical techniques, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00253-en" num="0239">As shown in step <b>2504</b>, the method <b>2500</b> may include detecting a signal from the sensor. The signal may be detected by one or more sensors, which may include any of the sensors described herein. The signal may include, without limitation, one or more signals associated with the heart rate of the user, other physiological signals, an optical signal, signals based on movement, signals based on environmental factors, status signals (e.g., battery life), historical information, and so on.</p>
      <p id="p-00254-en" num="0240">As shown in step <b>2506</b>, the method <b>2500</b> may include determining a condition of the heart rate monitoring system, which may be based upon the signal. The condition may include, without limitation, an accuracy of heart rate detection determined using a statistical analysis to provide a confidence level in the accuracy, a power consumption, a battery charge level, a user activity, a location of the sensor or motion of the sensor, an environmental or contextual condition (e.g., ambient light conditions), a physiological condition, an active condition, an inactive condition, and so on. This may include detecting a change in the condition, responsively selecting a different one of the two or more different modes, and storing additional continuous heart rate data obtained using at least one of the two or more different modes.</p>
      <p id="p-00255-en" num="0241">As shown in step <b>2508</b>, the method <b>2500</b> may include selecting one of the two or more different modes for detecting the heart rate based on the condition. For example, based on the motion status of the user, the method may automatically and selectively activate one or more light emitters to determine a heart rate of the user. The system may also or instead determine the type of sensor to use at a given time based on the level of motion, skin temperature, heart rate, and the like. Based on a combination of these factors the system may selectively choose which type of sensor to use in monitoring the heart rate of the user. A processor or the like may be configured to select one of the modes. For example, if the condition is the accuracy of heart rate detection determined using a statistical analysis to provide a confidence level in the accuracy, the processor may be configured to select a different one of the modes when the confidence level is below a predetermined threshold.</p>
      <p id="p-00256-en" num="0242">As shown in step <b>2510</b>, the method <b>2500</b> may include storing continuous heart rate data using one of the two or more different modes. This may include communicating the continuous heart rate data from the strap to a remote data repository. This may also or instead including storing the data locally, e.g., on a memory included on the strap. The memory may be removable, e.g., via a data card or the like, or the memory may be permanently attached/integral with the strap or a component thereof. The stored data (e.g., heart rate data) may be for the user's private use, for example, when in a private setting, or the data may be shared when in a shared setting (e.g., on a social networking site or the like). The method <b>2500</b> may further include the use of a privacy switch operable by the user to controllably restrict communication of a portion of the data, e.g., to the remote data repository.</p>
