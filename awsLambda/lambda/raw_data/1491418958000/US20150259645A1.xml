      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for inducing proliferation of Î³Î´ T lymphocytes using a combination of interleukin-33 (IL-33) and a Î³Î´ T cells activator for the treatment of an infectious disease or cancer therapy.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Î³Î´ T lymphocytes are known as non-conventional lymphocytes with respect to their characteristics at the interface of the innate and adaptive immunity. They recognize antigens with their TCR but without presentation or restriction by molecules of the complex major histocompatibility. The major subpopulation of Î³Î´ T lymphocytes in the human blood, the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes, recognizes in particular non peptidic antigens called phosphoantigens (PAgs). These PAgs are produced by some pathogen microorganisms and by human cancer cells (Poupot M, Fournie J J <i>Immunol Lett </i>2004). By their ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and the cytotoxicity induced upon their activation, these lymphocytes are very important actors of the antitumor immunity. They have indeed a high cytolitic potential in vitro against numerous cancer cell types such as established cancer cell lines or cells from cancer patients (renal or prostatic carcinoma or multiple myeloma) (Viey E et al. <i>Immunol </i>2005; Liu Z et al. <i>J Urol </i>2005; Kunzmann V et al. <i>Blood </i>2000). Their cytolytic potential was also showed in vivo in immunodeficient mouse with human tumor xenografts (Kabelitz D et al. <i>J Immunol </i>2004). Furthermore clinical trials based on the administration of phosphoantigens and IL2 showed an increase of the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells number in the blood of patients and a tumor reduction (Wilhelm M et al. <i>Blood </i>2003; Bonneville M, Scotet E <i>Curr Opin Immunol </i>2006).</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Actually, if the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes represent only one percent of total lymphocytes in blood, the PAgs/IL-2 combination leads to the proliferation of these cells. It is moreover possible to considerably amplify this cellular population by growing PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) in vitro in the presence of PAgs and IL-2 to reach a purity of around 80%. Through this method several billions of cytotoxic VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes can be obtained and subsequently re-injected in the patient for triggering an antitumor immunotherapy. The first phase I clinical trials performed showed a good safety of the grafts of autologous VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes amplified ex vivo. However, it is technically simpler to inject directly PAg and IL-2 to the patient (Bennouna J et al. <i>Cancer Immunol Immunother </i>2008). Several phase I and II clinical trials including as of today about one hundred patients with metastatic renal carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma and follicular lymphoma were performed with this combination therapy. The results of the different trials reveal a very good therapeutic potential of the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes, but unfortunately a strong toxicity of IL-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Together, these therapeutic progress call for a new approach combining PAgs and a safe compound capable of activating the proliferation of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes different from IL-2 (IL-2RÎ³c-independent) for a therapeutic approach based on VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes. Different combinations with IL-2RÎ³c dependant cytokines (IL-4, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21) showed in vitro bioactivities similar to that of IL-2, but also a similar toxicity. Combinations with TLR ligands were also explored by different teams in the world, but revealed a strict IL-2 dependence.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Accordingly there is a need to find an alternative to IL-2 to amplify VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes in vitro or in vivo</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The inventor have now surprisingly discovered that the combination of IL-33 and a Î³6 T cells activator such as a phosphoantigen is efficient for inducing proliferation of Î³Î´ T lymphocytes in vitro from a culture of fresh human PBMC.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The discovery is all the more unexpected since as shown in the example, combinations of two molecules are efficient for inducing and maintaining proliferation of Î³Î´ T in vitro and IL-33 is not associated with the IL2 receptor (IL-2RÎ³c-independent) and therefore able to avoid the IL-2 toxicity.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">IL-33 is a cytokine of the IL-1 family which is expressed by the vascular endothelial cells (Cayrol C, Girard J P, <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA </i>2009). This cytokine has a nuclear localization but can be released by stressed or necrotic cells, leading to consider IL-33 as an alarmin. An alarmin is an endogenous signal rapidly released from cells in response to infection or tissue damage (mechanic or induced by chemotherapy or radiotherapy), alarming the immune system by promoting chemoattraction and activation of innate and adaptive immunity (Haraldsen G et al. <i>Trends Immunol </i>2009). The inventors of the instant invention showed that IL-33 is highly expressed by epithelial cells of tissues in contact with the environment including the skin and gastrointestinal tract, where pathogens, allergens and other environmental agents are frequently encountered. Moreover, they showed that IL-33 is highly expressed by the vascular endothelial cells from HEV (High Endothelial Veinules) which are specialized blood vessels mediating lymphocyte recruitment into lymphoid organs (Moussion C et al. <i>PLoS One </i>2008).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">So far however, no data of literature showed any role of IL-33 on the T VÎ³VÎ´2 lymphocytes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">According to a first aspect, the present invention provides an in vitro or ex vivo method for inducing proliferation of Î³Î´ T cells comprising the treatment of said Î³Î´ T cells with a combination of IL-33 and a Î³Î´ T cells activator.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to other aspects, the present invention relates to a culture medium or a kit comprising IL-33 and Î³Î´ T cells activator (e.g. a phosphoantigen).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to a further aspect, the present invention provides an ex vivo and/or in vivo method for treating a subject in need of Î³Î´ T cell therapy which means for the treatment of infection, autoimmunity, cancer and other proliferative diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">According to another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising IL-33 and Î³Î´ T cells activator (e.g. a phosphoantigen), and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and the use of this pharmaceutical composition in anticancer or anti-infectious therapy.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention arises from the unexpected finding by the inventors that IL-33 can advantageously be used instead of IL-2 in combination with BrHPP, a phosphoantigen, for inducing proliferation of Î³Î´ T lymphocytes and allowing further development of the Î³Î´ T lymphocytes based therapies. Indeed, the combination of the invention is as efficient for inducing proliferation of Î³Î´ T lymphocytes as PAgs/IL-2 combinations and without activating IL2 receptor (IL-2RÎ³c-independent).</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">âFunction-conservative variantsâ are peptides derived from the peptide of the invention in which a given amino acid residue in a protein or enzyme has been changed without altering the overall conformation and function of the polypeptide, including, but not limited to, replacement of an amino acid with one having similar properties (such as, for example, polarity, hydrogen bonding potential, acidic, basic, hydrophobic, aromatic, and the like). Amino acids other than those indicated as conserved may differ in a protein so that the percent protein or amino acid sequence similarity between any two proteins of similar function may vary and may be, for example, from 70% to 99% as determined according to an alignment scheme such as by the Cluster Method, wherein similarity is based on the MEGALIGN algorithm. A âfunction-conservative variantâ also includes a polypeptide which has at least 60% amino acid identity as determined by BLAST or FASTA algorithms, preferably at least 75%, most preferably at least 85%, and even more preferably at least 90%, and which has the same or substantially similar properties or functions as the native or parent protein to which it is compared.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The term âanalogâ, when used herein in reference to a protein or polypeptide, refers to a peptide that possesses a similar or identical function as the protein or polypeptide but need not necessarily comprise an amino acid sequence that is similar or identical to the amino acid sequence of the protein or polypeptide or a structure that is similar or identical to that of the protein or polypeptide. Preferably, in the context of the present invention, an analog has an amino acid sequence that is at least 80%, more preferably, at least about: 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, identical to the amino acid sequence of the protein or polypeptide. In certain preferred embodiments, an analog of a peptide biomarker of the invention has an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical or at least 85% identical to the amino acid sequence of the cytokine peptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The term âhomologousâ (or âhomologyâ), as used herein, is synonymous with the term âidentityâ and refers to the sequence similarity between two polypeptide molecules or between two nucleic acid molecule. When a position in both compared sequences is occupied by the same base or same amino acid residue, the respective molecules are homologous at that position. The percentage of homology between two sequences corresponds to the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared and multiplied by 100. Generally, a comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum homology. Homologous amino acid sequences share identical or similar amino acid sequences. Similar residues are conservative substitutions for, or âallowed point mutationsâ of, corresponding amino acid residues in a reference sequence. âConservative substitutionsâ of a residue in a reference sequence are substitutions that are physically or functionally similar to the corresponding reference residue, e.g., that have a similar size, shape, electric charge, chemical properties, including the ability to form covalent or hydrogen bonds, or the like. Particularly preferred conservative substitutions are those fulfilling the criteria defined for an âaccepted point mutationâ by Dayhoff et al. (âAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structureâ, 1978, Nat. Biomed. Res. Foundation, Washington, D.C., Suppl. 3, 22: 354-352).</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In its broadest meaning, the terms âtreatingâ or âtreatmentâ refer to reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The term âpatientâ refers to any subject (preferably human) afflicted with or susceptible to be afflicted with an infectious disease (bacterial or viral), a cancer or another proliferative disease.</p>

      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0031">In another preferred embodiment, IL-33 is the artificially truncated form of human IL-33 (IL-33 AA 112-270: SEQ ID No5).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0032">The cytokine protein IL-33 has been shown to function as a ligand for the IL-1 receptor-related protein ST2 (IL-1R4), a member of the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)/IL-1 Receptors family (Schmitz J et al. <i>Immunity </i>2005). ST2 is expressed on Th2 lymphocytes, NKT cells, NK cells and on mast cells, basophils and eosinophils. The interaction IL-33/ST2 leads to an alarming intracellular signal involving the cascade MYD88, MAPK and NF-ÎºB. Accordingly, IL-33 was found to drive production of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-gamma) and/or Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) cytokines (Pecaric-Petkovic T et al. <i>Blood </i>2009, Bourgeois E et al. <i>Eur J Immunol </i>2009) but also to induce chemotaxis of immune cells to the inflammatory site (Komai-Koma M et al. <i>Eur J Immunol </i>2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">Broadly, the term âInterleukin-33â refers to the protein IL-33 itself, analogues of the protein, which include polypeptides and proteins which are functionally equivalent to the polypeptide of the invention as well as âfunction-conservative variantsâ. In the sense used in the invention, the expression âfunctionally equivalentâ means that the polypeptide in question has at least one of the biological activities of the cytokine of the invention, such as, for example, acting as an activator of the ST2 receptor which leads to an alarming intracellular signal involving the cascade MYD88, MAPK and NF-ÎºB.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">The ST2-activating capabilities of the protein of the invention will become evident to the skilled person by implementing a simple test to evaluate the production of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-gamma) and/or Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) cytokines (Schmitz et al. <i>Immunity </i>2005, Pecaric-Petkovic T et al. <i>Blood </i>2009, Bourgeois E et al. <i>Eur J Immunol </i>2009, Cayrol and Girard <i>PNAS </i>2009, Lefrancais et al. <i>PNAS </i>2012) but also to induce chemotaxis of immune cells to the inflammatory site (Komai-Koma M et al. <i>Eur J Immunol </i>2007).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">The term âÎ³Î´ T cellsâ (also called âgamma delta T cellsâ or âÎ³Î´ T lymphocytesâ) represent an important component of the healthy immune system at the interface of the innate and adaptive immunity. Î³Î´ T cells are known as non-conventional lymphocytes as they recognize the antigen with their TCR (T cell receptor for the antigen) but without presentation or restriction by molecules of the complex major histocompatibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">Î³Î´ T cells have numerous acknowledged biomarkers known in the art. These include CD3+, CD4â, CD8â and the TCR chain is formed of gamma chain (Î³) and delta chain (Î´).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">Unlike their counterparts Î±Î² T cells, Î³Î´ T cells represent only small proportion (&lt;6%) of circulating lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. They are much more prevalent in epithelial tissues and lymphoid organs where they can represent up to 50% of T lymphocytes. However, during various bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, meningitis, or tularemia, and protozoa such as malaria, toxoplasmosis and leishmaniasis, Î³Î´ T cells are amplified to levels that can represent the majority of circulating T cells (up to 40% in some individuals.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">Î³Î´ T cells according to the present invention are primate Î³Î´ T cells, most preferably human Î³Î´ T cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">Detection of Î³Î´ T cell proliferation can be performed by standard methods. One specific method for detecting Î³Î´ T cell proliferation in vitro is described in Example 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">By âVÎ³9VÎ´2 T cellsâ (also called âVÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytesâ), is meant a subgroup of Î³Î´ T cells present only in primates (human and nonhuman) with a TCR of type VÎ³9VÎ´2. The antigens selectively recognized by human VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes are non peptidic antigens called phosphoantigens (PAgs).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">By their production of pro-inflammatory cytokine and their cytotoxicity induced by their activation, VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells are very important actors of the antitumor immunity. They have indeed a high cytolitic potential in vitro against numerous cancer cell types as established cancer cell lines or cells from cancer patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">âVÎ³9VÎ´2 T cellsâ may be isolated from PBMCs by any suitable method known in the art. Examples of such methods are set out in the example section.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">For example, the initial cell preparation consists of PBMCs from blood from either fresh or frozen cytapheresis. The cells are expanded for two weeks in a closed system, with sequential addition of defined dosage IL-33 to the culture medium after a unique PAgs stimulation. The manufacturing process is much simpler than most current cellular therapy approaches using conventional CD8+ T cell lines or clones: there is no final separation or purification step nor use of feeder cells; the specific TCR-mediated signal provided by PAgs is sufficient to trigger the IL-33-dependent expansion of the VÎ³9VÎ´2 subset, which becomes dominant in the culture. Several doses of the Î³Î´ cellular product can be manufactured from one frozen cytapheresis.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">Typically, 100 million frozen PBMCs from cytapheresis yield 2 to 5 billions cells with the classical method of amplification with a Î³Î´ T cell specific stimulus (e.g. phosphoantigen) and IL-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">A VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cell must preferably display cytotoxic function against tumor cells. The demonstration of cytotoxic function may be determined by any suitable method known in the art. In particular, examples of such tests are set out in the example section. Specifically, the tests embodied in example and <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are regarded as standards in vitro tests for the assessment of VÎ³9VÎ´2 Î³Î´ T cell function.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">The term âÎ³Î´ T cell activatorâ designates a molecule, preferably artificially produced, which activates Î³Î´ T lymphocytes. It consists more preferably of a ligand for the Î³Î´ T lymphocyte's TCR and other receptor expressed on Î³Î´ T cell like activator receptor of NK cells (NKG2D . . . ). The activator may be of various natures, such as a peptide, a lipid or is a small chemical molecule (e.g. phosphoantigen), It also may be a ligand, or a fragment or derivative thereof, or an antibody having substantially the same specificity for the Î³Î´ T lymphocyte's TCR and other receptor of Î³Î´ T cell like activator receptor of NK cells (NKG2D . . . ).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">In particular embodiment the Î³Î´ T cell activator is a Î³Î´ T cell-specific activator which activates only the Î³Î´ T lymphocytes among all lymphocytes (For instance with a EC50 less or equal at 24 nM)</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">The Î³Î´ T cell activator is preferably purified from cells or otherwise artificially produced (e.g., by chemical synthesis, or by microbiological process).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">By âPhosphoantigensâ (also called âPAgsâ) refers to nonpeptide phosphate compound typically mono- and pyro-phosphates of linear C5 isoprenoids with bioactivity of Î³Î´ T cell activator. All phosphoantigens owe their antigen bioactivity to their phosphate moiety, which bioactivity is abrogated by phosphatases.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">A phosphoantigen that is a Î³Î´ T cell activator preferably increases the biological activity or causes the proliferation of Î³Î´ T cells and preferably increases the activation of Î³Î´ T cells, particularly the cytokine secretion from Î³Î´ T cells or the cytolytic activity of Î³Î´ T cells, with or without further stimulating the proliferation or expansion of Î³Î´ T cells in association with interleukin like IL-2.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">Accordingly, the Î³Î´ T cell activator is added to the cell culture or administered in an amount and under conditions sufficient to increase the activity of Î³Î´ T cells in a subject, preferably in an amount and under conditions sufficient to increase cytokine secretion by Î³Î´ T cells and/or to increase the cytolytic activity of Î³Î´ T cells. Cytokine secretion and cytolytic activity can be assessed by any appropriate in vitro assays.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">Cytokine secretion can be determined according to the methods described in Espinosa et al. (J Biol. Chem., 2001, Vol. 276, Issue 21, 18337-18344), describing measurement of TNF-Î± release in a bioassay using TNF-Î±-sensitive cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">The phosphoantigens for use in the invention may be obtained by purification from micro-organisms and plants, or by any synthetic method or by microbiological process, well known to the skilled person.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">Natural PAg such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,653, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), 3-formyl-butyl-pyrophosphate, and 4-hydroxy-3-dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (HDMAPP) which is synonymous to (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP). These molecules have been identified in several micro-organisms and plants. Literature equally refers to HDMAPP or HMBPP for the same above depicted molecule of (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">Other phosphoantigens for use in the present invention with significant Î³Î´ T cell activating activity are disclosed in WO 95/20673, WO 2004/050096, WO2007/057440, WO2007039635 and Belmant et al (Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Strategies 2006 (3), 17-23) all of which are herein incorporated by reference.

The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well known within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0145">In one embodiment, the cytokine IL-33 and the Î³Î´ T cell activator (or the activated Î³Î´ T cells) are administered into the subject simultaneously or sequentially. In a first embodiment, the Î³Î´ T cell activator (or the activated Î³Î´ T cells) is administered to the subject before the cytokine IL-33. In a second embodiment, the cytokine IL-33 is administered to the subject before the Î³Î´ T cell activator (or the activated Î³Î´ T cells). The Î³Î´ T cell activator (or the activated Î³Î´ T cells) and the cytokine IL-33 are administered so that the combined effect can be obtained.</p>

In another aspect, the Î³Î´ T cell activator is administered in multiple doses, the administration of successive doses of the Î³Î´ T cell activator being separated by at least 2, 3 or 4 or more weeks. Generally, the Î³Î´ T cell rate (number of Î³Î´ T cells), is allowed to return to substantially the basal rate prior to a second administration of the compound. At least about one week, but more preferably at least about two weeks, or up to eight weeks are required for a patient's Î³Î´ T cell rate to return to substantially the basal rate. For example, the Î³Î´ T cell activator can be administered only as a single dose to the individual, which will usually mean that the Î³Î´ T cell activator is administered no more than once a month or once every 2, 3 or 6 months.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0148">In a preferred aspect, the Î³Î´ T cell activator may increase the biological activity of Î³Î´ T cells, preferably increasing the activation of Î³Î´ T cells, particularly increasing cytokine secretion from Î³Î´ T cells or increasing the cytolytic activity of Î³Î´ T cells, with stimulating the expansion of Î³Î´ T cells with IL33.

The Î³Î´ T cell activator is preferably administered in a single dose, and typically at the beginning of the Î³Î´ T cell activator treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0153">In preferred aspects, a IL-33 cytokine, is administered daily for up to about 10 days, preferably for a period of between about 3 and 10 days, or most preferably for about 5 days. Preferably, the administration of the cytokine begins on the same day (e.g. within 24 hours of) as the administration of the Î³Î´ T cell activator. It will be appreciated that the cytokine can be administered in any suitable scheme within said regimen of between about 3 and 10 days. When the cytokine is administered for about 7 to about 14 days, a 4-weekly treatment cycle is preferred. When the first component is administered for about 4 days, a 3-weekly day treatment cycle is preferred</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0154">The IL-33 polypeptide is preferably administered at low doses, i.e. at doses that are sufficient to target in vivo cells that express the high affinity receptor for IL-33, defined as IL-1 receptor-related protein ST2 (IL-1R4). Practically, in human, such doses have been experimentally defined (in clinical trials with IL2) as being comprised between 0.2 and 2 million units per square meters, when injected subcutaneously. The IL-33 polypeptide is preferably administered by injection of between 0.1 and 3 million units (MU) per day, over a period of 1 to 10 days. Preferably, daily doses of between 0.2 and 2 MU per day, even more preferably between 0.2 and 1.5 MU, further preferably between 0.2 and 1 MU, are being administered. The daily dose may be administered as a single injection or in several times, typically in two equal injections. The IL-33 treatment is preferably maintained over between 1 and 9 days, even more preferably during 3 to 7 days. Optimum effect seems to be achieved after 5 days treatment.</p>

      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0178">We studied the effect of IL-33 in combination with the specific phosphoantigen, BrHPP, on the proliferation of human VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes. In this purpose, fresh PBMC were stained with CFSE and cultured with or without BrHPP, IL-33 and IL-2. After six days in culture, the proliferation of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes was analyzed by the reduction of the CFSE fluorescence intensity on the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes gated by flow cytometry. We showed in <figref>FIG. 1A</figref> that without specific BrHPP-activation, VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes are not able to proliferate with or without IL-33. The addition of 100 nM BrHPP in the culture induces the proliferation of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes. The combination of BrHPP and 1000 ng/ml of IL-33 amplifies significantly this proliferation more than the combination of BrHPP and IL-2. Regarding to the absolute number of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes obtained after six days in the culture, the combination of IL-33 with BrHPP increases this number in a similar manner as the combination of BrHPP and IL-2 (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0179">Discussion</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0180">Today, the only tool to amplify the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes in vitro or in vivo is the use of IL-2 combined to PAgs. Antitumor clinical trials based on VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes consist today either of an injection of high quantities of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes obtained by an in vitro culture with PAgs and IL-2 or of a direct injection of the two molecules allowing the in vivo amplification of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes. The first protocol has unfortunately limitations due to the deficient antitumor functionality after injection in the patient of the in vitro generated lymphocytes. The direct injection of PAgs and IL-2 show a good antitumor efficacy thanks to the cytotoxicity of the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes against cancer cells. However, the high toxicity of IL-2 represents an important limitation of this therapy despite the benefic effects. Actually, the benefit (antitumor cytotoxivity of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes)/risk (toxicity of IL-2) ratio is not in favor of this therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0181">The present invention seeks to overcome these problems and opens thus real perspectives for the use of IL-33 in antitumor therapies based on VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes. Actually, the capacity of IL-33 in combination with PAgs to amplify the VÎ³9VÎ´2 T lymphocytes could have important applications. IL-33 could replace IL-2 in therapies based on the injection of PAgs/IL-2 combinations to increase the benefit/risk ratio as IL-33 is less toxic than IL-2.</p>

      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0182">Materials and Methods</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0183">PBMC freshly isolated from blood sample from healthy donors were cultured for 6 days in complete RMPI supplemented by 10% FCS in the presence or not of IL-33 (0, 100, 500, 1000, 10000 ng/ml).</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0184">At days 1 and 3, PBMC were tested for their viability with a staining with annexin V and propidium iodure (PI) following by the analysis by flow cytometry.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0185">Results</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0186">
        <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> shows the viability of T cells gated through the staining with annexin V and PI. The percentage of cells negative for annexin V and PI represents the living cells. After one or three days of culture with or without IL-33, over 95% of T cells were alive.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0187">
        <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> shows that the percentage of living PBMC or living T cells is constant regardless the IL-33 concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0188">Thus, we demonstrated that IL-33 is not toxic for human PBMC and particularly for human Î³Î´ T cells cultured in vitro even at a high dose of IL-33.</p>
