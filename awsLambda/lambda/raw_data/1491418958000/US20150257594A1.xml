      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to a roaster, and more specifically, to a roaster which has the structure the heat of the flame is to the utmost a little bit delivered to the around while the heat of the flame is to the fullest a lot delivered to the roasting object food so that the thermal efficiency may be raised and therefore may be used in the indoor like as the general home as well as in the outdoor with convenience and safety.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Moreover, the invention relates to a new roaster which can be conveniently used for various uses like as the user may feel funny more while eating roasted meat because it has special structure like as the user may eat the other food like the pot stew besides eating the roasted meat.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">And the invention relates to new roaster which uses mainly charcoal as fuel. The roaster according to the invention minimizes the conditions that the heat at the charcoal fire flame source is transmitted to the around and the around container portion is overheated. Accordingly the invention has the various useful functions like as preventing the user to be scalded while roasting the meat.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Generally, the methods for roasting the meat may be classified roughly as an indirect roasting method for roasting the meat using the indirect cookware and a direct roasting method for directly roasting the meat by the direct fire roaster like as a charcoal fire roaster etc. In case of the indirect roasting method utilizing the indirect cookware like as an oven, the indirect cookware heats the inner portion of the predetermined section to make the meat roasted by the convection heat and heated air. In case of the direct roasting method, the direct fire roaster directly exposes food to the flame like as the charcoal fire and so on etc to make the meat roasted by the direct flame. When the meat is roasted by direct fire flame, if the charcoal fire is used for roasting the meat, there is various advantages like as the scent of charcoal may be permeated into the meat so that the taste of the meat get better.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The conventional roaster of the prior art includes a support container wherein the flame outlet port is equipped in the central part and the tray (<b>26</b>) of the trench-type is equipped around the flame outlet port and the oil generated while roasting the meat may be collected in the water filled in the tray, a roasting plate which is supported on the support container and has flam inlet port in the central portion. In case of the prior roaster, the flame comes up through the central part flame outlet of the roasting plate support stand and flame inlet port of the roasting plate so that the meat (for example, pork belly and so on) is roasted as the direct fire type.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Meanwhile, there are many cases that said roaster is used in the indoor like as the general home or in the outdoor. What is importantly considered in the roaster is that the heat of the flame is to the utmost a little bit delivered to the around while the heat of the flame is to the utmost a lot delivered to the roasting object meat so that the loss of fire is reduced to the utmost. If the heat of the flame is not burnt down around the meat to the utmost while the heat of the flame is delivered to the meat to the utmost, it will be good for the safety or the thermal efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">However, in case of the prior roaster, there is disadvantages that it is not preferable for the safety or the thermal efficiency described in the above because the flame for roasting the meat is not concentrated to the roasting plate and is transmitted to the surroundings around the position where the meat is being roasted so that the loss of the heat may be increased so much. That is, because there are many cases the heat of fire is directly transmitted to the roasting plate from the downside of the support container which supports the roasting plate, the oil falling down from the roasting plate may be received in the tray so that the heat transmission may be decreased by the water filled in the tray. But, even if said roaster is used at the state that water is filled up in the roasting plate support container, it is insufficient that said roaster solve the problem due to the direct overheat by the flame, and said roaster is undesirable character because the loss of heat is so much while the fuel (the source of the flame) is under combustion. And there is a problem that it is difficult to expect the convenience like as the user may roast to eat the meat after he/she moves said roaster to desired place (for example, to the outdoor from the indoor or to the indoor from the outdoor) because the heat of the roaster is transmitted to the other part around the part where the meat is roasted. That is, said roaster of the prior art has the problem it is difficult as to the portability of the food cooking place.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The invention has been made to solve the foregoing problems with the prior art, and therefore the purpose of the invention is to provide a roaster which has the structure the heat of the flame is to the utmost a little bit delivered to the around while the heat of the flame is a lot delivered to the roasting object food and the thermal efficiency may be raised so that the user may use in the outdoor as well as in the indoor like as general home and so on at the safe and convenient state.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Moreover, the invention relates to a new roaster which can be conveniently used for various uses like as the user may feel funny more while eating roasted meat because it has special structure like as the user may eat the other food like the pot stew besides eating the roasted meat.</p>

That is, according to the roasting grill <b>80</b> and the secondary roasting plate <b>86</b>, the user may roast to eat meat as well as may enjoy the pot stew or the soup etc with appropriately warm state. Therefore, the invention may contribute the user to cheerfully take meat. Especially, although time goes by while sharing the chat, there is no case that meat gets cold the stew pot or the soup etc gets cold, the invention may contribute the user to eat meat to the utmost cheerfully.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Moreover, the invention has the advantage that the user may use the invention more usefully when he/she wants to heat to eat the food containing soup like as pot stew more quickly because the invention has the wire grill <b>90</b> which is supported in the upper supporter <b>20</b> and is installed to be attachable and detachable. That is, after the user roast meat on the roasting plate <b>4</b> (or the secondary roasting plate <b>86</b>) to eat all the meat, carries out the roasting plate <b>4</b> from the upper supporter <b>20</b>, and sets up the wire grill <b>90</b> on the upper supporter <b>20</b>, if he/she puts the stew pot on the central position (the position which is in opposite directions to the flame hole <b>21</b> and fuel vessel <b>30</b> of the upper supporter <b>20</b>) of the wire grill <b>90</b>, the stew in the stew pot may be boiled more quickly so that the user may boil to eat the stew more quickly after he/she eat the roasted meat enough. Moreover, in the wire grill <b>90</b>, because the top end part (the end opposite to the end equipped with the wire support piece <b>94</b><i>a</i>) of the wire foot <b>94</b> is equipped based on the central part of the wire grill <b>90</b> along the columnar direction and the hanging portion formed by the end parts of these wire feet <b>94</b> supports the pot like as the stew pot so that the pot may not be shifted and the user may boil to eat the stew etc more safely and conveniently.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Further, the main container <b>10</b> called main part of the invention may have multiple air circulating holes which is penetrated toward inside and outside. Since air circulates through this air circulation holes to inside and outside of the main container <b>10</b>, the conducted heat delivered to the heating source of the fuel vessel <b>30</b> is more authentically minimized.</p>
