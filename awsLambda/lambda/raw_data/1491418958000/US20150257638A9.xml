      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to medical devices. In particular, in one or more embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods and devices for retracting tissue in a surgical procedure to allow access to the surgical site.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Retractor systems may be used in a variety of different surgical procedures to provide an opening through which the doctor may access the surgical site. In spinal surgeries, for example, a retractor system may be used to provide the surgeon with access to the patient's spine. The opening created by the retractor system may, for example, enable the doctor to insert surgical instruments into the body or enable visualization of the surgical site using X-ray. One typical retractor system may include a plurality of blades coupled to a retractor frame. In use, the blades may be inserted into an incision and then retracted to displace tissue surrounding the incision down to the surgical site. To minimize trauma to the tissue, this tissue displacement should generally be refined and controlled. However, current retractor systems may not provide desired control of the distraction.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for improved methods and devices that can be used for retracting tissue to provide access to the surgical site.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present disclosure generally relates to medical devices. In particular, in one or more embodiments, the present disclosure relates to methods and devices for retracting tissue in a surgical procedure to allow access to the surgical site.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An embodiment may comprise a retractor system. The retractor system may comprise a retractor frame. The retractor frame may comprise a first rotatable arm, a second rotatable arm, and a linearly translatable arm coupled to the first and second rotatable arms. The first blade may be coupled to a distal end of the first rotatable arm. The first rotatable arm may be configured to rotate to move the first blade in an arc for tissue retraction. The second blade may be coupled to a distal end of the second rotatable arm. The second rotatable arm may be configured to rotate to move the second blade in an arc for tissue retraction. The third blade may be coupled to a distal end of the linearly translatable arm. The linearly translatable arm may be configured to translate to move the third blade in a line for tissue retraction. The first, second, and third blades may be configured to angulate to separate distal ends of the first, second, and third blades from one another for tissue retraction.</p>

      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate a retractor system <b>10</b> that may be used to retract tissue in a surgical procedure in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The retractor system <b>10</b> comprises a first blade <b>12</b>, a second blade <b>14</b>, and a third blade <b>16</b>. The first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are each coupled to a retractor frame <b>18</b>. The retractor frame <b>18</b> comprises a first rotatable arm <b>20</b> having a first blade attachment member <b>22</b> for holding and positioning the first blade <b>12</b>. The retractor frame <b>18</b> further comprises a second rotatable arm <b>24</b> having a second blade attachment member <b>26</b> for holding and positioning the second blade <b>14</b>. The retractor frame <b>18</b> further comprises a linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> having a third blade attachment member <b>30</b> for holding and positioning the third blade <b>16</b>. The first and second rotatable arms <b>20</b>, <b>24</b> and the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> may be actuated so that the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be separated a desired distance from each other. In addition, the blade attachment members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b> may be actuated to angulate the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, increasing the distance between the distal ends of the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In this manner, tissue surrounding an incision may be retracted providing access to the surgical site. In embodiments, the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be individually actuated.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">
        <figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref> illustrate the retractor system <b>10</b> in a âclosedâ or non-retracted configuration, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the closed configuration, the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are radially disposed around a central bore <b>31</b> to form a substantially closed, tube-shaped structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref> illustrate the retractor system <b>10</b> in an âopenâ or retracted configuration, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In the open configuration, the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> have been moved so that they no longer form a tube-shaped structure that is substantially closed. Rather, the first and second blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have been rotated and angulated and third blade <b>16</b> has been linearly translated and angulated to enlarge the diameter of the central bore about which the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are arranged.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The first rotatable arm <b>20</b> may be actuated by rotation of an actuator <b>32</b>. The actuator <b>32</b> may be a fastener, such as a hex screw (e.g., a 10 mm hex screw). The actuator <b>32</b> may be coupled to a planetary gear <b>180</b> (shown on <figref>FIG. 9</figref>) having teeth that engage a first sun gear <b>34</b>. The engagement between the actuator <b>32</b>, the planetary gear <b>180</b>, and the first sun gear <b>34</b> may be described as a planetary gear mechanism in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiments, a ratchet-locking mechanism <b>38</b> is included that engages teeth on the first sun gear <b>34</b>. As the actuator <b>32</b> is turned, the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> should rotate as indicated by arrow <b>36</b> with the distal end of the arm <b>20</b> moving in an arc. For example, rotation of the actuator <b>32</b> in the counter-clockwise direction drives rotation of the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> as indicated by arrow <b>36</b> thereby rotating the first blade <b>12</b> in an arc away from the second and third blades <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the first sun gear <b>34</b> is stationary with the planetary gear <b>180</b> rotating tooth by tooth along the first sun gear <b>34</b>. In an embodiment, the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>38</b> engages the first sun gear <b>34</b> to prevent rotation of the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> in the counter-clockwise direction. The first rotatable arm <b>20</b> may be released from its rotated state (<figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref>) by depressing the lever of the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>38</b> to allow the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> to rotate back to its initial position (<figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In a similar manner to the first rotatable arm <b>20</b>, the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> may be actuated by rotation of an actuator <b>40</b>. The actuator <b>40</b> may be, for example, a fastener, such as a hex screw (e.g., a 10 mm hex screw). The actuator <b>40</b> may be coupled to a planetary gear <b>182</b> (shown on <figref>FIG. 9</figref>) having teeth that engage a second sun gear <b>42</b>. The engagement between the actuator <b>40</b>, the planetary gear <b>182</b>, and the second sun gear <b>42</b> may be described as a planetary gear mechanism in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood that use of the term âsunâ is not meant to imply that the first and second sun gears <b>34</b>, <b>42</b> are circular in shape but rather that the gears function in conjunction with the other components in a manner similar to what is commonly referred to as a planetary gear. In the illustrated embodiment, a ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> is included that engages teeth on the second sun gear <b>42</b>. As the actuator <b>40</b> is turned, the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> should rotate as indicated by arrow <b>46</b> with the distal end of the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> moving in an arc. For example, rotation of the actuator <b>40</b> in the counter-clockwise direction should drive rotation of the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> as indicated by arrow <b>46</b> thereby rotating the second blade <b>14</b> in an arc away from the first and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the second sun gear <b>42</b> is stationary with the planetary gear <b>182</b> rotating tooth by tooth along the second sun gear <b>42</b>. In an embodiment, the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> engages the second sun gear <b>42</b> to prevent rotation of the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> in the counter-clockwise direction. The second rotatable arm <b>24</b> may be released from its rotated state (<figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref>) by depressing the lever of the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> to allow the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> to rotate back to its initial position (<figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> may be actuated by rotation of an actuator <b>48</b>. The actuator <b>48</b> may be, for example, a fastener, such as a hex screw (e.g., a 10 mm hex screw). The actuator <b>48</b> may be coupled to a pinion gear (not shown) that engages teeth on rack portion <b>50</b> of the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b>. As illustrated, the rack portion <b>50</b> may be on the opposite end of the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> from the third blade attachment member <b>30</b>. The engagement between the actuator <b>48</b>, the pinion gear, and the rack portion <b>50</b> may be described as a rack and pinion gear mechanism in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, ratchet-locking mechanism <b>52</b> is also included that engages teeth on the rack portion <b>50</b>. As the actuator <b>48</b> is turned, the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> moves in a line as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref>. This will increase the distance between the third blade <b>16</b> and the first and second blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. In an embodiment, the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>42</b> engages the rack portion <b>50</b> to prevent translation in the opposite direction that would shorten the distance between the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> may be released from its translated state (<figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref>) by depressing the lever of the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>52</b> to allow the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> to rotate back to its initial position (<figref>FIGS. 1-2</figref>) without having to turn the actuator <b>48</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In accordance with present embodiments, the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be angulated by respective rotation of actuators <b>54</b>. As used herein, angulation of the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> refers to rotation of the distal ends of the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> outwardly and upwardly, resulting in separation of the distal ends. The actuators <b>54</b> may be, for example, a fastener, such as a hex screws (e.g., 10 mm hex screws). As illustrated by <figref>FIGS. 3-4</figref>, each of the actuators <b>54</b> may be rotated to angulate the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, respectively. As will be discussed in more detailed with respect to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, rotation of the actuators <b>54</b> facilitates this angulation by angulating the blade attachment members <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> to cause corresponding angulation of the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. In an embodiment, the angulation used is an infinite angle adjustment mechanism that is controlled by threading.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the retractor system <b>10</b> may have one or more holes <b>58</b> extending through the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> along their respective long axes. The holes <b>58</b> may configured to allow passage of light components, k-wires, or other suitable instruments through the blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The edges of the blades may be rounded, for example, to minimize the risk of damage to the retracted tissue. While illustrated with three blades, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the retractor system <b>10</b> may include more, or less, than three blades configured to move as desired for a particular application. For example, a retractor system may be used that comprises four blades with two linearly translatable arms and two rotatable arms. Alternatively, a retractor may be used that comprises two rotatable arms or alternatively one linereally translatable arm and one rotatable arm.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">It should be understood that the actuators <b>32</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> may be configured to engage a variety of different tools to facilitate the desired rotation. For example, wrenches, screwdrivers, or any other suitable tools may be used to rotate the actuators <b>32</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>54</b>. In addition, while actuators <b>32</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>54</b> are shown as fasteners, it should be understood that fasteners are not required to facilitate the movement. Other suitable devices, such as cranks, may be used to facilitate the desired movement.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">An embodiment of the present invention includes using the retractor system <b>10</b> to retract tissue in a surgical procedure. For example, the retractor system <b>10</b> may be placed into an opening (e.g., an incision) in the patient's tissue with the retractor system <b>10</b> in the closed position. The surgeon (or other operator) may then separately rotate actuator <b>32</b> and actuator <b>40</b> to rotate the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> and the second rotatable arm <b>24</b>, respectively, thus moving the first and second blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in an arc. The surgeon may also rotate actuator <b>48</b> to move the linearly translatable arm <b>28</b> and, thus, the third blade <b>16</b>, in a line. In this manner, the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be retracted (or spread) to provide enhanced access to the surgical site. To further enhance access, the surgeon may rotate each of actuators <b>54</b> to angulate the first, second, and third blades <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> in more detail in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment, the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> includes a lever <b>180</b> and a nose <b>182</b>. As illustrated, the nose <b>182</b> of the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> engages teeth <b>164</b> on the central gear housing <b>60</b>. As previously discussed, rotation of the actuator <b>54</b> in the counter-clockwise direction should drive the planetary gear <b>182</b> tooth by tooth along the second sun gear <b>52</b>. Rotation of the actuator <b>54</b> should drive corresponding rotation of the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> in the counter-clockwise direction. The nose <b>182</b> of the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b> should engage the teeth <b>164</b> of the second sun gear <b>52</b> to allow movement of the second rotatable arm <b>24</b> in one direction, i.e., the counter-clockwise direction. The second rotatable arm <b>24</b> can be released from this rotated position by depressing the lever <b>180</b>. The spring <b>168</b> should generally provide the force need to return the second rotatble arm <b>24</b> to its initial position when the lever <b>180</b> is released. While the previous discussion of <figref>FIG. 12</figref> is with respect to the ratchet-locking mechanism <b>44</b>, it should be understood that ratchet-locking mechanism <b>38</b> may be operated in a similar manner to restrict rotation of the first rotatable arm <b>20</b>. It should further be noted that, while the previous discussion describes a ratchet-locking mechanism, other suitable devices for allowing movement of the rotatable arms in one direction may be used in accordance with the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">
        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> describes angulation of the blade attachment member <b>22</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As previously discussed, the first rotatable arm <b>20</b> comprises blade attachment member <b>22</b> coupled to the distal end <b>70</b> of the base portion <b>66</b>. As illustrated, actuator <b>54</b> may secure the blade attachment member <b>22</b> onto the base portion <b>66</b>. The actuator <b>54</b> may be threaded, for example, into a corresponding opening <b>184</b> in the base portion <b>66</b>. The pin <b>107</b> (See <figref>FIG. 12</figref>) pivotably connects the attachment member <b>22</b> to the screw shaft of the actuator <b>54</b>. A second pin <b>105</b> (See <figref>FIG. 13</figref>) connects the attachment member <b>22</b> through the base portion of the <b>66</b>. The screw head of the actuator is provided with a portion that allows the attachment member to be retained within the head portion of the actuator and is pivotably rotatable when the actuator <b>54</b> is manipulated. The pin <b>107</b> and pin <b>105</b> create two separate axis of rotations. As the actuator is manipulated the attachment member <b>22</b> is rotated along the axis of rotation of pin <b>105</b>. In an embodiment, the opening <b>184</b> may be angled, in that the axis of the opening <b>184</b> may be at an angle with respect to the z-axis of the first rotatable arm <b>20</b>. Accordingly, as the actuator <b>54</b> is rotated, the blade attachment member <b>22</b> should pivot. In this manner, the blade attachment member <b>22</b> and, thus, the first blade <b>12</b> may be angulated. While the previous discussion of <figref>FIG. 12</figref> and <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is with respect to angulation of the first blade attachment member <b>22</b>, it should be understood that second and third blade attachment members <b>26</b>, <b>30</b> may be angulated in a similar manner. It should further be noted that, while the previous discussion describes an angled actuator for angulating the blade attachment member <b>22</b>, <b>26</b>, and <b>30</b>, other suitable mechanisms for facilitating the desired blade angulation may be used in accordance with the present invention.</p>
