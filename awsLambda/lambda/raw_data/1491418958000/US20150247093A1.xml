      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This disclosure relates to the recovery of oil from solid substrates, to the upgrading of oil in a heterogeneous chemical-thermal desorption system and also to the catalytic upgrading of oil using the treated solid substrates.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The composition of many oil-based drilling muds typically includes the following compounds: (1) bentonite; (2) barite; (3) kerosene, diesel or other oil; (4) polymers; (5) sodium, calcium and potassium chlorides; (6) lime; and (7) water (invert emulsion). The inverse emulsion generally uses more oil than water. As used herein, the term âoil-based mudâ also includes synthetic muds that are sometimes classified separately even though they contain appreciable amounts of hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventional oil based drilling fluids may use oil containing as much as 30% aromatics or more, such as, kerosene, diesel or refined Group I or Group II base stocks, whereas synthetic drilling fluids may employ a hydrocarbon base stock with a higher viscosity (KV40 and/or KV100), a higher viscosity index (VI), a lower pour point, a lower specific gravity, a higher flash point and a lower content of functional groups such as hydroxide, aryls, substituted aryls, halogens, alkoxys, carboxylates, esters, acrylates, oxygen, nitrogen, carboxyl, and the like. On the other hand, Group III or Group IV (polyalphaolefins or PAO) base stocks can have a viscosity index of 120 or more, a kinematic viscosity of 3 to 3000 cSt at 100Â° C., a pour point of â20Â° C. or less, specific gravity less than 0.86 and a flash point of 200Â° C. or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In general, higher quality oils have lower aromatics and sulfur, and higher saturates, viscosity and viscosity index. Aromatics content is important in drilling applications since oil with a high aromatic content as reflected by a low aniline point can cause elastomers used in O-rings and gaskets to swell and fail. The use of higher quality oils in drilling fluids may also allow the drilling fluid to perform under more severe conditions, to last longer, to reduce wear on the drilling equipment, to use less energy, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The physical nature of the oil based drill cuttings (OBDC) complicates the recovery of oil. Numerous attempts have been tried to recover or remove a high quality oil from the drill cuttings with limited success. For example, the industry has had a long-felt need to address one or more of the following problems in the prior art OBDC treatment processes: the quantity of oil recovered may be very low and/or the residual oil remaining in the solids too high; the process or processing equipment may require excessive amounts of energy, require a long treatment time, require large equipment not easily transported to a processing site, require excessive capital for expensive equipment, or entail excessive risk of explosion or other hazards; or the treated drill cuttings may have a pH less than 6 or more than 8, i.e., the drill cuttings may be too acidic or especially too alkaline for environmental disposal; or the quality of the oil obtained may not be suitable for re-use in drilling muds, especially synthetic grade muds requiring one or more of a higher flash point, viscosity and/or VI, and a lower pour point, specific gravity, aromatics content and/or functional group content, relative to the oil typically present in and/or recovered from an OBDC treatment process.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There exists a need for efficient ways to obtain high quality oil from solids such as OBDC while removing sufficient oil from the solids for environmental disposal.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The present disclosure is directed to a method and apparatus for processing a substrate containing oil to upgrade and/or recover the oil therein, in particular, the treatment of oil based drill cuttings (OBDC) from the drilling of oil and gas wells. The instant disclosure is also directed to the treatment of oil based drill cuttings for environmental disposal. Although the skilled person will appreciate the method and apparatus can be used to treat other substrates, especially oil-containing substrates having a peptizable matrix component such as acid-reactive clays or minerals wherein the oil is bound to a solid sorbent material, the following description refers to OBDC as a nonlimiting example for illustrative purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The process provides fast and efficient processing of OBDC which can be achieved with relatively small peptizing, combustion, desorption, solids recovery, vapor recovery and/or oil recovery process units and short residence times. The total processing time for the solids is on the order of minutes, for example. In an embodiment, the processing equipment can be transportable, e.g., skid-mounted or trailer-mounted, for transportation to the drilling site or other on-site processing location. The process provides in one embodiment a relatively high oil recovery, e.g., 50, 60, 70, 75 or even 80 percent or more of the oil in the OBDC or other substrate. Furthermore, in a specific embodiment, the recovered oil may surprisingly have improved properties relative to the oil in the OBDC, e.g., a higher viscosity and/or lower aromatic hydrocarbon concentration that of the oil present in the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In an embodiment, the oil in the bound liquid in the substrate comprises more than 2 wt % or more than 1 wt % aromatic hydrocarbons, by weight of the oil in the OBDC, and may contain as much as 20 wt %, 25 wt %, 30 wt % or more aromatic hydrocarbons, by weight of the oil in the OBDC, whereas the recovered oil comprises less aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably less than 2 wt % or more preferably less than 1 wt % total BTEX (benzene-toluene-ethlylbenzene-xylene) aromatic hydrocarbons, by weight of the recovered oil. As used herein, aromatics content is determined as the total BTEX (benzene-toluene-ethlylbenzene-xylene) according to US EPA 8260. In an embodiment, the viscosity of the recovered oil may be increased relative to the viscosity of the oil present in the substrate. In an embodiment, the recovered oil has a viscosity at 40Â° C. (KV40) of greater than 2 cSt, wherein the viscosity is determined according to ASTM-D88.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In an embodiment, the recovered oil is suitable for use in a drilling fluid. For example, the recovered oil in one embodiment is further processed by formulating a drilling fluid based on the oil, in one embodiment as the equivalent of a synthetic oil base stock. The drilling fluid can also be formulated with a brine component, e.g., as an internal phase, that is also recovered from the OBDC or a high-liquid (greater than 35 wt % liquids or where the liquid can be readily recovered by filtration, pressing, centrifugation or the like) water based or oil based drill cuttings or water based or oil based spent drilling fluids.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The exact mechanism for the improvement of the qualities and properties of the recovered oil are not known, but it is theorized that the oil may undergo various reactions in the low-oxygen or reducing atmosphere in the chemical-thermal treatment such as cracking, reforming, oligomerization, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, coking, isomerization or the like, and further that the drill cuttings or other sorbent material, particularly by pretreatment or âactivationâ by the acid treatment in the peptizing step, may act as a catalyst for the conversion of the hydrocarbons to paraffinic and/or alicyclic hydrocarbons and/or conversion of heterohydrocarbon components to non-functionalized hydrocarbons. It is also theorized that the mechanism(s) may selectively favor reaction of the aromatic compounds and devolatilization of the paraffinic compounds. The invention is, however, not bound by any particular theory or reaction mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a method <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure to separate and recover oil from a substrate feed <b>12</b> which may be OBDC and/or other oil-containing materials. The method <b>10</b> may include acid addition <b>14</b> and peptizing <b>16</b>, wherein the substrate is contacted with an amount of an acidic reagent for a period of time, at a temperature, and under shear to react at least a portion of the substrate to produce a peptizate having an increased surface area compared to the substrate. The acidic reagent can include a mineral acid added in step <b>14</b> to the substrate at one or more stages before or during the peptizing step <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Combustion <b>18</b> provides a hot effluent gas at a temperature greater than 300Â° C. and comprising less than 1 vol % oxygen for mixing and desorption <b>20</b> to mix the peptizate with the hot gas under turbulent conditions to heat the substrate and desorb at least a portion of the oil. Solids recovery <b>22</b> may involve separating the mixture from the substrate mixing/desorption step <b>20</b> to obtain a dilute phase comprising vapor including devolatilized oil from the substrate and a dense phase comprising oil-lean solids <b>24</b>. Solids recovery <b>22</b> may also include removal of entrained solids from the dilute phase with cyclonic separation, filtration, electrostatic precipitation, scrubbing or the like or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In oil recovery step <b>26</b>, oil <b>28</b> is recovered from the dilute phase vapors by, for example, condensation and gravity separation of the condensate into respective streams of oil <b>28</b> and an aqueous phase <b>30</b>. If desired, the recovered oil stream <b>28</b> may be collected for further purification and/or use in the process, e.g., as a fuel in combustion step <b>18</b>. In an embodiment, the oil purification may optionally include one or more additional processes to further purify the recovered oil for a particular end use. Examples include distillation, filtering, treatment with activated carbon, absorbents, adsorbents, and/or the like, reaction with various materials to remove and/or convert impurities contained therein, fractionation, ion exchange, and/or the like, depending on the desired properties of the oil and/or dependent on the intended use of the subsequently purified recovered oil.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows an embodiment of the apparatus, generally referred to as <b>32</b>, wherein the substrate from substrate feed zone <b>34</b> and acid from acid feed system <b>36</b> are supplied to a peptizer <b>38</b> comprising a first housing <b>40</b> equipped with one or more high-shear agitators <b>42</b>. The first housing <b>40</b> is preferably fixed and fluidly sealed. A transfer zone <b>44</b>, preferably comprising a rotary valve <b>46</b> or other means to fluidly isolate the peptizing zone <b>38</b>, is provided to supply the peptizate to an inlet end of thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> within second fixed housing <b>50</b> equipped with one or more turbulence-generating agitators <b>52</b>. Burner <b>54</b> is provided to supply hot combustion effluent gas to the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> to heat the peptizate and desorb oil from the sorbent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The second housing <b>50</b> is preferably a fixed horizontal cylinder equipped with a solids disengagement zone <b>54</b> opposite the inlet end of the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> and a solids outlet <b>56</b> adjacent the disengagement zone <b>54</b> to receive disengaged solids therefrom. The solids disengagement zone <b>54</b> and solids outlet <b>56</b> are preferably spaced away from the agitator <b>52</b> to promote solid separation and settling, i.e., the agitator <b>52</b> preferably terminates adjacent the solids disengagement zone <b>54</b> and does not extend into the solids disengagement zone or above the solids outlet <b>56</b>. The solids disengagement zone <b>54</b> may be provided with a hood <b>58</b> or other relatively large cross-sectional and/or low flow velocity plenum to promote solids settling and provide a solids-lean dilute phase for processing in vapor recovery system <b>60</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">The Substrate</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The substrate which is processed or treated according to various embodiments comprises liquid bound on or within a solid sorbent material, wherein the liquid comprises oil or a mixture of oil and water. Although the substrate to be treated is described herein with specific reference to drill cuttings as one example, and especially drill cuttings obtained from operations with oil-based drilling muds (oil based drill cuttings or OBDC), other contaminated or environmentally hazardous wastes or substrates can also be treated using the present methodology and apparatus, especially clay-containing wastes. Drill cuttings can contain large quantities of clay because the oil deposits and other strata typically have a high content of clay.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one embodiment, the substrate can be provided by contacting a sorbent material containing acid-reactive component(s) with oil in a suitable oil-sorbent mixing device, for example, where the oil contains aromatics or has a relatively poor quality and it is desired to upgrade the oil according to the process of the present invention. In this embodiment, the process may include a separate oil-sorbent contacting step or the oil sorbent contacting may occur in the peptizer, e.g., in an oil-sorbent contacting zone upstream from the peptizing zone or a portion thereof. In an embodiment, the solids recovered from the thermal desorber can be recycled as the sorbent to the oil-sorbent contacting zone or step.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Suitable substrates include OBDC containing 50 wt % or less total liquids, based on the total weight of the substrate, wherein the substrate is generally free of free liquid, i.e., the liquid will not readily separate from the OBDC by gravity. In various embodiments, the substrate may contain less than or equal to about 35 wt % total liquids, less than or equal to about 30 wt % total liquids, less than or equal to about 25 wt % total liquids, less than or equal to about 20 wt % total liquids, less than or equal to about 15 wt % total liquids, or less than or equal to about 10 wt % total liquids, and may contain at least about 5 wt % oil, at least about 10 wt % oil, at least about 15 wt % oil or at least about 20 wt % oil, based on the weight of the substrate (liquid and sorbent). Substrates with greater amounts of oil can be processed according to the present embodiments, but, when economically possible, it may be desirable according to an embodiment to alternatively treat such substrates by other steps such as centrifugation, gravity settling, solvent extraction, or the like, prior to the instant process, to remove the bulk of the oil which may be readily removed by more conventional means.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">If desired, in one embodiment, the substrate may be amended by the addition of lime or another acid-reactive component, e.g., where the substrate is deficient in acid-reactive components. OBDC normally have a pH in the range of about 10-12, and are sufficiently reactive with mineral acid to a pH in the intermediate peptized material and recovered devolatilized substrate of about 6-8. However, where the OBDC have an unusually low pH the process can benefit by the addition of alkaline earth, e.g. lime, to obtain a pH in the 10-12 range.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">If desired, in another embodiment, the OBDC may optionally be pretreated, and/or treated in the peptizer, with a demulsifier such as dodecyl benzene sulfonate.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Peptizing</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The peptizing of the substrate is a physical-chemical process in which the sorbent in the substrate is induced to quickly expand by contacting with one or more mineral acid reagents thereby increasing its volume to facilitate the disintegration or dispersion of agglomerated particles and expose surface area to facilitate the release of liquid in the subsequent thermal desorption step. Peptizing thus includes contacting the substrate with an amount of a mineral acid under high shear conditions within a peptizing zone.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In an embodiment, the mineral acid reagent, also referred to herein as the mineral acid, is added to the substrate in an amount sufficient to produce a peptizate having a pH between 6 and 8, preferably a pH between 6.5 and 7.5. The mineral acid may be added at between 1 wt % and 100 wt %, preferably between 2 wt % and 20 wt %, based on the total amount of substrate material present, to produce a peptizate. The mineral acid in one embodiment is typically added at 4 wt % to 10 or 12 wt %, based on the total weight of the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Importantly, the more water present in substrate the more acid is typically added. In an embodiment, the proportion of acid supplied to the peptizing zone can be employed as a temperature control tool in the thermal desorption zone, for example, if the steady state temperature of the thermal desorption zone increases or decreases due to decreased or increased water content of the OBDC supplied to the peptizer, then the acid addition rate may be respectively increased or decreased to account for the fluctuation. This can be an important control mechanism since the water content of the OBDC can vary considerably between and within batches, e.g., water may drain from the uppermost OBDC layers in the feed or storage hopper into the lower layers so that the lower layers may contain more water than the upper layers, or the upper layers may become wet from precipitation or humidity or other contact with water; and also because of the difficulty of adjusting the temperature of the combustion effluent gases supplied from the burner while maintaining low oxygen or substoichiometric oxygen:fuel ratios (fuel rich).</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In addition, depending on the water content and the composition of the substrate, in one embodiment the amount of mineral acid added to produce a peptizate suitable for desorbing would result in a peptizate having a pH of less than 6. In an embodiment wherein the addition of an amount of mineral acid to produce a peptizate having a pH of 6 or less would not otherwise be suitable for desorption, additional acid and an alkaline reagent may be added to the peptizing zone in neutralizing amount, e.g., an amount of additional acid and alkaline reagent such as alkaline earth sufficient to produce a peptizate having a pH between 6 and 8. Where alkaline reagent is employed it is preferably added in an alternating stage or stages with the acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The acid may be diluted with water to achieve the desired result and/or control, but is preferably added as a concentrate or neat to obtain a higher temperature in the peptizate. Suitable mineral acids include, for example, sulfuric acid, oleum, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, combinations thereof, and the like. In an embodiment, the mineral acid preferably comprises concentrated (98+wt %) sulfuric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The mineral acid may be added to the substrate as it enters the peptizing zone, or may be added step wise in one or more stages during peptizing, under high shear mixing and/or kneading conditions. Examples of high shear conditions include those present in various kneaders, ribbon blenders, paddle mixers, and the like, known to one of skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In an embodiment, the oil based drill cuttings and the mineral acid are contacted for a period of time and at conditions of temperature and shear sufficient to allow them to react chemically inasmuch as the OBDC are broken into smaller particles and/or a clay solid shale matrix may be expanded (e.g., intercalated, exfoliated, delaminated, opened, and/or the like) to permit the immigration of the inverse oil in water emulsion contained within the substrate to a point nearer to the surface of the particles.</p>

In one embodiment, the vent <b>68</b> and port(s) <b>70</b>, if present, are sealed so as to fluidly seal the peptizer <b>62</b>, except that the vent <b>68</b> and port(s) <b>70</b> may be equipped with a pressure relief valve or rupture disk so as to prevent overpressuring the peptizer <b>62</b>, e.g., in the event peptizer <b>62</b> is overheated above the boiling point of water or other liquid in the substrate, in which case the vent <b>68</b> or port <b>70</b> may be connected to the vapor recovery system <b>60</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In an embodiment as best seen in <figref>FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the peptizer <b>62</b> comprises at least one agitator <b>72</b> to impart shear into the acid/substrate mixture.

A plurality of paddles, pins, plows, blades and/or the like, referred to herein as blades <b>76</b>, may be positioned along the length of shaft(s) <b>74</b>. The blades <b>76</b> can be pitched to facilitate maximum shear conditions for agitation and/or movement of the solids in a forward and/or partial back-mixing within peptizer <b>62</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In embodiment, peptizer <b>62</b> is operated at a temperature of greater than or equal to about 50Â° C. and 200Â° C., preferably between about 70Â° C. and 100Â° C., more preferably between 75Â° C. and 90Â° C. In one embodiment, the peptizer <b>62</b> has a maximum operating temperature at or below the boiling point of the liquid bound to the substrate at an absolute pressure of 1.25 atmospheres, preferably below the boiling point of the bound liquid at atmospheric pressure; and in another embodiment, the peptizer <b>62</b> is operated at about atmospheric pressure, i.e., from about 0.9 to about 1.25 atmospheres absolute, or below atmospheric pressure, preferably from â0.1 to 0 atmospheres gauge. Subatmospheric pressure may be maintained in the peptizer <b>62</b>, for example, by connecting vent <b>68</b> or a port <b>70</b> to an induced draft fan in vapor recovery system <b>60</b>, or by sealing the inlet <b>64</b> and outlet <b>66</b> with suitable mechanical devices such as rotary valves which permit some vapor leakage or bypass from the peptizer <b>62</b> into a subatmospheric system such as where subatmospheric pressure is provided in thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). In an embodiment, the peptizer <b>62</b> may heated or cooled to maintain the desired temperature. In a preferred embodiment, however, the peptizer <b>62</b> is insulated and operated adiabatically wherein the exothermic reaction between the acid reagent and acid-reactive materials in the substrate and/or heat of dilution of the acid reagent in the liquid present in the substrate feed provide internal heating. Where present, heating may occur through indirect heating e.g., via external application of a heat transfer medium, electrical heating, and/or the like.</p>

The peptizer <b>62</b> may further comprise a plurality of reactors or stages in sequence, either separate or within the same housing.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The internal design and construction materials for the peptizer <b>62</b> are preferably such as to resist extreme pH environments within the process, especially when heat is provided through direct or indirect heating of the peptizer <b>62</b> and/or via the exothermic reaction between the substrate and the mineral acid, the mineral acid and a caustic reagent, and/or the like. The peptizer is preferably comprised of stainless steel alloy.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The speed of the material throughput, as well as the specific materials used to manufacture the peptizer <b>62</b> may be selected to prevent the viscoelastic hydrocarbon and cuttings matrixes typical of oil based drill cuttings from sticking to the walls thereof. In an embodiment, the speed of agitator <b>72</b> is critical in creating particles suitable for the desorption step of the substrate contaminants. If the impeller speed is too slow, the substrate will not be adequately contacted with the reagents resulting in poor contact between the contaminated particles and the acid. If the speed of the impeller is too fast, energy is wasted with no improvement in reaction conditions including reduction in particle size and/or expanding of the particles of the substrate (i.e., the substrate) to be treated.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The moving speed at the tip of the blades <b>62</b> in one embodiment may ideally be between 2 and 8 m/s (7 and 26 ft/s) on rotation. More preferably, the tip speed is between 2 and 5 m/s (7 and 16 ft/s), and especially between 2.5 and 3.5 m/s (8 and 12 ft/s). As one example for a mixer treating 10 metric tons per hour of drill cuttings (5 m<sup>3</sup>/h or 180 ft<sup>3</sup>/h), the peptizer can have twin parallel shafts approximately 3 m (10 ft) long, running the length of the mixer, each with at least 30 paddles/shaft and a 0.4 m (1.3 ft) diameter. In another embodiment, the moving speed at the tip of the blades <b>62</b> is approximately 0.01 to 1 m/s, preferably about 0.2 m/s (0.7 ft/s) on the translation in both directions</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In an embodiment, the total residence time of the substrate within the peptizer <b>62</b> is less than or equal to about 2 minutes, preferably the residence time within the peptizer is between about 10 and 120 seconds, preferably less than 100 seconds, preferably less than 90 seconds, preferably less than 80 seconds, preferably less than 70 seconds, preferably less than 60 seconds, preferably less than 50 seconds, preferably less than 40 seconds, with less than 30 seconds being more preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">As one example for a reactor treating 30 metric tons per hour of drill cuttings (15 m<sup>3</sup>/h), the peptizer <b>62</b> has twin parallel shafts approximately 3.66 m (12 ft) long with 74 paddles/shaft and a 457 mm (18-in.) diameter. The total reaction (residence) time preferably does not exceed 60-80 seconds inside the reactor. The reaction process requires vigorous agitation. The energy for agitation in the peptizer <b>62</b> desirably does not exceed 1.12 kW (1.5 hp) per each metric ton of treated matrix per hour. For example, to treat 30 metric tons per hour of contaminated drill cuttings, the total power required for driving the peptizer agitator is preferably 33.6 kW (45 hp) or less.</p>

The temperature of material within the peptizer may increase due to the heat generated by the reaction of the mineral acid with the substrate being treated, by the heat of dilution of the mineral acid in the water present in the substrate, and/or via (optional) application of heat to the peptizer itself. The temperature at the exit of peptizer is preferably greater than or equal to about 70Â° C., and preferably less than or equal to about 100Â° C.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In an embodiment as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the peptizate is transferred from the peptizing zone <b>38</b> through the transfer zone <b>44</b> into the second housing <b>50</b> comprising the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b>. The thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> is in fluid communication with burner <b>54</b> which supplies combustion effluent gas. In an embodiment, the combustion effluent gas comprises less than 1 vol % oxygen and is supplied to the thermal desorption zone at a temperature greater than 300Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In an embodiment, the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> comprises an agitator <b>52</b> to create turbulent conditions and promote rapid heat transfer. The peptizate is mixed with the combustion effluent gas under turbulent conditions in the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> to heat the peptizate and desorb at least a portion of the oil from the sorbent material. The mixture exiting the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> is separated into a dilute phase comprising oil vapor from the sorbent and a dense phase comprising the sorbent, wherein the dense phase has an oil content which is less than the oil content of the sorbent material present in the feed substrate and/or in the peptizate.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In an embodiment, the temperature of the combustion effluent gas is sufficient to provide a temperature of the vapor phase exiting the desorber in a range from a lower limit of 180Â° C., 200Â° C., 220Â° C., 235Â° C., or 250Â° C. to a higher upper limit of up to 500Â° C., 400Â° C., 350Â° C., or 300Â° C. In general, the thermal equilibrium temperature of the dense phase solids recovered from the desorber is about 10Â° C. to 50Â° C. less than the dilute phase vapor, preferably 20Â° C. to 40Â° C. less, more preferably 25Â° C. to 35Â° C. less. In an embodiment, slightly negative pressure, for example, 0.8 to 0.99 atmospheres absolute or â<b>0</b>.<b>01</b> to â0.2 atmospheres gauge, is continuously maintained in the thermal desorption zone, e.g., by withdrawing vapor or a dilute solids phase via an induced draft fan in the vapor recovery system <b>60</b>, and if desired a safety valve such as a pressure relief valve and/or rupture disk can be provided in the case of overpressure, e.g., the safety valve can be calibrated at about 0.1 MPa gauge (about 14.7 psig) or 0.05 MPa gauge (7.35 psig) or 0.03 MPa gauge (4.4 psig) or 0.02 MPa gauge (3 psig).</p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In another important embodiment, the oil is selectively devolatilized in the thermal desorption step and/or otherwise upgraded to improve one or more of the properties of the recovered oil relative to the oil in the OBDC or other substrate, such as, for example, lower aromatics content, lower sulfur content, lower functional group content, higher saturates, higher viscosity, higher viscosity index, and any combination thereof. Without being bound by theory, reactions that may occur in the thermal desorber include cracking, hydrocracking, steam cracking, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization, etc. The combustion effluent gas may contain reactive species such as, for example, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, steam, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and the like. In one embodiment, the combustion effluent gas is free of oxygen, e.g., less than 1 vol % oxygen, preferably less than 0.1 vol % oxygen.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In one embodiment, the OBDC or other substrate may act as a catalyst or as a support for catalysts, e.g., the peptization with acid may expose or form catalytically active surfaces in the sorbent material.

In an embodiment, at least a portion of the oil present in the dilute phase is recovered in the vapor recovery system <b>60</b>, and in various embodiments, the recovered oil comprises at least 50 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 60 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 65 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 70 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 75 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 80 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate, or at least 85 wt % of the oil originally present in the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In an embodiment, heat is supplied directly to the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> in the form of combustion effluent gas by the burner <b>54</b> which is discharged into the thermal desorption zone. In an embodiment, the burner <b>54</b> preferably includes a combustion chamber positioned such that the hot combustion effluent gas enters the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b>, but the burner is spaced away from the thermal desorption zone such that the flame does not impinge directly on the sorbent so as to avoid excessive pyrolysis or combustion of the oil present in or with the peptizate. In an embodiment, the burner <b>54</b> may operate at stoichiometric or sub-stoichiometric oxygen levels to control the amount of oxygen entering the thermal desorption zone to avoid or limit combustion or other oxidation of the oil present in or with the peptizate. In an embodiment, oxygen is desirably excluded from the combustion effluent by setting the desired fuel rate to the burner, adjusting the air or oxygen-enriched air supplied to find the maximum flame temperature, and then slightly reducing the air or oxygen-enriched air to reduce the flame temperature, e.g., 5Â° C., 10Â° C., 20Â° C. or 30Â° C. below the maximum flame temperature. For example, the burner in one embodiment is supplied with 90 to 99 percent of stoichiometric air, preferably 95 to 98 percent of stoichiometric air.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">If desired, a temperature moderator such as supplemental water and/or steam may be injected into the combustion effluent gas to moderate the temperature within the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> to avoid overheating of the material being treated therein. Any suitable fuel supply may be used, e.g., natural gas, fuel oil, recovered process oil, or a combination thereof. The combustion effluent gas may be supplied to the thermal desorption zone at a temperature from about 300Â° C. to about 1200Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In an embodiment, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6-9</figref>, the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> is located within a desorber <b>100</b> which includes a generally cylindrical fixed housing <b>102</b>. The peptizate inlet <b>104</b> and solids outlet <b>106</b> are preferably controlled by respective rotary valves <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> (see <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) or other similar device to prevent oxygen from entering and/or hydrogen, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon vapors from exiting the otherwise fluidly sealed desorber <b>100</b>. An agitator <b>112</b> comprises a rotating shaft <b>114</b> and a plurality of radially extending paddle assemblies <b>116</b>. The shaft <b>114</b> is centrally located, extends longitudinally through the desorber <b>100</b> and is supported by end bearings <b>118</b> and intermediate bearings <b>120</b> carried on bearing support assemblies <b>122</b>. The end bearings <b>118</b> should be sealed to inhibit fluid communication outside the desorber <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 8-9</figref>, the housing <b>110</b> may optionally be refractory-lined and include, for example, a coaxial steel outer wall <b>124</b> and/or one or more refractory linings such as outer refractory layer <b>126</b>, inner refractory layer <b>128</b> and surface layer <b>130</b>. The outer refractory layer <b>126</b> in one embodiment is a concrete layer formed from steel-reinforced gypsum cement, and inner layer <b>128</b> in an additional or alternate embodiment comprises a cast refractory or refractory bricks. Skin layer <b>130</b> is disposed between an inner surface of layer <b>128</b> and the cylindrical surface defined by the rotation of the paddle assemblies <b>116</b> about the shaft <b>114</b>, and may be formed in situ by the deposition of substrate particles which become baked onto the surface of layer <b>128</b>. Additional insulation materials e.g., cast or brick refractory materials, insulation, sound abatement materials, and the like, may be employed inside or outside the unit to further improve the efficiency of the unit by attenuating the escape of heat.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In an embodiment, the combustion effluent gas <b>132</b> may enter the desorber <b>100</b> at a hot gas inlet <b>134</b> located in a lower portion of the inlet end below the peptizate inlet <b>104</b> and pass co-currently with the solids to gas outlet <b>136</b> located above the solids outlet <b>106</b>. Co-current flow facilitates movement of the solid particles toward the exit location and also facilitates temperature moderation in the thermal desorption zone, which may be helpful to avoid or minimize coke or carbon formation from oil residue which can otherwise occur if the temperature within the thermal desorption zone <b>48</b> is too high, which can in-turn inhibit mass transfer and lead to losses in the amount of oil that can be recovered. The presence of coke or carbon deposits on the treated solids can also discolor the treated solids, e.g., gray or black, which may serve as an indication to one of skill in the art that the internal temperature is too high for a particular application. In an alternate embodiment, the gas and solids may enter and exit from opposite ends in a countercurrent configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In an embodiment, the shaft <b>114</b> is preferably rotated such that the tip speed of the paddle assemblies <b>116</b> is between 0.1 and 20 m/s, preferably between 0.5 and 10 m/s, more preferably between 1 and 8 m/s, and more preferably between 2 and 6 m/s. The rotation creates turbulence within the thermal desorption zone to improve the gas-solid contact of the substrate undergoing the desorption step with the hot gases and thus to promote heat and mass transfer, reducing the residence time required to complete the desired heat and mass transfer within the thermal desorption zone. Insufficient agitation can increase the residence time needed or reduce the efficiency of the oil recovery. Too much agitation can unnecessarily increase the power requirements, speed wear and tear on the equipment and produce excessive fines which are undesirably entrained in the dilute phase and can lead to problems with fines removal or plugged lines and equipment in the vapor recovery system <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The paddle assemblies <b>116</b> can be pitched as desired to advance the solids material through the desorber <b>100</b>, but are preferably not pitched. Similarly the desorber <b>100</b> can be sloped to facilitate or inhibit the movement of solids through the unit, but is preferably level. The turbulence in the desorber <b>100</b> and the relatively high velocity of the gas through the unit are preferably sufficient to advance the solids to the solids outlet <b>106</b>. The space above the solids outlet <b>106</b>, which is preferably located through a lower surface of the desorber <b>100</b>, is desirably free of rotating paddle assemblies <b>116</b> so as to promote solids disengagement from the dilute phase or vapor. Solids disengagement is also promoted by providing an exit conduit or hood <b>58</b> of relatively large cross sectional area so as to reduce the flow velocity and allow solids to settle, i.e., where the fines entrainment is limited to particles having a terminal velocity which is less than the velocity of the exiting vapor. Increasing the height of the hood <b>58</b> and limiting agitation in the space below and/or adjacent to the vapor outlet <b>136</b> can also be beneficial to promoting solids disengagement.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The dilute phase produced in the thermal desorption zone may comprise fluidized solid particles of the sorbent and other materials. It is generally desirable to minimize solids entrainment in the dilute phase. Therefore, in one embodiment, the desorber <b>100</b> comprises a solids disengagement zone <b>54</b> having a relatively low velocity and turbulence relative to other areas of the thermal desorption zone, which allows entrained particles to drop out of the dilute phase before exiting the thermal desorption zone. The solids disengaged in the solids disengagement zone are returned to the solids adjacent a bottom surface of the thermal desorption zone and discharged from the thermal desorption zone at a solids discharge <b>51</b>. In an embodiment, solids discharge <b>51</b> may comprise a desorber outlet rotary valve <b>44</b>. Disengagement zone <b>96</b> may also comprise an impingement plate, demister or similar devices (not shown), to facilitate solids disengagement from the dilute phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In an embodiment, the first fixed housing and the second fixed housing are located in a single housing, separated from one another. In another embodiment, the thermal desorption zone is a different type of reactor which achieves the same mass and energy transfer under high shear or turbulent conditions to mix and heat the solids being treated with the combustion effluent gas, such as, for example, a fluid bed reactor, a moving bed reactor, a riser reactor, any combination thereof, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The solids are recovered from the thermal desorber below the solids disengagement zone. A rotary valve may be used to inhibit gas from escaping from the desorber and air from entering the desorber.

The dilute phase may also comprise combustion gas produced by the burner. The dilute phase may further include particulate matter, which is entrained in the dilute phase during thermal desorption. The dilute phase leaving the thermal desorber is typically at a temperature between 100Â° C. and 800Â° C., preferably greater than or equal to about 150Â° C., preferably between 180Â° C. and 350Â° C., more preferably about 180Â° C. to about 325Â° C. or more preferably between 200Â° C. and 300Â° C.

In Comparative Example 1, an oil based drill cuttings (OBDC) substrate having 11 wt % water, 9.3 wt % oil, and 79.7 wt % solids was treated according to a comparative process using a lab scale setup including a peptizer, an agitated direct thermal desorber, and a cyclone, but without adding any acid to the peptizer The desorber agitator speed was 115 rpm with a tip speed of 1.1 m/s and the residence time of the combustion effluent gas was about 3 seconds (27.7 m/min). The material from the peptizer was heated in the thermal desorber under high shear conditions using co-current fuel-rich combustion effluent gas at 920Â° C. to obtain an outlet temperature of 220Â° C., which was subject to cyclone separation to remove entrained solids, followed by condensation and decanting to recover oil and water streams. The substrate and liquid and solids product streams were measured and analyzed for oil, water and solid contents and the results are presented in Table 1.</p>

The higher desorber outlet temperature is explained by the exotherm from the reaction of the OBDC with the acid in the peptizer. The results are presented in Table 2.</p>

      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0129">In Example 2, 53 wt % of the oil present in the substrate was recovered and the residual oil on the recovered dense phase solids was 3 wt %, which was an improvement for the peptizing embodiment over the high-shear direct thermal desorption without acid addition in Example 1. The excess solids reported in the outputs is believed to be due to the formation of sulfate salts and other solid compounds formed as the acid reaction products in the peptizer.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0130">In Example 3, another OBDC substrate having 19 wt % water, 11.6 wt % oil, and 69.4 wt % solids was treated according to the inventive process using the same lab scale setup as in Examples 1 and 2, except that the concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the peptizer at a rate of 7.8 wt % by weight of the OBDC. The peptizate was heated in the desorber using combustion effluent gas at 900Â° C. to obtain products at a temperature of 275Â° C. The dilute phase was again subjected to cyclone separation to remove entrained solids, followed by heat exchange/condensation and decanting to recover oil. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>

      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0131">In Example 3, when the amount of acid was increased to about 8 wt % by weight of the OBDC, 72.5 wt % of the oil present in the substrate was recovered and the residual oil on the recovered dense phase solids was nearly 1 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0132">In Example 4, a test was conducted on a commercial scale (portable size) unit for a total time of operation of 7.25 hours using a 2.3 m diameter by 3 m long thermal desorber with paddles on 195 mm (7.68-in.) spacing at 40 rpm. The test was conducted at a rate of 3.54 metric tons/hr using OBDC obtained from a well site wherein the oil utilized was mainly diesel fuel with an aromatic content of up to about 30 wt % according to the spec sheet. A total of 2066 L of oil were recovered (82.3%) and the dense phase had a final wt % oil of 2.2%, reduced from 10.72 in the substrate feed. A total of 1030 L of diesel fuel were fed to the entire system including the burner and the diesel generator used to operate the equipment, to produce a net recovery of 1036 L of oil from the process above fuel requirements. During the process, 2.37 L/min of diesel fuel was supplied to the burner to produce the combustion effluent gas utilized in the desorber. A total of 19,000 L of water were used in the scrubber columns. The average residence time of the solids was 40 seconds in the peptizer and 3 minutes in the thermal desorber. The peptizing zone volume was 1.8 m<sup>3 </sup>and the thermal desorption zone volume was 22.8 m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0133">In this test, the substrate feed was supplied to the peptizer along with concentrated sulfuric acid at an average of 3.7 wt % by weight of the OBDC. The peptizer outlet temperature was between 80Â° and 100Â° C. The peptizate was fed into the desorber co-currently with a combustion effluent gas supplied at a temperature of 1000Â° C. The temperature at the outlets of the thermal desorption zone was maintained between 240Â° and 260Â° C. by adjusting the acid rate to the peptizer as needed. The dense phase solids were recovered through a rotary valve. The dilute phase exited the thermal desorption zone and entered a cyclone separator and entrained solids were recovered. Mechanical rodding of the transfer line to the cyclone was used as needed to avoid plugging. The solids-lean gas exited the cyclone separator at a temperature between 150Â° and 180Â° C. and entered a knock-out drum to further remove entrained solids. The gas exited the knock-out drum at a temperature of 120Â° to 140Â° C. and was directed into a high temperature heat exchanger wherein oil and water were recovered. The uncondensed vapors exited the heat exchanger at a temperature between 40 and 60Â° C. and were then directed into a low temperature condenser using cooling tower water (Ë30Â° C.) as the cooling medium. The condensate from the low temperature condenser was gravity separated to recover the oil. The uncondensed vapors exited the scrubber column at a temperature between 33Â° and 35Â° C. and were vented.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0134">The outputs were measured and analyzed, and the results are shown in Table 4. Note additional water recovery from the combustion effluent in the outputs and additional solids believed to be due to sulfate addition salts and other products from the acid added to the OBDC in the peptizer.</p>

      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0137">As the data show, 61.7 wt % of the available oil was recovered as a liquid from the substrate. A rather unexpected result was the improvement in the properties of the oil recovered. The composition of the oil recovered by the instant process is markedly different from that of normal diesel fuel that was present in the oil based drill cuttings used as substrate in the instant test. In fact, in view of the viscosity and aniline point, the recovered oil is suitable for use in a variety of functions including oilfield functions, household/industrial cleaning products, metal rolling oil, paints and coatings, pesticide formulations, paper and milling chemicals, water treatment chemicals, and the like, consistent with other known refined mineral oils having similar properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0138">The uncondensed gases from the stack in Example 4 were analyzed and determined to contain 92-134 ppm CO, 7.3 vol % CO2, 1 ppm NOx as NO, no detectable H2S, and had an explosivity (lower explosive limit in air) of 40 to 80 vol %.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0139">The invention has been described above with reference to numerous embodiments and specific examples. Many variations will suggest themselves to those skilled in this art in light of the above detailed description.
