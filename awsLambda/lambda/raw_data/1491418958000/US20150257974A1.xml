In some embodiments, the compounder <b>10</b> may be used to prepare one or more of the following: chemotherapy drugs, epidurals, dialysis solution, cardioplegia drugs, etc. for later administration to a patient. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the compounder <b>10</b> may be part of a bedside system which delivers fluid directly to a patient or to an apparatus that will deliver the fluid to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The compounder <b>10</b> may include a housing <b>12</b>. The housing <b>12</b> may enclose various reservoirs, fluid pathways, valves, manifolds, chambers, control circuitry, sensors, etc. that are included as parts of the compounder <b>10</b>. The housing <b>12</b> may be any suitable enclosure constructed of any suitable material or combination of suitable materials. In various embodiments, the interior volume of the housing <b>12</b> may be a controlled environment, or may be divided into a number of controlled environments. In such embodiments, the controlled portion(s) of the housing <b>12</b> may be sealed, insulated, etc. to facilitate control of that portion of the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In some embodiments, the interior volume or a portion of the interior volume of the housing <b>12</b> may be controlled to be relatively free of particulates and/or contaminates or meet a desired cleanroom standard. In such embodiments, the compounder <b>10</b> may include various filters (not shown) and circulation fans (not shown). Additionally, the interior volume of the housing <b>12</b> may be positively pressurized to help ensure air from an uncontrolled environment may not ingress into the housing <b>12</b> in the event that there is a leak. The interior volume, or a portion of the interior volume of the housing <b>12</b> may be temperature controlled. In such embodiments, the compounder <b>10</b> may include thermal control components (not shown) such as a heater and/or refrigeration system, temperature sensors, etc. In some embodiments, the interior volume of the housing <b>12</b> may be controlled based on humidity, light levels or wavelengths, etc. and include such components as necessary to accomplish such control.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The compounder <b>10</b> may include a user interface <b>13</b>. The user interface <b>13</b> may be a graphic user interface such as a touch screen or any other suitable user interface. The user interface <b>13</b> may be used by a user to control operation of or program the compounder <b>10</b>, check status of the compounder <b>10</b>, convey status messages from the compounder <b>10</b>, provide troubleshooting or help screens to a user, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the example embodiment, the user interface <b>13</b> is shown as a part of the compounder <b>10</b>, however, this need not be so in all embodiments. In some embodiments, the user interface <b>13</b> may be external to the compounder <b>10</b>. For example, the user interface <b>13</b> may be accessed through a tablet, PC, smart phone, or any other suitable platform.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As shown, the compounder <b>10</b> includes a manifold <b>14</b>. A number of reservoirs <b>16</b> are docked on the manifold <b>14</b>. In the example embodiment, five reservoirs may be docked on the manifold <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, the manifold <b>14</b> may be adapted such that any suitable number of reservoirs <b>16</b> may be docked on a manifold <b>14</b>. This may be desirable in order to make a compounder <b>10</b> more versatile and able to concoct a larger number of compounded medications or other mixtures. Some embodiments may include more than one manifold <b>14</b>. For example, there may be a number of manifolds <b>14</b> arranged in parallel. This may also help to increase the range of compounded medications or mixtures which the compounder <b>10</b> may create. Additionally, having multiple manifolds <b>14</b> may help to increase the overall throughput of a compounder <b>10</b>. In some specific embodiments, the manifold(s) <b>14</b> may be configured to dock at least 63 reservoirs <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">A manifold <b>14</b> for the compounder <b>10</b> may be constructed in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the manifold <b>14</b> may be machined, injection molded, or generated with an additive manufacturing process such as selective laser sintering, etc. It may also be desirable that a manifold <b>14</b> for the compounder <b>10</b> be of a material which will not be compromised by repeated sterilization. For example, it may be desirable that a manifold <b>14</b> be made from high temperature, heat resistant plastic.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The reservoirs <b>16</b>, in the example embodiment, may be medication vials. In other embodiments, the reservoirs <b>16</b> may not be medication vials. In applications where the compounder <b>10</b> is adapted for use in beverage mixing the reservoirs <b>16</b> may contain drink concentrates, liquors, drink additives, etc. In applications where the compounder <b>10</b> is adapted for use in paint mixing, the reservoirs may be various colors of paint. In other embodiments, the reservoirs <b>16</b> may contain other fluids, solutions, materials, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Fluid may be selectively extracted from the reservoirs <b>16</b> and into the manifold <b>14</b>. This may be done in any suitable fashion. In some embodiments, a positive pressure may be created in the reservoir <b>16</b> such that fluid is forced out of the reservoir <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, a vacuum or partial vacuum may be drawn downstream of the reservoir <b>16</b> to suck fluid out of the reservoir <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, a reservoir <b>16</b> may be elastomeric and may exert a force on the fluid contained within the reservoir <b>16</b> that squeezes the contained fluid out of the reservoir <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, a reservoir <b>16</b> may be flaccid or flexible and be surrounded by an inflatable bladder or pressurizable chamber. As the bladder is inflated or the pressurizable chamber is pressurized, the flaccid reservoir <b>16</b> may be forced to collapse and fluid may be forced out of the reservoir <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The manifold <b>14</b> may include various valves to facilitate extraction of fluid from the reservoirs <b>16</b> in a controlled manner. For example, a valve may be positioned downstream of a reservoir dock on a manifold <b>14</b>. As pressure is exerted on the fluid in a reservoir <b>16</b> on that dock or port, the valve may be opened and closed to allow a desired amount of fluid to escape from the reservoir <b>16</b>. Each time the valve is opened and closed the volume of fluid which escapes from the reservoir <b>16</b> may be measured. The valve may be cycled open and closed until the proper amount of fluid has left the reservoir <b>16</b></p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Fluid from the reservoir <b>16</b> may be routed through the various fluid passageways of the manifold <b>14</b> and into a mixing chamber <b>18</b>. Additionally, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be selectively put into communication with a diluent source <b>20</b>. In the mixing chamber <b>18</b>, diluent from the diluent source <b>20</b> may be added to the fluid from the reservoirs <b>16</b> to dilute the reservoir <b>16</b> fluids to a lower concentration. In some embodiments, multiple diluent sources <b>20</b> may be included. This may be desirable since different medications may need to be diluted with different diluents. In some embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be actively agitated or otherwise controlled in a manner that would facilitate mixing of fluid in the mixing chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">A valve <b>22</b> may be actuated to allow fluid to flow from the mixing chamber <b>18</b> to a fluid line <b>23</b> and into a destination reservoir <b>24</b>. The destination reservoir <b>24</b> may be any type of suitable reservoir for a compounded medication or mixture. In the example embodiment, the destination reservoir <b>24</b> is shown as an IV bag. Other types of medication reservoirs may also be used as the destination reservoir <b>24</b>. For example, a medication vial, syringe, bladder, cassette, or any other drug containing volume or vessel may be used as a destination reservoir <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, a patient may be the reservoir <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In embodiments where the compounder <b>10</b> is not a pharmaceutical compounder, the destination reservoir <b>24</b> may differ. For example, if the compounder <b>10</b> is for use in the mixing of beverages, the destination reservoir <b>24</b> may be a cup, glass, bottle, can, mug, thermos, or the like. In embodiments where the compounder <b>10</b> is for use in the mixing of paints, the destination reservoir <b>24</b> may be a paint can or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> depicts another example embodiment of a compounder <b>10</b>. The compounder <b>10</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> includes a gantry <b>30</b>. The gantry <b>30</b> may be used move reservoirs <b>16</b> onto and off of a manifold <b>14</b>. In other embodiments, any other means of moving reservoirs <b>16</b> onto and off of the manifold <b>14</b> may be used. For example, a mechanized armature or the like may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The gantry <b>30</b> may be controlled by a controller <b>31</b> The controller <b>31</b> may command movement of a crane <b>32</b> of the gantry <b>30</b> using, for example, an x,y coordinate system. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a reservoir <b>16</b> is held by the crane of the gantry <b>30</b>. The crane <b>32</b> of the gantry <b>30</b> has been maneuvered over an open port of the manifold <b>14</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. This may be accomplished by the controller <b>31</b> commanding the crane <b>32</b> of the gantry <b>30</b> to move to the specific coordinate of the open port on the manifold <b>14</b>. The controller <b>31</b> may then lower crane <b>32</b> to place the reservoir <b>16</b> on the manifold <b>14</b>. The manifold <b>14</b> may include a retaining feature or the like to ensure that the reservoir <b>16</b> is securely held on the manifold <b>14</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the interface between the reservoir <b>16</b> and the manifold <b>14</b> may be made to be fluid tight in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In some embodiments, the controller <b>31</b> may cause a unique identifier <b>34</b> on a reservoir <b>16</b> to be read before moving the reservoir <b>16</b> to an open port on a manifold <b>14</b>. The unique identifier <b>34</b> may be any variety of unique identifier <b>34</b> and may identify the contents of the reservoir <b>16</b>. The unique identifier <b>34</b> may be a barcode, RFID, magnetic strip, other smart identification, etc. There may, for example, be a unique identifier <b>34</b> for each drug (and each form and concentration of each drug if it comes in multiple forms/concentrations) which may be used in the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Based on the unique identifier <b>34</b>, the controller <b>31</b> may identify a number of compatible ports on the manifold (s) <b>14</b>. The controller <b>31</b> may then command the gantry <b>30</b> to move to a selected port of the compatible ports. For a compounder <b>10</b> used in the compounding of pharmaceuticals, compatible ports may, for example, be ports on manifolds <b>14</b> which do not include a contraindicated drug or ports on manifolds <b>14</b> made from compatible materials. In some embodiments, instead of identifying a number of compatible ports for a unique identifier <b>34</b>, each unique identifier <b>34</b> may have an assigned manifold <b>14</b> port. Ports may be chosen for each unique identifier <b>34</b> in a manner which maximizes throughput, efficiency, and/or safety of the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In some embodiments, a user may instead or additionally manually identify the contents of the reservoir <b>16</b> on a user interface of the compounder <b>10</b>. In embodiments where this is done in addition to the reading of a unique identifier <b>34</b> on the reservoir <b>16</b>, the compounder <b>10</b> may generate an error if the contents of the reservoir <b>16</b> manually input by a user do not match the contents of the reservoir <b>16</b> as indicated by the unique identifier <b>34</b>. Additionally, a user may identify which manifold <b>14</b> port they would like the reservoir <b>16</b> to be docked to in some embodiments. In such embodiments, if the port selected is incompatible (e.g. is on a manifold <b>14</b> with a contraindicated medication) with the contents of the reservoir <b>16</b> the compounder <b>10</b> may generate an error and not allow docking.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">To remove a spent reservoir <b>16</b> from the manifold <b>14</b>, the controller <b>31</b> may move the crane <b>32</b> of the gantry <b>30</b> to the location of the port of the manifold <b>14</b> where the spent reservoir <b>16</b> is docked. The crane <b>32</b> may then be lowered to the reservoir <b>16</b>, pick up the reservoir <b>16</b> and remove the reservoir <b>16</b> from the manifold <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the manifold <b>14</b> may include a retaining feature which ensures that the reservoir <b>16</b> is securely retained on the manifold <b>14</b>. In such embodiments, the crane <b>32</b> may include an unlocking feature which must engage with a portion of the manifold <b>14</b> for the reservoir <b>16</b> to be released from the retaining feature. When the crane <b>32</b> is lowered to the desired port on the manifold <b>14</b> correctly, the unlocking feature may operatively engage a portion of the manifold <b>14</b> such that the retaining feature may release the reservoir <b>16</b>. Likewise, in some embodiments, a reservoir <b>16</b> may not be placed on the manifold <b>14</b> without the unlocking feature of the crane <b>32</b> engaging the appropriate portion of the manifold <b>14</b>. In such embodiments, the retaining feature may also act as a receiving feature which precludes docking of a reservoir <b>16</b> on the manifold <b>14</b> unless the unlocking feature is properly engaged with the manifold <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In some embodiments, when a spent reservoir <b>16</b> is removed from a manifold <b>14</b> port, a controller <b>31</b> may command the gantry <b>30</b> to move to the coordinates of a bin or container (not shown) within the compounder <b>10</b>. Such a bin or container may be used to store spent reservoirs <b>16</b>. The bin or container may be removable once full. In some embodiments, the bin or container may seal once removed from the compounder <b>10</b>. Once removed the bin or container may be replaced with a new bin or container.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In some embodiments, after removing a spent reservoir <b>16</b> the controller <b>31</b> may command the gantry <b>30</b> to retrieve a cover member for the manifold <b>14</b> port. The crane <b>32</b> may then place the cover member over the manifold <b>14</b> port. Alternatively, the controller <b>31</b> may command the gantry <b>30</b> to retrieve a cleaning or sterilizing cartridge which may then be placed over the port and used for cleaning or sterilization of the port.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Instead of moving randomly about a manifold <b>14</b> or number of manifolds <b>14</b>, it may be desirable that the gantry <b>30</b> be controlled to work on manifold <b>14</b> ports which are in close spatial proximity to one another when possible. This may help to increase efficiency and throughput of the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> depicts another example embodiment of a compounder <b>10</b>. As shown, the compounder <b>10</b> includes a number of manifolds <b>14</b>. As previously mentioned, other embodiments may include a greater or lesser number of manifolds <b>14</b>. As shown, all of the manifolds <b>14</b> are arranged in parallel. This arrangement may help to increase throughput of the compounder <b>10</b> since more than one manifold <b>14</b> may deliver fluid to a mixing chamber <b>18</b> simultaneously. This may further be advantageous for a variety of other reasons. For instance, such an arrangement would allow reservoirs <b>16</b> containing contraindicated drugs to be placed on separate manifolds <b>14</b>. It would allow for some reservoirs <b>16</b> to be contained in a different controlled environment (e.g. different temperature zones) within the compounder <b>10</b> housing <b>12</b>. Additionally, it may allow for manifolds <b>14</b> to be made of a variety of materials. Thus, reservoirs <b>16</b> may be placed on manifolds <b>14</b> made from compatible materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As shown, all of the manifolds <b>14</b> are plumbed into the same mixing chamber <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, each manifold <b>14</b> may be associated with its own mixing chamber <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, each of the reservoirs <b>16</b> is enclosed within a reservoir receptacle or cartridge <b>50</b>. It may be desirable to enclose a reservoir <b>16</b> within a cartridge <b>50</b> if the reservoir <b>16</b> contains hazardous contents. In applications where the compounder <b>10</b> is for use in the compounding of pharmaceuticals, it may be desirable to have various drugs enclosed in a cartridge <b>50</b>. For example, some drugs, such as those used in chemotherapy applications, may give off dangerous vapors or may be harmful if they contact a handler. The cartridge <b>50</b> may be used to seal the drug containing reservoir <b>16</b> such that vapors and/or fluids may not exit the cartridge <b>50</b> and pose a hazard to users of the compounder <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the cartridge <b>50</b> itself may seal the reservoir <b>16</b> from the surrounding environment. In some embodiments, the cartridge <b>50</b> may contain a closure which may facilitate sealing. The cartridge <b>50</b> may then interface with the manifold <b>14</b> such that the cartridge <b>50</b> may be docked on the manifold <b>14</b></p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In other embodiments, the cartridge <b>50</b> may cooperate with one or more additional component to create a seal. Some embodiments may use a cartridge <b>50</b> similar to the vial receptacle, shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,158,102, issued Apr. 17, 2012 and entitled SYSTEM, DEVICE, AND METHOD FOR MIXING A SUBSTANCE WITH A LIQUID, (Attorney Docket No. D70), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In such embodiments, the cartridge <b>50</b> may be spiked with a spike receptacle in a vial spike assembly also as shown and described in just referenced U.S. Pat. No. 8,158,102.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">For some applications, the reservoirs <b>16</b> need not be enclosed and sealed using a cartridge <b>50</b>. For example, it may not be necessary for drugs used by a compounder <b>10</b> which pose less of a handling hazard to be sealed. In such instances, bare reservoirs <b>16</b> may be docked on the manifold <b>14</b>. These reservoirs <b>16</b> may come in a number of different styles, types, sizes or dimensions. In some embodiments, adapter members may also be included for each reservoir <b>16</b> variety. The adapter members may fit around and/or over a portion of the reservoirs <b>16</b>. The adapter members may also have a standardized connecting feature or fitting. The connecting feature may allow the ports of the manifolds <b>14</b> to be standardized to a single size, geometry, etc. Thus, a reservoir <b>16</b> with the proper adapter attached may be placed on any suitable manifold <b>14</b> port regardless of the dimensions, type, style, etc. of the reservoir <b>16</b>. Alternatively, manifolds <b>14</b> may include dedicated ports for each variety of reservoir <b>16</b> or the compounder <b>10</b> may include designated manifolds <b>14</b> for each variety of reservoir <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, the manifolds <b>14</b> may interface with specifically designed reservoirs <b>16</b>. This may ensure that only reservoirs <b>16</b> made for use in the compounder <b>10</b> are able to be used with the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In addition to reservoirs <b>16</b> coming in a number of different styles, types, sizes or dimensions, the stoppers (not shown) used in these reservoirs <b>16</b> may also vary. The stoppers may affect the distance that a spike for the reservoir <b>16</b> may penetrate into the interior volume of that reservoir <b>16</b>. Since, for example, it would be desirable that an outlet spike for a reservoir <b>16</b> be located toward the bottom of the reservoir volume <b>16</b>, in some embodiments, adapter members may similarly be included for each stopper variety. Such adapters may function similarly to those described above, however, may also ensure that the reservoir <b>16</b> is located at a distance from the manifold <b>14</b> which ensures the spike is at a suitable location within the reservoir volume when the reservoir <b>16</b> is docked to a manifold <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">It may be desirable that the reservoir-manifold interface or manifold <b>14</b> port be made aspetic or sterilizable for certain compounder <b>10</b> applications. In the compounding of pharmaceuticals, this may be particularly desirable. In some embodiments, the compounder <b>10</b> may include one or more cleaning cartridge <b>52</b>. In the embodiment depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a cleaning cartridge <b>52</b> is docked to the farthest right port of the foremost manifold <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, a steam line (not shown) may be plumbed into communication with a cleaning cartridge <b>52</b>. The cleaning cartridge <b>52</b> may be placed over the desired manifold <b>14</b> port and steam may be allowed to fill the cleaning cartridge <b>52</b>. This steam may sterilize the manifold <b>14</b> port. During cleaning with the cleaning cartridge <b>52</b>, any valves for fluid pathways leading to or from a selected manifold <b>14</b> port may be closed.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Alternatively, the compounder <b>10</b> may be configured to move an entire manifold <b>14</b> to a sterilizing chamber in the housing <b>12</b> of the compounder <b>10</b>. This may, for example, be accomplished with a gantry such as the gantry <b>30</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, the sterilizing chamber may be a steam chamber. Such a sterilizing scheme may, however, slow throughput of the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In some embodiments, materials used by a compounder <b>10</b> may not come in a liquid form. For example, some drugs may come in a powdered or lyophilized form. Such drugs may need to be reconstituted before compounding or administration to a patient. In some embodiments, such materials may be reconstituted by a user before being provided to a compounder <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, a compounder <b>10</b> may be configured to reconstitute the material. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> depicts a representation diagram of a compounder <b>10</b> which is configured to reconstitute a drug which is in a powdered form.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">As shown, the compounder <b>10</b> includes a manifold <b>14</b>. A number of reservoirs <b>16</b> are docked on the manifold <b>14</b>. The manifold <b>14</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is also in communication with a reconstituting component <b>70</b>. Some embodiments may include additional reconstitution components <b>70</b>. As shown, a reservoir <b>16</b> is docked on the reconstituting component <b>70</b>. The reservoir <b>16</b> on the reconstituting component <b>70</b> may include a powdered drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">As shown, the reconstituting component <b>70</b> may also be placed into communication with a diluent source <b>20</b>. As shown, diluent may be pumped from the diluent source <b>20</b> using a diluent pump <b>72</b>. In other embodiments, fluid may flow from the diluent source <b>20</b> by means of a gravity feed. In other embodiments, fluid may be compelled to leave the diluent source <b>20</b> by any number of other suitable means. Such suitable means may include, but are not limited to, creating a positive pressure in the diluent source <b>20</b> container, creating a vacuum downstream of the diluent source <b>20</b>, squeezing or collapsing the diluent source <b>20</b> container, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In the example embodiment, when a diluent valve <b>74</b> is appropriately actuated, the diluent may flow to the reconstitution component <b>70</b>. As shown, check valves <b>78</b> are included to ensure that no diluted medication may enter the diluent lines. The reconstitution component <b>70</b> may reconstitute the drug. In some embodiments, this may be accomplished by pumping diluent into the reservoir <b>16</b>. The reservoir <b>16</b> or diluent in the reservoir <b>16</b> may be actively agitated to encourage the powdered drug to go into solution quickly. In some embodiments, the diluent may be pumped back and forth between the reservoir <b>16</b> and a reconstitution chamber <b>76</b> in the reconstitution component <b>70</b> in order to fully reconstitute the drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In some embodiments, the reconstituted solution may be agitated for an empirically derived predetermined period of time for each drug. The period of time may be a tested period of time sufficient for the powdered drug within the reservoir <b>16</b> to go into solution plus an additional margin. In some embodiments, the reconstitution component <b>70</b> may include one or more sensor (not shown). For example, the reconstitution component <b>70</b> may include a conductivity probe which may be used to detect whether or not the drug has fully gone into solution. In some embodiments, the reconstitution component <b>70</b> may include an optical sensor which monitors for particulates which would indicate that the drug has yet to fully go into solution. In some embodiments, the reconstitution component <b>70</b> may include one or more sensor to monitor the volume of diluent used to reconstitute the drug. The reconstitution component <b>70</b> may also include one or more sensor which may measure the volume of the reconstituted drug. Such an arrangement would allow a controller to compare the volume of diluent to the reconstituted drug volume to determine the drug concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In some embodiments the reconstituting component may include a reconstituting cassette similar to as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,210,361, issued Apr. 3, 2001 and entitled SYSTEM FOR DELIVERING INTRAVENOUS DRUGS (Attorney Docket No. B81), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such a cassette may also be used in place of the manifolds <b>14</b> described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Once the drug has been reconstituted, it may be allowed to flow to a fluid path of a manifold <b>14</b> and on to a mixing chamber <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, the drug may flow from the reconstitution component <b>70</b> to the mixing chamber <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, other non-liquid materials may be reconstituted and mixed by a compounder <b>10</b>. For example, in embodiments where the compounder <b>10</b> is not used in a pharmaceutical application, the compounder <b>10</b> may reconstitute powdered drink mix.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> depicts a representational diagram of a compounder <b>10</b> in which various flow paths of a manifold <b>14</b> are depicted. As shown, each reservoir <b>16</b> docked on the manifold <b>14</b> has been spiked such that it may be placed in communication with the various fluid pathways of the manifold <b>14</b>. In the example embodiment, each reservoir <b>16</b> is spiked with an inlet <b>92</b> and an outlet <b>94</b>. The inlet <b>92</b> and outlet <b>94</b> may be two separate needles or a double lumen needle in some embodiments. In other embodiments only a single needle may be used. In still other embodiments, more than two needles may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As shown, the manifold <b>14</b> is in communication with a clean air reservoir <b>90</b>. The clean air reservoir <b>90</b> in the example embodiment is a pressurized tank of clean, medical grade air. In other embodiments, the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> may differ. For example, in some embodiments, the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> may be part of a clean air system included in the compounder <b>10</b>. In such embodiments, the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> may be an accumulator for a compressor pump (not shown). The pump may pump in ambient air. This air may pass through appropriate filters, dryers, etc. to ensure it is suitable for use in the compounder <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Clean air from the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> may selectively be routed into desired reservoirs <b>16</b> on the manifold <b>14</b>. To facilitate this, the manifold <b>14</b> may include a number of valves <b>96</b>. The valves <b>96</b> may open and close the fluid path between the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> and inlet <b>92</b> for each reservoir <b>16</b>. When the fluid pathway is open, clean air may flow into the reservoir <b>16</b> from the pressurized clean air reservoir <b>90</b>. This may create a positive pressure in the reservoir <b>16</b> and force fluid out of the reservoir <b>16</b> through the outlet <b>94</b>. In some embodiments, the volume of air which may flow into a reservoir <b>16</b> may be controlled so as to displace a desired amount of fluid from the reservoir <b>16</b>. This may, for example, be accomplished by cycling the valves <b>96</b> associated with each reservoir <b>16</b> to achieve a desired flow rate. It may be desirable that the inlet <b>92</b> is configured to be positioned near the top of the interior volume of the reservoir <b>16</b> when the reservoir <b>16</b> is spiked. This may help to minimize concern for creation of air bubbles when forcing fluid out of the reservoir <b>16</b>. It may also be desirable that the outlet <b>94</b> be near the bottom of the reservoir <b>16</b>. This may help to ensure that all of the fluid within the reservoir <b>16</b> may be used by the compounder <b>10</b>. As mentioned above, not all embodiments may create a positive pressure in a reservoir <b>16</b> to draw fluid out of the reservoir <b>16</b>. The compounder <b>10</b> may be configured to use any other suitable means of drawing fluid from a reservoir <b>16</b> such as those mentioned above.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The valves <b>96</b> may be any suitable variety of valve. In some embodiments, the valves <b>96</b> may be solenoid type valves.

      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Once fluid travels from the reservoir <b>16</b> through the outlet <b>94</b>, it may pass through a check valve <b>98</b>. The fluid may then flow to a mixing chamber <b>18</b>. As shown, each outlet includes a check valve <b>98</b>. This may ensure that fluid from one reservoir <b>16</b> may not enter another reservoir <b>98</b> through that reservoir's <b>16</b> outlet <b>94</b>. Additionally, it may ensure that during flushing of the manifold <b>14</b>, fluid may not enter any of the reservoirs <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the manifold <b>14</b> is configured such that clean air from the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> may be used to flush the manifold <b>14</b>. To flush the manifold <b>14</b>, a flush valve <b>100</b> may be opened. Opening the flush valve <b>100</b> may place the fluid pathways for fluid leaving the reservoirs <b>16</b> into communication with clean air reservoir <b>90</b>. Pressurized air may then flow through these fluid pathways flushing out remaining fluid. As shown in the example embodiment, a check valve <b>98</b> is also included downstream from the flush valve <b>100</b> to preclude fluid from the reservoirs <b>16</b> from flowing back to the clean air reservoir <b>90</b> or other undesired fluid pathways of the manifold <b>14</b>.

      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">As mentioned above, fluid from the reservoirs <b>16</b> may travel from the manifold <b>14</b> to a mixing chamber <b>18</b>. A mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be used to mix fluid from one or multiple reservoirs <b>16</b> with diluent from a diluent source <b>20</b>. In various embodiments, the size of the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may differ. In some embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be sized such that it may be filled and dispensed a plurality of times to fill a destination reservoir <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be sized such that it need only be filled and dispensed a single time to fill a destination reservoir <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be a reusable component of the compounder <b>10</b>. That is, the same mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be used repeatedly as multiple pharmaceutical compounds are compounded by the compounder <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, the mixing chamber <b>18</b> may be a limited (e.g. one time) use disposable which may be replaced after each pharmaceutical compound is compounded by the compounder <b>10</b>.

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> depicts a representational embodiment of a compounder <b>10</b> in which a labeler <b>120</b> and destination reservoir connection port <b>122</b> are shown. As shown, the reservoir connection port <b>122</b> may serve as the interface between the compounder <b>10</b> and a destination reservoir <b>24</b>. A destination reservoir <b>24</b> may couple to a reservoir connection port <b>122</b> such that the compounder <b>10</b> is placed in fluid communication with the destination reservoir <b>24</b>. The reservoir connection port <b>122</b> may be a part of the compounder <b>10</b> and may be reused each time a destination reservoir <b>24</b> is attached. As shown, there are two destination reservoirs <b>24</b> attached to the connection port <b>122</b> by means of a y-site connector <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the y-site connector <b>124</b> may be included as part of the connection port <b>122</b>. In other embodiments, suitable connectors may be included to allow additional destination reservoirs <b>24</b> to be connected.

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Connecting multiple destination reservoirs <b>24</b> may be desirable if the compounder <b>10</b> is commanded to produce a large volume of the same pharmaceutical compound because it may help to increase throughput. This may be so because the compounder <b>10</b> would not need to stop to allow a user to time to disconnect a destination reservoir <b>24</b>, clean the connector port <b>122</b>, and connect another destination reservoir <b>24</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the connection port <b>122</b> may be a standard fitting which may connected to any of a variety of destination reservoirs <b>24</b>.

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> depicts a representational example embodiment of a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> and a compounder dock <b>302</b>. As shown, the drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> is not in place on the compounder dock <b>302</b>. As mentioned, the drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> may be used to ensure that any hazardous vapors or substances are contained and prevented from entering the ambient environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">A drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> may generally include one or more enclosing structures or housing sections and an adapter which allows the enclosing structures to receive a plurality of reservoirs (e.g. vials, bags, etc.).

The containment assembly <b>300</b> may include one or more windows which allow a user to view the contents of the containment assembly <b>300</b>. The containment assembly <b>300</b>, in some embodiments, may be clear, translucent, or transparent to allow a user to view the contents of the containment assembly, or to generally view the interior of the containment assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">The adapter may be a separate component or alternatively may be an integral part of an enclosing structure. Suitable sealing members (gaskets, o-rings, etc.) may be included to ensure that the drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> is sealed from the environment when assembled. At least one enclosing structure may include one or more septum which may be pierced by a spike of a compounder. The one or more septum may be disposed in a channel which extends from a proximal end of an enclosing structure to a distal end of the enclosing structure and may form a barrier between the proximal and distal end of the channel. The septum may be made of a self healing material and allow for a seal to be maintained when a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> has been spiked during use. Additionally, a portion of a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> may act as a sealed receiving volume for any hazardous substances or vapors which may escape a drug reservoir. In such embodiments, the receiving volume may be negatively pressurized and may be rigid or expandable. In various embodiments, at least a portion of the enclosing structure or housing section having the receiving volume may be of variable volume.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">As shown in the specific example in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> is a vial containing assembly.

In the example embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the interface portion <b>308</b> includes a first septum <b>316</b> and a second septum <b>318</b>. Other embodiments may include a greater or lesser number of septa. These septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be made an elastomer, rubber, a flexible polymer, resilient material, or any elastomeric or self healing material which is capable of being pierced by a needle <b>322</b> and maintaining a seal and wiping the needle when the needle <b>322</b> is withdrawn.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The example receiving assembly <b>304</b> also includes an adapter <b>310</b> as mentioned above. The adapter <b>310</b> may fit around a portion of a vial <b>306</b> allowing the vial <b>306</b> to coupled into a standard interface portion <b>308</b>. In the example embodiment, the adapter <b>310</b> is shown around the neck of the vial <b>306</b>. In other embodiments, the adapter <b>310</b> may fit around another portion of the vial <b>306</b> or may be included as part of the interface portion <b>308</b>. Different adapters <b>310</b> may be used depending on the vial type <b>306</b>. Alternatively, the adapter <b>310</b> may be standard and include a variable aperture or cinching mechanism which allows the adapter <b>310</b> to adapt itself to a range of different vial <b>306</b> types.

In some embodiment, the adapter <b>310</b> may be include two pieces which may be coupled together around a suitable portion of a vial (e.g. the neck). In such embodiments, the pieces may snap, or friction fit together, be bonded (adhesive, solvent, etc.) together, magnetically couple, or couple in any other manner which would be known to one skilled in the relevant art. The adapter <b>310</b> may include a hole or gap to vent gases emanating from the spike region to the variable volume of the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> (e.g., see the pass-through <b>336</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">The variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> of the receiving assembly <b>304</b> may fit around the portion of the vial <b>306</b> or medication reservoir not housed by the interface portion <b>308</b> or adapter <b>310</b>. Thus the vial <b>306</b> may be completely enclosed and sealed from the surrounding environment. In the example embodiment, the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> houses the vial body. A variable volume housing <b>312</b> may be made of an elastomeric or stretchable material or may include at least one flexible or expandable segment or feature (e.g. pleats of a bellows). Additionally, it may be desirable that the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> be made of a durable and substantially impermeable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">The variable volume housing <b>312</b> may function as a protective sleeve or jacket for the medication vial receiving assembly <b>304</b> and in concert with the septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> prevent any leakage of potentially hazardous fluid into the environment. If pressure or vapors escape from the vial <b>306</b>, the escaping fluid may be captured and retained within the variable volume housing <b>312</b>. This may increase the volume of the variable volume housing <b>312</b>. The material of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> may allow the variable volume housing <b>312</b> to expand or inflate to accommodate the escaping fluid if necessary. In this manner, a variable volume housing <b>312</b> may allow for any fluid escaping from a medication vial <b>306</b> to be contained and sealed within the vial receiving assembly <b>304</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">The interior volume of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> may be at ambient pressure when a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b> is docked on a compounder dock <b>302</b>. Alternatively, a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>700</b> may include a port which allows the interior volume of the variable volume housing to be lowered below ambient pressure or emptied of fluid after a vial <b>306</b> is installed. This may minimize any stretching of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> material in the event that any fluid escapes the vial <b>306</b>.</p>

Similar to the septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> described in relation to the drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b>, the septum <b>320</b> (or septa) of a compounder dock <b>302</b> may be made of an elastomeric or self healing material. A spike <b>322</b> may also be included in a compounder dock <b>302</b>. The spike may pierce through the septum or septa of the dock <b>302</b> and containment assembly <b>300</b> into the drug reservoir such that fluid may be drawn out of or introduced into the reservoir.

For example, as the containment assembly <b>300</b> is removed from the compounder dock <b>302</b>, the spike <b>322</b> will be pulled through the septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>. Thus the septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> serve to wipe the spike <b>322</b> when the spike <b>322</b> is withdrawn. Any fluid wiped from the spike <b>322</b> will be kept on the interior side of the septa <b>316</b>, <b>318</b>, facilitating containment. The compounder dock <b>302</b> septum <b>320</b> may act as a cover for the spike <b>322</b> keeping the spike <b>322</b> from being exposed. This may aid in the prevention of contamination and may facilitate cleaning as only the top face of the septum <b>320</b> may need to be cleaned between uses.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> depicts a specific example embodiment of a vial receiving assembly <b>304</b>. As shown, only the interface portion <b>308</b>, septum <b>316</b>, and the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> are visible in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. In the example embodiment, the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> includes a bellows <b>330</b> which may be in a collapsed state when a vial is installed in the assembly <b>304</b>. The bellows <b>330</b> may expand to accommodate fluid in the event that there is any fluid (e.g., a gas) escaping an installed vial. In other embodiments, the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> may not include a bellows <b>330</b>. Some embodiments may instead use a flaccid bag-like reservoir instead, for example. In such embodiments, the flaccid reservoir may become more turgid in the event any fluid (e.g., gas) escapes a vial. Also shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a bayonet mount <b>319</b> which is included as part of the interface portion <b>308</b> of the containment assembly <b>304</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> depicts a cross sectional view taken at the mid plane of the vial receiving assembly <b>304</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, a vial <b>306</b> is installed in the vial receiving assembly <b>304</b>. An adapter <b>310</b> is in place around the neck of the vial <b>306</b>. The outer edge of the adapter may be threaded and the interface portion <b>308</b> of the vial receiving assembly <b>304</b> may thread onto the adapter <b>310</b>. Once fully threaded onto the adapter <b>310</b> a gasket <b>332</b> may become compressed between a face of the interface portion <b>308</b> and an opposing face of the adapter <b>310</b> to create an airtight seal in some embodiments. Other options exist for mating, including but not limited to, a snap fit, sandwich between <b>308</b> and <b>312</b>, etc. In some specific embodiments, there is no gasket <b>332</b> or there is the gasket with a pass-through <b>336</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Similarly, the variable volume housing portion <b>312</b> may thread onto a section of the interface portion <b>308</b>. This threaded engagement may also cause a gasket <b>334</b> to become compressed between a face of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> and the interface portion <b>308</b> creating an airtight seal. The first septum <b>316</b> and second septum <b>318</b> serve to complete the seal between the interior volume of the vial receiving assembly <b>304</b> and the ambient environment.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">As shown the adapter <b>310</b> may include a pass-through <b>336</b> which places the interior volumes of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> and interface portion <b>308</b> into fluid communication. If any fluid escapes the vial <b>306</b>, the fluid may pass through the pass-through <b>336</b> and into the variable volume housing <b>312</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">Using an embodiment in which fluid may pass through the adapter <b>310</b> allow for simplified manufacture of the adapter <b>310</b>. The adapter <b>310</b> may, for example, be made of two pieces of injection mold material which may be snapped, press fit, or otherwise joined together around the neck of the vial <b>306</b>. In some embodiments the adapter <b>310</b> may be airtight or non-airtight.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Though the example embodiment shows the adapter <b>310</b> mating with the interface portion <b>308</b> and the variable volume housing <b>312</b> mating with the interface portion <b>308</b>, this is not limiting and illustrative. It would be appreciated by one skilled in the art that these sections may mate in any combination so long as the appropriate seals are created and the interior volume of the containment assembly <b>300</b> is isolated from the ambient environment. For example, both the interface portion <b>308</b> and the variable volume housing <b>312</b> may mate with the adapter <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, the adapter <b>310</b> may be an integral part of either the interface portion <b>308</b> of the variable volume housing <b>312</b>. It should also be appreciated that other types of interfaces besides threaded interfaces may be used.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> and <figref>FIG. 12</figref> depict alternate embodiments of a drug reservoir containment assembly <b>300</b>. The containment assembly <b>300</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. The variable volume housing <b>312</b> includes a bellows <b>330</b> which allows the volume of the variable volume housing <b>312</b> to increase in the event that fluid escapes the contained drug reservoir. The variable volume housing <b>312</b> in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> also includes a window portion <b>350</b> in the example embodiment. This window <b>350</b> may be transparent and allow a user to view a contained drug reservoir. In the example embodiment, the window <b>350</b> is disposed in a position which would allow a user to read the label on a medication vial and view the contents of the vial.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, the variable volume housing <b>312</b> of the containment assembly <b>300</b> is a flaccid elastomeric jacket of bag <b>352</b>. The elastomeric jacket or bag <b>352</b> may be made of a transparent material and obviate the need for a window <b>350</b> similar to that shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. In the event that fluid escapes from a contained medication reservoir, the turgidity of the elastomeric jacket or bag <b>352</b> may increase as the fluid is accommodated.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 13-15</figref> depict various views of a specific example embodiment of an adapter <b>310</b> which may be placed around the neck of a medication vial as a collar. As shown, the adapter <b>310</b> may include a first portion <b>360</b> and a second portion <b>362</b> which may be joined together to surround the neck of a vial. When joined together, an inner void <b>364</b> which accommodates the neck of a vial may be formed as shown best in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>. There may be a number of different adapters <b>310</b> each having an inner void <b>364</b> of different dimensions in order to accommodate different vials. In such embodiments, it may be desirable that the adapters <b>310</b> for different vials may be identical with the exception of the dimensions of the inner void <b>364</b>. This allows for other components of a containment assembly <b>300</b> to be standardized.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">In the example embodiment, the first portion <b>360</b> and the second portion <b>362</b> are identical pieces. It may be desirable that the first portion <b>360</b> and second portion <b>362</b> of an adapter <b>310</b> be identical pieces as it may simplify manufacturing and installation of the adapter <b>310</b>. Each portion may include a pass through <b>336</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. Each portion may include a mating projection <b>366</b> and a receiving structure <b>368</b> for a mating projection <b>366</b>. In the example embodiment, the mating projection <b>366</b> and the receiving structure <b>368</b> snap fit together.

        <figref>FIG. 17</figref> depicts a flowchart detailing a number of example steps which may be used in creating a desired pharmaceutical compound with a compounder. At block <b>702</b>, a doctor places an order. The doctor may place the order with a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. At block <b>704</b>, a pharmacist may check the order and confirm that the order is correct or that there is an issue with the order. The pharmacy system may also interface with a CPOE system. If the pharmacy order check passes, the order may be sent to the compounder at block <b>706</b>. At block <b>706</b>, the order may be sent from a CPOE system to the compounder. If the pharmacy order check fails, the issue may be resolved per institution policy at block <b>722</b>. The compounder may check the order for incompatibilities at block <b>708</b>. The compounder may have a drug library file stored in its memory and the compounder may refer to the drug library file to check for drug names, characteristics, contraindications, other incompatibilities, etc. If the compounder order check fails, the user may be notified at block <b>712</b>. If the user is notified of a failed compounder order check at block <b>712</b>, the issue may be resolved per institution policy at block <b>722</b>. If the compounder order check passes, the compounder may compound the order at block <b>710</b>. After the compounder compounds the order, the compounder may indicate that the order has been completed at block <b>714</b>. At block <b>714</b>, the compounder may indicate to other hospital or institutional systems (e.g. CPOE system) that the order has been completed. At block <b>716</b>, the compounder may print a label for the compounded medication. In some embodiments, the compounder may distribute the compounded order into multiple reservoirs. In such embodiments, the compounder may print multiple labels for the compounded medication. If a label is printed, the compounded medication may be labeled at block <b>718</b>. At block <b>720</b>, the log data for the compounder may be saved and/or communicated to other pharmacy or institution systems such as a continuous quality improvement (CQI) system, which may be used for analysis of compounder usage and quality improvement. In some embodiments, a CQI system may interface with the compounder to generate materials for regularly scheduled reviews. The compounded medication may be transported to the patient floor for administration at block <b>724</b>. In some embodiments, some orders may be stockpiled if the orders lend themselves to such stockpiling (e.g. the orders would not expire in a short time period).</p>

        <figref>FIG. 18</figref> depicts a flowchart detailing a number of example steps which may be used by a compounder when placing a reservoir on a manifold. At block <b>802</b>, the compounder may receive a command to dock a reservoir on a manifold. At block <b>804</b>, the compounder may identify a list of open manifold ports. At block <b>806</b>, the compounder may check the list of open manifold ports and may create a second list of available manifold ports on manifolds which do not have a related contraindicated drug docked. The compounder may have a drug library file stored in its memory and the compounder may refer to the drug library file to check for contraindications at block <b>806</b>. At block <b>808</b>, the compounder may check the second list and may create a third list of ports on manifolds that are made from compatible materials. The compounder may refer to the drug library file to check for compatible materials at block <b>808</b>. At block <b>810</b>, the compounder may select a port which will best optimize throughput. For example, the compounder may select a more efficiently located port, such as a port located in close proximity to the current position of a gantry or the like. As another example, the compounder may place commonly combined medications on separate manifolds permitting simultaneous delivery from both manifolds when the medications are being combined. This may be useful to increase throughput of the device. At block <b>812</b>, the compounder may dock the reservoir to the selected port with the gantry or the like.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 19</figref> depicts a flowchart detailing a number of example steps which may be used by a compounder to manage a medication order queue when a new order is received. At block <b>902</b>, the compounder receives a new order. The order may be received by the compounder from a CPOE system. At block <b>904</b>, the compounder may check to see when the compounded order is required. At block <b>906</b>, the compounder may queue the order such that it is scheduled to be completed by required time. At block <b>908</b>, the compounder may check the shelf life of the order once the order is compounded. If the compounded order does not have a long shelf life, the compounder may keep the queue order at block <b>910</b>. If the compounded order does have a long shelf life but is needed before the soonest off peak time, the compounder may keep the queue order at block <b>910</b>. An off peak time may be, for example at night (e.g. 1:00 a.m.), when compounding demand is lower. If the compounded order has a long shelf life and is not needed before soonest off peak time, the compounder may change the queue order at block <b>912</b> such that the order is scheduled to be compounded at an off peak time.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">In various embodiments, a compounder may take other information into consideration when determining a queue location for a new order. In some embodiments, when the compounder is determine where to place a new order in an existing queue, the compounder may search the queue for identical orders or orders for which the same drug cocktail is being compounded. The compounder may then combine these orders and instruct the user to set up multiple destination reservoirs (one or more for each order of the combined orders) when the queue location is reached. In some embodiments, the compounder may queue the order in a manner which would help maximize efficiency of the compounder. For example, the compounder may queue orders such that orders using similar drugs are grouped together to allow the compounder to have a higher throughput. This may be so because it will minimize the number of times manifolds may need to be flushed. By means of example, if five orders all use a particular drug and no other drug on that manifold is needed to produce the order, that compounder may not need to flushed during compounding of those five orders.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 20</figref> depicts a flowchart detailing a number of example steps which may be used by a compounder which is included in an integrated system to schedule compounding of drugs. The flowchart depicted in <figref>FIG. 204</figref> assumes that the steps described above in <figref>FIG. 17</figref> have been completed and there is compounded medicine available to start the therapy. At block <b>1002</b>, a therapy is programmed. At block <b>1004</b>, the therapy is started. If the therapy was not altered (e.g. titrated), the therapy completes at block <b>1006</b>. If the therapy will require additional medication to be compounded, the compounder may receive therapy information at block <b>1008</b>. At block <b>1010</b>, the compounder queues the compounding of the additional medication such that the additional medication is scheduled to be compounded by the time needed based on therapy parameters programmed for the therapy or medication regimen of the patient receiving the therapy. If the therapy is altered (e.g. titrated) after the therapy is started at block <b>1004</b> and if additional compounding was required, the compounder may receive altered therapy information at block <b>1012</b>. At block <b>1014</b>, the compounder changes the queue order so that medication will be compounded by the time it is needed. After the compounder queues the order in block <b>1010</b> or block <b>1014</b>, the compounder may begin compounding the order at block <b>1016</b> when the queue location is reached. At block <b>1018</b>, the order compounding is finished. At block <b>1020</b>, the order is labeled and transported to the patient floor. At block <b>1022</b>, the medication reservoir associated with the delivery device is drained and replaced with the compounded order. During one therapy, the above described cycle may be repeated once or several times if the therapy requires additional medication to be compounded. If further compounding is required, the compounder may receive therapy information at block <b>1008</b> and repeat the discussed cycle through block <b>1022</b>. When no further compounding is required, the therapy completes at block <b>1006</b>. Alternatively, the example steps above may be utilized to meet the needs of a medication regimen rather than an individual therapy. The medication regimen may be defined in another hospital or institution system which interfaces with the compounder (e.g. an auto-programming system, patient medical record system, auto-refill order system, CPOE system, etc.).</p>
