    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">Smoking article inspection systems configured to inspect smoking articles are provided. The systems may include imaging devices configured to capture images of an exterior of the smoking article and an analysis unit configured to analyze the images captured by the imaging devices. The analysis unit may execute an edge detection tool configured to determine a position of the smoking article based on an edge location of the smoking article and a defect detection tool configured to determine whether the smoking article is defective after the position of the smoking article is determined. The imaging devices may be configured to capture images of the smoking articles during the assembly thereof. Thereby, the analysis unit may determine any operations during assembly causing damage to the smoking article from analysis of the images of the smoking article captured during assembly. Related methods are also provided.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to smoking articles and more particularly to smoking article inspection systems and related methods. The smoking articles may be made or derived from tobacco, or otherwise incorporate tobacco, and may be intended for human consumption.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Popular smoking articles, such as cigarettes, typically have a substantially cylindrical rod shaped structure and include a charge, roll, or column of smokable material such as shredded tobacco (e.g., in cut filler form) surrounded by a paper wrapper thereby forming a so-called âsmokable rodâ or âtobacco rod.â Normally, a cigarette has a cylindrical filter element aligned in an end-to-end relationship with the tobacco rod. Typically, a filter element comprises cellulose acetate tow plasticized using a plasticizer such as triacetin, and the tow is circumscribed by a paper material known as âplug wrap.â</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The filter element may be attached to one end of the tobacco rod using a circumscribing wrapping material known as âtipping materialâ or âtipping paper,â in order to provide a so-called âfiltered cigarette.â More particularly, the tipping material, which may be air impermeable, may circumscribe at least a portion of both the filter element and the tobacco rod to secure the filter element to the tobacco rod. The inner surface of the tipping material may be fixedly secured to the outer surface of the plug wrap circumscribing the filter tow and the outer surface of the wrapping material/paper wrapper surrounding the smokable material of the tobacco rod, using a suitable adhesive. Accordingly, the filter element and the tobacco rod may be connected to one another. The adhesive may also function to secure the overlapping ends of the tipping material circumscribing the filter element and tobacco rod. The tipping material and plug wrap may be perforated in order to provide dilution of drawn mainstream smoke with ambient air.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The above described steps may be performed largely, or entirely, by high-speed automated machinery. During automated production of cigarettes, certain defects may occur. It follows that, due to the high speed nature of the cigarette manufacturing process, many of the defects that may occur may not be readily apparent or otherwise detected before the completed smoking article is packaged for sale. As such, defects may not be discovered until an end user opens the package of smoking articles. Such a situation is generally undesirable to the perception of the quality of the product. As such, there exists a need for an apparatus and method for inspecting smoking articles, such as filtered cigarettes, for defects prior to the products being packaged for distribution and sale. It may also be desirable for such a solution to be readily implemented with respect to existing cigarette production machinery.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ASPECTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The present disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawing. The disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the aspects set forth herein; rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, there are shown components of a smoking article in the form of a filtered cigarette <b>100</b>. The cigarette <b>100</b> includes a generally cylindrical rod <b>102</b> of a charge or roll of smokable filler material <b>104</b> contained in a circumscribing wrapping material <b>106</b>. The rod <b>102</b> is conventionally referred to as a âsmokable rodâ or âtobacco rod.â The ends of the tobacco rod are open to expose the smokable filler material. At one end of the tobacco rod <b>102</b> is the lighting end <b>108</b> (or âlighting end terminusâ), and at the other end is shown a filter element <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The filter element <b>110</b> or other suitable mouthpiece is typically positioned adjacent one end of the tobacco rod <b>102</b> such that the filter element and tobacco rod are axially aligned in an end-to-end relationship, preferably abutting one another. The filter element <b>110</b> may have a generally cylindrical shape, and the diameter thereof may be essentially equal to the diameter of the tobacco rod <b>102</b>. The ends of the filter element <b>110</b> may be open to permit the passage of air and smoke therethrough. The filter element <b>110</b> includes filter material <b>112</b> (e.g., plasticized cellulose acetate tow) that is overwrapped along the longitudinally extending surface thereof with by a plug wrap <b>114</b>. The filter element <b>110</b> can comprise two or more filter segments (not shown), and/or flavor additives incorporated therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The filter element <b>110</b> is attached to the tobacco rod <b>102</b> by a tipping material <b>116</b> which circumscribes both the entire length of the filter element and an adjacent region of the tobacco rod. Opposite to the tobacco rod <b>102</b>, the filter element <b>110</b> includes a mouth end <b>118</b> (or âmouth end terminusâ). The inner surface of the tipping material <b>116</b> is fixedly secured to the outer surface of the plug wrap <b>114</b> and the outer surface of the wrapping material <b>106</b> of the tobacco rod, using a suitable adhesive (e.g., a water-based adhesive of the type traditionally employed by cigarette manufacturers for application of tipping paper during filtered cigarette manufacture). That is, the tipping material <b>116</b> extends around the longitudinally extending periphery of substantially the entire length of the plug wrap <b>114</b>, and a portion of the longitudinally extending periphery of the wrapping material <b>106</b> of the tobacco rod <b>102</b>, in a region of the tobacco rod immediately adjacent to the filter element <b>110</b>. Optionally, the smoking article <b>110</b> may be ventilated or air-diluted by air dilution provisions, such as a plurality or series of perforations <b>120</b>, each of which extends through the tipping material <b>116</b> and the plug wrap <b>114</b>. Adhesive may also be applied to a longitudinally extending seam line or lap zone (not shown) of the tipping material, such as is conventionally employed during cigarette manufacture.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In some instances, the cigarette may also possess one or more additional layers of tipping material (not shown) overlying and circumscribing the inner layer of tipping material. All or selected portions of the inner surface of the additional tipping material can be fixedly secured to the outer surface of the inner tipping material. As such, in some aspects, the additional tipping material may overlie the entire length of the filter element and the adjacent region of the tobacco rod. In one aspect, both tipping materials may extend essentially equal distances along the region of the tobacco rod that is adjacent the filter element. For certain cigarettes, the inner and outer tipping materials may be substantially identical in overall dimension (e.g., those tipping materials have comparable thicknesses, widths, and lengths). In embodiments in which the cigarette is ventilated or air-diluted, air dilution provisions such as a series of perforations may extend through the outer tipping material, the inner tipping material, and the plug wrap. Adhesive can be applied to each of the tipping materials using techniques generally similar to those employed conventionally for tipping material application during cigarette manufacture.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a representative âtwo-upâ filtered smoking article assembly <b>200</b> (e.g., a two-up cigarette) that can be subdivided along hashed line 2-2 in order to provide two filtered cigarettes <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B having a configuration as described with respect to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In addition, representative manners or methods for providing preferred types of cigarettes are described with reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. A âtwo-upâ filter segment <b>202</b> is provided. That representative filter segment <b>202</b> possesses filter material circumscribed by plug wrap, as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Two tobacco rods <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are aligned at each end of the âtwo-upâ filter segment <b>202</b>. A layer of tipping material <b>116</b> (e.g., a so-called âpatchâ of tipping material) is wrapped around the aligned components, such that the tipping material circumscribes the entire length of the âtwo-upâ filter segment <b>202</b>, and a portion of the length of each tobacco rod <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B in the respective regions thereof adjacent the filter segment. Typically, that layer of tipping material <b>116</b> circumscribes about 3 mm to about 4 mm of the length of each tobacco rod <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. As such, the so-called two-up filtered smoking article assembly <b>200</b> is provided. For certain preferred aspects, the tipping material <b>116</b> may be selected from types of tipping material, and applied in a particular manner, comparable to that traditionally used for commercial filtered cigarette manufacture. Optionally, the cigarette can be air diluted (e.g., using laser perforation techniques) by forming at least one circumscribing ring of perforations through the layer of tipping material <b>116</b> and underlying plug wrap. Then, the two-up filtered smoking article assembly <b>200</b> is cut in half (i.e., through the âtwo-up filter segment <b>202</b> along hashed line 2-2), perpendicular to its longitudinal axis, to provide two finished cigarettes <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B. As such, the two finished cigarettes <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are each characterized by a smooth mouth end terminus, wherein the mouth end terminus of the filter material, plug wrap, and tipping material are all in the same plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Popular smoking articles, such as cigarettes, have a substantially cylindrical rod shaped structure and include a charge, roll, or column of smokable material such as shredded tobacco (e.g., in cut filler form) surrounded by a paper wrapper thereby forming a so-called âsmokable rodâ or âtobacco rod.â Normally, a cigarette has a cylindrical filter element aligned in an end-to-end relationship with the tobacco rod. Typically, a filter element comprises cellulose acetate tow plasticized using a plasticizer such as triacetin, and the tow is circumscribed by a paper material known as âplug wrap.â</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The filter material can vary, and can be any material of the type that can be employed for providing a tobacco smoke filter for cigarettes. Preferably a traditional cigarette filter material is used, such as cellulose acetate tow, gathered cellulose acetate web, polypropylene tow, gathered cellulose acetate web, gathered paper, strands of reconstituted tobacco, or the like. Especially preferred is filamentary tow such as cellulose acetate, polyolefins such as polypropylene, or the like. One filter material that can provide a suitable filter rod is cellulose acetate tow having 3 denier per filament and 40,000 total denier. As another example, cellulose acetate tow having 3 denier per filament and 35,000 total denier can provide a suitable filter rod. As another example, cellulose acetate tow having 8 denier per filament and 40,000 total denier can provide a suitable filter rod. For further examples, see the types of filter materials set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3,424,172 to Neurath; U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,745 to Cohen et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,925,602 to Hill et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,277 to Takegawa et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,419 to Arzonico et al.; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Normally a plasticizer such as triacetin is applied to the filamentary tow in traditional amounts using known techniques. Other suitable materials or additives used in connection with the construction of the filter element will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette filter design and manufacture.

      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Cigarette filter rods can be used to provide multi-segment filter rods. Such multi-segment filter rods can be employed for the production of filtered cigarettes possessing multi-segment filter elements. An example of a two-segment filter element is a filter element possessing a first cylindrical segment incorporating activated charcoal particles (e.g., a âdalmatianâ type of filter segment) at one end, and a second cylindrical segment that is produced from a filter rod, with or without objects inserted therein. The production of multi-segment filter rods can be carried out using the types of rod-forming units that have been employed to provide multi-segment cigarette filter components. Multi-segment cigarette filter rods can be manufactured, for example, using a cigarette filter rod making device available under the brand name Mufti from Hauni-Werke Korber &amp; Co. KG of Hamburg, Germany. Representative types of filter designs and components, including representative types of segmented cigarette filters, are set forth in U.S. Pat.

The automated cigarette making machines of the type set forth herein provide a formed continuous cigarette rod or smokable rod that can be subdivided into formed smokable rods of desired lengths.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">A cigarette is employed by a smoker by lighting the lighting end terminus thereof opposite the filter element and burning the tobacco rod. The smoker then receives mainstream smoke into his/her mouth by drawing on the opposite end (e.g., the filter element or mouth end terminus) of the cigarette. Accordingly, drawn mainstream smoke may be diluted with ambient air by the perforations and/or off-line air dilution techniques described above. For cigarettes that are air diluted or ventilated, the amount or degree of air dilution or ventilation can vary. Frequently, the amount of air dilution for an air diluted cigarette is greater than about 10 percent, generally is greater than about 20 percent, often is greater than about 30 percent, and sometimes is greater than about 40 percent. Typically, the upper level for air dilution for an air diluted cigarette is less than about 80 percent, and often is less than about 70 percent. As used herein, the term âair dilutionâ is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the volume of air drawn through the air dilution provisions to the total volume and air and smoke drawn through the cigarette and exiting the extreme mouth end portion of the cigarette.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The dimensions of a representative filtered cigarette can vary. Preferred cigarettes are rod-shaped, and can have diameters of about 7.5 mm (e.g., circumferences of about 20 mm to about 27 mm, often about 22.5 mm to about 25 mm); and can have total lengths of about 70 mm to about 120 mm, often about 80 mm to about 100 mm. The length of the filter element can vary. Typical filter elements can have total lengths of about 15 mm to about 40 mm, often about 20 mm to about 35 mm. For a typical dual-segment filter element, the downstream or mouth end filter segment often has a length of about 10 mm to about 20 mm; and the upstream or tobacco rod end filter segment often has a length of about 10 mm to about 20 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">During the manufacture of filtered smoking articles, such as filtered cigarettes, certain defects may occur. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to systems and methods for inspecting smoking articles. More particularly, the present disclosure is directed to inspection of smoking articles during the manufacture thereof and tools employed in analyzing images of smoking articles to determine whether the assembled smoking articles are defective and the operation causing such defect.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In this regard, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates a smoking article or cigarette maker <b>300</b>. In one embodiment the cigarette maker <b>300</b> may comprise a MAX <b>90</b> cigarette maker from Hauni-Werke Korber &amp; Co. KG of Hamburg, Germany. The cigarette maker <b>300</b> may include a plurality of substantially cylindrical rotatable devices such as cylinders or drums. In the illustrated embodiment, the cigarette maker <b>300</b> includes first through eleventh drums <b>302</b>A-K. The drums <b>302</b>A-K may be configured to transport smoking articles, in various stages of completion, between various stations performing operations thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The smoking articles may generally progress from drum-to-drum in a direction corresponding to an increasing state of completion as indicated by arrow <b>304</b>. In this regard, tipping paper may be applied to the smoking article at the third drum <b>302</b>C, perforations may be cut (e.g., laser cut) in the tipping paper and the plug wrap at the fourth drum <b>302</b>D, the smoking articles may be divided from a two-up smoking article assembly into two completed smoking articles at the fifth drum <b>302</b>E, the completed smoking articles may be inspected at the eighth drum <b>302</b>H, and defective smoking articles may be ejected at the ninth drum <b>302</b>I. The remaining drums may be configured to transport the smoking articles between the various drums where operations are performed on the smoking articles, reposition the smoking articles, and/or perform other functions. Accordingly, the remaining drums may comprise transfer drums in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The smoking articles may generally be held in contact with the drums, with each smoking article oriented such that a longitudinal axis thereof is parallel to a rotational axis of the drum that the smoking article is in contact therewith. For example, the smoking articles may be held in channels or flutes in the drums via gravity, via suction applied thereto, and/or via contact therewith by one or more mechanical mechanisms. Gravity or other means and mechanisms may be employed to transfer the smoking articles between the drums.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">It may be desirable to inspect the smoking articles prior to packaging and transport of the smoking articles for sale. Accordingly, the cigarette maker <b>300</b> may include an inspection system in some embodiments. In this regard, as noted above, the smoking articles may be inspected at the eighth drum <b>302</b>H in some embodiments. As further noted above, the smoking articles may be completed by the time they reach the eight drum <b>302</b>H. Accordingly, the completed smoking articles may be inspected prior to packaging and transport to consumers.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">However, Applicant has determined that it may be desirable to inspect the smoking articles at additional or alternative stages during the manufacture thereof. In this regard, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> schematically illustrates a smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> configured to inspect a smoking article. As described above, the smoking article may comprise a smokable rod <b>102</b> and a filter element <b>110</b> connected by a tipping material <b>112</b> (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The inspected smoking articles may be inspected in various states of completion. In this regard, the smoking articles may comprise two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in some embodiments (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), individual, completed, as-formed smoking articles <b>100</b> (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), or components thereof in any state of completion.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> may comprise an inspection apparatus <b>402</b>. Further, the smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> may include an analysis unit <b>404</b>. Accordingly, the analysis unit <b>404</b> may analyze data captured by the inspection apparatus <b>402</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In one embodiment the inspection apparatus <b>402</b> may comprise one or more infrared cameras, x-ray devices, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, thermal imaging devices, microphones, and/or visible spectrum imaging devices. In one embodiment, the inspection apparatus <b>402</b> comprises a plurality of imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D configured to respectively capture one or more images of an exterior of the smoking article (e.g., cameras configured to capture images in the visible light spectrum). As discussed hereinafter, the images may be captured of a longitudinal periphery of each smoking article or the longitudinal ends thereof. Accordingly, the analysis unit <b>404</b> may be configured to analyze the images captured by the one or more imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D. Further, in some embodiments one or more of the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may include an illumination source <b>406</b>A-D associated therewith, which may illuminate the exterior of the smoking articles in order to facilitate capturing images thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In some embodiments the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may be configured to capture images in color. Further, the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may comprise high-speed cameras in some embodiments. For example, the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may be configured to capture at least about thirty frames per second in one embodiment, at least about fifty frames per second in an additional embodiment, and at least about sixty frames per second in a preferred embodiment. Accordingly, the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may be configured to capture images of the smoking articles while the smoking articles move at relatively high speeds during the production thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In one embodiment the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may comprise the In-Sight 7000 Series Vision System, from Cognex Corp. of Natick, Mass. In this embodiment the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may include integral illumination sources. Accordingly, the separate illumination sources <b>406</b>A-D may be omitted in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">As noted above, Applicant has determined that it may be desirable to inspect the smoking articles at various stages of completion. By inspecting the smoking articles during assembly thereof, it may be possible to determine which operations in the assembly process are causing defects. Thereby, repairs and/or adjustments may be made to the particular operations causing the defects. In another embodiment it may be possible to remove defective smoking articles prior to completion thereof to save resources or reduce the risk of the defective smoking article continuing in the production process. For example, after a partially-completed smoking article is determined to be defective, the smoking article may be removed prior to completion thereof. In this regard, the determination of whether a smoking article is defective may be made during the production thereof (e.g., prior to completion) in one embodiment. By way of further example, defective smoking article removal devices (e.g., ejectors) may additionally or alternatively be positioned downstream of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A and/or the second imaging device <b>402</b>B in some embodiments. Thereby, by removing the defective, partially-completed smoking articles, material savings may occur by avoiding the unnecessary addition of materials thereto and/or unnecessary wear to the cigarette maker <b>300</b> may be avoided by preventing usage of wear items such as cutting blades thereon. In another embodiment it may be possible to adjust parameters of the assembly operations performed by the cigarette maker <b>300</b> and/or it may be possible to identify defective components of the smoking articles (e.g., defective tipping material supplied to the cigarette maker) in order to avoid the defects. Note, however, that in an alternate embodiment the determination of whether a smoking article is defective may be made after the completion of the smoking article, for example, in instances in which the operation of the cigarette maker <b>300</b> appears to be stable and proper.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In one embodiment the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may be configured to capture the images of the smoking article during and after assembly of the smoking article. In this regard, in the embodiment in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a first imaging device <b>402</b>A is configured to capture images of the smoking articles at the third drum <b>302</b>C, a second imaging device <b>402</b>B is configured to capture images of the smoking articles at the fourth drum <b>302</b>D, the third imaging device <b>402</b>C is configured to capture images of the smoking articles at the eighth drum <b>302</b>H, and the fourth imaging device <b>402</b>D is configured to capture images of the smoking articles at the ninth drum <b>302</b>I. Example positions of the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D with respect to the drums <b>302</b>C, D, H, I are illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Various control schemes may be employed to keep track of the smoking articles as they are assembled. In this regard, in one embodiment timing mechanisms may be employed to determine the identity of a smoking article for which an image is captured thereof. For example, the amount of time associated with moving through the cigarette maker <b>300</b> from the start to each of the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D may be proportional to the rotational speed of the drums <b>302</b>A-K. Accordingly, the time at which an image of a smoking article is captured may be employed to identify the smoking article. In another embodiment the identity of a smoking article may be determined by maintaining a count of the number of smoking articles having images thereof captured. In some embodiments the count may be based on the number of images captured, regardless of whether a smoking article appears therein, in order to account for removed (e.g., removed as defective) or missing (e.g., fallen from one of the drums <b>302</b>A-K) smoking articles. In a further embodiment, identification of the smoking articles may be based on the number of rotations of the drums <b>302</b>A-K and/or the rotational position thereof. In this regard, the number of rotations of the drums <b>302</b>A-K and the rotational position thereof may directly correspond to the position of the smoking articles in the cigarette maker <b>300</b>. For example, the drums <b>302</b>A-K may be rotationally synchronized. However, various other techniques may be employed to identify each of the smoking articles having images captured thereof. Identification of smoking articles using one of the above-mentioned techniques or various other techniques may be important in that removal of defective smoking articles may occur downstream of the locations at which the images of the smoking articles are captured. Thereby, the position of the smoking articles must be known and tracked such that the correct smoking articles, identified as defective, may be removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> may additionally include a network <b>408</b> (e.g., a local network or the internet). The analysis unit <b>404</b> may connect to the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D through the network <b>408</b>. In another embodiment the analysis unit <b>404</b> may communicate directly with the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D. Further, the smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> may include one or more monitor(s) <b>410</b>. The monitors <b>410</b> may be configured to display images captured by the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D and/or information provided by the analysis unit <b>404</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an enlarged perspective view of the third drum <b>302</b>C and the first imaging device <b>402</b>A. Tobacco rods and filter elements may be transferred to the third drum <b>302</b>C by transfer drums <b>302</b>A, B. The third drum <b>302</b>C may comprise a roll drum, at which tipping material is applied to the tobacco rod and the filter rod to form the two-up smoking article assembly <b>200</b> (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The third drum <b>302</b>C may include a plurality of grooves, slots, or channels <b>306</b>C at the circumference thereof oriented parallel to the rotational axis of the third drum. Each of the channels <b>306</b>C may be configured to receive a two-up filtered smoking article assembly <b>200</b>. In order to retain the two-up filtered smoking article assemblies in the channels <b>306</b>C, one or more suction ports <b>308</b>C may be respectively positioned in the channels <b>306</b>C. Accordingly, suction applied to the suction ports <b>308</b>C may retain the two-up filtered smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in the channels <b>306</b>C as the roll drum <b>302</b>C rotates. Thereby, the tipping material <b>116</b> may be applied to form the two-up smoking article assembly <b>200</b> (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As illustrated, the first imaging device <b>402</b>A may be generally aimed toward the circumference of the third drum <b>302</b>C. Accordingly, the first imaging device <b>402</b>A may be positioned, aimed, and focused to capture images of at least a portion of a longitudinal length of a two-up filtered smoking article assembly <b>200</b> before, during, or after application of the tipping material thereto. A debris shield <b>412</b>A may be configured to block debris from a lens <b>414</b>A of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A. In this regard, tobacco crumbs, paper particles, dust, and/or other materials may release from the smoking articles during assembly thereof, which could coat the lens <b>414</b>A and impair the image capturing abilities of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A. As illustrated, the debris shield <b>412</b>A may include a lip <b>416</b>A positioned proximate the outer surface of the third drum <b>302</b>C and oriented substantially tangentially to a portion thereof. Accordingly, the lip <b>416</b>A may provide further protection in terms of directing debris away from the lens <b>414</b>A of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A which may release from the smoking articles on the third drum <b>302</b>C substantially tangentially. These and various other techniques configured to prevent build-up of debris on lenses of the imaging devices, which are described hereinafter, may be employed at any of the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D.</p>

      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some embodiments the first imaging device <b>402</b>A captures images of a plurality of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in each image. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the first imaging device <b>402</b>A captures images of two of the two-up filtered smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in each of the images. Capturing multiples of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in each image may provide various advantages.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">For example, in some embodiments the rotational speed of the third drum <b>302</b>C may cause the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> to pass the first imaging device <b>402</b>A at a rate that exceeds the frame rate of the first imaging device. Accordingly, capturing multiples of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> in each image may allow for inspection of each of the two-up smoking article assemblies. Thus, capturing images of multiples of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> may allow for inspection of each of the two-up smoking article assemblies despite frame rate limitations of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Further, in embodiments in which the frame rate of the first imaging device <b>402</b>A is sufficient to capture individual images of each of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> passing thereby, capturing multiple image of the two-up smoking article assemblies may still provide benefits. In this regard, in some embodiments each image may capture at least two of the two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b> such that at least two images are captured of each two-up smoking article assembly in successive frames. By capturing more than one image of each two-up smoking article assembly <b>200</b>, the smoking article inspection system <b>400</b> may analyze and inspect the multiple images of each two-up smoking article assembly such that each two-up smoking article assembly is inspected multiple times at the third drum <b>302</b>C. Accordingly, multiple images of each two-up smoking article assembly may be captured without requiring a higher frame rate of the imaging device, which may not be available or which may be cost prohibitive.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Note that the remainder of the disclosure generally describes and illustrates capturing images of individual smoking articles, as opposed to multiple smoking articles in each image. However, multiple smoking articles may be captured in each image at any of the drums. Accordingly, the disclosure is not limited to the example embodiments disclosed herein.</p>

      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">In some embodiments the apparatus <b>500</b> may further comprise a defect detection module <b>510</b>. The processor <b>502</b> may be configured to control at least some functions of one or more elements of the defect detection module <b>510</b>. The defect detection module <b>510</b> may be configured to execute a defect detection tool configured to determine whether a smoking article is defective based on the data provided by the inspection apparatus <b>402</b>. Thus, for example, the defect detection tool may determine whether a smoking article is defective based on images captured by the imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D. In this regard, the defect detection tool may be configured to determine an edge location of the tipping material, detect a plurality of perforations extending through the tipping material and spacing thereof, detect a contrast between a dark portion and a light portion of the smoking article, determine a color of the smoking article, detect a pattern, identify segments of the filter element, and/or perform various other functions configured to detect defects. Some defects that may be detected include tobacco crumbs under the tipping material, patches of tipping material glued to a drum, extra patches of tipping material, tobacco that is glued between the filter and the tobacco rod, wrinkled tipping material, laser holes that are on top of one another as opposed to properly spaced apart (e.g., due to the smoking article not rolling correctly on the fourth drum <b>302</b>D), exposed capsules or charcoal at the mouth end of the filter element, absence of a string in the filter element (in embodiments of smoking articles including string filter elements), missing tipping material, misaligned (e.g., tilted tipping material), improperly positioned tipping material (e.g., along the longitudinal axis of the smoking article), misaligned tobacco rod and filter element (e.g., non-axial alignment), etc. Various other examples of defects that may be detected are described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">In some embodiments the apparatus <b>500</b> may further comprise a position determination module <b>512</b>. The processor <b>502</b> may be configured to control at least some functions of one or more elements of the position determination module <b>512</b>. The position determination module <b>512</b> may be configured to determine a position of the smoking article. For example, the position determination module may be configured to execute an edge detection tool configured to determine a position of the smoking article based on an edge location of the smoking article. The edge detection tool may be configured to detect the location of various edges of the smoking article. For example, the edge detection tool may detect edges at an outer perimeter of the smoking article (e.g., upper and lower horizontal edges (x-axis) and left and right vertical edges (y-axis) at the termini of the smoking article or the two-up smoking article assembly). The edge location of various other features of the smoking article (e.g., vertical and horizontal edges of the tipping material and/or edges of any other of the components of the smoking article and/or interfaces therebetween) may also be detected in order to determine a position of the smoking article. The edges may be detected for both the tobacco rod and the filter element in some embodiments to determine the position of the smoking article.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The defect detection module <b>510</b> may function in conjunction with the position determination module <b>512</b>. In this regard, the position of the smoking article may be employed in the determination of whether the smoking article is defective. For example, the alignment of the tipping material may be compared to the overall alignment of smoking article. Thus, whether the smoking article is defective may be determined after the position of the smoking article is determined in some embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">By way of example, <figref>FIG. 15</figref> illustrates execution of the edge detection tool in relation to an image <b>426</b>B of the two-up smoking article assembly <b>200</b> which may be captured by the second imaging device <b>402</b>B. As illustrated, the edge detection tool may detect left and right edges <b>428</b>B, <b>430</b>B of the tipping material <b>116</b>. Further, the edge detection tool may detect upper and lower edges <b>432</b>B, <b>434</b>B of the tipping material <b>116</b>. Accordingly, based on these edge locations and/or locations of various other portions or components of the smoking article, the position of the tipping material and/or the smoking article may be determined. In this regard, detection of one edge location may provide information with respect to the position of the smoking article. However, detection of a second edge may provide additional information. In this regard, if the smoking article is bent or otherwise structurally misconfigured, detection of a single edge may provide incomplete information with respect to the position of the smoking article. Further, detection of multiple edges may provide information with respect to the size of the smoking article or components thereof, which provides additional positional information. Note that the position of the smoking article may additionally or alternatively be determined based off of the position of the tobacco rod and/or other components of the smoking article other than the tipping material to later determine whether the tipping material is properly aligned with the remainder of the smoking article in some embodiments. Accordingly, determination of first and second edge locations may include determination of boundaries (e.g., external boundaries) of the smoking article or components thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">Thus, as described by way of example with respect to <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, the position of the smoking article, in any state of assembly (e.g., embodied as completed smoking articles <b>100</b> or as two-up smoking article assemblies <b>200</b>), may be determined. Thereafter, the defect detection tool may detect any defects in the smoking article. In this regard, <figref>FIGS. 16A-D</figref> illustrate various examples of defects that may be detected in images that may be captured by the first imaging device <b>402</b>A. Various example of defects that may be detected in images captured by the first imaging device <b>402</b>A include the absence of the tipping material, skewed tipping material, mispositioned tipping material (e.g., along the longitudinal axis of the smoking article), and debris and stains. Note that in the illustrated embodiment the first imaging device captures images of the tipping material during attachment to the two-up smoking article assemblies. Thus, by determining the position of an upper edge, a lower edge, and/or side edges of the partially attached tipping material and determining the position of the remainder of the smoking article, it may be possible to determine whether the tipping material is properly aligned with the smoking article prior to completing wrapping the tipping material about the smoking article.</p>

In this regard, <figref>FIG. 16A</figref> illustrates a defect in the form of a simulated gap <b>432</b>A which may be detected. For example, the gap <b>432</b>A may be detected by determining a color of the smoking article and determining that a detected color of the smoking article (e.g., black) does not match a desired color of the smoking article (e.g., white). Similarly, the defect detection tool may detect a contrast between the gap <b>432</b>A (a dark portion) and the remainder of the tipping material <b>116</b> (a light portion) to determine that there is a defect. The gap <b>432</b>A may also be detected by determining edge locations of the tipping material <b>116</b>, wherein the lower edge of the tipping material is out of place with respect to the remainder of the smoking article.</p>

      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">Thus, as described above, various defects in the smoking articles may be detected. Further, these defects may be detected during assembly of the smoking article. In this regard, assembly of the smoking article may include a plurality of operations, as described above. For example, the operations may include attaching the tipping material, cutting the perforations in the filter, and dividing the two-up smoking article assembly. Accordingly, when the analysis unit <b>404</b> determines that a smoking article is defective, the analysis unit may be further configured to determine the one of the operations causing damage to the smoking article from analysis of the images of the smoking article. Thus, as described above defective smoking articles may be removed at various points during the assembly process and/or repairs or adjustments may be made to the particular operations causing the defects. Accordingly, the assembly process may be improved relative to embodiments in which the smoking articles are only inspected after completion.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">As noted above, in one embodiment the inspection apparatus <b>402</b> may include one or more imaging devices <b>402</b>A-D. However, the inspection apparatus may include various alternative or additional devices in other embodiments. For example, in one embodiment the inspection apparatus may include one or more microphones that may detect sounds occurring during the production of smoking articles. Accordingly, variations in sounds from expected sounds may indicate that an error is occurring in the production process that could cause defects in the smoking articles. For example, when a piece of tipping material becomes attached to one of the drums, the piece of tipping material may produce certain sounds during rotation therewith. Accordingly, the microphone may detect any abnormal noises by comparing detected noises to noises associated with proper operation of the cigarette maker.</p>
