      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/099,893 entitled “Coated and Cured Proppants” and filed on May 3, 2011. The contents of this co-pending application are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for the production of coated proppants, and also to the proppants obtained according to this method, to the uses thereof and to methods which use the proppants.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Well factoring is an often used technique to increase the efficiency and productivity of oil and gas wells. Overly simplified, the process involves the introduction of a fracturing fluid into the well and the use of fluid pressure to fracture and crack the well strata. The cracks allow the oil and gas to flow more freely from the strata and thereby increase production rates in an efficient manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There are many detailed techniques involved in well fracturing, but one of the most important is the use of a solid “proppant” to keep the strata cracks open as oil, gas, water and other fluids found in well flow through those cracks. The proppant is carried into the well with the fracturing fluid which itself may contain a variety of viscosity enhancers, gelation agents, surfactants, etc. These additives also enhance the ability of the fracturing fluid to carry proppant to the desired strata depth and location. The fracturing fluid for a particular well may or may not use the same formulation for each depth in the strata.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Proppants can be made of virtually any generally solid particle that has a sufficiently high crush strength to prop open cracks in a rock strata at great depth and temperatures of about 35° C. and higher. Sand and ceramic proppants have proved to be especially suitable for commercial use.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A proppant that is flushed from the well is said to have a high “flow back.” Flow back is undesirable. In addition to closure of the cracks, the flushed proppants are abrasive and can damage or clog the tubular goods used to complete the well, valves and pipelines in downstream processing facilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">One type of synthetic resin coatings can be used to impart a degree of adhesion to the proppant so that flow back is substantially reduced or eliminated. Such resins can include phenol resin, epoxy resin, polyurethane-phenol resin, furane resin, etc. See published US Patent Application No. 2002/0048676, 2003/0131998, 2003/0224165, 2005/0019574, 2007/0161515 and 2008/0230223 as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,192; 5,048,608; 5,199,491; 6,406,789; 6,632,527; 7,624,802; and published international application WO 2010/049467, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">With some coatings, the synthetic coating is not completely cured when the proppant is introduced into the well. The coated, partially-cured proppants are free flowing, but the coating resin is still slightly reactive. The final cure is intended to occur in situ in the strata fracture at the elevated closure pressures and temperatures found “down hole.”</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Such partially cured coating can also exhibit a number of performance issues ranging from: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>A lack of storage stability if stored in a hot environment. This type situation could result in a completion of the curing process (while in storage) making the coated proppant incapable of bonding when placed in the fracture.</li><li>Leaching chemicals out of the partially cured coating that could interfere when the viscosity profile of the fluid used to carry the proppant into the fracture or the chemical breaker system that is relied on to reduce the frac fluid viscosity after completion of the fracturing treatment.</li><li>Erosion of the partially cured coating when the coated proppant is handled pneumatically in order to place in the field storage bins at the well site.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0013">A second type of synthetic coating is described as being precured or tempered. In this case the coating is essentially cured during the manufacturing process. This type of coating will strengthen the substrate particle so that it can withstand a higher stress level before grain failure. Such a precured coating with also exhibit the following traits: 1) Excellent storage stability; 2) Minimal chemicals that can be leached out of the coating to interfere with carrier fluid viscosity or breaker systems; and 3) A coating that is resilient to the abrasion of pneumatic handling.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0014">The main limitation of a precured coating is that it can not create significant particle to particle bonding when placed in the fracture an temperature and closure pressure are applied. This means that a precured coated particle can do little to prevent proppant flowback after the well is opened up to start the clean-up process or to produce the well.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0015">Proppants based on polyurethane chemistries have a number of potential advantages over phenol resin systems. Most notably, the reaction rates used to make polyurethane coatings are generally faster than phenol resins, cure at lower temperatures and do not have gaseous emissions that require specialized recovery equipment. The coating step with polyurethanes can be carried out at temperatures of about 10° C. to about 250° C. although temperatures of less than about 100° C. are preferred to minimize emissions during the coating process as well as energy use. Polyurethane coatings can also be performed without the use of solvents, whereas many of the known methods, as a rule, require organic solvents for the resinous coating. The components in polyurethane systems are also generally easier to use and pose lower environmental issues. These factors could reduce the cost to make coated proppants and could also permit the coating process to be moved to the site of the well head.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0016">Polyurethanes have not, however, achieved widespread adoption due to their performance in the hot, wet, high pressured environment encountered in the fracture. The stability of the coating to this environment, the ability of the coating to prevent particle failure (e.g., by crushing) and to develop strong particle-to-particle bonds, have contributed to poor flowback control and less than desirable fracture conductivity.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0017">It would be desirable to develop a coated proppant that combined adequate crush resistance, resistance to dusting when handled pneumatically and the limited leaching of chemicals that is exhibited by precured coatings with the ability to create the particle-to-particle reaction bonds that resist proppant flowback which are exhibited by a partially cured proppant coating.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0029">The coating formulation of the present invention includes a substantially homogeneous mixture that comprises: (a) at least one isocyanate reactant having at least 2 isocyanate groups, and (ii) at least one curing agent. The coating may further comprise one or more curing agents in the form of amine reactants, metal catalysts, hydroxyl-functional curing agents and/or polyols. The components are used in an amount sufficient and under conditions that are also sufficient to substantially cure the proppant coating and form free flowing, coated proppants in a fairly short period of time. The coated proppant thus exhibits the good handling and low dust characteristics of a precured product but also exhibits in-strata consolidation characteristics and flow-back resistance that are like a partially cured product.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0030">The coating process of the present invention applies one or more layers of curable coating around a solid proppant core that is quickly and substantially cured to resist dissolution of the coating under the rigorous combination of high heat, agitation, abrasion and water that are found downhole in a well. Preferably, the cured coating exhibits a sufficient resistance to a 10 day autoclave test or 10 day conductivity test so that the coating resists loss by dissolution in hot water (“LOI loss”) of less than 25 wt %, more preferably less than 15 wt %, and even more preferably a loss of less than 5 wt %. The substantially cured coating of the invention thus resists dissolution in the fractured stratum while also exhibiting sufficient particle-to-particle reaction bond strength to resist flow back and sufficiently high crush strength to maintain conductivity of the fractures.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0031">A preferred testing method for the effectiveness of a proppant is described in ISO 13503-5:2006(E) “Procedures for measuring the long term conductivity of proppants”, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. ISO 13503-5:2006 provides standard testing procedures for evaluating proppants used in hydraulic fracturing and gravel packing operations. ISO 13503-5:2006 provides a consistent methodology for testing performed on hydraulic fracturing and/or gravel packing proppants. The “proppants” mentioned henceforth in this part of ISO 13503-5:2006 refer to sand, ceramic media, resin-coated proppants, gravel packing media, and other materials used for hydraulic fracturing and gravel-packing operations. ISO 13503-5:2006 is not applicable for use in obtaining absolute values of proppant pack conductivities under downhole reservoir conditions, but it does serve as a consistent method by which such downhole conditions can be simulated and compared in a laboratory setting.</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0049">The amine-based curing agent may have a molecular weight of about 64 or greater.

      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0050">Of the list above, the saturated amine-based curing agents suitable for use with the present invention include, but are not limited to, ethylene diamine; hexamethylene diamine; 1-methyl-2,6-cyclohexyl diamine; 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine; 4,4′-bis-(sec-butylamino)-dicyclohexylmethane; 1,4-bis-(sec-butylamino)-cyclohexane; 1,2-bis-(sec-butylamino-cyclohexane; derivatives of 4,4′-bis-(sec-butylamino)-dicyclohexylmethane; 4,4′-dicyclohexylmethane diamine; 1,4-cyclohexane-bis-(methylamine); 1,3-cyclohexane-bis-(methylamine); diethylene glycol bis-(aminopropyl) ether; 2-methylpentamethylene-diamine; diaminocyclohexane; diethylene triamine; triethylene tetramine; tetraethylene pentamine; propylene diamine; dipropylene triamine; 1,3-diaminopropane; dimethylamino propylamine; diethylamino propylamine; imido-bis-(propylamine); monoethanolamine, diethanolamine; triethanolamine; monoisopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine; triisopropanolamine; isophoronediamine; N,N′-diisopropylisophorone diamine and mixtures thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0052">Because unhindered primary diamines result in a rapid reaction between the isocyanate groups and the amine groups, in certain instances, a hindered secondary diamine may be more suitable for use in the prepolymer. Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that an amine with a high level of stearic hindrance, e.g., a tertiary butyl group on the nitrogen atom, has a slower reaction rate than an amine with no hindrance or a low level of hindrance. For example, 4,4′-bis-(sec-butylamino)-dicyclohexylmethane (CLEARLINK 1000® from Huntsman Corporation in The Woodlands, Tex.) may be suitable for use in combination with an isocyanate to form the polyurea prepolymer. In addition, N,N′-diisopropyl-isophorone diamine, also available from Huntsman Corporation, under the tradename JEFFLINK®, may be used as the secondary diamine curing agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0053">In addition, a trifunctional curing agent can be used to help improve cross-linking and, thus, to further improve the chemical and/or abrasion resistance of the coating. In one embodiment, a triol such as trimethylolpropane or a tetraol such as N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-hydroxylpropyl)ethylenediamine may be added to the formulations.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0054">The curing agents of the present invention can be added to the coating formulation with the polyol component, the amine-reactive polyol component, any of the additives (e.g., coloring agents) or added simultaneously as any of these components or pre-coated on the proppant. Preferably, the curing agent is mixed with or co-applied to the solid proppant core as the first isocyanate and any other reactants are mixed so that the curing process has begun by the time the coating formulation is applied to the surface of the solid proppant core. It is also possible to premix the isocyanate and polyol together immediately before entry into the mixer. This probably would give a slightly more uniform distribution of the chemicals in the coating. Alternately, it would be possible to premix the polyol and curing agent before they are added to the isocyanate.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0055">Most preferably, the isocyanate, polyol, combination of (a) polyol and (b) curing agent or each individually are continuously added to solid proppant in a moving mixer at a rate that is not substantially greater than the rate of the crosslinking reaction between and among the ingredients. The specific rate will depend on the size of the mixer, the type of mixer, and whether batch or continuous production is desired. The goal is to substantially completely coat the proppant solid with a coating that becomes cured in the mixer and is discharged as a free-flowing, discrete particulates. The amperage draw rate of the mixer can be used as a guide in tumbling-type mixers because the build-up of an uncured, tacky coating on the proppant solids will increase the load on the mixer motor which can be monitored by a simple amp meter. Adding the reaction components at a rate that is consistent with the reaction rate of the curing process avoids substantial increases in amperage allows the coating process, avoids stalling the motor or interrupting the coating process, and maximizes the productivity of the equipment used to perform the coating/curing process. In a preferred process using laboratory scale equipment, a few seconds after beginning to add the polyol, the isocyanate is added at a controlled rate over a relatively short period, e.g., about a minute.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0082">Cardol and cardanol can each be used alone or at any particular mixing ratio in the phenol resin. Decarboxylated cashew nut oil can also be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0083">Cardol and/or cardanol can be condensed into the above described phenol resins, for example, into the resole- or novolak-type phenol resins. For this purpose, cardol and/or cardanol can be condensed e.g. with phenol or with one or more of the above defined compounds of the formula (I), and also with aldehydes, preferably formaldehyde.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0084">The amount of cardol and/or cardanol which is condensed in the phenol resin is not particularly restricted and preferably is from about 1 wt % to about 99 wt %, more preferably about 5 wt % to about 60 wt %, and still mom preferably about 10 wt % to about 30 wt %, relative to 100 wt % of the amount of phenolic starting products used in the phenol resin.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">In another embodiment, the polyol component is a phenol resin obtained by condensation of cardol and/or cardanol with aldehydes, preferably formaldehyde.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">A phenol resin which contains monomer units based on cardol and/or cardanol as described above, or which can be obtained by condensation of cardol and/or cardanol with aldehydes, has a particularly low viscosity and can thus preferably be employed with a low addition or without addition of reactive thinners. Moreover, this kind of long-chain, substituted phenol resin is comparatively hydrophobic, which results in a favorable shelf life of the coated proppants obtained by the method according to the present invention. In addition, a phenol resin of this kind is also advantageous because cardol and cardanol are renewable raw materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">Apart from the phenol resin, the polyol component can still contain other compounds containing hydroxyl groups. The other compounds containing hydroxyl groups can be selected from the compounds containing hydroxyl groups that are known to be useful for making polyurethanes, e.g., hydroxy-functional polyethers, hydroxy-functional polyesters, alcohols or glycols. One preferred compound containing hydroxyl groups is, for instance, castor oil. Compounds containing hydroxyl groups such as alcohols or glycols, in particular cardol and/or cardanol, can be used as reactive thinners.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0088">The amount of the other compounds containing hydroxyl groups depends on the desired properties of the proppant coating and can suitably be selected by the person skilled in the art. Typical amounts of compounds containing hydroxyl groups are in the range of between about 10 wt % and about 80 wt %, preferably from about 20 wt % to about 70 wt %, relative to 100 wt % of the polyol component.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0089">The process of the present invention is particularly useful when the proppants are coated with a condensation reaction product that has been made with an excess of isocyanate component with respect to the polyol or curing agent component. In step (a) therefore, 100 parts by weight of the polyol component is used with about 100 to about 600, preferably about 210 to about 530, more preferably about 220 to about 420, and still more preferably about 230 to about 400 parts by weight of the isocyanate base value. Ratios of iso:polyol from about 50:50 to as low as 100:0 are usable depending on the equipment, conditions and production rate provided that the coating and reaction are completed during the coating process.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0090">The isocyanate base value defines the amount of the isocyanate component which is equivalent to 100 parts by weight of the polyol component. The NCO-content (%) of the isocyanate component is defined herein according to DIN ISO 53183. To determine the OH-content (%) of the polyol component, first the so-called OH-number is determined in mg KOH/g according to DIN ISO 53240 and this value is divided by 33, in order to determine the OH-content. Thus, in step (a) an excess of NCO-groups in the isocyanate component of between about 100 and about 500%, preferably about 110 to about 430%, more preferably about 120% to about 320%, and still more preferably about 130% to about 300%, relative to the OH-groups in the polyol component is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0091">Moreover, in step (a) one or more additives can be mixed with the proppant, the polyol component and the isocyanate component. These additives are not particularly restricted and can be selected from the additives known in the specific field of coated proppants. Provided that one of these additives has hydroxyl groups, it should be considered as a different hydroxyl-group-containing compound, as described above in connection with the polyol component. If one of the additives has isocyanate groups, it should be considered as a different isocyanate-group-containing compound. Additives with hydroxyl groups and isocyanate groups can be simultaneously considered as different hydroxyl-group-containing compounds and as different isocyanate-group-containing compounds.</p>

The coating formulation can, however, be made effectively and with good properties in the absence or substantial absence of a reactive amine component apart from the reactive polyol and isocyanate components.

      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0104">Other additives can include, for example, solvents, softeners, surface-active agents, molecular sieves for removing the reaction water, thinners and/or adhesion agents can be used. Silanes are a particularly preferred type of adhesion agent that improves the affinity of the coating resin for the surface of the proppant. Silanes can be mixed in as additives in step (a), but can also be converted chemically with reactive constituents of the polyol component or of the isocyanate component. Functional silanes such as amino-silanes, epoxy-, aryl- or vinyl silanes are commercially available and, as described above, can be used as additives or can be converted with the reactive constituents of the polyol component or of the isocyanate component. In particular, amino-silanes and epoxy-silanes can be easily converted with the isocyanate component.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Proppant Core Solids</heading>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0105">The proppants can be virtually any small solid with an adequate crush strength and lack of chemical reactivity. Suitable examples include sand, ceramic particles (for instance, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, zirconium dioxide, cerium dioxide, manganese dioxide, iron oxide, calcium oxide or bauxite), or also other granular materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0106">Proppant sands are a preferred type of proppant for the present invention. Sand is mainly used in the hydraulic fracturing process of natural gas and oil wells to increase their productivity of valuable natural resources. Proppant sand is monocrystalline with a high silica content of at least 80 wt %, and more typically greater than about 97 wt % silica.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0107">American Petroleum Institute specifications place the following limitations on sieve distribution for proppants suitable tor use in a fracture: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>At least 90% of material must fall between the two mesh sizes.</li><li>No more than 10% of the material may be coarser than the largest mesh size,</li><li>No more than 0.1 % of the material may be coarser than the next largest mesh size [e.g. for 20/40, up to 10% of the proppant may be between 16 and 20 mesh, but no more than 0.1% can exceed 16 mesh], and</li><li>No more than 1% of material is permitted to fall onto the pan.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0112">According to bulk density, proppant is divided into: low-density, medium density, high-density. According to the anti-crushing strength, proppant is divided into 52 Mpa, 69 Mpa, 86 Mpa and 103 Mpa four series. Specifications of proppant sand are generally: 12-18 mesh, 12-20 mesh, 16-20 mesh, 16-30 mesh, 20-40 mesh between 30-50 mesh, 40-60 mesh, 40-70 mesh and smaller. The proppants to be coated preferably have an average particle size within the range from about 50 μm and about 3000 μm, and more preferably within the range from about 100 μm to about 2000 μm.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Coating Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0113">The method for the production of coated proppants according to the present invention can be implemented without the use of solvents. Accordingly, the mixture obtained in step (a) in one embodiment of the method is solvent-free, or is essentially solvent-free. The mixture is essentially solvent-free, if it contains less than 20 wt %, preferably less than 10 wt %, more preferably less than 5 wt %, and still more preferably less than 3 wt %, and most preferably less than 1 wt % of solvent, relative to the total mass of components of the mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0114">Preferably, the method is implemented without the use of organic solvents. In this case, the mixture obtained in step (a) is free of organic solvents, or is essentially free of organic solvents. The mixture is essentially free of organic solvents, if it contains less than 20 wt %, preferably less than 10 wt %, more preferably less than 3 wt %, and still more preferably less than 3 wt %, and most preferably less than 1 wt % of solvent, relative to the total mass of components of the mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0115">In step (a) the proppant is preferably heated to an elevated temperature and then contacted with the coating components. Preferably, the proppant is heated to a temperature within the range of about 50° C. to about 150° C. to accelerate crosslinking reactions in the applied coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">The temperature of the coating process is not particularly restricted outside of practical concerns for safety and component integrity. The preferred conditions for the coating/curing step of the present invention are generally at conditions within the range of about 50° to about 175° C., more preferably at a temperature within the range from about 75° C. to about 150° C., and most preferably at a temperature within the range from about 80° C. to about 135° C. This temperature avoids a number of emissions issues, reduces the amount of energy consumed in the coating process and also reduces the cooling time for the coated proppants for further handling and packaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">The mixer used for the coating process is not particularly restricted and can be selected from among the mixers known in the specific field. For example, a pug mill mixer, agitation mixer, drum mixer, plate-type mixer, tubular mixer, trough mixer or conical mixer can be used. The easiest way is mixing in a rotating drum. As continuous mixer, a worm gear can, for example, be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">Mixing can be carried out on a continuous or discontinuous basis. In suitable mixers it is possible, for example, to add adhesion agents, isocyanate, amine and optional ingredients continuously to the heated proppants. For example, isocyanate components, amine reactant and optional additives can be mixed with the proppant solids in a continuous mixer (such as a worm gear) in one or more steps to make one or more layers of cured coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">Preferably, the proppant, isocyanate component, curing agent, amine reactant, polyol, and optional additives are mixed homogeneously. Thus, the isocyanate component and amine reactant are distributed uniformly on the surface of the proppants. The coating ingredients are preferably kept in motion throughout the entire mixing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">It is also possible to arrange several mixers in parallel, series, or serially in several runs in one mixer.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">Importantly, the time, temperature, chemistry and reaction rate of the coating/curing process are combined to substantially completely react all of the —NGO groups within the applied proppant coating by the time the product is discharged as a free-flowing solid. Preferably, the proppant coating is cured to an amount less than about 10 wt % of reactive —NCO groups, more preferably less than about 5 wt % and even more preferably less than about 2 wt % of reactive —NCO groups remain, based on the originally applied weight of the proppant coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">The coating is preferably performed at the same time as the curing of the coating on the proppant. In the present invention, the coated proppant becomes free-flowing at a time of less than 5 minutes, preferably within the range of 1-4 minutes, more preferably within the range of 1-3 minutes, and most preferably within the range of 1-2.5 minutes to form a coated, substantially cured, free-flowing, coated proppant. This short cycle time combines with the relatively moderate coating temperatures to form a coating/curing process that provides lower energy costs, smaller equipment, reduced emissions from the process and the associated scrubbing equipment, and overall increased production for the coating facility.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">The coating material may be applied in more than one layer. In this case, the coating process is repeated as necessary (e.g. 1-5 times, 2-4 times or 2-3 times) to obtain the desired coating thickness. In this manner, the thickness of the coating of the proppant can be adjusted and used as either a relatively narrow range of proppant size or blended with proppants of other sizes, such as those with more or less numbers of coating layers of polyurethane according to the present invention, so as to form a proppant blend have more than one range of size distribution. A typical size range for coated proppant is typically within the range of about 16-100 mesh.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">The amount of coating resin, that is, of the polyurethane resin applied to a proppant, is preferably between about 0.5 and about 10 wt %, more preferably between about 1% and about 5 wt %, resin relative to the mass of the proppant as 100 wt %. With the method according to the present invention proppants can be coated at temperatures between about 10° C. and about 150° C. and preferably in a solvent-free rnanner. The coating process requires a comparatively little equipment and if necessary can also be carried out near the sand or ceramic substrate source, near the geographically location of the producing field or at/near the well itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">The coated proppants can additionally be treated with surtace-active agents or auxiliaries, such as talcum powder or stearate or other processing aids, to improve pourability.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0126">If desired, the coated proppants can be baked or heated for a period of time sufficient to further react at least substantially all of the available isocyanate, hydroxyl and reactive amine groups that might remain in the coated proppant. Such a post-coating cure may occur even if additional contact time with a catalyst is used after a first coating layer or between layers. Typically, the post-coating cure step is performed like a baking step at a temperature within the range from about 100°-200° C. for a time of about 30 minutes to 4 hours, preferably the temperature is about 125°-175° C. for 5-30 minutes.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0127">Even more preferably, the coated proppant is cured for a time and under conditions sufficient to produce a coated proppant that exhibits a loss of coating of less than 25 wt %, preferably less than 15 wt %, and even more preferably less than 5 wt % when tested according to simulated downhole conditions under ISO 13503-5:2006(E). Even more preferably, the coated proppant exhibits the low dust and handling characteristics of a precured proppant (see API RP 60) but also exhibits a crush test result at 10,000 psi of less than 2%, more preferably less than 1.5%, and especially less than 1%. The coated proppants of the invention preferably also have an unconfined compressive strength of greater than 100 psi and more preferably more than 500 psi with a fracture conductivity at 4000 psi that is equal to, or greater than, the conductivity of a phenolic coating at the same weight percent of coating.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Using the Coated Proppants</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0128">The invention also includes the use of the coated proppants in conjunction with a fracturing liquid to increase the production of petroleum or natural gas. Techniques for fracturing an unconsolidated formation that include injection of consolidating fluids are also well known in the art. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,732,800 the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Generally speaking, a fluid is injected through the wellbore into the formation at a pressure less than the fracturing pressure of the formation. The volume of consolidating fluid to be injected into the formation is a function of the formation pore volume to be treated and the ability of the consolidating fluid to penetrate the formation and can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. As a guideline, the formation volume to be treated relates to the height of the desired treated zone and the desired depth of penetration, and the depth of penetration is preferably at least about 30 cm radially into the formation. Please note that since the consolidation fluid is injected through the perforations, the treated zone actually stems from the aligned perforations.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0129">Before consolidating the formation, according to a preferred embodiment, an acid treatment is performed by injection of an acidic fluid. As it is well known in the art, this acidic treatment typically includes several stages such as an acid preflush, one or more stages of acid injection and an overflush.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0130">After the perforation and the consolidation, the final step is the fracturing step. Although a resin treatment alone may have been sufficient in preventing early sand production the resin reduces the permeability of the formation around the wellbore. The primary purpose of the fracture treatment is to connect the wellbore to the formation and in doing so by pass any damage and act as a filter allowing the production of hydrocarbons while holding back formation material. The high surface area associated with a fracture makes it a very effective filter, for example, a 13.7 m fracture length with 25 cm height has a surface area of 368 m<sup>2</sup>, compared to the open hole flow area for a gravel pack of 3.2 m<sup>2 </sup>with the same zone height.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0131">Techniques for hydraulically fracturing a subterranean formation will be known to persons of ordinary skill in the art, and will involve pumping the fracturing fluid into the borehole and out into the surrounding formation. The fluid pressure is above the minimum in situ rock stress, thus creating or extending fractures in the formation. In order to maintain the fractures formed in the formation after the release of the fluid pressure, the fracturing fluid carries a proppant whose purpose is to prevent the fracturing from closing after pumping has been completed.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0132">The fracturing liquid is not particularly restricted and can be selected from among the frac liquids known in the specific field. Suitable fracturing liquids are described, for example, in W C Lyons, G J Plisga, <i>Standard Handbook Of Petroleum And Natural Gas Engineering</i>, Gulf Professional Publishing (2005). The fracturing liquid can be, for example, water gelled with polymers, an oil-in-water emulsion gelled with polymers, or a water-in-oil emulsion gelled with polymers. In one preferred embodiment, the fracturing liquid comprises the following constituents in the indicated proportions: 1000 l water, 20 kg potassium chloride, 0.120 kg sodium acetate, 3.6 kg guar gum (water-soluble polymer), sodium hydroxide (as needed) to adjust a pH-value from 9 to 11, 0.120 kg sodium thiosulfate, and 0.180 kg ammonium persulfate.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0133">In addition, the invention relates to a method for the production of petroleum or natural gas which comprises the injection of the coated proppant into the fractured stratum with the fracturing liquid, i.e., the injection of a fracturing liquid which contains the coated proppant, into a petroleum- or natural gas-bearing rock layer, and/or its introduction into a fracture in the rock layer bearing petroleum or natural gas. The method is not particularly restricted and can be implemented in the manner known in the specific field.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0134">Suitable proppants include, but are not limited to, sand, bauxite, glass beads, and ceramic beads and resin-coated sand versions of each. The proppant will typically exhibit a size within the range from about 8 to about 100 U.S. Standard Mesh in size. Mixtures of suitable proppants can be used. The concentration of proppant in the fracturing fluid can be any concentration known in the art, and will typically be in the range of about 0.5 to about 20 pounds of proppant added per gallon of clean fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0135">The fracturing fluid can contain an added proppant-retention agent, e.g. a fibrous material, a curable resin coated on the proppant, platelets, deformable particles, or a sticky proppant coating to trap proppant particles in the fracture and prevent their production through the wellbore. Fibers, in concentration that preferably ranges front about 0.1% to about 5.0% by weight of proppant, for example selected from natural organic fibers, synthetic organic fibers, glass fibers, carbon fibers, ceramic fibers, inorganic fibers, metal fibers and mixtures thereof, in combination with curable resin-coated proppants are particularly preferred. The proppant-retention agent is intended to keep proppant solids in the fracture, and the proppant and proppant-retention agent keep formation particles from being produced.</p>

      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0136">Conductivity testing was performed at simulated downhole conditions using the method and procedures found in ISO 13503-5:2006. In such tests, a closure stress is applied across a test unit for 50 hours to allow the proppant sample bed to reach a semi-steady state condition. As the fluid is forced through the proppant bed, the pack width, differential pressure, temperature and flow rates are measured at each stress. Proppant pack permeability and conductivity are then calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0137">Multiple flow rates are used to verify the performance of the transducers, and to determine Darcy flow regime at each stress; an average of the data at these flow rates is reported. The test fluid is potassium chloride substitute solution filtered to 3 μm absolute. The initial conductivity, permeability and width is measured and compared to the final conductivity, permeability and width after each stress period. Stress is applied and maintained using an Isco 260D. Stress is applied at 100 psi/minute.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">Width of the proppant pack is determined by assembling the conductivity cell with the Ohio sandstone wafers and shims without the sample proppants. The distance between the width bars that are attached to each end of the conductivity cells are measured at each of the four corners and recorded. The cells are then assembled with the proppant samples. The measurements are made again at the beginning and ending of each stress period. Width is determined by subtracting the average of the zero from the average of each of the stress width values. Conductivity is calculated using Darcy's equation.</p>

      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0145">Sieve analysis is performed using the procedure found in ISO 13503-2 “Measurements of proppants used in hydraulic fracturing and gravel pack operations” Standard US mesh screens are used to separate the sample by size. Not more than 0.1% should be greater than the first specified sieve and not more than 1% should be retained in the pan. There should be at least 90% retained in the specified screens.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0146">To determine the magnitude of coating loss during the conductivity test, samples of the proppant pack are taken, dried in an oven, and weighed. They are then subjected to a temperature of 96° C. for 2.5 hours. At the end of this period the samples are cooled and weighed again. The difference between the sample weight after drying but before being subjected to the furnace compared to the sample weight after the time in the furnace, equates to the coating weight. Comparing this number to the same test performed on a sample of the coated material before being subjected to the conductivity test, will equate to the coating weight lost due to the long term exposure to the conditions of the conductivity tests.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0147">The procedure used in an autoclave test would be as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0148">The autoclave test utilizes what amounts to a pressure cooker to subject the coated sands to a hot wet environment that is above the boiling temperature of water. Approximately 20 g of sample is placed in a jar along with 150 ml of distilled water. The lids are placed on sample jars but not tightened. The samples are placed in the autoclave and the chamber is sealed. Heat is applied until the autoclave temperature reaches 250-265° F. (121°-129° C.). The samples are maintained under these conditions for the ten day period. At the end of the test period the autoclave is cooled down, opened and the sample jars removed. Each sample is washed with distilled water and then placed in an oven to dry. The dried samples are then put through a standard test for determination of coating loss. This result is compared to the results of a coating test that was run on the original sample. The difference in coating weight before and after the autoclave test, quantifies the amount of coating that was dissolved by the exposure to a hot water environment.</p>

      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0150">In this and the other examples presented herein, it was noticed that the JEFFCAT TR90 catalyst increased the reaction rate sufficiently that the amperage on the associated mixer was not exceeded as the coating reactants were metered into the proppant solids in the moving mixer. This suggests that the coating became cured at a rate that was consistent with the feed rate so that the liquid viscosity did not increase the electrical load on the mixer. This same method of controlled, metered addition would also apply for other formulations and chemistries under the present invention in order to keep the contents reacting at a rate that does not tax the load on the mixing equipment.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0151">The resin coated sand from the example above tested at 2.75% coating loss from the mixer. When subjected to a three day 250° F. autoclave test, the coating loss was measured again at 2.34% reflecting the good resistance to hot water removal of the coating.</p>

The graph in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the TMA results for (a) Precured phenolic coated sand, (b) New Technology coated sand using the formulation of Example 1, (c) a partially cured, phenolic-coated sand (also identified as Phenolic A) and (d) a somewhat more curable, phenolic-coated sand (also identified as Phenolic B)</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0161">The ThermoMechanical Analyzer (TMA) as supplied by TA Instruments is a device that accurately imposes a small force (i.e., a load) onto a sample which is then subjected to a desired temperature over a defined time. During this increasing temperature period, the force is held constant. The probe which imposes the force is connected to a sophisticated micrometer that is capable of measuring fractions of a micron change in the position of the probe. Any change in the position of the probe can be interpreted to reflect an expansion or contraction of the sample that is brought about by the temperature change(s). In many applications, the sample merely expands as it is being heated (for instance raw sand) thereby creating a database that refers to the coefficient of themral expansion. The TMA has the ability to run the samples in a variety of environments.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0162">In general, a precured, phenolic-coated sand will be characterized by a plot that is essential flat (parallel to the X axis) or has a positive slope. This response is indicative of a coating that is essentially reacted in which there is little to no remaining reactivity that remains in the coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0163">If, however, a more curable or partially cured phenolic coating is tested, the TMA plot will exhibit a negative slope as early as 80° C. to 100° C., but more often after about 125° C. to about 175° C. This type of plot is characteristic of a coating that has retained a level of reactivity even after completing the manufacturing process. The more negative the slope and the lower the temperature in which the slope turns negative, the more reactivity that has been left in the coating.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0164">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the top curve is labeled “Precured” and is indicative of the response of a phenolic coating that is no longer reactive. The two lower curves are labeled “Partially Cured Phenolic A” and “More Curable Phenolic B.” These curves represent the TMA results from two levels of partially cured coatings. The second curve labeled “New Technology” shows a response that is similar to the precured coating curve but actually shows properties that fall between a precured coating and the less reactive partially cured coating. The shape of the New Technology curve indicates that the New Technology coating would exhibit some properties that are similar to a precured coating and others that may be similar to the partially cured coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0165">The plot of “Crush Results” in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the comparable strength of sand coated with precured phenolic coating, two partially cured coatings (labeled A and B) and the New technology coating. Historically, the precured phenolic coated sand would show a lower crush percentage (in the ISO test procedure) than partially cured coated sand. These crush test results follow this trend with the precured coating sand having a crush of 2.05% and the two partially coatings (Phenolic coatings A and B) having crushes of 3.93% and 4.95% respectively. It is important to notice that the coating having the more remaining reactivity (Phenolic B) has the highest crush value. The New Technology coating actually tested out having the lowest crush value (0.69%). So in the crush evaluation The New Technology coating performed like a superior, precured coated sand.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0166">The plot entitled “Unconfined Compressive Strength” in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> represents a strength measurement of the particle to particle bonds of a coated sand. Historically, a precured coated phenolic sand possess little if any ability to form particle to particle bonds of any measureable strength. In this test the coating labeled Phenolic A exhibited a bond strength UCS of 449 psi. The coating labeled Phenolic B had a UCS of 155 psi. Since the TMA indicated that Phenolic B was a more reactive coating than Phenolic A, one would expect that the UCS results should be reversed. That would be true if the coated sands had the same resin level (LOI). However the plot entitled “Coated Sand Loss On Ignition” in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, shows that Phenolic A actually has a 3.97% phenolic coating while phenolic coating B has a 2.84% resin coating. This could be one explanation for the unexpected UCS results.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0167">In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the precured phenolic coating sand showed only a weak bonding capability with a measurement of 7 psi. This level of bonding would indicate that the precured phenolic coating is not capable of forming particle-to-particle bonds that would consolidate the proppant or be effective in controlling proppant flowback.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0168">The New Technology coating exhibited the TMA appearance of a precured coated sand in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, it yielded the highest bond strength (UCS=576 psi) of any sample tested. See <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. These dual results are new and unexpected for a coated proppant.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0169">The plot entitled “Fracture Conductivity @ 4000 psi” in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> reveals a data point from a long term conductivity test. Presented on the plot are the conductivity numbers for the two partially cured phenolic coated sands and a sand coated with the New Technology. Historically, the conductivity test results for a partially cure phenolic coating will meet or exceed that of a precured coating. The plot shows that the New Technology coating has a conductivity similar to the partially cured coating of Phenolic A and superior to partially cured coating of Phenolic B. This is in spite of the fact the Phenolic A has a significantly higher coating level than the New technology and Phenolic B is marginally higher than the New Technology coating (see <figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0170">In summary, The New Technology coated sand exhibits the TMA of a precured phenolic coated sand and crush resistance superior to a precured phenolic coating. It also shows a bonding capability superior to the partially cured phenolic coated sand and a comparable if not superior fracture conductivity (when measured at 4,000 psi in a long term conductivity test). This would seem to indicate that the new technology contains traits and performance properties from both type coating and would best be described as a “hybrid” coating technology.</p>

The invention, therefore, is not to be restricted except in the spirit of the appended claims.</p>
