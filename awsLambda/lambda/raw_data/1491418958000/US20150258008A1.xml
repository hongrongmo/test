      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to in-situ compatibilizers/emulsifiers for incompatible cosmetic formulations, i.e. emulsions, colloids, etc., which comprise immiscible polymers having complementary reactive groups that interact at the interface of the incompatible cosmetic compositions to stabilize the cosmetic compositions.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many cosmetics and personal care products, such as concealers, creams, lotions, and mascaras, are emulsions. Emulsions are a mixture of two or more immiscible liquids, such as water/oil or oil/silicone. These emulsions provide a means of dispersing a cosmetic agent, which may be lypophilic, within water or silicone which have a more appealing feel than oils. Although beneficial for administration, emulsions are typically difficult to formulate because of the demands on cosmetic products. In order to be commercially viable the emulsion must exhibit sufficient stability to survive shipping and storage environments. For example, cosmetics are often shipped under conditions where they are exposed to temperatures that are higher and lower than standard room temperature (72Â° F.). Products must be stable at these temperature extremes so that they can be delivered to the customer in a form that is suitable for commercial sale. In addition, commercially acceptable cosmetics must also be shelf stable, such that they do not exhibit an inordinate degree of separation when stored for long periods of time, typically one, two to three years, and even longer in some instances. The tendency of the immiscible liquids to separate out of the emulsion and coalesce frustrates these goals.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Stabilizers/emulsifiers and/or particles may be used to stabilize the emulsion. Stabilizers/emulsions tend to be amphiphilic, i.e., possessing both polar (hydrophilic) and non-polar (lypophilic) domains. The amphiphilic ingredient facilitates compatibility between two phases that may not otherwise be compatible to form a composition that is internally stable. Typically, the dispersed phase is stabilized within the continuous phase when the emulsifier/surfactant coats the interface between the dispersed and continuous phases to reduce the surface tension.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, several problems exist with emulsifiers. Since the emulsion is stabilized by the interfacial adsorption of the surfactants (emulsifiers), the emulsion destabilizes if the emulsifiers de-adsorb from the interface or get lost in micelles before arriving at the interface. To address these complications, emulsifiers and/or particles are often added in excess to ensure they arrive at the interface. However this is less than an ideal solution given that the cost of compatibilizing agents is often high; they can be difficult to formulate; compositions containing them are sometimes prone to premature separation, and when used in high concentrations they can be somewhat irritating for consumers having sensitive skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">WO2009139884A1 to Hein et al. outlines reacting natural butters (and other naturally occurring triglycerides) with glycerol, in the presence of a basic catalyst, during mixing to promote compatibility between lipid and water phases. The patent application does not claim any reactive polymeric materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">WO 2010068891 to Bui et al. discloses a self-emulsifying mascara composition, in which the self-emulsification results in rheological properties which improve the lengthening properties of the cosmetic formula. The self-emulsification occurs within an aqueous formulation and involves functional polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Accordingly, there is still a need for a method of stabilizing incompatible cosmetic compositions for extended periods without the drawbacks associated with conventional emulsifiers.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The foregoing discussion is presented solely to provide a better understanding of the nature of the problems confronting the art and should not be construed in any way as an admission as to prior art nor should the citation of any reference herein be construed as an admission that such reference constitutes âprior artâ to the instant application.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In accordance with the foregoing objectives and others, it has surprisingly been found that a stable emulsion composition can be obtained by providing a compatibilizer at the interface of the emulsion phases.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one aspect of the invention, emulsion compositions are provided with enhanced stability, the compositions comprising a first phase, a second phase, and a compatibilizer that is the reaction product of a first functional polymer dispersible in the first phase and a second functional polymer dispersible in the second phase, the compatibilizer having at least one complementary reactive group pairing obtained by reacting the functional group of the first polymer and the functional group of the second polymer. Preferably, the complementary reactive group pairing is selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid/amine, carboxylic acid/oxazoline, carboxylic acid/epoxy, amine/epoxy, amine/cyclic anhydride, amine/isocyanate, hydroxyl/cyclic anhydride, hydroxyl/carboxylic acid, and combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In another aspect of the invention, the compatibilizer is formed interfacially between the continuous phase and disperse phases upon admixing of the first and second phases each containing their respective dispersible functional polymers to effect compatibilizer formation by in-situ reaction of the polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The at least one polymer dispersed in the first phase and the at least one polymer dispersed in the second phase, each polymer having at least one reactive functional group component adapted to form the at least one complementary reactive group pairing. Suitable reactive functional groups for each dispersible polymer may be selected either from (i) a first group consisting of an amine, a carboxylic acid, or a hydroxyl group, or from (ii) a second group consisting of an amine, a carboxylic acid, a cyclic anhydride, an epoxy, an isocyanate, an oxazoline, or a silicone hydride group, the selected reactive first and second functional group each being adapted to form said complementary reactive group pairing. Each polymer may contain two or more different reactive groups for that polymer, and the compatibilizer thus obtained may comprise two or more of the recited group pairings.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In a further embodiment, the emulsion composition is selected from emulsions consisting of oil-in-silicone, silicone-in-oil, oil-in-oil, fluoropolymer-in-oils, oil-in-fluoropolymer, fluoropolymer-in-silicone, or silicone-in-fluoropolymer emulsion. These compositions comprise a disperse phase stably dispersed in a continuous phase.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In a further aspect of the invention, the dispersible polymers, i.e., the first phase dispersible polymer or the second phase dispersible polymers are natural or synthetic polymers. In a further embodiment, the natural polymers are selected from chitin, chitosan, polysaccharides, and combinations thereof, and in a further embodiment the synthetic polymers are selected from polyolefins, polyether, polyesters, polysiloxanes, polyamides, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyphosphazenes, polyvinylpyrolidones, and combinations thereof. The functional groups attached to these dispersible polymers are pendant to, endcapped on, or are within the backbone chain of the dispersible polymers.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In a preferred aspect of the invention, the complementary reactive group pairing of the current invention is amine/cyclic anhydride. In a further aspect of the invention, the interface reaction occurs at a temperature range from about 20Â° C. to about 100Â° C., and in further embodiments at a pH of 1 to 14, preferably about a pH of about 3.5 to about 9.5. In a further embodiment, the interface reaction occurs in about one minute to about one hour after the continuous phase dispersible polymer and the disperse phase dispersible polymer are blended and preferably in about one minute to about ten minutes. The interface reaction also preferably does not produce a leaving group. Further, the interface reaction may occur before formulation of the cosmetic composition upon blending of the immiscible polymers or upon sequential application of the immiscible polymers to an integument in order to form a stabilized bi-layer in-situ.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In a further aspect, the emulsion compositions are useful in the cosmetic field for topical application to human integument, e.g., skin, lips, hair, nails, etc., and may be further comprise colorants, pigments, emollients, skin-benefit agents, botanical extracts, rheology modifiers, film formers, aesthetic modifiers, other emulsifiers, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Further aspects of the invention are directed to double emulsions wherein the non-aqueous emulsion of the present invention is further emulsified with a hydrous phase to form a double emulsion selected from the group consisting of silicone-in-oil-in water, oil-in-silicone-in-water, fluoropolymer-in-silicone-in-water, silicone-in-fluoropolymer-in-water, fluoropolymer-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-fluoropolymer-in-water.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The current invention is further directed to a method for producing emulsion compositions having long term stability comprising the steps of providing a first phase having at least one functional polymer dispersed therein, the polymer having at least one reactive functional group that is one member of a complementary reactive pair; providing a second phase having at least one functional polymer dispersed therein, the polymer having at least one reactive functional group that is a different member of the complementary reactive pair, and forming a compatibilizer at the interface of the first phase and the second phase by admixing the first phase and the second phase to initiate a reaction between the dispersed polymers at the interface.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In still a further aspect, the invention is directed to a kit comprising a composition of claim <b>1</b>. In a further embodiment of the kit the continuous phase containing the continuous phase polymer and the disperse phase containing the disperse phase polymer are separate components in the kit. In a further embodiment of the method of the present invention the phases are conjoined, for example by applying the first phase as a bottom coat and the second layer as a top coat on the integument, with the reaction occurring at the interface of the layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">These and other aspects of the present invention will be better understood by reference to the following detailed description and accompanying figures.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/294,562, Attorney Docket No. CR135AU-US, titled âCosmetic Compositions Of Reactively Blended Copolymers,â filed contemporaneously herewith on Nov. 11, 2011, is incorporated herein by reference in entirety</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">All terms used herein are intended to have their ordinary meaning unless otherwise provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">As used herein, the term âconsisting essentially ofâ is intended to limit the invention to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed invention, as understood from a reading of this specification. The term âcompatibilizerâ means the reaction product of the dispersible polymers of the present invention that are capable of providing stability to incompatible phases of a composition. The term âdispersibleâ as it relates to the functional polymers used to form the compatibilizer means that the polymer is compatible in and can be homogeneously incorporated within the phase in which it is provided. All percentages are by weight based on the total weight of the composition, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">This invention involves using a compatibilizer to stabilize emulsion compositions, including colloid compositions. In particular, the compatibilizer is the reaction product of a first functional polymer dispersible in the first phase and a second functional polymer dispersible in the second phase, the compatibilizer having at least one complementary reactive group pairing obtained by reacting the functional group of the first polymer and the functional group of the second polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The emulsion compositions comprise a first phase (hereinafter the continuous phase), a second phase (hereinafter the disperse phase), and the compatibilizer that is present in the emulsion composition substantially at the interface of the continuous and disperse phases. Preferably, the complementary reactive group pairing is selected from the group consisting of carboxylic acid/amine, carboxylic acid/oxazoline, carboxylic acid/epoxy, amine/epoxy, amine/cyclic anhydride, amine/isocyanate, hydroxyl/cyclic anhydride, hydroxyl/carboxylic acid, and combinations thereof. As used herein the terms first phase, continuous phase, second phase, and disperse phase also refer to the compositions of those phases, whether in emulsified form in the emulsion composition or in premix form prior to use in forming the compositions of the present invention. Accordingly, the disperse and continuous phases may be discrete compositions within a kit for forming the emulsion compositions or discrete compositions useful in the manufacture of the emulsion compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The at least one polymer dispersed in the continuous phase and the at least one polymer dispersed in the dispersed phase each have at least one reactive functional group component adapted to form the at least one complementary reactive group pairing. Suitable reactive functional groups for each dispersible polymer may be selected either from (i) a first group consisting of an amine, a carboxylic acid, or a hydroxyl group, or from (ii) a second group consisting of an amine, a carboxylic acid, a cyclic anhydride, an epoxy, an isocyanate, an oxazoline, or a silicone hydride group, the selected reactive first and second functional group each being adapted to form said complementary reactive group pairing.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In another aspect of the invention one of the functional polymers may comprise two or more of the same functional group. In yet another embodiment each functional polymer may comprise two or more of the same functional group. The incorporation of two (or more) functional groups in a polymer dispersed in one of the phases of the emulsion composition advantageously results in the formation of a partially mobile interface as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>. The incorporation of two (or more) functional groups in each polymer dispersed in its respective phase of the emulsion composition advantageously results in the formation of an immobile interface as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Most preferably, the compatibilizer is formed interfacially between the continuous phase and disperse phases upon admixing of the first and second phases each containing their respective dispersible functional polymers, especially in the case of a compatibilizer intended to form a partially mobile interface or an immobile interface, as noted above.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">While the compositions of the invention are especially useful in the cosmetic field, the use of the compatibilizers of the invention are readily seen to have utility in related applications, such as pharmaceutical preparations, dermatological formulations, wellness products, personal care products, and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">A. Emulsion Compositions</heading>

      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0053">The dispersible polymers may then be admixed to initiate the interfacial reaction that generates the in-situ compatibilizer. In some instances this reaction may occur prior to the addition of the polymers to an incompatible composition, but will most usually occur coextensively with the development of the composition, and may also occur sequentially during application to the integumentâi.e., one phase laid down on the integument followed by the second phase in order to form a networked or cross-linked bilayer in situ.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0054">These reactions may occur at temperatures ranging from 20Â° C. to 120Â° C., preferably about 20Â° C. to about 75Â° C., and most preferably about 20Â° C. to about 50Â° C.

      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0082">The effectiveness of the in-situ reactive emulsifier of the current invention was compared to commercially available emulsifiers in an incompatible cosmetic system of polyisobutene and dimethicone. Six emulsions were made using the formulations within Table 3 below. In particular, two positive controls, samples 2 and 3, were generated by adding Silwax CR 5016 and Silwax D02 (Siltech), alkylated silicones known to compatibilize silicone and oil compositions, to the silicone within samples 2 and 3, respectively, and blending at 80Â° C. for 10 minutes. Samples 4-5 are emulsions incorporating reactive polymers of the current invention, i.e. Marlene (Lion Copolymer, LLC.) an ethylene-propylene copolymer with 2% wt pendant maleic anhydride groups and AMS-132 (Gelest, Inc.) a linear polydimethylsiloxane with pendant amine groups, at a ratio 2:1 to 1:2, respectively. The maleic anhydride and amine groups are able to react with each other forming an in situ emulsifier. In each sample, the appropriate amount of AMS-132 was pre-added to the silicone phase and blended at 80Â° C. for 10 min, and the Marlene CP80-2 was pre-added to the polyisobutene phase and blended at 80Â° C. for 10 min. In each of the samples, the hot silicone phase was slowly added to the hot polyisobutene phase and vigorously blended for 20 minutes. All finished emulsions were placed in 40Â° F. (4.44Â° C.) and 110Â° F. (43.33Â° C.) stability for 4 weeks.</p>
