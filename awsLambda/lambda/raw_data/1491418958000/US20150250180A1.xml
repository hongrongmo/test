      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Unwanted plants, such as weeds, reduce the amount of resources available to crop plants and can have a negative effect on crop plant yield. Commonly unwanted plants in crop plant environments include broadleaf plants and grasses.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Herbicides are used to kill unwanted plants, such as weeds, in crop plant environments. Herbicides are expensive, and their use may result in unintentional consequences such as groundwater contamination, environmental damage, herbicide-resistant weeds, and human and mammalian health concerns. It is therefore desirable to minimize the amount of herbicides applied to a crop-growing environment or any area in need of weed control.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The herbicide saflufenacil, (Nâ²-[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-3,6-dihydro-1(2H)-pyrimidinyl)benzyl] -N-isopropyl-N-methylsulfamide), is the active ingredient in the commercially available herbicide SharpenÂ® (available from BASF Chemical Company). Saflufenacil has some activity on horseweed and some activity on grasses at high concentrations, such as concentrations of at least 0.022 lb ai/acre. However, high rates of saflufenacil may damage crop plants. In addition, SharpenÂ®'s product label cautions that the product should not be applied on soybeans with herbicides such as sulfentrazone or flumioxazin as a tank mix or as a sequential application within 30 days of planting because crop injury may result.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The herbicide flumioxazin, (2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-(2-propynyl)-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione), is the active ingredient in the commercially available herbicide ValorÂ® (available from Valent USA Corporation). ValorÂ® provides excellent broadleaf residual control of weeds such as <i>Palmer amaranth </i>and waterhemp. ValorÂ® is also an excellent pre-emergence herbicide. However, flumioxazin has limited control on large Horseweed (<i>Conyza Canadensis</i>) and on growing grasses. Flumioxazin is not used as a post-emergence herbicide.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Herbicides such as flumioxazin and saflufenacil are protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitors and use a membrane-disruption mechanism to destroy leaf tissue. PPO is an enzyme that naturally occurs in plants that is crucial to the formation of chlorophyll. When PPO inhibitors prevent PPO activity, singlet oxygen accumulates within plant cells and disrupts cell membranes.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The herbicide 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (â2,4-Dâ) is a synthetic auxin plant hormone. 2,4-D causes stem curl-over, leaf withering, and eventual plant death by increasing the plants' growth to an unsustainable rate. 2,4-D is used for the control of broadleaf weeds, however, 2,4-D has limited activity on small Horseweed and no activity on grasses.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Unwanted plants, such as weeds, may greatly reduce yields of crop plants. For example, a Horseweed infestation reportedly was responsible for an 80% reduction in soybean yields. Bruce, J. A., and J. J. Kells, Horseweed (<i>Conyza Canadensis</i>) control in no-tillage soybeans (<i>Glycine max</i>) with preplant and preemergernce herbcides, Weed Technol. 4:642-647 (1990). Therefore, controlling weeds, and especially grasses and Horseweed, is a major concern of crop growers.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Further, Horseweed and other grasses are becoming resistant to glyphosate. As early as 2000, glyphosate resistant Horseweed was reported in Delaware. Glyphosate resistant Horseweed has since been reported in numerous states. Accordingly, there is a need for new products that can provide effective kill rates of glyphosate resistant Horseweed.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">No-till farming has been increasing in popularity because it has many benefits, including decreased labor time and decreased soil erosion. However, one of the downsides of no-till farming is that weeds are harder to control in these areas because they are not subjected to tilling. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for alternative ways to handle weed infestation.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In summary, there is a need for a composition that reduces the amount of herbicides necessary to obtain sufficient weed control while minimizing the harm to crop plants. As more weeds become resistant to herbicides, alternative compositions with high weed control are desired. Further, as no-till farming continues to increase in popularity, there is a greater need for effective herbicides. A composition with effective weed control and lower dosage rate will lead to increased crop plant yields, and decreased environmental, human, and mammalian health concerns.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">It was surprisingly discovered that combining saflufenacil with flumioxazin and 2,4-D allowed for more effective Horseweed and grass control when compared to application of each of the individual components of the composition or any combination of two components. It was unexpected that the combination of saflufenacil with flumioxazin and 2,4-D would result in better kill rates than twice the amount of saflufenacil alone. The synergy of the combination of saflufenacil, flumioxazin, and 2,4-D was also unexpected.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In one embodiment, the invention is directed to agricultural compositions comprising an effective amount of saflufenacil, an effective amount of flumioxazin, and an effective amount of 2,4-D. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention contain a ratio of saflufenacil to flumioxazin from about 1:1.5 to about 1:6 and a ratio of saflufenacil to 2,4-D from about 1:11 to about 1:50.

      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Applicants' mixtures can be applied by any convenient means. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modes of application that include foliar applications such as spraying, chemigation (a process of applying the mixture through the irrigation system), by granular application, or by impregnating the mixture on fertilizer.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Applicants' mixtures can be prepared as concentrate formulations or as ready-to-use formulations.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The term âeffective amountâ means the amount of the formulation that will kill a weed. The âeffective amountâ will vary depending on the formulation concentration, the type of plants(s) being treated, the severity of the weed infestation, the result desired, and the life stage of the weeds during treatment, among other factors. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact âeffective amount.â However, an appropriate âeffective amountâ in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The herbicide mixtures of the present invention may be formulated to contain adjuvants, such as solvents, anti-caking agents, stabilizers, defoamers, slip agents, humectants, dispersants, wetting agents, thickening agents, emulsifiers, and preservatives which increase the long lasting activity of the actives. Other components that enhance the biological activity of these ingredients may optionally be included.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Methylated seed oil (âMSOâ) is an adjuvant that improves leaf cuticle penetration of an agricultural active, such as a plant growth regulator, fungicide or herbicide. MSO can be used in the mixtures of the present invention, but is not required or responsible for the synergy of the combination of saflufenacil, flumioxazin, and 2,4-D. Other oil based adjuvants with similar qualities could also be used, such as crop oil concentrates.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Mixtures of the present invention can be formulated to contain a liquid solvent. Examples of solvents include water or oil concentrates.</p>

      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The mixtures of the present invention can be applied to any environment in need of weed control. The environment in need of weed control may include any area that is desired to have a reduced number of weeds or to be free of weeds. For example, the herbicide combination can be applied to an area used to grow crop plants, such as a field, orchard, or vineyard. For example, Applicants' compositions and methods can be applied to areas where soybeans, corn, peanuts, and cotton are growing. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture is applied in an area where a broadleaf crop (soybean, cotton, peanut, orchard, vineyard, forages) is growing. The mixtures of the present invention can also be applied to non-agricultural areas in need of weed control such as a lawns, golf courses, or parks.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Applicants' compositions and methods can be applied successfully to crop plants and weeds that are resistant to glyphosate. The composition and methods can also be applied to areas where genetically modified crops (âGMOsâ) or non-GMO crops are growing. The term âGMO cropsâ as used herein refers to crops that are genetically modified.</p>

      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The following field test was conducted during spring in Mississippi. SharpenÂ® was used in the test as the source of saflufenacil. ValorÂ® was used in the test as the source of flumioxazin. Roundup Ready soybeans (Glycine max) were used in the test as the crop plant. All of the treatments contained MSO concentrate oil at 1% v/v.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">When the test began, the test plot had Horseweed that was 6 to 20 inches tall. Applications were administered at the concentrations as follows. Saflufenacil was administered at 0.011, 0.017 or 0.022 lb ai/acre (indicated in the table as âSâ followed by the amount). Flumioxazin was administered at 0.064 lb ai/acre, and 2,4-D was administered at 0.5 lb ai/acre throughout the experiment. Three days after the treatment (3 DAT), soybeans were planted across the front of the plot. On 7 DAT, another pass of soybeans was planted across the front of the plot with a 30 inch planter. Each test was</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">On 11 DAT, readings were taken to determine the survival of Horseweed and Crabgrass. On 12 DAT, readings were taken to determine the survival of Palmer Amaranth, Broadleaf Signalgrass, Common Barnyardgrass, Yellow Nutsedge, and Eclipta. Survival ratings were taken by counting the number of alive and dead plants at the time of the reading. The pytotoxicity of each treatment was also evaluated by examining the soybeans at 11 and 12 DAT. All data was analyzed using Bartlett's test and with p value of 0.5 for determining significance of the results. The results of this study can be seen below in âTable 1. The Effect of Saflufenacil, Flumioxazin and 2,4-D on Weeds.â</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">The results illustrate that a composition of saflufenacil, flumioxazin, and 2,4-D is synergistic as it allows for a lower application of saflufenacil while achieving effective kill rates. The combination of 0.011 lb ai/acre saflufenacil, 0.064 lb ai/acre flumioxazin, and 0.5 lb ai/acre 2,4-D had a better kill rate than saflufenacil alone, or saflufenacil with flumioxazin, saflufenacil with 2,4-D, or flumioxazin with 2,4-D.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">Further, the three component mixture treatments allowed for less total amount of herbicide to be applied to the area in need of weed control, by reducing the total rate required of any single or two-way mixture to obtain an equivalent amount of weed control.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">Applicants used the widely accepted fraction method for determining synergy. The fraction method involves not merely adding together the individual control percentages together, as that will often be greater than 100%. The fraction method involves taking the control as a decimal value (X), multiplying the 1 minus X values together, then taking the â1 minusâ value to get the calculated control as a decimal value. For example, if two products give 60% control, the additive or predicted value would be 84% and not 120%. See Rao, V. S., Principles of Weed Science, Second Edition, (2000) 351-352, and the illustrative example below.</p>
