      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an extractor cleaning machine <b>10</b> (hereinafter referred to simply as an âextractorâ). In the illustrated embodiment, the extractor <b>10</b> is an upright extractor operable to clean a surface, such as, for example, a floor. In some embodiments, the extractor <b>10</b> may be adapted to clean a variety of surfaces, such as carpets, hardwood floors, tiles, or the like. The extractor <b>10</b> distributes or sprays a cleaning fluid (e.g., water, detergent, or a mixture of water and detergent) onto the surface to clean the surface. The extractor <b>10</b> then draws the cleaning fluid and dirt off of the surface, leaving the surface relatively clean.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The illustrated extractor <b>10</b> includes a base <b>14</b> (other extractors such as non-upright-type extractors, might include a different type of base), a body <b>18</b> coupled to the base <b>14</b> and the body <b>18</b> including a handle <b>20</b>.

The apertures <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> provide communication through the tank tray <b>26</b> and may be configured and located as desired for the application, such as in various geometries such as rectangular, circular, square, etc. The tank inlet aperture <b>94</b> defines an axis <b>122</b> and provides fluid flow to the recovery tank <b>30</b> while the air passage aperture <b>90</b> receives air flow exhausting from the recovery tank <b>30</b>. Furthermore, fluid-sealing gaskets <b>126</b> are located on the top surface <b>82</b> adjacent the apertures <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> in generally the same geometric configuration as the apertures <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>. In alternative embodiments, the airflow entering the recovery tank or exhausting from the recovery tank may be routed in a path that does not pass through the tank tray.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The illustrated tank tray <b>26</b> further includes a wall <b>106</b> that provides a perimeter around at least a portion of the tank tray <b>26</b>. The wall <b>106</b> enables the recovery tank <b>30</b> to be easily received on the tank tray <b>26</b> when the recovery tank <b>30</b> is removed and attached to the tray <b>26</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, an auxiliary tool inlet <b>114</b> is located adjacent the wall <b>106</b> at the front of the tray <b>26</b> and defines an inlet axis <b>118</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In operation, the suction source <b>22</b> generates an airflow that is drawn through the suction nozzle <b>42</b>. If cleaning fluid from the supply tank assembly <b>38</b> was sprayed onto the surface, then the suction source <b>22</b> also draws at least a portion of the cleaning fluid from the surface through the suction nozzle <b>42</b>. The airflow and cleaning solution is drawn through the nozzle <b>42</b>, through the hose <b>96</b> and into the air duct <b>146</b> that is attached to the bottom surface <b>86</b> of the recovery tank <b>30</b>. The airflow and cleaning solution then travel through the aperture <b>94</b> in the illustrated embodiment, and travel into the recovery tank <b>30</b>. In the recovery tank <b>30</b> the dirty cleaning solution is separated from the airflow, and the airflow is discharged through the aperture <b>90</b> and eventually discharged to atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in the illustrated embodiment, the extractor includes the auxiliary tool inlet <b>114</b>, which provides a second suction opening, and an auxiliary cover <b>198</b>. The auxiliary cover <b>198</b> is rotatably coupled to the air duct <b>146</b>. In a closed position, the cover <b>198</b> blocks the inlet <b>114</b> to substantially prevent an airflow from being drawn through the inlet <b>114</b> by the suction source <b>22</b>. In an open position, the auxiliary cover <b>198</b> exposes the inlet <b>114</b> to allow for the auxiliary hose <b>78</b> to be inserted into inlet <b>114</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). The auxiliary hose <b>78</b> can then be used with various hand tools to clean other surfaces, such as upholstery, stairs, etc. When the auxiliary hose <b>78</b> is inserted into inlet <b>114</b>, the auxiliary hose <b>78</b> blocks a suction nozzle inlet <b>174</b> of the duct <b>146</b>. Therefore, when the auxiliary hose <b>78</b> is received in the inlet <b>114</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the suction source <b>22</b> generally does not draw an airflow through the suction nozzle <b>42</b>.</p>
