      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">In an aeroponic system, plants may be grown in air without the use of soil or other media by providing a nutrient mist to the plants. Plants grown using an aeroponic system may benefit from greater exposure of the root system to oxygen, relative to soil based growing systems. Increased aeration of the nutrient solution may allow for more oxygen to reach the roots and may also prevent pathogen formation, leading to higher quality and quantity yields.</p>

      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">This disclosure is generally drawn, inter alia, to methods, apparatus, systems and devices, related to a misting device.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Briefly stated, technologies are generally described for systems, devices and methods effective to implement misting devices. In various examples, the misting devices may include a nutrient solution in a basin. In some other examples, the misting devices may further include a motor. In still other examples, the misting devices may include a misting apparatus connected to the motor. The misting apparatus may have an external surface at least partially submerged in the nutrient solution. In some examples, the motor and misting apparatus may be arranged such that when the motor spins the misting apparatus the nutrient solution adheres to the external surface. The nutrient solution may be atomized into a mist and the mist may be propelled toward roots of a plant.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> that can be utilized to implement a misting device arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. System <b>100</b> may include a basin <b>104</b>, a nutrient solution <b>102</b>, a misting apparatus <b>106</b>, a motor <b>112</b>, an enclosure <b>118</b>, and a light source <b>122</b>. Basin <b>104</b> may be a container or other reservoir and may be at least partially filled with nutrient solution <b>102</b>. Nutrient solution <b>102</b> may be a water-based solution including dissolved organic and/or inorganic molecules. Nutrient solution <b>102</b> may be adapted to provide nutrition to plants <b>120</b> when absorbed by root system <b>130</b> of plants <b>120</b>. Light source <b>122</b> may provide light to plants <b>120</b> such that photosynthesis may occur. Some examples of light source <b>122</b> may include one or more grow lamps and/or the sun.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be an object configured to spin around an axis. In some examples, misting apparatus <b>106</b> may have a cross-section that is circular, elliptical, oblong, a polygon, and/or another shape. As will be further discussed below, misting apparatus <b>106</b> may include paddles, fringes and/or other textured features. Misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be at least partially submerged in nutrient solution <b>102</b>. In some examples, an inner rim <b>132</b> of misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be made of plastic, rubber, metal, composite fiber and/or other materials. For example, inner rim <b>132</b> of misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be made from materials which are resistant to rust and/or corrosion. An external surface <b>108</b> of misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be made of a different material from inner rim <b>132</b>. In an example, surface <b>108</b> may be made from a material to promote adhesion or dispersion of nutrient solution <b>102</b>. In a further example, surface <b>108</b> may be comprised of hydrophilic or hydrophobic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be spun via the spinning of axle <b>110</b>. Axle <b>110</b> may be connected to and spun around an axis by a motor <b>112</b>. In some examples, axle <b>110</b> may be made of plastic, metal and/or composite fiber. Axle <b>110</b> may be resistant to corrosion and/or rust. In some examples, motor <b>112</b> may be an electric motor, a combustion motor and/or another type of motor. In an example, motor <b>112</b> may be configured in communication with a processor <b>124</b> and a memory <b>128</b>. Processor <b>124</b> may execute one or more instructions stored in memory <b>128</b>. In an example, processor <b>124</b> may execute instructions configured to operate motor <b>112</b> to spin misting apparatus <b>106</b> at a defined speed for a defined duration, beginning at a defined time. For example, processor <b>124</b> may execute instructions configured to spin misting apparatus at a speed of X km/hr, beginning at 3:00 PM and ending at 4:00 PM, each day.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be spun at a speed sufficient to produce a nutrient mist <b>116</b> with a droplet size from about 5-50 Î¼m. For example, misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be adapted to spin through nutrient solution <b>102</b>. In some examples, misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be adapted to be at least partially submerged in nutrient solution <b>102</b>. Misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be submerged from the bottom surface of misting apparatus <b>106</b> up to axle <b>110</b>. The level of submersion of misting apparatus <b>106</b> may be adjustable. In an example, the degree of submersion of misting apparatus <b>106</b> may affect a droplet size of nutrient mist <b>116</b>. In another example, a hose <b>140</b> may be configured to drip, spray, and/or direct nutrient solution <b>102</b> onto surface <b>108</b> of misting apparatus <b>106</b>. In an example, nutrient solution <b>102</b> may be pumped through hose <b>140</b> from basin <b>104</b> or from another container.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Because of spinning of motor <b>112</b> and features of surface <b>108</b>, nutrient solution <b>102</b> may adhere to surface <b>108</b> of misting apparatus <b>106</b>. Surface <b>108</b> may be include a tread. For example, a tread <b>140</b> of surface <b>108</b> may include features such as one or more channels, grooves, flanges, frayed panels, bumps or other textured features. In some examples, tread <b>140</b> may increase the adhesion of nutrient solution <b>102</b>. In other examples, tread <b>140</b> may be adapted to increase an amount of nutrient solution <b>102</b> which is propelled away from surface <b>108</b>. Nutrient solution <b>102</b> that has adhered to surface <b>108</b> may be propelled away from surface <b>108</b> as misting apparatus <b>106</b> is spun. Centrifugal force produced by spinning misting apparatus <b>106</b> may atomize nutrient solution <b>102</b> to produce nutrient mist <b>116</b>. Nutrient mist <b>116</b> may be propelled away from spinning misting apparatus <b>106</b> as centrifugal force overcomes adhesive/cohesive forces of the nutrient solution on surface <b>108</b>. Nutrient mist <b>116</b> may be propelled away from misting apparatus <b>106</b> as misting apparatus <b>106</b> is spun. Nutrient mist <b>116</b> may be contained by enclosure <b>118</b>. Enclosure <b>118</b> may be effective to expose root system <b>130</b> of plants <b>120</b> to nutrient mist <b>116</b>. Roots of root system <b>130</b> may be coated by nutrient mist <b>116</b> and may absorb nutrients and water from nutrient mist <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another example misting system, including two misting apparatuses, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> includes elements in system <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, with additional details. Those components in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> that are labeled identically to components of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> will not be described again for the purposes of clarity and brevity.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Enclosure <b>118</b> may include two misting apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>206</b> with respective surfaces <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>. At least one of misting apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>206</b> may be at least partially submerged in nutrient solution <b>102</b>. Misting apparatus <b>206</b> may be spun via axle <b>110</b>. Axle <b>110</b> may be spun by motor <b>112</b>. Friction between surfaces <b>210</b> and <b>208</b> may cause misting apparatus <b>202</b> to spin while motor <b>112</b> is spinning misting apparatus <b>206</b>. Misting apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>206</b> may spin along parallel axes. Although depicted in a vertical orientation in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, misting apparatuses <b>202</b> and <b>206</b> may be oriented horizontally or at some angle relative to the bottom of basin <b>104</b>. Additionally, more than two misting apparatuses may be used to produce nutrient mist <b>116</b>. In another example, two or more misting apparatuses may be connected by a belt <b>220</b> such that nutrient mist <b>116</b> is propelled away from a surface of belt <b>220</b>. Belt <b>220</b> may include a tread, such as one or more channels, grooves, flanges, frayed panels, bumps or other textured features.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Misting apparatus <b>206</b> may spin through nutrient solution <b>102</b>.
