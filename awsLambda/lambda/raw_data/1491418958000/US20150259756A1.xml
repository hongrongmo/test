      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The Papanicolaou (PAP) smear has been the cornerstone of cervical cancer screening since 1949. By definition, the PAP smear is a stain performed on cells smeared on a slide and visualized by microscopy. Following the advent of liquid-based cervical cytology (LBC), cells from the cervix were obtained using a brush, suspended in a fixative solution, and then applied to a slide prior to staining. Highly trained cytotechnologists and cytopathologists review the stained slides looking for evidence of abnormal cells as indicated by the characteristics in Table 1.</p>

      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0003">Because of the necessity to use slides for the PAP smear, other biomarkers used for cervical cancer screening, especially those used for the molecular detection of HPV DNA, are performed on a separate aliquot of the LBC. Though some biomarkers such as p16 can be performed on a slide, the throughput is not desirable to accommodate the 60-70 million cervical cytology specimens obtained every year in the US and the 150+ million samples worldwide. Further, molecular techniques performed on a slide are cumbersome and time consuming, characteristics that are not amenable to cervical cancer screening.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0004">Clinically, the PAP smear and HPV testing are used together though they are very disparate technologies. The PAP smear has relatively low sensitivity (50%) and relatively high specificity (90%) for high grade cervical lesions (pre-cervical cancer and cervical cancer). Conversely, HPV DNA testing has high sensitivity (&gt;90%) but low specificity (30%) for high grade cervical lesions (pre-cervical cancer and cervical cancer. These performance characteristics have supported the combined use of these tests for effective cervical cancer screening. Some investigators have pushed for the sole use of HPV detection for cervical cancer screening (primary HPV screening), however, current HPV DNA tests lack the specificity afforded by morphologic assessment using PAP smear, raising a concern for an overwhelming number of unnecessary colposcopy/biopsy procedures. Thus the replacement of the PAP smear by HPV testing alone remains extremely controversial.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0021">In further describing embodiments of the invention, aspects of embodiments of the methods will be described first in greater detail. Next, embodiments of systems that may be used in practicing methods of the invention are reviewed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0022">As summarized above, embodiments of the invention are directed to methods of predicting whether a subject has a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesion or cervical cancer. The term âCIN lesionâ (also referred to in the art as cervical dysplasia) is used in its conventional sense to refer to the abnormal growth of squamous cells on the surface of the cervix. As is known in the art, CIN lesions may be histologically graded as CIN1, CIN2/3, CIN2 and CIN3. CIN1 lesions are those lesions that are confined to the basal â of the epithelium, and have the least risk of developing into a cancerous lesion, relative to the other categories of lesions. CIN2 lesions are characterized by moderate dysplasia confined to the basal â of the epithelium. CIN3 lesions (sometimes referred to by those of skill in the art as cervical carcinoma in situ) are categorized by the presence of severe dysplasia that traverses more than â of the epithelium. The CIN2/3 category (i.e., CIN2+) collectively refers to both CIN2 and CIN3 lesions.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0023">Embodiments of the invention are characterized by predicting the presence of a CIN lesion in a subject with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. By predicting is meant to prognosticate or foresee the presence of a CIN lesion in the subject without actually taking a biopsy of the cervix of the subject. The terms sensitivity and specificity are used in their conventional sense. As such, sensitivity is a measure of the proportion of actual positives (as opposed to false positives) that are correctly identified while specificity is a measure of negatives which are correctly identified. Embodiments of the invention may predict the presence or absence of any type of CIN lesion. Embodiments of the invention may also predict the type of CIN lesion, e.g., whether the CIN lesion is a CIN1, CIN2+, CIN2 or CIN3 lesion. Embodiments of the methods make this prediction, e.g., whether a lesion is present, what type of lesion is present (such as whether a CIN2+ lesion is present) with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. In some instances, sensitivity is 85% or more, such as 90% or more, including 95% or more. In some instances, specificity is 85% or more, such as 87% or more, including 90% or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0024">Aspects of the methods include obtaining both: (1) morphometric data and (2) biomarker data and/or non-specific cell data from a labeled liquid sample of cervical cells in suspension from the subject, e.g., a liquid sample labeled with one or both of a biomarker label and a non-specific cell label. In other words, a liquid sample of cervical cells is collected from the subject, where the cervical cells are in suspension in a fluid medium (e.g., as described in greater detail below), is assayed to obtain both morphometric data and biomarker/non-specific cell data. Thus, a labeled liquid sample according to aspects of the methods may be a biomarker labeled liquid sample, a non-specific cell labeled liquid sample, or a biomarker and non-specific cell labeled liquid sample. The labeled liquid sample of cervical cells that is assayed may be provided according to any convenient protocol.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0025">In one embodiment, an initial fluid cervical cellular sample is prepared by taking a cellular sample from the cervix and combining it with a suitable fluid medium. Any convenient protocol for collecting cervical cells may be employed. Examples of protocols of interest include protocols that employ a cervical brush or broom device to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and the endocervix. Descriptions of examples of cervical cell collection devices that may find use in methods of the invention are provided in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,955,591; 3,626,470; 3,815,580; 3,877,464; 3,881,464; 3,945,372; 4,127,113; 4,175,008; 4,700,713; 4,754,764; 4,762,133; 4,754,764; 4,873,992; 4,862,899; 4,953,560; 5,445,164; 5,787,891; 5,795,309; 6,387,058 and 6,740,049.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0026">Following collection, the cellular sample may be combined with a suitable liquid medium, as desired. Liquid mediums of interest include, but are not limited to: saline, or balanced salt, solutions (such as Hanks' balanced salt solution, a minimal essential (MEM) tissue culture medium, POLYSALâ¢ solution, and normal saline); cytology mediums, e.g., Universal Collection Medium (UCM); the universal collection medium described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,371,518 (the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference); Standard Transport Medium (STM), PRESERVCYTâ¢ fluid medium (Cytyc, Inc. (Boxborough, Mass.)); CytoRichâ¢ fluid medium (TriPath, Inc. (Burlington, N.C.); and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0027">Where desired, the collected initial sample may be assessed for adequacy prior to proceeding further in the process. For example, an aliquot of the sample may be subjected to light scatter analysis to determine whether adequate target cells are present in the sample, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,167; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0028">Following preparation, the resultant initial fluid cervical cellular sample may be fixed and/or permeabilized as desired. As such, methods of the invention include fixing the cellular sample by contacting the sample with a suitable fixation reagent. Fixation reagents of interest are those that fix the cells at a desired timepoint. Any convenient fixation reagent may be employed, where suitable fixation reagents include, but are not limited to: formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, formaldehyde/acetone, methanol/acetone, IncelIFP (IncellDx, Inc) etc. For example, paraformaldehyde used at a final concentration of about 1 to 2% has been found to be a good cross-linking fixative. In some instances, the cells in the sample are permeabilized by contacting the cells with a permeabilizing reagent. Permeabilizing reagents of interest are reagents that allow the labeled biomarker probes, e.g., as described in greater detail below, to access to the intracellular environment. Any convenient permeabilizing reagent may be employed, where suitable reagents include, but are not limited to: mild detergents, such as Triton X-100, NP-40, saponin, etc.; methanol, and the like. It may also be desirable to label cells with a positive heavy metal control, e.g. a DNA intercalator labeled with a heavy metal, e.g. iridium, etc. Cells may also be stained with a viability dye prior to fixation, e.g. ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, DAPI, RhCI<sub>3</sub>, etc., as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0029">In certain embodiments, and as reviewed above, the sample that is assayed to obtain morphometric and biomarker data is a biomarker labeled sampled. Accordingly, the sample is one that has been labeled for one or more biomarkers of interest. By âbiomarker labeled sampleâ is meant a sample which has been contacted with a labeled biomarker probe (e.g., as described in greater detail below) that specifically binds to a biomarker of interest if the biomarker is present in the cellular sample. Biomarkers of interest include, but are not limited to, cervical cancer biomarkers. Cervical cancer biomarkers are a distinctive biological or biologically derived indicator, for example nucleic acids or proteins, whose presence is associated or linked with either the propensity of a subject to develop cervical cancer or the presence of cervical cancer in a subject. Accordingly, biomarkers of interest include nucleic acid and protein analytes whose presence and/or amount in a cell can be used to make a prediction of at least the propensity of a subject to suffer from cervical cancer. Biomarkers of interest include, but are not limited to: HPV expression products of HPV genes, such as HPV genes L1, L2, E2, E4, E5, E6 or E7; cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, e.g., p14, p15<sup>INK4b </sup>p16 (i.e., p16<sup>INK4a </sup>as described in Serrano, M., et al., Nature, 1993 Dec. 16; 366(6456): 704-7), p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, p19<sup>INK4d</sup>; p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1 </sup>and p27<sup>KIP1</sup>; cell cycle regulatory proteins, e.g., p14<sup>ARF</sup>; specific microRNAs or chromosome alterations 3q-associated with cervical cancer, such as described in United States Patent Publication No. 20100234445 (the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference); etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0030">The biomarker labeled liquid cervical cellular sample that is assayed in methods of the invention may be prepared using any convenient labeling protocol. In some embodiments, preparation of the biomarker labeled liquid sample includes contacting an initial cervical cell sample with a labeled biomarker probe that specifically binds to a cervical cancer biomarker. Depending on the particular assay to be performed, the initial sample may be combined with a single labeled biomarker probe or two or more distinct labeled biomarker probes that bind to different biomarkers of different molecular composition, where the number of such distinct labeled biomarker probes may be two or more, e.g., three or more, four or more, five or more, etc; e.g., where the assay is a multiplex assay for two or more biomarkers.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0031">In contacting the initial sample with the labeled biomarker probe(s), the sample is combined with one or more labeled biomarker probes to produce a reaction mixture. Labeled biomarker probes of interest include a specific binding domain and a label domain. The specific binding domain comprises a capture ligand that specifically binds to the biomarker of interest. Depending on the particular assay, the biomarker of interest may be a variety of different types of molecules, including but not limited to: proteins, polypeptides, proteoglycans, glycoproteins and the respective fragments of these molecules; nucleic acids, e.g., DNA and RNA, such as mRNA, etc. The capture ligand is therefore a ligand that binds to the biomarker molecule of interest, wherein this capture ligand may of course vary depending on the specific type of biomarker molecule to be detected, e.g., antibody for protein biomarker, oligonucleotide for mRNA biomarker. In certain embodiments, the affinity between a capture ligand and the biomarker molecule to which it specifically binds when they are specifically bound to each other in a binding complex is characterized by a K<sub>D </sub>(dissociation constant) of 10<sup>â6 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â7 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â8 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â9 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â10 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â11 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â12 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â13 </sup>M or less, 10<sup>â14 </sup>M or less, including 10<sup>â15 </sup>M or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0032">As indicated above, a variety of different types of specific binding agents may be employed as the capture ligands, where the particular type of binding agent is selected based, at least in part, on the particular type of molecule of the biomarker of interest. Specific binding agents of interest include antibody binding agents, proteins, peptides, haptens, nucleic acids, etc. The term âantibody binding agentâ as used herein includes polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies or fragments that are sufficient to bind to an analyte of interest. The antibody fragments can be, for example, monomeric Fab fragments, monomeric Fabâ² fragments, or dimeric F(ab)â²<sub>2 </sub>fragments. Also within the scope of the term âantibody binding agentâ are molecules produced by antibody engineering, such as single-chain antibody molecules (scFv) or humanized or chimeric antibodies produced from monoclonal antibodies by replacement of the constant regions of the heavy and light chains to produce chimeric antibodies or replacement of both the constant regions and the framework portions of the variable regions to produce humanized antibodies. Nucleic acid binding agents of interest are nucleic acids that specifically bind to biomarker nucleic acids in a cell. The length of these nucleic acids may vary, so long as it is sufficient for the oligonucleotide to serve as a specific binding agent, and in some instances ranges from 13 to 100 nt, such as 14 to 50 nt, e.g., 15 to 25 nt. The oligonucleotides that make up these nucleic acid binding agents may be DNA or RNA, or a synthetic analogue thereof, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0033">In addition to the specific binding domain, the labeled biomarker probes further include a detectable label. Of interest as detectable labels are fluorescent dyes. Fluorescent dyes (fluorophores) can be selected from any of the many dyes suitable for use in imaging applications (e.g., flow cytometry). A large number of dyes are commercially available from a variety of sources, such as, for example, Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.) and Exciton (Dayton, Ohio). Examples of fluorophores of interest include, but are not limited to, 4-acetamido-4â²-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2â²disulfonic acid; acridine and derivatives such as acridine, acridine orange, acrindine yellow, acridine red, and acridine isothiocyanate; 5-(2â²-aminoethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS); 4-amino-N-[3-vinylsulfonyl)phenyl]naphthalimide-3,5 disulfonate (Lucifer Yellow VS); N-(4-anilino-1-naphthyl)maleimide; anthranilamide; Brilliant Yellow; coumarin and derivatives such as coumarin, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC, Coumarin 120), 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcouluarin (Coumaran 151); cyanine and derivatives such as cyanosine, Cy3, Cy5, Cy5.5, and Cy7; 4â²,6-diaminidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI); 5â², 5â³-dibromopyrogallol-sulfonephthalein (Bromopyrogallol Red); 7-diethylamino-3-(4â²-isothiocyanatophenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; diethylaminocoumarin; diethylenetriamine pentaacetate; 4,4â²-diisothiocyanatodihydro-stilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid; 4,4â²-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2â²-disulfonic acid; 5-[dimethylamino]naphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride (DNS, dansyl chloride); 4-(4â²-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL); 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4â²-isothiocyanate (DABITC); eosin and derivatives such as eosin and eosin isothiocyanate; erythrosin and derivatives such as erythrosin B and erythrosin isothiocyanate; ethidium; fluorescein and derivatives such as 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl)aminofluorescein (DTAF), 2â²7â²-dimethoxy-4â²5â²-dichloro-6-carboxyfluorescein (JOE), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), fluorescein chlorotriazinyl, naphthofluorescein, and QFITC (XRITC); fluorescamine; IR144; IR1446; Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP); Reef Coral Fluorescent Protein (RCFP); Lissamineâ¢; Lissamine rhodamine, Lucifer yellow; Malachite Green isothiocyanate; 4-methylumbelliferone; ortho cresolphthalein; nitrotyrosine; pararosaniline; Nile Red; Oregon Green; Phenol Red; B-phycoerythrin; o-phthaldialdehyde; pyrene and derivatives such as pyrene, pyrene butyrate and succinimidyl 1-pyrene butyrate; Reactive Red 4 (Cibacronâ¢ Brilliant Red 3B-A); rhodamine and derivatives such as 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 6-carboxyrhodamine (R6G), 4,7-dichlororhodamine lissamine, rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride, rhodamine (Rhod), rhodamine B, rhodamine 123, rhodamine X isothiocyanate, sulforhodamine B, sulforhodamine 101, sulfonyl chloride derivative of sulforhodamine 101 (Texas Red), N,N,Nâ²,Nâ²-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), tetramethyl rhodamine, and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC); riboflavin; rosolic acid and terbium chelate derivatives; xanthene; or combinations thereof. Other fluorophores or combinations thereof known to those skilled in the art may also be used, for example those available from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.) and Exciton (Dayton, Ohio).</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">Where multiple distinct labeled biomarker probes are employed, the label of each distinct probe may be chosen to provide a distinguishable signal. For example, in embodiments where first and second distinct labeled biomarker probes are employed, the label in the second probe is a fluorescent label which produces a fluorescent signal that is distinguishable from the first fluorescent signal of the label of the first probe. Accordingly, the first and second fluorescent signals produced upon excitation of the first and second fluorescent labels are distinguishable from each other, meaning that both can be detected at the same time and that the signal from one does not modify or change the signal from the other. Each distinct label may produce signals that are distinguishable from any other label. For example, the cells may be stained with a third fluorescent label which produces a third fluorescent signal that is distinguishable from the first and second fluorescent signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">In some instances, the labeled biomarker probe that is employed is an HPV E6, E7 oligonucleotide fluorescently labeled probe. Such probes may vary in length, ranging in some instances from 13 to 100 nt, such as 14 to 50 nt, e.g., 15 to 25 nt. The particular sequence of such probes may vary. Specific sequences of interest include, but are not limited to those found in the probe cocktail of the HPV OncoTectâ¢ E6,E7 mRNA Detection Kit (incellDx, Menlo Park, Calif.).</p>

      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0038">Additional HPV specific probe sequences that find use in the methods and systems described herein may be designed and tested using any convenient probe design methodology.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0039">In preparing the reaction mixture, the sample may be combined with the labeled biomarker probes using any convenient protocol. Combination may be carried out with mixing, as desired. Contact of the sample with the labeled biomarker probes is performed under incubation conditions that provide for binding of probes to their respective biomarkers, if present, in the sample. In some instances, the probes and samples are contacted and combined at a temperature ranging from 15 to 50, such as from 20 to about 40Â° C. Contact may be performed with mixing or agitation, e.g., with vortexing etc., to provide for sufficient combination of the reaction components and the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0040">The resultant reaction mixture may then be maintained or incubated for a period of time prior to assay for morphometric and biomarker data, e.g., via flow cytometric analysis (e.g., as described in greater detail below). In some instances, the reaction mixture is incubated at a temperature ranging from 15 to 50, such as from 20 to about 40Â° C. for a period of time ranging from about 30 minutes to 72 hours, such as 1 hour to 24 hours, including 1 hour to 3 hours. Following the above incubation step, the sample may be assayed immediately or stored for assay at a later time. If stored, in some embodiments the sample is stored at a reduced temperature; e.g., on ice.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0041">Where desired, the resultant reaction mixture may be washed, e.g., to remove any unbound probes and other sample components. Washing may be performed using any convenient protocol, e.g., by combining the reaction mixture with a suitable wash buffer and separating the cells from the fluid. A given washing protocol may include one or more distinct washing steps, as desired. Following any washing protocol, the labeled cells may be re-suspended in a suitable liquid, e.g., the washing buffer or another buffer, for subsequent analysis, e.g., via flow cytometric analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0042">In some embodiments, as described above, the labeled liquid cell sample is labeled (or stained) with a non-specific cell stain, either in addition to or in the absence of a biomarker label. The cells may be stained with a non-specific stain using any convenient protocol. Of interest as non-specific cells stains are DNA specific stains. Dyes and stains that are specific for DNA (or preferentially bind double stranded polynucleotides in contrast to single-stranded polynucleotides) and therefore may be employed as non-specific stains include, but are not limited to: Hoechst 33342 (2â²-[4-ethoxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2,5â²-bi-1H-benzimidazole) and Hoechst 33258 (2â²-[4-ethoxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2,5â²-bi-1H-benzimidazole) and others of the Hoechst series; SYTO 40, SYTO 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (green); SYTO 17, 59 (red), DAPI, DRAQ5â¢ (an anthraquinone dye with high affinity for double stranded DNA), YOYO-1, propidium iodide, YO-PRO-3, TO-PRO-3, YOYO-3 and TOTO-3, SYTOX Green, SYTOX, methyl green, acridine homodimer, 7-aminoactinomycin D, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyactridine. Depending on the particular stain and assay, the stain may serve in quantitation of biomarker, as an indication of cell cycle, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0043">Following preparation of the labeled sample, e.g., as described above, the sample is assayed to obtain both morphometric as well as biomarker and/or non-specific cell data. In some instances, the same aliquot of sample, i.e., the same physical quantity of sample, is assayed to obtain both the morphometric and biomarker/non-specific cell data. Accordingly, these embodiments are distinguished from protocols in which a first aliquot of a sample is assayed using one protocol, e.g., slide based protocol, for morphometric data and a second aliquot of the sample is assayed using another protocol, e.g., flow cytometric protocol.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0044">Morphometric data refers to any type of data from which cell morphology information, i.e., information about the size, shape and/or structure of the cells, may be derived. Morphometric data of interest includes, but is not limited to data selected from the group consisting of: forward light scatter data, side light scatter data, image data and combinations thereof. Morphological parameters of interest include, but are not limited to: nuclear area, perimeter, texture or spatial frequency content, centroid position, shape (i.e., round, elliptical, barbell-shaped, etc.), volume, and ratios of any of these parameters. The obtained morphometric date may be for cells as a whole or for subparts thereof, e.g., the cytoplasm of cells. In some instances, the morphometric data may include an actual designation of whether a cell is normal or abnormal, including the type of abnormal cell. For example, morphometric data may, in some instances, include a designation that a given cell is abnormal, for example that the cell is: an atypical squamous cell, e.g., atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASC-US), atypical squamous cellâcannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H); low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL or LSIL); high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL or HSIL); squamous cell carcinoma; atypical glandular cell not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS); atypical clandular cell, suspicious for AIS or cancer (AGC-neoplastic); and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0045">Biomarker data refers to any type of data from which biomarker information for the cell may be derived. In some instances, biomarker data is data that includes a signal emitted by the label of the labeled biomarker probe that is employed in the assay. The biomarker data may be in the form of the presence and amplitude of emitted light, the number of discrete positions in a cell or other object from which the light signal(s) originate(s), the relative placement of the signal sources, and the color (wavelength or waveband) of the light emitted at each position in the cell. The biomarker data may take the form of qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative data. Qualitative data is simply the presence or absence of the biomarker. Semi-quantitative or quantitative data is data that provides some indication of the amount, e.g., copy number, concentration, etc., of the biomarker in the cell. For example, semi-quantitative data may take the form of an indication that the copy number of a biomarker of interest is above a certain threshold number. Quantitative data provides an indication of an absolute value, e.g., copy number, amount, etc., of the biomarker in the cell. Semi-quantitative and quantitative data may be collectively referred to as biomarker quantitation data.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0046">In some instances, the biomarker of interest is an mRNA that is present when a subject is infected with a high risk HPV strain. mRNAs of interest include an HPV E6, E7 mRNA. In these embodiments, the absolute copy number of the mRNA species of interest may be determined, such that the quantitation data of the mRNA species of interest is obtained. In some instances where the biomarker is HPV E6, E7, the total amount of E6, E7 mRNA species per cell is determined. In these instances, of interest is the identification of cells that 2 or more, such as 5 or more, including 10 or more, 50 or more, 100 or more, 200 or more, 500 or more HPV E6, E7 mRNA copies per cell, as these cells may be associated with the presence of a CIN lesion in the host. In some instances, the biomarker data that is obtained in methods of the invention provides information that there are 2 to 1000 copies of HPV E6, E7 mRNA per cell, e.g., 5 to 750 copies of HPV E6, E7 mRNA per cell, including 10 to 500 copies of HPV E6, E7 mRNA per cell. In some instances, the biomarker data that is obtained is the HPV E6, E7 mRNA copy number per cell data as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,524,631, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Determination of the copy number may include comparing a single to a suitable control, e.g. as provided by a non-specific DNA stain (such as described below), by a reference value, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0047">In some instances, photometric measurements are also obtained. Photometric measurements enable the determination of nuclear optical density, cytoplasm optical density, background optical density, and the ratios of any of these values.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0048">Non-specific cell data is any type of data from which non-specific (i.e., non-biomarker specific) cell information for the cells in the sample may be derived. In some instances, non-specific cell data is data that includes a signal emitted by a non-specific cell stain that is employed in the assay. The non-specific cell data may be in the form of the presence and amplitude of emitted light, the number of discrete positions in a cell or other object from which the light signal(s) originate(s), the relative placement of the signal sources, and the color (wavelength or waveband) of the light emitted at each position in the cell. The non-specific cell data may take the form of qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative data. For example, quantitative or semi-quantitative non-specific cell data may include data on the DNA content of a cell obtained using a DNA stain (e.g., as described above). Other quantitative data includes electronic volume (EV). Thus, non-specific cell data may provide an indication of an absolute or relative value, e.g., copy number, amount, etc., of the non-specific cell component in the cell. Semi-quantitative and quantitative data may be collectively referred to as non-specific cell quantitation data. Qualitative non-specific cell data can provide information with respect to the presence of absence of a particular feature of a cell. For example, in cells stained with a DNA stain, the presence or absence of a cell nucleus can be determined (e.g., the number of nucleated cells in a sample, also referred to as percent nucleation).</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0049">It is noted that where multiple distinct labels are to be detected in a single labeled liquid cell sample, e.g., biomarker probe labels and non-specific cell stains used in a single sample, the labels and stains employed may be chosen to provide a distinguishable signal (as described above for using multiple biomarker probes in a single sample, above). For example, in embodiments where a labeled biomarker probe and a DNA stain are employed, the label for the biomarker probe is a fluorescent label which produces a fluorescent signal that is distinguishable from the fluorescent signal of the DNA stain. Accordingly, the fluorescent signals produced upon excitation of the biomarker probe label and the DNA stain are distinguishable from each other, meaning that both can be detected at the same time and that the signal from one does not modify or change the signal from the other. Each distinct label may produce signals that are distinguishable from any other label. For example, the cells may be stained with three fluorescent labels which produce three distinct fluorescent signals that are distinguishable from each other upon excitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0050">The above types of data, e.g., the morphometric, biomarker, and non-specific cell data, may be obtained from the same aliquot of sample using any convenient protocol. In some instances, a flow cytometric protocol is employed which collects each type of data. Flow cytometry is a well-known methodology using multi-parameter data for identifying and distinguishing between different particle (e.g., cell) types i.e., particles that vary from one another terms of label (wavelength, intensity), size, etc., in a fluid medium. In flow cytometrically analyzing the sample prepared as described above, an aliquot of the sample is first introduced into the flow path of the flow cytometer. When in the flow path, the cells in the sample are passed substantially one at a time through one or more sensing regions, where each of the cells is exposed separately individually to a source of light at a single wavelength (or in some instances two or more distinct sources of light) and measurements of morphometric parameters, e.g., light scatter parameters, and/or biomarker parameters, e.g., fluorescent emissions, as desired, are separately recorded for each cell. The data recorded for each cell is analyzed in real time or stored in a data storage and analysis means, such as a computer, for later analysis, as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0051">More specifically, in a flow cytometer, the cells are passed, in suspension, substantially one at a time in a flow path through one or more sensing regions where in each region each cell is illuminated by an energy source. The energy source may include an illuminator that emits light of a single wavelength, such as that provided by a laser (e.g., He/Ne or argon) or a mercury arc lamp with appropriate filters. For example, light at 488 nm may be used as a wavelength of emission in a flow cytometer having a single sensing region. For flow cytometers that emit light at two distinct wavelengths, additional wavelengths of emission light may be employed, where specific wavelengths of interest include, but are not limited to: 535 nm, 635 nm, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0052">In series with a sensing region, detectors, e.g., light collectors, such as photomultiplier tubes (or âPMTâ), image collectors (e.g., in the form of charge-coupled devices (CCDs)), etc., are used to record light that passes through each cell (generally referred to as forward light scatter), light that is reflected orthogonal to the direction of the flow of the cells through the sensing region (generally referred to as orthogonal or side light scatter) and fluorescent light emitted from the cells, if it is labeled with fluorescent marker(s), as the cells passes through the sensing region and is illuminated by the energy source. Each type of data that is obtained, e.g., forward light scatter (or FSC), orthogonal light scatter (SSC), and fluorescence emissions (FL1, FL2, etc.) and image, etc., comprise a separate parameter for each cell (or each âeventâ).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0053">Flow cytometers further include data acquisition, analysis and recording means, such as a computer, wherein multiple data channels record data from each detector for the morphometric and biomarker data emitted by each cell as it passes through the sensing region. The purpose of the analysis system is to classify and count cells wherein each cell presents itself as a set of digitized parameter values. In flow cytometrically assaying cells in methods of the invention, the flow cytometer may be set to trigger on a selected parameter in order to distinguish the cells of interest from background and noise. âTriggerâ refers to a preset threshold for detection of a parameter. It is typically used as a means for detecting passage of cell through the laser beam. Detection of an event which exceeds the threshold for the selected parameter triggers acquisition of light scatter and fluorescence data for the cell. Data is not acquired for cells or other components in the medium being assayed which cause a response below the threshold. The trigger parameter may be the detection of forward scattered light caused by passage of a cell through the light beam. The flow cytometer then detects and collects the light scatter and fluorescence data for cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0054">A particular subpopulation of interest is then further analyzed by âgatingâ based on the data collected for the entire population. To select an appropriate gate, the data is plotted so as to obtain the best separation of subpopulations possible. This procedure is typically done by plotting forward light scatter (FSC) vs. side (i.e., orthogonal) light scatter (SSC) on a two dimensional dot plot. The flow cytometer operator then selects the desired subpopulation of cells (i.e., those cells within the gate) and excludes cells which are not within the gate. Where desired, the operator may select the gate by drawing a line around the desired subpopulation using a cursor on a computer screen. Only those cells within the gate are then further analyzed by plotting the other parameters for these cells, such as fluorescence.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0055">Any flow cytometer that is capable of obtaining both the morphometric and biomarker/non-specific cell data, e.g., as described above, from the same aliquot of a liquid sample may be employed. Of interest are those flow cytometer systems described in U.S. Pat.

Combinations of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: a) nuclear to cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio analysis (e.g., to identify abnormal cells) coupled with quantification of E6, E7 mRNA; b) N/C ratio analysis coupled with cell cycle analysis as determined by DAPI staining and green fluorescence of the E6, E7 mRNA hybridization signal; c) N/C ratio analysis coupled with cell cycle analysis as determined by p16 staining and green fluorescence of the E6, E7 mRNA hybridization signal; d) N/C ratio analysis coupled with cell cycle analysis as determined by DAPI (or other DNA stain) staining, etc.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0058">In addition to N/C ratio, nuclear area (NA) assessment may be used as morphometric data. Cells in a cervical cell sample having an increased nuclear area, e.g., as compared to nuclei in normal intermediate squamous cells, can be identified cells as abnormal cells. Abnormal cells may have a nuclear area-to-nuclear area ratio (nuclear area of cell of interest/nuclear area of normal intermediate squamous cell) of 1.25 or more, 1.75 or more, 2.0 or more, 2.25 or more, 2.75 or more, 3.0 or more, 3.25 or more, 3.5 or more, etc. It is noted here that using standard microscopy observations, the accuracy of estimating nuclear area is low (see, e.g., Schmidt et al., 2008, âVisual estimates of nucleus-to-nucleus ratios: can we trust our eyes to use the Bethesda ASCUS and LSIL size criteria?â Cancer 114(5):287-93. Aspects of the present invention provide a more accurate and reproducible assessment of nuclear area.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0059">Additional data parameters may also be employed in analyzing the cells in the cervical cell sample, including side (orthogonal) light scatter, forward scatter, and electronic volume (EV; a measure of cell size; based on the Coulter principle). Such parameters find use in identifying populations or sub-populations of cells in the sample that are to be analyzed for the presence of abnormal cells (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 6</figref> and its description herein). For example, analysis of EV and DNA content (e.g., using DAPI) allows the differentiation of enucleated from nucleated squamous cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0060">In some instances, the methods include determining that the assayed cellular sample includes cancerous cells. In these embodiments, the methods include identifying the presence of one or more cancerous cells in the sample, where the identification is made based on morphometric and biomarker data, e.g., as described above. Such embodiments may or may not include predicting the presence of CIN in a subject, since the methods of these embodiments identify the presence of actual cancerous cells in the sample.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0061">In some instances, the prediction of the presence of a CIN lesion is made within a short period of time following introduction of the sample into the cytometer. Accordingly, results may be provided to a user in a period of 6 hours or less, such as 3 hours or less, e.g., 2 hours or less, including 1 hour or less. Where desired, the overall assay time which ranges from obtainment of the sample from the subject to delivery of the result to the subject is 6 hours or less, such as 5 hours or less, e.g., 4 hours less, including 3 hours or less, e.g., 2 hours or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0062">In some instances, the methods further include performing further analysis of a subject if the methods result in a prediction of a CIN lesion in the subject. For example, where methods of the invention result in prediction of a CIN2+ lesion in a subject, the methods may then further include providing a recommendation to a subject that further action be taken, e.g., in the form of further diagnostic procedures, such as biopsy. In some instances, the methods include taking further diagnostic action. Further diagnostic action may include a colposcopy, in which a magnified visual inspection of the cervix is performed to identify abnormal cells on the surface of the cervix. If the biopsy indicates that cancer or pre-cancerous lesions may be present, further diagnostic and treatment procedures may be taken, such as loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP) and conization, in which the inner lining of the cervix is removed to be examined pathologically.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0063">While the methods are suitable for use with a variety of different female mammalian subjects, of interest are use of the methods with human female subjects, such as human female subjects of 10 years age or older, e.g., 15 years age or older, including 20 years age or older.</p>

Accordingly, the invention provides a computer-based system for analyzing data produced using the above methods in order to detect or predict a CIN lesion.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0076">In certain embodiments, the methods are coded onto a physical computer-readable medium in the form of âprogrammingâ, where the term âcomputer readable mediumâ as used herein refers to any storage or transmission medium that participates in providing instructions and/or data to a computer for execution and/or processing.

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0080">The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">EXPERIMENTAL</heading>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0081">A 1 ml sample aliquot of the liquid-based cervical cytology (LBC) specimen obtained was and centrifuged at 1000Ãg for 5 minutes at room temperature. The resultant cell pellet was washed twice in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), pH 7.4 and the cells were fixed and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature using IncelIFP (Incelldx, Menlo Park, Calif.). The resultant fixed and permeabilized cells were washed twice using two different pre-hybridization buffers (PBS and 2ÃSSC) and a hybridization cocktail was prepared by mixing hybridization buffer (5ÃSSC, 30% formamide) with a fluorescence-labeled HPV E6, E7 mRNA probe cocktail for all known high risk HPV types (the probe cocktail was from the those found in the probe cocktail of the HPV OncoTectâ¢ E6, E7 mRNA Detection Kit (incellDx, Menlo Park, Calif.). The hybridization reaction was performed in a preheated 43Â±1Â° C. water bath for 30 minutes and was followed by stringency washing of cells with two post-hybridization buffers (2ÃSSC, Triton X-100 and 0.1ÃSSC, Triton X-100) in order to remove the unbound probe. The cells were washed in 1 ml PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum and re-suspended in 60 Î¼l PBS, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 1 Î¼g/ml DAPI. Prior to running on the instrument, 200 Î¼l 10 Î¼M EDTA in PBS was added. The samples were homogenized with a syringe and run on an ImageStream instrument (Amnis Inc, Seattle, Wash.). The instrument was set-up to distinguish intact single cells using Aspect Ratio versus Area dot plot, e.g., as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. This setting allowed: (1) identification of abnormal cells by N/C (nuclear to cytoplasmic) ratio analysis (see e.g., <figref>FIGS. 2</figref>); and (2) quantification of E6, E7 mRNA as determined by DAPI staining and green fluorescence of the E6, E7 mRNA hybridization signal (see <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0082">Alternatively, cell cycle analysis as determined by a DNA-staining reagent (e.g., DAPI or DRAQ5 staining of the cells) and green fluorescence of the E6, E7 mRNA hybridization signal can be used to detect abnormal cells. For example, as can be seen in the histogram in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, overexpression of E6/E7 mRNA (Y-axis) is found in cells having increased DNA content (X-axis; DNA stain is DRAQ5).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">Combined use of morphometric measurements consistent with accepted slide based criteria in Table 1 and E6, E7 mRNA overexpression on a cell-by-cell basis all performed on cells while in suspension increased the sensitivity and specificity for detection of CIN 2+ to &gt;95% and &gt;90% respectively. This performance in a single assay greatly exceeds the test performance of the PAP smear and HPV DNA combined for the detection of CIN 2+ lesions.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">This approach can be used substituting a p16 antibody for E6, E7 mRNA detection, or substituting E6, E7 mRNA probes with probes directed at specific microRNAs or chromosome alterations 3q-associated with cervical cancer, or substituting E6, E7 directed antibodies for E6, E7 mRNA probes.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">As an additional alternative, cell cycle analysis as determined by a DNA-staining reagent coupled with morphometric measurements, e.g., nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the cells, can be used to detect abnormal cells. For example, <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show histograms of N/C ratios (Y-axis) versus DNA content of normal cervical cells (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, top panel), LSIL cervical cells (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, bottom panel), and HSIL cervical cells (<figref>FIG. 5B</figref>, both panels). This alternative uses only 1 staining reagent, i.e., the non-specific DNA-staining reagent.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">Furthermore, as shown in Table 2 below, we have found that degree of nucleation of squamous cells in the sample, as determined by using a DNA staining reagent, corresponds with the severity of the cytologic abnormality. Specifically, an increase in the percent nucleation of the squamous cells in the sample corresponds to an increased severity of the cytologic abnormality. In Table 2, normal squamous cells had a % nucleation of about 50%, LSIL squamous cells had a % nucleation of about 80%, and HSIL squamous cells had a % nucleation above 90%. As such, a percent nucleation for squamous cells in a sample from a subject of about 80% or higher indicates that the subject has a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesion (e.g., LSIL or HSIL), where a percent nucleation of about 90% or higher in the sample indicates that the subject has a high grade squamous epithelial lesion (HSIL).</p>
