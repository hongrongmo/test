      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Miniaturization and diversification of semiconductor devices have progressed more and more, and a processing method thereof covers a wide range with respect to each of device structures and production steps. As regards etching of the substrate, development of both dry etching and wet etching has been advanced, and a variety of chemical liquids and processing conditions have been proposed depending on kinds and structures of the substrate material.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Above all, when a device structure of CMOS, DRAM or the like is produced, a technique of etching a prescribed material precisely is important and as one of techniques of addressing such problem, a wet etching which utilizes a chemical liquid is exemplified. For example, a precise etching processing is required in the production of circuit wiring of a microscopic transistor circuit, a metal electrode material, or a substrate having a barrier layer, a hard mask, and the like. However, sufficient study has not yet been done on etching conditions and chemical liquids suitable for each of the substrates containing a wide variety of metal compounds. Under these circumstances, efficient removal of a hard mask or the like applied to the device substrate has been laid out as a production problem. Specifically, there are examples of studies on chemical liquids for etching titanium nitride (TiN) (see Patent Literatures 1 to 6).</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0011">By the way, in recent semiconductor device production, there is a requirement for a processing technique of wet-etching a metal hard mask (MHM) composed of TiN under the condition of exposed contact plug composed of tungsten (W), copper (Cu) and the like. In the production, a solid hard mask composed of TiN has to be removed without damaging the contact plug composed of metals. That is to say, simply developing of chemical liquids having removal performance for TiN is not enough to respond to such a requirement. In particular, recently the contact plug has increasingly been miniaturized and it still more increases the difficulty of a fine and selective etching using chemical liquids.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0012">On the other hand, the above Patent Literature 6 sets out that, by using a mixture of a hydrogen fluoride and a silane-containing precursor, a metal hard mask can be removed while suppressing dissolution of the above contact plug material. However, there is no disclosure of the specific formula, so that its details are unclear. Even if the mixture of the hydrogen fluoride and the silane-containing precursor (methyl triethoxysilane) disclosed therein is simply used, there is a possibility that sufficient etching properties cannot be obtained depending on the oxygen concentration of the substrate (see Comparative Example C11 described below).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0013">In view of the above, the present invention addresses the provision of an etching liquid which removes a first layer containing TiN selectively and efficiently to a second layer containing a particular metal and further enables achievement of surface uniformity of the TiN layer after etching, an etching method using the same, and a method of producing a semiconductor device. In particular, the present invention addresses the provision of an etching liquid which achieves the above etching selectivity suitably in response to a broad concentration range of oxygen contained in the TiN layer, if needed, an etching method using the same, and a method of producing a semiconductor device.</p>

      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing a semiconductor substrate before etching. In the production example of the present embodiment, a layered product is used, in which SiOC layer 3 and SiON layer 2 as a specific third layer are disposed on a silicon wafer (not shown) and TiN layer 1 is formed on the third layer. At this time, via 5 has been formed already in the above-described composite layer and, a second layer (metal layer) 4 containing a metal has been formed at the bottom of via 5. Onto substrate 10 at this state, an etching liquid (not shown) according to the present embodiment is applied to remove the TiN layer. As a result, substrate 20 having a configuration in which the TiN film has been removed as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> can be obtained. Needless to say, although the etching as graphically shown is ideal in the present invention and a preferable embodiment thereof, a remainder of the TiN layer or alternatively some corrosion of the second layer is appropriately acceptable according to a required quality of a semiconductor device to be produced and the like and, therefore, the present invention is not construed to a limited extent by the above description.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0027">Note that, when a silicon substrate or a semiconductor substrate, or simply a substrate is mentioned, these are used in the sense of including not only a silicon wafer but also a whole substrate structure provided with a circuit structure. The term âthe element of the substrateâ refers to an element that constitutes the silicon substrate that is defined above, and may be made of a single material or a plurality of materials. A processed semiconductor substrate is sometimes called as a semiconductor substrate product by a distinction. A tip or a processed product thereof, which has been obtained by further processing the semiconductor substrate, if needed, and then by singulating the same is referred to as semiconductor device or semiconductor equipment. With respect to the direction of the semiconductor, in reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the opposite side to the silicon wafer (TiN side) is called as âupperâ, or âhead edgeâ, while the silicon wafer side (SiOC side) is called as âunderâ, or âbottomâ.</p>

      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0028">Next, a preferable embodiment of the etching liquid of the present invention is explained. The etching liquid of the present embodiment contains a fluorine-containing compound, an oxidizing agent and an organic silicon compound. Hereinafter, each of components including optional ones is explained.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">(Oxidizing Agent)</heading>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0029">Examples of the oxidizing agent include nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide, ammonium persulfate, perboric acid, peracetic acid, periodic acid, perchloric acid, or a combination thereof. Among them, nitric acid or hydrogen peroxide is particularly preferable.</p>

The upper limit thereof is preferably 10% by mass or less, more preferably 9.5% by mass or less, still more preferably 7.5% by mass or less, still more preferably 5% by mass or less, and particularly preferably 3% by mass or less. Setting to the above-described upper limit or less is preferable from the viewpoint that good protection performance (selective etching) of the second layer can be achieved thereby. By setting to the above-described lower limit or greater, sufficient etching rate of the first layer can preferably be ensured.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0031">As the above-described oxidizing agent, one kind thereof may be used solely, or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">(Fluorine-Containing Compound)</heading>

The upper limit thereof is preferably 30% by mass or less, more preferably 10% by mass or less, still more preferably 10% by mass or less, and particularly preferably 3% by mass or less. Setting to the above upper limit or less is preferable from the viewpoint of securing sufficient etching performance of the first layer. Further, by setting this amount to the above lower limit or above, etching selectivity between the first layer and the second layer can preferably be enhanced to a higher degree as well as securement of sufficient etching performance of the first layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0034">In relation to the oxidizing agent, the fluorine-containing compound is preferably used in an amount of 1 part by mass or more, and more preferably in an amount of 10 parts by mass or more, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the oxidizing agent. The upper limit thereof is preferably 1000 parts by mass or less, more preferably 500 parts by mass or less, and particularly preferably 300 parts by mass or less. By using the amounts of both compounds in a suitable relation, a good etching performance can be realized and also a high etching selectivity can be achieved together as described above.</p>

Either single wafer type (spray-type) etching or immersion type (batch type) etching may be applicable. In the spray-type etching, a semiconductor substrate is transported or rotated in the prescribed direction and an etching liquid is sprayed into the space, thereby bringing the etching liquid into contact with the semiconductor substrate. On the other hand, in the batch-type etching, a semiconductor substrate is immersed in a liquid bath constituted of an etching liquid, thereby bringing the etching liquid into contact with the semiconductor substrate in the liquid bath. These etching processes may be appropriately used depending on the structure, the material, and the like of a device.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0103">The environmental temperature at which etching is conducted is preferably 15Â° C. or higher, and particularly preferably 25Â° C. or higher, in the measurement method of temperature in Examples below.

The feeding rate of the etching liquid, although it is not particularly limited, is preferably set within the range from 0.05 to 1 L/min, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 L/min. When the feeding rate of the etching liquid is set to a higher level, the feeding rate is preferably set to a range of from 0.1 to 2 L/min. By setting to the above-described lower limit or greater, in-plane uniformity of etching can preferably be secured at more excellent level. By setting to the above-described upper limit or lower, stable selectivity at the time of continuous processing can preferably be secured. In the case of rotating a semiconductor substrate, although it varies depending on the size or the like, from the same viewpoint as the above, it is preferable to rotate the semiconductor substrate at the rate of 50 to 400 rpm. In the case of low rotation, it is preferable to rotate the semiconductor substrate at the rate of from 50 to 400 rpm. When the rotation number is set to a higher level, the rotation number is preferably set to a range of from 100 to 1000 rpm.</p>

The immersing time of the semiconductor substrate, although it is not particularly limited, is preferably set to be from 0.5 to 30 minutes and more preferably from 1 to 10 minutes. By setting to the above-described lower limit or longer, in-plane uniformity of etching can preferably be secured.

Specifically, in the present embodiment, when an etching liquid is applied onto semiconductor substrate S having a Ti layer, the substrate is made to rotate in the r direction. On the other hand, the discharge opening is designed to move along with moving-track-line t extending from the central portion of the semiconductor substrate to the edge thereof. Thus, in the present embodiment, the rotation direction of the substrate and the moving direction of the discharge opening are set so as to be a different direction from one another whereby they are subjected to a relative movement with respect to one another. As a result, the configuration is such that an etching liquid can be evenly applied onto the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate whereby the uniformity of etching is favorably secured.</p>

Specifically, etching of the metal layer, a semiconductor layer, an insulating layer, and the like is conducted, thereby patterning the metal layer and the semiconductor layer, or forming, on the insulating layer, an opening portion such as a via hole and a wiring groove. In the plasma etching, a residue derived from the resist used as a mask, and the metal layer, the semiconductor layer, and the insulating layer to be etched may be produced on the semiconductor substrate. In the present invention, the residue produced by the plasma etching as described above is called as âa plasma etching residueâ. The âplasma etching residueâ includes an etching residue derived from the above-described second layer (Cu, W) and third layer (SiON, SiOC, and the like).</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0109">Further, the resist pattern used as a mask is removed after etching. In order to remove the resist pattern, a wet method using a stripper liquid, or a dry method in which ashing is conducted using, for example, plasma or ozone, is used. In the ashing, a converted residue of the plasma etching residue produced by the plasma etching and a residue derived from the resist to be removed are produced on the semiconductor substrate. In the present invention, the residue produced by the ashing as described above is called as an âashing residueâ. Further, as the general term for the residual matter which is produced on the semiconductor substrate and should be removed by washing, such as the plasma etching residue and the ashing residue, they may be simply called as a âresidueâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0110">The plasma etching residue and the ashing residue which are the residue after such etching (Post Etch Residue) are preferably washed and removed using a washing composition. The etching liquid according to the present embodiment can also be applied as a washing liquid for removing the plasma etching residue and/or the ashing residue. Especially, the etching liquid is preferably used to remove both the plasma etching residue and the ashing residue after the plasma ashing which is conducted in succession to the plasma etching.</p>
      <heading id="h-00024-en" level="2">[Material to be Processed]</heading>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0111">A material, which is etched by applying thereto the etching liquid according to the present embodiment, may be arbitrarily used. However, it is required that a substrate having a first layer containing TiN is applied. Herein, the term âlayer containing TiN (TiN layer)â means that the layer may contain oxygen. When the TiN layer is especially used to distinguish it from a layer which does not contain oxygen, it may be called as a TiON layer or the like. In the present invention, the surface oxygen content of the TiN layer is preferably 10% by mole or less, more preferably 8.5% by mole or less and still more preferably 6.5% by mole or less. The lower limit side is preferably 0.1% by mole or more, more preferably 2.0% by mole or more, and still more preferably 4.0% by mole or more. Such adjustment of the oxygen concentration in the TiN layer in the substrate can be conducted by, for example, adjustment of the oxygen concentration in a processing room for CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) at the time of forming the TiN layer. The above-described oxygen concentration can be specified by the method utilized in Examples described below. Note that the first layer contains TiN as a major ingredient and may contain other ingredients within the range in which the effect of the present invention is exerted. This is true on the other layer such as the second layer, the metal layer and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0112">The above-described first layer is preferably subjected to etching at high etching rate. The thickness of the first layer is not particularly limited. However, when compositions of ordinary devices are considered, it is practical that the thickness is approximately from 0.005 to 0.3 Î¼m. The etching rate (R1) of the first layer is not particularly limited. However, considering production efficiency, the etching rate is preferably 50 â«/min or more, more preferably 100 â«/min or more, and particularly preferably 200 â«/min or more. The upper limit is not particularly limited and it is practical that the upper limit is 500 â«/min or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0113">In the present invention, it is preferable that Cu, W, Co, Ni, Ag, Ta, Hf, Pt, Au or the like is applied as a constituent element of the second layer (metal layer). Among them, it is preferable that Cu or W is applied as a material of the second layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0114">Here, the technical significance of the metal layer is explained on the basis of an example in which copper (Cu) and tungsten (W) are used as a material thereof. Recently, in response to demands for speed-up of the semiconductor device (semiconductor equipment), miniaturization of wiring pattern, and high integration, reduction in capacity between wirings, improvement in electrical conductivity of the wire and improvement in electromigration resistance have been required. As regards the techniques for addressing these requirements, a multilayer-wiring technique of using copper which has high electrical conductivity and excellent electromigration resistance as a wire material and using a low dielectric constant layer (Low-K layer) as an insulation layer between layers has attracted attention. This copper wiring is generally disposed by a Dual Damascene process, on a copper seed layer (for example, dual layer composed of tantalum (Ta) and tantalum nitride (TaN)) which acts as a copper diffusion-preventing film for preventing copper from diffusion in the copper wiring.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0115">On the other hand, contact of the semiconductor device is disposed through a tungsten plug by a single Damascene process in place of the Dual Damascene process which is ordinarily used at the time of forming a copper wiring and a via hole. In such multilayer-wiring technique, a Damascene method of forming a concave portion such as a wiring gutter, a through hole, and the like in a low dielectric constant layer and thereby burying therein copper is adopted. In this case, in order to form the concave portion with accuracy in the low dielectric constant layer by etching, it is necessary to use a mask composed of a material which has an adequately high-selection ratio to the low dielectric constant layer, as a mask to be used when the low dielectric constant layer is etched.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0116">As the above low dielectric constant layer, an organic material is generally used, and as a result, in the case of etching the low dielectric constant layer using, as a mask, a photoresist layer composed of the same organic material as the above, it is presumed that the selection ratio becomes insufficient. In order to dissolve such problem, it has been proposed to use a hard mask layer composed of an inorganic material such as a TiN film, as a mask to be used at the time of etching. Further, removal of this hard mask layer is needed in the process after etching of the low dielectric constant layer. In particular, in the wet etching process, an exact removal of the above hard mask without corroding a metal layer such as tungsten plug and the like, or other wiring and/or low dielectric constant layer materials is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0117">The first layer (TiN) layer which constitutes a hard mask in the embodiment as described above is removed. As a result, the metal layer (second layer) is expected to be located at the bottom of a via-hole or a trench (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref> and <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0118">The etching rate [R2] of the second layer (metal layer) is not limited in particular. However, it is preferable that the second layer is not removed to excess. The etching rate is preferably 100 â«/min or more, and more preferably 50 â«/min or more. The lower limit, although it is not limited in particular, is 0.001 â«/min or more for practical purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0119">The exposed width (d in the figure) of the metal layer is not limited in particular. However, from the viewpoint that advantages of the present invention become more remarkable, the exposed width is preferably 2 nm or more, and more preferably 4 nm or more. In a similar way, from the viewpoint of conspicuity of the effect, the upper limit is 1000 nm or less for practical purposes, preferably 100 nm or less, and more preferably 20 nm or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0120">In the selective etching of the first layer and the second layer, its etching rate ratio ([R1]/[R2]) is not particularly limited. However, when described based on the premise of a device that needs a high selectivity, the etching rate ratio is preferably 2 or more, more preferably 3 or more, still more preferably 5 or more. The upper limit is not particularly limited and a higher upper limit is more preferable. However, it is practical that the upper limit is 500 or less.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0121">Further, the method of the present invention is also preferably applied to a semiconductor substrate having a third layer containing a metal compound such as SiO, SiN, SiOC, SiON, or the like. Note that in the present specification, when the composition of a metal compound is expressed by a combination of elements thereof, the composition means that compositions having arbitrary percentage of the elements are incorporated in a broad sense. For example, SiO means that it incorporates a thermally-oxidized film of silicon and SiO<sub>2</sub>, and includes SiO<sub>x</sub>. This is the common definition in the present specification, so that same applies to other metal compounds. It is preferable that the third layer is also subjected to surface uniformization. The etching rate [R3] of the third layer, although it is not limited in particular, is preferably the same range as the above etching rate [R2] of the second layer. Further, it is preferable that the etching rate ratio ([R1]/[R3]) of the first layer and the third layer is also in the same range as the etching rate ratio ([R1]/[R2]) of the first layer and the second layer.</p>

It is preferable that the semiconductor substrate (second layer and/or third layer) is subjected, prior to the above-described etching step, to a dry etching or dry ashing step. Further, it is preferable that a residue produced in the step is removed.</p>

Further, film formation for a second layer substrate was carried out by CVD in the same manner as the above to use it as a test substrate in tables.</p>
      <heading id="h-00028-en" level="2">(Substrate Surface Oxygen Concentration)</heading>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0127">Regarding a surface oxygen concentration of the TiN layer, concentration profiles of Ti, O and N in the depth direction from 0 to 30 nm were measured using etching ESCA (Quantera manufactured by ULVAC-PHI, INCORPORATED) and each of the contents at the depth of from 5 to 10 nm was calculated. An average of the oxygen contents was defined as the surface oxygen concentration.</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0128">With respect to the above-described test substrates, etching was carried out under the following conditions using single wafer-type equipment (POLOS (trade name) manufactured by SPS-Europe B.V.) and evaluation tests were carried out.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0129">Processing temperature: 25Â° C.</p>

      <heading id="h-00030-en" level="2">(Measurement Method of Processing Temperature)</heading>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0132">A radiation thermometer IT-550F (trade name) manufactured by HORIBA, Ltd. was fixed at the height of 30 cm above the wafer in single wafer type equipment. The thermometer was pointed onto the wafer surface of 2 cm outside of the wafer center, and temperature measurement was conducted while making a chemical liquid flow. The temperature was measured by digital output from the radiation thermometer and continuously recorded on a personal computer. Among them, an averaged value of the temperature during the period of 10 seconds after stabilization of the temperature was used as a temperature on the wafer.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0000">[Evaluation of in-Plane Uniformity]</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0133">Condition setting required for the etching depth at the center of a circular substrate was conducted at different time periods whereby the time period required to be 300 Ã¥ of the etching depth was confirmed. Then, the entire substrate was again etched at the confirmed time period, and at this moment, the measurement of the obtained etching depth was conducted at the centrally-directed position of 30 mm from the periphery of the substrate. Evaluation was conducted on the condition that as the depth is near 300 Ã¥, in-plane uniformity becomes high. Specific criteria are as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0134">The following shows a difference between the above two points (center and 30 mm positions) and evaluation was carried out by an average of five point data.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0144">The section of Metal compound 1/Metal compound 2 represents an etching rate ratio [R1]/[R2]. The same is true on the following tables.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0145">From the above results, it is found that by the etching liquid of the present invention, both a good etching selectivity such that TiN is preferentially etched in a broad oxygen concentration range of the TiN layer as well as in-plane uniformity are obtained. Note that TiN is destined to be removed in the manufacturing process, and therefore the in-plane uniformity does not directly influence product performance, but it may cause removal unevenness. When reduction in the processing time is considered, the influence of the in-plane uniformity becomes conspicuous. In other words, upgrading of the in-plane uniformity becomes important because it leads to improvement in productivity.</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0161">The wafer surface after etching was observed using a Defect Inspection System (trade name SP-1, manufactured by KLA-Tencor Corporation) and evaluation was conducted with respect to the number of TiN residue on the surface. Measurement was conducted on the condition that when a residue having a size of 0.2 m or greater was present, the defect number was 1.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0162">The defect number in terms of 0.2 m or greater was:</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0163">A: less than 50/12 inch wafer surface</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0164">B: 50 or more and less than 200/12 inch wafer surface</p>
