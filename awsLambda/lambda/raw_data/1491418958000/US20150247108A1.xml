      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Some consumers find aesthetically pleasant opaque liquid detergents. Opaque products seem to connote quality and sophistication. This appearance can be achieved by the use of opacifiers. Opacifiers are usually suspensions of submicron size particles that modify the appearance of liquids through mainly light scattering. The level of opacifier necessary to confer this pleasant aesthetics to a liquid detergent is not very high.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">It can be very difficult to handle an opacifier during manufacture because the particles can be prone to flocculation, sedimentation or any other type of separation. It is also difficult to keep the particles of the opacifier suspended during the life of a liquid detergent.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Opacifiers can be susceptible to microbial growth. In order to store an opacifier in a manufacturing environment a preservative needs to be added. Mono-alcohols are usually added as preservatives to pre-mixes containing an opacifier. A problem might occur when mixing is not totally homogeneous and local pockets of mono-alcohol are formed. In these cases the mono-alcohol, that usually has good solvency properties, can negatively impact the stability of the suspension. Thus good mixing is needed in the process of manufacture in order to avoid these local pockets of mono-alcohol. This sometimes can impose too strenuous manufacturing limitations, such a long mixing times resulting in manufacturing capacity reduction, they also need more energy for mixing, etc. It has been surprisingly found that with the opacifier of the invention, this problem can be ameliorated and it can even be avoided, thereby providing manufacture flexibility.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The objective of the present invention is to provide a detergent with an opaque appearance that is physically stable under storage and transport and a process for making the product. The process should be flexible and versatile.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid detergent composition. The composition is aqueous. By âaqueousâ is herein meant that the composition comprises more than 15%, preferably more than 20% and more preferably more than 30% by weight of the composition of water.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The composition comprises a mono-alcohol and an opacifier. By âmono-alcoholâ is herein meant a hydrocarbon comprising only one âOH group.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to the first aspect, the opacifier has improved stability in ethanol. By âimproved stabilityâ is herein meant that under the same conditions the opacifier of the invention is stable, preferably physically stabile, in a water-ethanol solution comprising a higher level of ethanol than the same solution comprising Acusol 301. Stability is evaluated by visual observation. By âstableâ is herein meant that when the solution is observed with the naked eye no separation of the particles can be seen. In particular for the purpose of this invention an opacifier is considered to be more stable than Acusol 301 if the opacifier is stable in a water-ethanol mixture comprising 10% by weight of the mixture of opacifier and more than 50% of ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Acusol OP 301, herein shortened as Acusol 301, is an opacifier supplied by Dow. Acusol 301 is provided as an aqueous polymeric dispersion comprising 40% polymeric particles by weight of the dispersion. The polymer is synthesized from styrene and acrylate comonomers and is made through emulsion polymerization. The polymer is present in the dispersion in particulate form.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">âPolymer,â as used herein and as defined by F W Billmeyer, JR. in Textbook of Polymer Science, second edition, 1971, is a relatively large molecule made up of the reaction products of smaller chemical repeat units. Normally, polymers have 11 or more repeat units. Polymers may have structures that are linear, branched, star shaped, looped, hyperbranched, crosslinked, or a combination thereof; polymers may have a single type of repeat unit or they may have more than one type of repeat unit. Polymers may have the various types of repeat units arranged randomly, in sequence, in blocks, in other arrangements, or in any mixture or combination thereof. Chemicals that react with each other to form the repeat units of a polymer are known herein as âmonomersâ and a polymer is said herein to be made of âpolymerized unitsâ of the monomers that reacted to form the repeat units.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Preferably the opacifier of the invention is a polymer and more preferably a high order polymer. By âhigh order polymerâ is meant a polymer that is made from more than two monomers, preferably three or more. According to the second aspect of the invention, the polymer is a high order polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Preferably, the opacifier of the invention is a polymer comprising monomers comprising styrene. More preferably, the opacifier further comprises monomers comprising units selected from the group consisting of carboxylates including acrylate, maleate and methacrylate; carboxylic amides including acrylamide; alkenyl; alkoxy; polyalkoxy and mixtures thereof. Preferred carboxylate include acrylate and maleate.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Especially preferred for use herein is a polymer comprising styrene, acrylate and monomers comprising maleate. In particular a styrene-polyethylene glycol-10 maleate-acrylate or a styrene/polyethylene glycol-10 maleate/nonoxanol-10 maleate/acrylate copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably the composition of the invention comprises from about 0.001% to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.005% to about 2% and especially from about 0.05% to about 1.5% by weight of the composition of opacifier. This level of opacifier seems to be optimum to provide the liquid detergent very appealing appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The liquid detergent of the invention comprises a mono-alcohol; the primary function of the mono-alcohol is to act as anti-microbial active. Preferably, the mono-alcohol has Hansen polarity parameter of from about 5 to about 15 (Mpa)<sup>1/2 </sup>and a Hansen hydrogen bonding parameter of from about 15 to about 25 (Mpa)<sup>1/2</sup>. Best performing alcohols have been found to be those selected from the group consisting of C1 to C3 alcohols and mixtures thereof, most preferred for use herein being ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Especially preferred for use herein, in terms of appearance and stability, are compositions wherein the polymer is a styrene-polyethylene glycol-10 maleate-acrylate or a styrene/polyethylene glycol-10 maleate/nonoxanol-10 maleate/acrylate copolymer and the mono-alcohol is ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for making a premix.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The process comprises the step of mixing water, a mono-alcohol and an opacifier wherein the opacifier has improved stability in ethanol versus Acusol 301 and wherein the opacifier preferably is a high order polymer. The mixing step does not need to achieve perfect mixing, even if some pockets of mono-alcohol are formed, the opacifier is robust enough not to become instable. This presents a great advantage from the manufacture feasibility view point, reduce the mixing time and energy required.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">A âpremixâ for the purpose of this invention is the combination of a plurality of ingredients prior to its addition to subsequent ingredients to form the finish product.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Preferably, the opacifier used to make the premix is in the form of an aqueous dispersion with a solid content of from about 10 to about 50% by weight of the dispersion. Preferably, the level of opacifier in the premix is from 2% to 20% by weight thereof. Preferably, the level of mono-alcohol is below 20%, more preferably from 15% to 1%, and especially from 12% to 5% by weight of the premix. When given the level of opacifier in the present invention, it meant the level of polymer particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Especially preferred premixes comprise a styrene-polyethylene glycol-10 maleate-acrylate or a styrene/polyethylene glycol-10 maleate/nonoxanol-10 maleate/acrylate copolymer as opacifier and ethanol as mono-alcohol. This premix has been found to be very stable.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for making a liquid detergent composition comprising the steps of adding the premix of the invention to a detergent base.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The features of the opacifier of the liquid detergent of the invention apply mutatis mutandis to the process for making the premix and the process for making the detergent.</p>

      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Process for Making the Detergent</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In some instances late product differentiation of liquid detergent is desired. A base detergent containing of the main ingredients is made and minors are added at a later state. This facilitates the manufacture of a plurality of different products starting from the same base. Aesthetics modifications of detergents sometimes take place at the end of the manufacturing process, i.e., when the main ingredients have already been mixed. In some instances, it is desirable to make a premix that will be subsequently added to the mixture of the base. A premix of a minor ingredient can be advantageous when the level of active required is very low, this can help with accurate dosing during the manufacturing process. In some instances, anti-microbial agents need to be added in order to avoid microbial growth. Mono-alcohols present good anti-microbial properties. However, it has been found that mono-alcohols when added to opacifiers can bring instability issues, such as sedimentation and separation of the opacifier in the premix. Once the instability takes place it is very difficult to correct it later on in the process and it will bring instability to the final detergent. Thus the mixing of the premix needs to be such that a quasi perfect mixture is obtained. This requirement bring a lot of constrains to the manufacture process (increased mixing time and energy). The process of the present invention overcomes the above issues thereby improving process flexibility and efficiency.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The premix of the present invention comprises the step of mixing water, a mono-alcohol and an opacifier. Mixing can take place in any mixing vessel, the premix can be consequently stored, preferably the premix is kept under agitation in the storage tank. It has been found that mixing from about 5-10% of opacifer, in particular Acusol 305, from about 10-15% of ethanol and from about 75 to 85% of water a very stable premix is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The premix is added to a base detergent to make the finish liquid detergent.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Stability Test</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The stability of the opacifier of the invention versus the stability of Acusol 301 is compared using the method described herein below.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Solutions are made at 20Â° C. containing 3 parts of mono-alcohol and 1 part of Acusol (Acusol is provided in liquid form with 40% solids (as supplied by the Dow Company)). Solutions were mixed till a visually homogeneous dispersion was obtained. The solutions are stored for 12 hours at room temperature. This datapoint refers to the 100% datapoint.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Solutions with different mono-alcohol concentration were prepared in which 3 parts of mono-alcohol solvent were gradually replaced by demineralized water (not touching Acusol concentration in Acusolâsolvent/water mixture) to detect the mono-alcohol concentration at which respective Acusol emulsions remain stable upon overnight storage at 20Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The 50% datapoint reflects half of the mono-alcohol being replaced by water, resulting in a 1.5 part waterâ1.5 part mono-alcoholâ1 part 40% active Acusol mixture.</p>
