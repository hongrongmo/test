      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/005,841, filed May 30, 2014 and 61/952,741, filed Mar. 31, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is directed to methods for reducing tolerance to opioids in a patient undergoing opioid analgesic treatment for pain comprising treating the patient with noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof at a dosage that provides a therapeutic serum concentration. In one embodiment, the average serum concentration is 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL, including under conditions where the QT interval prolongation does not exceed about 50 milliseconds, and preferably 30 milliseconds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Addictive opioid analgesic agents such as morphine are well-known and exceptionally potent analgesics. Such opioids operate as mu receptor agonists. Upon administration, opioids initiate a cascade of biological events including increased serotonin and dopamine expression. As is well known, continued use of many such opioids (especially at high doses) carries a significant risk of dependency/addiction. Indeed, potential addiction to such opioids is a serious issue that limits the therapeutic use of addictive opioids as analgesic agents. For example, the use of morphine as an analgesic is common among end stage patients suffering from serious pain where addiction is no longer a concern.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Drug tolerance to opioid analgesics is common, and may be psychological and/or physiological. A patient who has developed tolerance to the opioid analgesic is not necessarily addicted to or misusing the analgesic. Drug tolerance occurs when the patient's reaction to the drug is reduced, requiring an increase in dose to achieve the same desired effect. There are several potential methods for how tolerance develops, including receptor desensitization, receptor phosphorylation, receptor internalization or down-regulation, and up-regulation of inhibitory pathways.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Drug tolerance requires that the dosage of analgesic be increased in order to provide sustained analgesic effect. However, high doses of opioids may lead to serious complications and side effects, including physical dependence, addiction, respiratory depression, nausea, sedation, euphoria or dysphoria, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and itching.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It would be beneficial to provide a method for modulating opioid analgesic tolerance in a patient taking one or more opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">This invention is directed, in part, to the use of noribogaine to modulate tolerance to addictive opioid analgesic agents in a patient who has developed or is at risk of developing a tolerance for the analgesic. In such methods, effective analgesia can be achieved in a patient while resensitizing the patient to the addictive opioid analgesic. The term “resensitizing the patient” is used herein to refer to reducing, relieving, attenuating, and/or reversing tolerance to the analgesic. In one aspect, the resensitized patient obtains therapeutic effect from a lower dose of the opioid analgesic than before resensitization. In one aspect, the resensitized patient obtains improved therapeutic effect from the same dose of the opioid analgesic compared to before resensitization.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">It has been discovered that the use of noribogaine imparts a dose dependent prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval, rendering higher dosing of noribogaine unacceptable. A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential Torsades de Pointes, a serious arrhythmia that can result in death.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The current invention is predicated on the surprising discovery that treatment with a narrow dosage range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, between 1 mg/kg body weight and 4 mg/kg body weight, provides a therapeutic modulation of in tolerance to opioid analgesics. Preferably, the dose range that provide both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is between 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than 4 mg per kg body weight and, more preferably between 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than 3 mg per kg body weight, or any subrange or subvalue within the aforementioned ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the narrow therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate described above do not prolong the QT interval to unacceptable levels in human patients. In some embodiments, patients will be administered therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof in a clinical setting with cardiac monitoring. In some embodiments, the patient will be pre-screened to evaluate tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, e.g., to determine whether the patient has any pre-existing cardiac conditions which would disqualify them from treatment with noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one embodiment, noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is administered concurrently with the opioid analgesic. In one embodiment, noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is administered after administration of the analgesic, for example one, two, three, four, eight, ten, twelve, 24 hours or more after administration of the analgesic. In one embodiment, one dose of noribogaine is administered. In one embodiment, two or more doses of noribogaine are administered. In one embodiment, the opioid analgesic is interrupted for a period of time while noribogaine is administered. In one embodiment, a non-opioid analgesic is administered while the opioid analgesic is interrupted. In one embodiment, noribogaine acts as an analgesic. In one embodiment, the opioid analgesic is not interrupted during noribogaine treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient is sufficient to provide an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL (area under the curve/24 hours), or any subrange or subvalue there between. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of 80 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL is administered as a single dose. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL is administered as multiple doses. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 1.3 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is about 2 mg/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In some embodiments, the unit dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds in opioid-tolerant humans is about 120 mg. In some embodiments, the unit dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds in opioid-tolerant humans is 2 mg/kg body weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some embodiments, the patient is administered an initial dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, followed by one or more additional doses. In one embodiment, the initial dose is from 75 mg to 120 mg. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are lower than the initial dose. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are from 5 mg to 50 mg. In one embodiment, such a dosing regimen provides an average serum concentration of noribogaine of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses maintain an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL over a period of time. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are administered periodically.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In some embodiments, the serum concentration is sufficient to modulate said tolerance while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 80 ms. In one embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 30 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 20 ms. In one embodiment, the patient is tested to determine QT interval and/or risk of prolongation before treatment with noribogaine, and if clinician determines that the QT prolongation would be unacceptable risk, noribogaine therapy will be contraindicated.</p>

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of this invention will be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a compound” includes a plurality of compounds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">I. Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein the following terms have the following meanings</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The term “about” when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time, amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may vary by (+) or (−) 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or any subrange or subvalue there between. Preferably, the term “about” when used with regard to a dose amount means that the dose may vary by +/−20%. For example, “about 2 mg/kg noribogaine” indicates that a patient may be administered a dose of noribogaine between 1.6 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg. In another example, about 120 mg per unit dose of noribogaine indicates that the unit dose may range from 96 mg to 144 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">“Administration” refers to introducing an agent, such as noribogaine, into a patient. Typically, an effective amount is administered, which amount can be determined by the treating physician or the like. Any route of administration, such as oral, topical, subcutaneous, peritoneal, intra-arterial, inhalation, vaginal, rectal, nasal, introduction into the cerebrospinal fluid, or instillation into body compartments can be used. The agent, such as noribogaine may be administered by direct blood stream delivery, e.g. sublingual, buccal, intranasal, or intrapulmonary administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The related terms and phrases “administering” and “administration of”, when used in connection with a compound or pharmaceutical composition (and grammatical equivalents) refer both to direct administration, which may be administration to a patient by a medical professional or by self-administration by the patient, and/or to indirect administration, which may be the act of prescribing a drug. For example, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug and/or provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">“Periodic administration” or “periodically administering” refers to multiple treatments that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Periodic administration may also refer to administration of an agent, such as noribogaine one, two, three, or more times per day. Administration may be via transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, intranasal, intrapulmonary, oral administration, or other administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">“Comprising” or “comprises” is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. “Consisting essentially of” when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination for the stated purpose. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. “Consisting of” shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.</p>

Also encompassed within this invention are derivatives of noribogaine that act as prodrug forms of noribogaine. A prodrug is a pharmacological substance administered in an inactive (or significantly less active) form. Once administered, the prodrug is metabolized in vivo into an active metabolite. Noribogaine derivatives include, without limitation, those compounds set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,456 and 8,362,007; as well as in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/165,626; and US Patent Application Publication Nos. US2013/0131046; US2013/0165647; US2013/0165425; and US2013/0165414; all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Non-limiting examples of noribogaine derivatives encompassed by this invention are given in more detail in the “Compositions” section below.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0138">In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure entail the administration of a prodrug of noribogaine that provides the desired maximum serum concentrations and efficacious average noribogaine serum levels. A prodrug of noribogaine refers to a compound that metabolizes, in vivo, to noribogaine. In some embodiments, the prodrug is selected to be readily cleavable either by a cleavable linking arm or by cleavage of the prodrug entity that binds to noribogaine such that noribogaine is generated in vivo. In one preferred embodiment, the prodrug moiety is selected to facilitate binding to the μ and/or κ receptors in the brain either by facilitating passage across the blood brain barrier or by targeting brain receptors other than the λ and/or κ receptors.

      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0139">This invention is not limited to any particular chemical form of noribogaine or noribogaine derivative, and the drug may be given to patients either as a free base, solvate, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In the latter case, the hydrochloride salt is generally preferred, but other salts derived from organic or inorganic acids may also be used. Examples of such acids include, without limitation, those described below as “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0140">“Pharmaceutically acceptable composition” refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, preferably a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0141">“Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0142">“Therapeutically effective amount” or “therapeutic amount” refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine, in the context of modulating opioid analgesic tolerance, refers to an amount of noribogaine that resensitizes the patient to the opioid analgesic therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0143">The therapeutically effective amount of the compound may be higher or lower, depending on the route of administration used. For example, when direct blood administration (e.g., sublingual, pulmonary and intranasal delivery) is used, a lower dose of the compound may be administered. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine or derivative is from about 50 ng to less than 100 μg per kg of body weight. Where other routes of administration are used, a higher dose of the compound may be administered. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound is from greater than about 1 mg to about 8 mg per kg of body weight per day.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0144">A “therapeutic level” of a drug is an amount of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that is sufficient to modulate tolerance to an opioid analgesic, but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the “serum concentration.” Where the serum concentration of noribogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term “noribogaine” encompasses any form of noribogaine, including derivatives thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0145">The term “dose” refers to a range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that provides a therapeutic serum level of noribogaine when given to a patient in need thereof. The dose is recited in a range, for example from 20 mg to 120 mg, and can be expressed either as milligrams or as mg/kg body weight. The attending clinician will select an appropriate dose from the range based on the patient's weight, age, degree of addiction, health, and other relevant factors, all of which are well within the skill of the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0146">The term “unit dose” refers to a dose of drug that is given to the patient to provide therapeutic results, independent of the weight of the patient. In such an instance, the unit dose is sold in a standard form (e.g., 20 mg tablet). The unit dose may be administered as a single dose or a series of subdoses. In some embodiments, the unit dose provides a standardized level of drug to the patient, independent of weight of patient. Many medications are sold based on a dose that is therapeutic to all patients based on a therapeutic window. In such cases, it is not necessary to titrate the dosage amount based on the weight of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0147">A “sub-therapeutic level” of noribogaine or pharmaceutical salt and/or solvate thereof that is less than the therapeutic level described above. For example, the sub-therapeutic level of noribogaine may be e.g., 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount (e.g., 120 mg) of noribogaine, or any subvalue or subrange there between. Sub-therapeutic levels of noribogaine may coincide with “maintenance amounts” of noribogaine which are amounts, less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provide some attenuation and/or prevention of post-acute withdrawal syndrome in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically addicted to opioid or opioid-like drug.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0148">As defined herein, a “prophylactically effective amount” of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provides attenuation and/or prevention of a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. For example, the prophylactically effective amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who no longer has a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder (e.g., no longer physically addicted to nicotine). For example, a prophylactically effective amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount. However, a prophylactically effective amount may be the same as the therapeutically effective amount, for example when a patient who is physically addicted to nicotine is administered noribogaine to attenuate cravings for a period of time when nicotine use is not feasible. The prophylactically effective amount may vary for different a diseases or disorders or symptoms of different diseases or disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0149">As defined herein, a “maintenance amount” of a drug or an agent is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount that provides attenuation and/or prevention of syndrome disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically manifests a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder. For example, a maintenance amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount, or any subvalue or subrange there between.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0150">“Treatment,” “treating,” and “treat” are defined as acting upon a disease, disorder, or condition with an agent, such as noribogaine to reduce or ameliorate harmful or any other undesired effects of the disease, disorder, or condition and/or its symptoms. “Treatment,” as used herein, covers the treatment of a human patient, and includes: (a) reducing the risk of occurrence of the condition in a patient determined to be predisposed to the condition but not yet diagnosed as having the condition, (b) impeding the development of the condition, and/or (c) relieving the condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition and/or relieving one or more symptoms of the condition. “Treating” or “treatment of” a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results such as the reduction of symptoms. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to modulating, reducing, attenuating, relieving or reversing tolerance to an opioid analgesic compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0151">“Nociceptive pain” refers to pain that is sensed by nociceptors, which are the nerves that sense and respond to parts of the body suffering from a damage. The nociceptors can signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain. Nociceptive pain is typically well localized, constant, and often has an aching or throbbing quality. A subtype of nociceptive pain includes visceral pain and involves the internal organs. Visceral pain tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain may be time limited; when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves. However, nociceptive pain related to arthritis or cancer may not be time limited. Nociceptive pain tends to respond to treatment with opiate analgesics, such as, for example, buprenorphin, codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and the like. Examples of nociceptive pain include, without limitation, pains from sprains, bone fractures, burns, bumps, bruises, inflammatory pain from an infection or arthritic disorder, pains from obstructions, cancer pain, and myofascial pain related to abnormal muscle stresses.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0152">“Neuropathic pain” refers to chronic pain, often due to tissue injury. Neuropathic pain is generally caused by injury or damage to nerve fibers. It may include burning or coldness, “pins and needles” sensations, numbness and/or itching. It may be continuous and/or episodic. Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat, but opioids, including, without limitation, methadone, tramadol, tapentadol, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, levorphanol, and the like. Causes of neuropathic pain include, without limitation, alcoholism; amputation; back, leg, and hip problems; chemotherapy; diabetes; facial nerve problems; HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; shingles; spine surgery; trigeminal neuralgia; fibromyalgia; and the like. In some cases, the cause of neuropathic pain may be unclear or unknown.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0153">“Addictive” refers to a compound that, when administered to a mammal over a period of time, creates dependency in the mammal to that compound. The dependence can be physiological and/or psychological. A therapeutic effect of an addictive compound on a mammal may decrease with prolonged administration of the addictive compound, which is a non-limiting example of a physiological dependence. When administered to a mammal, an addictive compound may also create a craving in the mammal for more of it, which is a non-limiting example of a psychological dependence. Examples of addictive compounds include, without limitation, addictive opioids, and the like. In contrast, noribogaine is a non-addictive alkaloid.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0154">“Opioid” refers to a natural product or derivative thereof containing a basic nitrogen atom, typically as part of a cyclic ring structure and less commonly as an acyclic moiety, and synthetic derivatives thereof. Opioids include compounds extracted from poppy pods and their semi-synthetic counterparts which bind to the opiate receptors. Examples of opioids include, without limitation, buprenorphine, codeine, heroine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, thebaine, and their derivatives, which will be well known to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0155">“Analgesic” and “analgesic agent” refer to a compound that is capable of inhibiting and/or reducing pain in mammals. Pain may be inhibited and/or reduced in the mammal by the binding of the opioid analgesic agent to the mu receptor. When analgesia is effected through the mu receptor, the analgesic agent is referred to as a mu receptor agonist. Certain analgesic agents are capable of inhibiting nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain including, by way of example, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, hydrocodone, buprenorphin, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0156">As used herein, the term “patient” refers to mammals and includes humans and non-human mammals.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0157">As used herein, the term “QT interval” refers to the measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart. Prolongation of the QT interval refers to an increase in the QT interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0158">The term “tolerance” as used herein refers to the psychological and/or physiologic process wherein the patient adjusts to the frequent presence of a substance such that a higher dose of the substance is required to achieve the same effect. Tolerance may develop at different times for different effects of the same drug (e.g., analgesic effect versus side effects). The mechanisms of tolerance are not entirely understood, but they may include receptor down-regulation or desensitization, inhibitory pathway up-regulation, increased metabolism, and/or changes in receptor processing (e.g., phosphorylation).</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0159">A “pharmaceutically acceptable solvate” or “hydrate” of a compound of the invention means a solvate or hydrate complex that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound, and includes, but is not limited to, complexes of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0160">As used herein the term “solvate” is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term “solvate”. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest. The term “solvate” as used herein refers to complexes with solvents in which noribogaine is reacted or from which noribogaine is precipitated or crystallized. For example, a complex with water is known as a “hydrate”. Solvates of noribogaine are within the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in organic chemistry that many organic compounds can exist in more than one crystalline form. For example, crystalline form may vary based on the solvate used. Thus, all crystalline forms of noribogaine or the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof are within the scope of the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0326">The compositions utilized herein may be formulated for sublingual administration, for example as sublingual tablets. Sublingual tablets are designed to dissolve very rapidly. The formulations of these tablets contain, in addition to the drug, a limited number of soluble excipients, usually lactose and powdered sucrose, but sometimes dextrose and mannitol.</p>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0327">It has been discovered that noribogaine has a bitter taste to at least some patients. Accordingly, compositions for oral use (including sublingual, inhaled, and other oral formulations) may be formulated to utilize taste-masking technologies. A number of ways to mask the taste of bitter drugs are known in the art, including addition of sugars, flavors, sweeteners, or coatings; use of lipoproteins, vesicles, and/or liposomes; granulation; microencapsulation; numbing of taste buds; multiple emulsion; modification of viscosity; prodrug or salt formation; inclusion or molecular complexes; ion exchange resins; and solid dispersion. Any method of masking the bitterness of the compound of the invention may be used.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0328">Thirty-six healthy, drug-free male volunteers, aged between 18-55 years, were enrolled in and completed the study. This was an ascending single-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized double blind, parallel group study. Mean (SD) age was 22.0 (3.3) years, mean (SD) height was 1.82 (0.08) m, and mean (SD) weight was 78.0 (9.2) kg. Twenty-six subjects were Caucasian, 3 were Asian, 1 Maori, 1 Pacific Islander, and 5 Other. The protocol for this study was approved by the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee (LRS/12/06/015), and the study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12612000821897). All subjects provided signed informed consent prior to enrolment, and were assessed as suitable to participate based on review of medical history, physical examination, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0329">Within each dose level, 6 participants were randomized to receive noribogaine and 3 to receive placebo, based on a computer-generated random code. Dosing began with the lowest noribogaine dose, and subsequent cohorts received the next highest dose after the safety, tolerability, and blinded pharmacokinetics of the completed cohort were reviewed and dose-escalation approved by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Blinded study drug was administered as a capsule with 240 ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Participants did not receive any food until at least 5 hours post-dose. Participants were confined to the study site from 12 hours prior to drug administration, until 72 hours post-dose, and there were subsequent outpatient assessments until 216 hours post-dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0330">Blood was obtained for pharmacokinetic assessments pre-dose and then at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours post-dose. Samples were centrifuged and plasma stored at −70° C. until analyzed. Block 24 hour urine collections were obtained following study drug administration for the 30 and 60 mg cohorts. Aliquots were frozen at −20° C. until analyzed.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0331">Pulse oximetry and capnography data were collected continuously using a GE Carescape B650 monitoring system from 2 hours prior to dosing and until six hours after dosing, and thereafter at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dosing. Additional oximetry data were collected at 120, 168 and 216 hours. Pupillary miosis was assessed by pupillometry. Dark-adapted pupil diameter was measured in triplicate using a Neuroptics PLR-200 pupillometer under standardized light intensity (&lt;5 lux) pre-dose, and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours post-dosing.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0332">Plasma noribogaine concentrations were determined in the 3 mg and 10 mg dose groups using a validated, sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved double extraction of basified plasma samples with tert-butyl methyl ether, drying the samples under a stream of nitrogen and reconstitution of sample with acetonitrile: B.P. water (5:95, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple—quadruple API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d<sub>4 </sub>was used as the internal standard. The precursor-product ion transition values for noribogaine were m/z 297.6→122.3, and for the internal standard noribogaine-d<sub>4 </sub>m/z 301.1→122.2. Analyst® software was used for data acquisition and processing. The ratio of the peak area of noribogaine to the internal standard noribogaine-d<sub>4 </sub>was used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.025 ng/ml noribogaine. The calibration curve was between 0.025 and 25.600 ng/ml noribogaine. Mobile phase A was acetonitrile: B.P. water (5:95, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile: B.P. water (95:5, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Total run time was 6 minutes. Binary flow: Initial concentration was 8% mobile phase B; hold at 8% mobile phase B for 0.5 minutes and linear rise to 90% mobile phase B over 1.5 minutes; hold at 90% mobile phase B for 1 minute and then drop back to 8% mobile phase B over 0.01 minute. Equilibrate system for 3 minutes. Total run time was 6 minutes. Within- and between-day assay precision was &lt;9%, and within- and between-day assay accuracy was &lt;9%.</p>

      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0335">Urine noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations were determined in the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups using a validated sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved deproteinization of urine samples with acetonitrile and dilution of the sample with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple—quadruple API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d<sub>4 </sub>was used as the internal standard.

The ratios of the peak area of noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide to the internal standard noribogaine-d<sub>4 </sub>were used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine and its glucuronide. Assay LLOQ was 20.0 ng/ml for noribogaine and 2.0 ng/ml for noribogaine glucuronide. The calibration curve was between 20.0 and 5120.0 ng/ml noribogaine, and 2.0 and 512.0 ng/ml noribogaine glucuronide. Mobile phases were as described in method A, and binary flow as in method C.

      <p id="p-00313-en" num="0336">Noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations above the limit of quantification were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using model-independent methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were the observed values. Plasma concentration data in the post-distribution phase of the plasma concentration-time plot were fitted using linear regression to the formula ln C=ln Co−t.Kel, where Co was the zero-time intercept of the extrapolated terminal phase and Kel was the terminal elimination rate constant. The half-life (t<sub>1/2 </sub>) was determined using the formula t<sub>1/2</sub>=0.693/Kel. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last determined concentration-time point (tf) in the post distribution phase was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The area under the curve from the last concentration-time point in the post distribution phase (Ctf) to time infinity was calculated from AUC<sub>t-∞</sub>=Ctf/Kel. The concentration used for Ctf was the last determined value above the LLOQ at the time point. The total AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>, was obtained by adding AUC<sub>tf </sub>and AUC<sub>t-∞</sub>. Noribogaine apparent clearance (CL/F) was determined using the formula CL/F=Dose/AUC<sub>0-∞</sub>×1000, and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was determined using the formula Vd/F=(CL/F)/Kel. Total urine noribogaine was the sum of both analytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00314-en" num="0337">Summary statistics (means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation) were determined for each dose group for safety laboratory test data, ECG and pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacodynamic variables. Categorical variables were analysed using counts and percentages. Dose-proportionality of AUC and Cmax was assessed using linear regression. The effect of dose on pharmacodynamic parameter values over time was assessed using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons (with Tukey-Kramer adjustment) between each dose group to the placebo were conducted at each time point using the least squares estimates obtained from the ANOVA, using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS ver 6.0).</p>

      <p id="p-00317-en" num="0339">Noribogaine was rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations occurring 2-3 hours after oral dosing. Fluctuations in individual distribution-phase concentration-time profiles may suggest the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation (see highlighted individual 4-8 hour profiles in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, insert). Both Cmax and AUC increased linearly with dose (Table 1, upper panel). Mean half-life estimates of 28-50 hours were observed across dose groups for noribogaine. Volume of distribution was extensive (1417-3086 L across dose groups).</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0340">Mean plasma noribogaine glucuronide concentration-time plots for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose group are shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, and mean pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 1, lower panel. Noribogaine glucuronide was detected in all subjects by 0.75 hours, with peak concentrations occurring 3-4 hours after noribogaine dosing. Mean half-life of 21-23 hours was estimated for plasma noribogaine glucuronide. The proportion of noribogaine glucuronide Cmax and AUC relative to noribogaine was 3-4% for both dose groups. Total urine noribogaine elimination was 1.16 mg and 0.82 mg for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively, representing 3.9% and 1.4% of the doses administered.</p>

Six adverse events were reported by three participants in the placebo group, five adverse events were reported by two subjects in the 3 mg dose group, and one adverse event was reported by single subjects in the 10 mg and 30 mg dose groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were headache (four reports) and epistaxis (two reports). All adverse events were of mild-moderate intensity, and all resolved prior to study completion. There were no changes in vital signs or safety laboratory tests of note. In particular, there were no changes in oximetry or capnography, or changes in respiratory rate. There were no QTcF values &gt;500 msec at any time. One subject dosed with 10 mg noribogaine had a single increase in QTcF of &gt;60 msec at 24 hours post-dosing.</p>

      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0350">This example is to illustrate that noribogaine can be administered at a therapeutic dosing while maintaining an acceptable QT interval. While the therapy employed is directed to opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the results show that a therapeutic window can be established for noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0351">The efficacy of noribogaine in humans was evaluated in opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients had been receiving methadone treatment as the opioid substitution therapy, but were transferred to morphine treatment prior to noribogaine administration. This was done to avoid negative noribogaine-methadone interactions that are not observed between noribogaine and morphine. See U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,157, filed Mar. 14, 2014 and Ser. No. 14/346,655, filed Mar. 21, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0352">Three cohorts of nine (9) subjects (6 administered noribogaine and 3 administered placebo in each cohort) were evaluated for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Cohort 1 received a single dose of 60 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 2 received a single dose of 120 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 3 received a single dose of 180 mg noribogaine or placebo. Treatment was administered 2 hours after last morphine dose and the time to resumption of morphine (opioid substitution treatment, OST) was determined. Few adverse effects of noribogaine were observed in any of the participants, including no hallucinatory effects. Table 3 shows the reported adverse events for each treatment that were not attributable to withdrawal from opioids. Headaches were frequent in the placebo and 60 mg noribogaine treatment groups, but were attenuated in the 120 mg and 180 mg dose groups.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> indicates the time to resumption of morphine (OST) for patients treated with placebo (circles), 60 mg noribogaine (squares), 120 mg noribogaine (triangles), and 180 mg noribogaine (inverted triangles). Patients receiving a single 120 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids of greater than 20 hours. Patients receiving a single 180 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids similar to that of placebo. This demonstrates that increasing the dose of noribogaine to 180 mg results in a shorter time to resumption of OST than observed in patients receiving 120 mg noribogaine. Time to resumption of OST after treatment with 180 mg was still longer than untreated patients (7 hours, not shown) or those administered 60 mg noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0356">Patients were evaluated based on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) scoring systems over the period of time between administration of noribogaine (or placebo) until resumption of OST. These scales are outlined in Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, World Health Organization, Geneva (2009), Annex 10, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The scales measure the intensity of withdrawal symptoms, based on clinical, subjective, and objective indicia.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0357">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows the COWS scores at time of resumption of OST for each cohort. Box includes values representing 25%-75% quartiles. Diamond=median; crossbar in box=mean; whiskers=values within standard deviation of mid-quartiles. No outliers present. The highly variable COWS scores across and within each cohort indicates that patients were resuming opiates without relation to the intensity of withdrawal. This was also reflected in SOWS and OOWS scores at the time of resumption of OST.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0358">
        <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows the mean change in total COWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the COWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> shows the mean change in total OOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 7B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the OOWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> shows the mean change in total SOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the SOWS total score change from baseline. These data indicate that withdrawal symptoms get worse over time after cessation of OST, and that patients administered placebo experience generally worse withdrawal symptoms over that period. Patients who received 120 mg noribogaine generally experienced fewer withdrawal symptoms than the other patients, regardless of the scale used. Patients administered placebo generally experienced more withdrawal symptoms than patients who were administered noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0359">Patients' QT intervals were evaluated at regular time points throughout the study. <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> shows the average change in QT interval (ΔQTcl, i.e., QT interval prolongation) over the first 24 hours post noribogaine (or placebo) administration. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> shows the estimated correlation between noribogaine concentration and change in QT interval. There is a dose-dependent increase in QT interval prolongation that is correlated with the serum concentration of noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0360">Based on above data, it is believed that the therapeutic window for a single bolus dose of noribogaine is bound at the lower end by 50 mg and at the upper end by less than 180 mg. In particular, the therapeutic serum concentration in vivo appears to be between about 50 ng/mL and about 180 ng/mL.</p>

Cell membranes were thawed on ice and experiments were carried out in a 96-well format. Cell membranes (10 μg per reaction) were incubated in a binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>×6H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and GDP 10 μM, pH 7.4) containing 80 pM [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS and varying concentrations of opioid agonists (U69,593, DAMGO, morphine, dynorphin A, nalmefene, or noribogaine) in a total volume of 100 μL for 60 minutes at 25° C. Membranes were pre-incubated with the GDP for 15 minutes on ice prior to the addition of ligands. Antagonists were added to the membrane solution 20 minutes prior the addition of the agonist, and [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS was added 5 minutes after the agonist. Non-specific and basal levels of GTPγS binding was evaluated by using 10 μM cold GTPγS and binding buffer, respectively.

      <p id="p-00347-en" num="0366">β-arrestin-2 recruitment Assay: The PathHunter enzyme complementation Arrestin-2 Recruitment assay was performed at DiscoveRx Corporation, Fremont, Calif.. This assay utilized CHO—K1 cells stably transfected to overexpress β-arrestin-2 fused to a β-galactosidase fragment together with human OPRK gene (NM<sub>—</sub>000912.3, human KOR) or human OPRM gene (NM<sub>—</sub>000914.3, encoding human MOR). Briefly, when β-arrestin-2 travels to active receptor, the complementary β-galactosidase fragments fused to the receptor and β-arrestin interact to form a functional enzyme with activity that is detected by chemiluminescence. For all in vitro assays, data were normalized as a percentage of control agonist responses, typically defined by dynorphin A stimulated activity in the OPRK assays, and [Met] Enkephalin stimulated activity in the OPRM assays. For agonist dose-response experiments, cells were treated with test compound for 90 minutes prior to assessment of enzyme complementation. For antagonist dose-inhibition experiments, the cells were incubated with the test compound for 30 minutes prior to agonist addition. For OPRK, a dose corresponding to the EC<sub>80 </sub>(316.9 nM) of Dynorphin A was used. For OPRM a dose corresponding to the EC<sub>80 </sub>(2.1 μM) of [Met] Enkephalin was used.</p>
      <p id="p-00348-en" num="0367">Data Analysis: The IC<sub>50 </sub>and K<sub>i </sub>values for ligands in the radioactive binding assays were determined by fitting competition binding data of individual experiments normalized to buffer (total binding) and 1 μM naloxone (nonspecific binding) to a single site competition model in GraphPad Prism 5.04 using the transformation of Cheng and Prusoff (CFeq): K<sub>i</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+[S]/K<sub>m</sub>), where [S] is the concentration of agonist and K<sub>m </sub>is the K<sub>i </sub>value for [<sup>3</sup>H]U69,593 and [<sup>3</sup>H]DAMGO determined by homologous competition. The EC<sub>50 </sub>and E<sub>max </sub>values to agonists for [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding and β-arrestin-2 translocation were determined by fitting data from individual experiments to sigmoidal concentration-response curves with variable slope in GraphPad Prism 5.04. Final mean and S.E.M. were calculated using individual values from each experiment. Functional inhibitory potency (K<sub>e</sub>) values for agonist dose-response displacement experiments were calculated using the Gaddum/Schild EC<sub>50 </sub>shift calculation or with the following equation: K<sub>e</sub>=[nanomolar antagonist]/(dose ratio-1), where dose ratio is the ratio of the EC<sub>50 </sub>for an agonist in the presence and absence of another ligand/inhibitor at a given concentration. K<sub>e </sub>values for dose-inhibition experiments were calculated with a modified CFeq: K<sub>e</sub>=IC<sub>50</sub>/(1+[S]/EC<sub>50</sub>) where [S] is the concentration of agonist used and EC<sub>50 </sub>is the functional potency of the agonist.</p>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0368">Coupling efficiency (e-coupling) values indicated the relationship between the apparent binding affinity K<sub>i </sub>versus the apparent functional potency EC<sub>50 </sub>of a given agonist ligand and used the equation pKi-pEC<sub>50</sub>. For the functional inhibitory components of antagonists and partial agonists, e-coupling represents the relationship between the K<sub>i </sub>versus the K<sub>e </sub>of a given ligand (against Dynorphin A for OPRK assays, and against U69,593 for OPRM assays) and used the equation pK<sub>i</sub>-pK<sub>e</sub>. Efficacy efficiency (e-signal) values indicated the ratio of the E<sub>max </sub>to a given agonist ligand versus the E<sub>max </sub>to Dynorphin A (or U69,593) and uses the equation E<sub>max</sub>(control agonist)/E<sub>max</sub>(test compound). For inhibitory ligands, e-signal was calculated using maximal level of inhibition (I<sub>max</sub>) normalized from 0 (basal, buffer) to 1 (agonist without inhibitor). Bias-coupling (quantification of pathway bias) was evaluated by subtracting the EC<sub>50 </sub>or the K<sub>e </sub>issued from the G-protein pathway assays by those issued from β-arrestin pathway assays for a given ligand and in a linear (nM) scale. Bias-efficacy in favor of the G-protein pathway was evaluated by dividing the functional activation and the functional inhibition maximum responses (e-signal) from the G-protein pathway by the beta-arrestin pathway assays for a given ligand.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0369">μ-Opioid Receptor Ibogaine binding model: The mouse μ-opioid receptor OPRM co-crystal structure available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), PDB accession 4dkl, Uniprot accession P42866, was used. The mouse OPRM has 94% (global) sequence identity to the corresponding human receptor (Uniprot accession P35372) and all residues in the binding site are identical. The receptor was crystallized as a fusion protein (OPRM—T4L) with an irreversible morphine antagonist ligand (bound to Lys233, pdb numbering). All simulations were performed using the Schrodinger 2014.2 and Desmond 2014.2 software suite. For initial docking studies, the PDB file into Maestro 9.5 (Schrodinger) was imported and the standard protein preparation workflow to assign bond orders and clean up the structure including hydrogen bond optimization and constrained minimization was run. In the preparation process missing side chains were added using Prime. The fusion protein was manually cut and removed between residues Val262 and Glu270 to leave just the GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor) transmembrane domain; the cut residues were capped as primary amide (C-terminal) and acetate (N-terminal). A (non-covalent) ligand entry (separate from the chain) was manually created in Maestro. The resulting protein complex was again processed via the protein preparation workflow. A docking grid was created around the co-crystal ligand using Glide (standard settings). Several small molecules including the morphinan co-crystal ligand (unbound), Ibogaine, Noribogaine and Voacangine were imported as 2D SDF into Maestro and 3D structure representations were generated using LigPrep (default settings); two representations (inverted at the tertiary bridgehead nitrogen) were generated for each ligand. These were docking using Glide SP (standard settings except keeping 5 poses per compound out of 30 for post-minimization). The docked morphinan ligand reproduced the co-crystal almost perfectly. This docked complex was then optimized using Prime Refine Protein-Ligand complex (default settings). This complex was then used to generate another docking grid using Glide (default settings around the ligand) followed by Glide SP docking of the prepared ligands. In these results, the top poses of noribogaine and ibogaine aligned well the morphinan antagonist (hydrophobic Ibogaine and Noribogaine bicyclic system and ethyl substituent with morphinan cyclopropyl residues and the positively charged tertiary amines, which all form a hydrogen bond to the site chain of Asp147). The μ-OR noribogaine docking complex was then used in a 12 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The MD system generation and simulations were performed in Desmond using an all atom system with a membrane model and explicit water model (ASP). The Desmond software automatically sets up the systems (adjust charges, adds water molecules) and performs several rounds of minimization and short simulations before the 12 ns production run. MD was run on the Pegasus 2 cluster at the Center for Computational Science at the</p>

Simulation analysis was performed using the Desmond trajectory analysis software. A representative frame with these most prevalent interactions throughout the simulation was extracted from the trajectory, processed via protein preparation (including constrained minimization) to remove overlapping atoms, and visualized using PyMol.</p>

Noribogaine exhibited the highest apparent affinity for OPRK(κ-opioid receptor) with a K<sub>i </sub>value of 720±128 nM. Ibogaine displayed a K<sub>i </sub>of 3.68±0.22 μM, while 18-MC had a K<sub>i </sub>a 1.84±0.12 μM. At the OPRM, noribogaine displayed a K<sub>i </sub>of 1.52±0.3 μM, while ibogaine and 18-MC K<sub>i </sub>values were 6.92±0.83 μM and 2.26±0.35 μM respectively. Values of both noribogaine and ibogaine for the human OPRM/K receptors were comparable that of the calf OPRM and OPRK receptors (1.52 and 0.96 μM, Table 5) where noribogaine was previously shown to be ˜30× less affine at OPRD (δ-opioid receptor) than at OPRK. In assays, 18-MC was equi-affine to both human OPRK and OPRM, contrary to the reported 5× selectivity at OPRM. Experimental values, historical values from the literature, and control ligands, are displayed in Table 5 for agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists used.</p>

      <p id="p-00355-en" num="0373">Functional agonist properties of noribogaine at OPRM and OPRK [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding stimulation: [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to membranes of CHO cells stably transfected with OPRK or OPRM was examined in response to noribogaine, ibogaine, morphine, and nalmefene drug treatment and measured the activation of the G-protein pathway by agonists (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). The prototypical full agonist U69,593, and the endogenous ultra-potent agonist, Dynorphin A, were used as controls for OPRK function and DAMGO was used for OPRM. Calculated EC<sub>50 </sub>and E<sub>max </sub>values are enumerated in Table 6.</p>
      <p id="p-00356-en" num="0374">Noribogaine was marginally active at stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to OPRM, with an E<sub>max </sub>of 10% the full agonist DAMGO (<figref>FIG. 11A</figref>) and comparable to the level of activation previously reported. Morphine was a partial agonist with an E<sub>max </sub>of 80±4.5% of DAMGO signal and an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 32±1.2 nM. The partial agonist buprenorphine stimulated OPRM with an E<sub>max </sub>of 26±2.2% in the assays, and ibogaine and 18-MC failed to stimulate the OPRM G-protein pathway.</p>
      <p id="p-00357-en" num="0375">Noribogaine was a partial agonist at stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to OPRK with an E<sub>max </sub>of 72±3.8% of U69,593, and an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 8.75±1.09 μM (<figref>FIG. 11B</figref>). Ibogaine displayed a lower agonist power than noribogaine at OPRK with an E<sub>max </sub>of 18±1.4%, while 18-MC failed to stimulate [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to OPRK. In the assays, morphine and dynorphin A displayed E<sub>max </sub>values of 91±7% and 94±7% respectively, and nalmefene, a partial agonist of OPRK, maximally stimulated at 35±4.7% and similar to formally reported values.</p>
      <p id="p-00358-en" num="0376">The coupling efficiencies of agonists DAMGO, U69,593, morphine, dynorphin A, nalmefene, 6′GNTI, noribogaine and ibogaine at the G-protein pathway were calculated and found to be congruent with values shifted by ˜1 log (Tables 2 and 5). Dynorphin A and 6′GNTI were outliers and displayed better coupling efficiencies (0.56 and 0.26) than other agonists at stimulating [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding in comparison to their apparent binding affinities against [<sup>3</sup>H]U69,593 and [<sup>3</sup>H]diprenorphin (Tables 2 and 5).</p>
      <p id="p-00359-en" num="0377">As shown in Table 6, activation and inhibition by noribogaine of [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding in CHO—K1 stably expressing human OPRM and OPRK were examined. Data used for the non-linear regression analysis are shown as the mean±SEM of (n) experiments. [Met]-Enkephalin and 6′GTNI values were gathered from references as indicated. Non-italic section indicates values (EC<sub>50</sub>) for the activation component of the ligand and italic section indicates the values (K<sub>e</sub>) for the inhibitory component of the ligand. Coupling efficiency (e-coupling) was calculated as in methods. Outliers are underlined.</p>

      <p id="p-00361-en" num="0378">Functional inhibitory properties of noribogaine at OPRM [<sup>35 </sup>S]GTPγS binding stimulation: Noribogaine marginally stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding via OPRM with an approximated EC<sub>50 </sub>of 16 μM (<figref>FIG. 11A</figref>). Therefore, whether noribogaine was an antagonist of OPRM was investigated. DAMGO and morphine dose responses were carried out in the presence and absence of 150 μM of noribogaine (<figref>FIG. 12A</figref>). Noribogaine was an inhibitor of both agonists tested and right-shifted their EC<sub>50 </sub>by a magnitude of ˜1 log. The calculated K<sub>e </sub>values (see methods) were 19±5 μM against DAMGO and 28±14 μM against morphine (Table 6) and both were in the concentration range of the EC<sub>50 </sub>of noribogaine at OPRM G-protein pathway. In a similar design, naloxone displayed a K<sub>e </sub>of 3.36±0.75 nM, a value close to its K<sub>i </sub>at OPRM (Table 5 and 6). Noribogaine also decreased the E<sub>max </sub>of both DAMGO and morphine dose-responses curves in this assay (<figref>FIG. 12A</figref>), indicating partial unsurmountable antagonism that can encompass several distinct molecular mechanisms such as (a) irreversible competitive antagonism, (b) noncompetitive antagonism, and/or (c) functional antagonism; for review. Dose-inhibition curves of noribogaine against increasing doses of DAMGO were performed (<figref>FIG. 12B</figref>). Noribogaine dose-dependently inhibited DAMGO-stimulated [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding at OPRM with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 134±17 μM independent of the agonist concentrations of DAMGO. As shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, noribogaine inhibits agonist-induced [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding at the mu receptor (OPRM).</p>
      <p id="p-00362-en" num="0379">Functional inhibition of noribogaine-induced OPRK [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding by antagonist: inhibitory effects of naloxone, Nor-BNI, and nalmefene on the agonist-induced [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding to OPRK by noribogaine and U69,593, Dynorphin A, morphine, and nalmefene were investigated (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>, Table 7). Dose-responses to these agonists were gathered in the absence and presence of fixed antagonist concentration: 30 nM Naloxone, 5 nM Nor-BNI, and 3 nM nalmefene. The compound 18-MC was examined, which appeared to be an antagonist in this assay with a K<sub>e </sub>of 4.5±1.4 μM against U69,593.</p>
      <p id="p-00363-en" num="0380">Antagonists and partial agonist nalmefene dose-dependently right-shifted the dose-response curves of noribogaine, consistent with the addition of a surmountable competitor of the noribogaine binding site (<figref>FIG. 17</figref>). Functional inhibition constants (K<sub>e</sub>) for antagonists are shown in Table 7 with the assumption of ideal conditions of competitiveness and equilibrium. In all instances, the functional inhibition constants for these inhibitors were close to their K<sub>i</sub>, indicating that noribogaine was no different than other agonists tested and was apparently competing for a common binding site.</p>
      <p id="p-00364-en" num="0381">As shown in Table 7, functional inhibition constants K<sub>e </sub>of Noribogaine and other ligands to agonist-induced [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding in CHO—K1 stably expressing human OPRK were examined. Data used for the non-linear regression analysis are shown as the mean±SEM of 3 up to 7 experiments. Italic value represents the estimate of a hypothetical functional activation constant of designated agonist in the presence of other agonists.</p>

      <p id="p-00366-en" num="0382">Residual functional antagonist properties of noribogaine at OPRK [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding stimulation: Noribogaine was a partial agonist at OPRK in the [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding stimulation assays (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). Therefore, whether noribogaine, termed here as ‘rival agonist’, and the partial agonists nalmefene was able to functionally compete with and level down the activity of more efficacious agonists than itself was determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00367-en" num="0383">Dynorphin A and morphine dose-responses curves were performed in the presence and the absence of rival agonists nalmefene or noribogaine at concentrations of˜5× their EC<sub>50 </sub>(nalmefene 3 nM, noribogaine 50 μM) (<figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, <b>13</b>C). Nalmefene readily right-shifted the EC<sub>50 </sub>of Dynorphin A and morphine with an apparent K<sub>e </sub>of 0.077±0.016 nM and 0.11±0.005 nM, within the range of its apparent Ki (0.08 nM) and similar to the pure antagonist NorBNI (nor-binaltorphimine) (Table 7). Noribogaine, on the other hand, poorly right-shifted the EC<sub>50 </sub>of these agonists and the K<sub>e </sub>estimates in these conditions were 40±16 μM and 15±4 μM respectively, about 40× its (Table 7, underlined values).</p>
      <p id="p-00368-en" num="0384">In another set of experiments (<figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, <b>13</b>D), noribogaine and nalmefene dose-response curves were produced in the presence of a set concentration of agonists. Nalmefene readily leveled-down the signal of moderate to high concentrations of rival full (U69,593) or partial (noribogaine) agonists to its own reduced levels (30%) with an apparent IC<sub>50 </sub>proportional to the rival agonist concentration (including noribogaine). Noribogaine also leveled-down the signal of high concentrations of rival agonists to its own reduced signal (70%), but the IC<sub>50 </sub>values were high (100-300 μM range). Finally, the apparent functional potency of dynorphin A, U69,593 and morphine were estimated by being set as rival agonist dose-responses in the presence of either noribogaine or nalmefene. In this setting, the calculated K<sub>e </sub>(activation) for all rival agonists were lower in the presence of noribogaine than in the presence of nalmefene (close to their experimental EC<sub>50</sub>) and showed that noribogaine was a somewhat poor functional blocker of these agonists (Table 7, underlined values). As shown in <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, noribogaine partially inhibits of agonist-induced [35S]GTPγS binding at the kappa receptor (OPRK).</p>
      <p id="p-00369-en" num="0385">Functional antagonist properties of noribogaine at OPRK-mediated β-arrestin-2 recruitment: PathHunter β-Arrestin GPCR assays detecting the interaction of β-Arrestin with the activated receptor were used to measure non-G protein OPRM and OPRK activity. Dose-response curves to noribogaine were compared to full agonists [Met]-enkephalin (OPRM), and Dynorphin A (OPRK) drug treatments</p>
      <p id="p-00370-en" num="0386">(<figref>FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>). Calculated EC<sub>50 </sub>values, maximal responses and coupling efficiencies are shown in Table 8. Control agonist [Met]-Enkephalin displayed an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 193±11 nM at OPRM and Dynorphin A displayed an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 82±21 nM at OPRK. Noribogaine displayed a profound functional bias at OPRK and was marginally efficacious at inducing β-Arrestin-2 recruitment at OPRK with an E<sub>max </sub>of 12.6±3% of dynorphin A maximal stimulation and an estimated EC<sub>50 </sub>of 265 nM. Noribogaine was also not an agonist at OPRM.</p>
      <p id="p-00371-en" num="0387">Noribogaine was then tested for its ability to inhibit agonist-induced β-Arrestin-2 recruitment at OPRM and OPRK (<figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, <b>14</b>B). In these assays, β-Arrestin-2 recruitment was induced by the agonists [Met]-Enkephalin (OPRM) and Dynorphin A (OPRK) at their EC<sub>80 </sub>concentration and challenged with increasing concentrations of noribogaine. Noribogaine inhibited agonist responses at OPRM and OPRK up to 60-100% and ˜60%, with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of ˜57 μM and 1.45±1.1 μM respectively (<figref>FIG. 14</figref>). The K<sub>e </sub>values were ˜4.8 μM and 262 nM for OPRM and OPRK respectively (Table 8). Thus, noribogaine was apparently 144× more potent at inhibiting Dynorphin A-induced β-arrestin-2 recruitment than at inhibiting Dynorphin A-induced G-protein activation (Table 9). As shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, noribogaine inhibits agonist-induced β-arrestin recruitment at the mu (OPRM) and kappa (OPRK) receptors.</p>
      <p id="p-00372-en" num="0388">As shown in Table 8, activation and inhibition by Noribogaine of β-arrestin 2 recruitment in CHO—K1 stably expressing human OPRM and OPRK were examined. Data used for the non-linear regression analysis are shown as the mean±SEM of one standardized experiment. Morphine, buprenorphine and 6′GTNI values were gathered from references as indicated. Non-italic section indicates values (EC<sub>50</sub>) for the activation component of the ligand and italic section indicates the values (K<sub>e</sub>) for the inhibitory component of the ligand.

      <p id="p-00375-en" num="0389">Binding Model of noribogaine and ibogaine to the inactive conformation of OPRM: An in silico binding model was developed based on the mouse OPRM co-crystal structure [PMID 22437502] as described in methods. The mouse and human OPRM share 94% (global) sequence identity and all binding site residues are identical. After initial optimization of the model, the top docking poses of noribogaine and ibogaine were pharmacophorically aligned with the co-crystal morphinan antagonist: the hydrophobic ibogaine and noribogaine bicyclic system and ethyl substituent with morphinan cyclopropyl residues were spatially aligned and the positively charged tertiary amines were superimposed with each forming a hydrogen bond to the site chain of Asp147. Then, the noribogaine and ibogaine OPRM complexes were each used in a 12 ns all atom explicit water molecular dynamics simulation. Trajectory analysis revealed the most prevalent interactions of noribogaine (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>) and ibogaine. Both ligands formed a stable hydrogen bond with Asp147 via their tertiary amine Noribogaine and ibogaine formed pi-cation interaction with Tyr148 (64 and 56%, respectively), and hydrophobic interactions with His297 (64 and 93%, respectively). Further hydrophobic interactions were observed between Val236 (˜40 and ˜60%, respectively), Tyr326 (˜20 and ˜40% respectively), Met151 (˜20% and ˜30%, respectively) and also Trp293, Ile296, Val300. Characteristically, noribogaine, but not ibogaine, formed a water bridge with Tyr148 for 34% of the simulation time. Both ligands showed a hydrogen bond with His297 for about 20% of the simulation. Movies of the simulations were generated and are available as supporting material. A representative illustration frame of noribogaine in the OPRM was extracted from the simulation and is shown in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, inhibition of Noribogaine induced [35S]GTPγS binding by OPRK antagonists.</p>
      <p id="p-00376-en" num="0390">In some embodiments, noribogaine is shown to be a dual ligand of both mu and kappa opioid receptors (OPRM and OPRK) with peculiar pharmacological properties. In some embodiments, noribogaine displayed mixed agonism-antagonism properties and a profound G-protein bias at the opioid receptors. In some embodiments, noribogaine also incurred functional selectivity to the otherwise unbiased dynorphin A signaling and the kappa system.</p>
      <p id="p-00377-en" num="0391">Noribogaine is the primary metabolite of the anti-addictive substance ibogaine, which modulates opiate analgesic activity and the components of drug addiction in animal models at brain concentrations of 0.5-15 μM. Noribogaine was a moderately potent antagonist of the OPRM G-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways (20 μM; 48 μM). Noribogaine was a partial agonist at the OPRK G-protein pathway and activated at 75% the maximal efficacy of Dynorphin A (Dyn-A), a potency of 9 μM and weak inhibitory properties (40 μM, 25% against Dyn-A). Noribogaine was a biased agonist and poorly activated the OPRK β-arrestin pathway at 12% of Dyn-A maximal efficacy. Noribogaine was able to functionally inhibit Dyn-A-induced β-arrestin recruitment (Dyn-A EC<sub>50</sub>: 82 nM) at physiologically relevant concentrations (IC<sub>50 </sub>of 1.45 μM at 370 nM Dyn-A). Computational simulations indicated that noribogaine may bind to the orthosteric morphinan binding site of the receptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00378-en" num="0392">Noribogaine is demonstrated to be a mixed agonist-antagonist of OPRK and OPRM as well as a profound G-protein biased OPRK ligand. Ibogaine and 18-MC were either not agonists or poor agonists of OPRM or OPRK. 18-MC was a regular competitive antagonist of agonist-induced OPRK signaling. Noribogaine may belong to a different class of opioid ligands than ibogaine or 18-MC.</p>
