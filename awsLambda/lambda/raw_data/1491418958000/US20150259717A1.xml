      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method for producing an acidic substance having a carboxyl group. L-Glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid are widely used as raw materials in making seasonings and so forth. Succinic acid is widely used as a raw material in making seasonings and biodegradable plastics.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Brief Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">L-Glutamic acid is mainly produced by fermentation utilizing L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria of the so-called coryneform bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium </i>or <i>Microbacterium</i>, or their mutant strains (see, for example, Kunihiko Akashi et al., Amino Acid Fermentation, Japan Scientific Societies Press (Gakkai Shuppan Center), pp. 195-215, 1986). Methods are known for producing L-glutamic acid by fermentation using other bacterial strains, including microorganisms belonging to the genera <i>Bacillus, Streptomyces, Penicillium </i>or the like (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,220,929), microorganisms belonging to the genera <i>Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Serratia, Candida </i>or the like (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,563,857), microorganisms belonging to the genera <i>Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Aerobacter aerogenes </i>(currently referred to as <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>) or the like (see, for example, Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 32-9393), a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli </i>(see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open (KOKAI) No. 5-244970), and the like. In addition, methods for producing L-glutamic acid have also been disclosed using microorganisms belonging to the genera <i>Klebsiella, Erwinia, Pantoea </i>or <i>Enterobacter </i>(see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-106869 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,682,912), Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-189169 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2001009836), Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-189175 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,459)).</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Furthermore, various techniques have been disclosed for increasing the L-glutamic acid-producing ability by enhancing the L-glutamic acid biosynthetic enzymes using recombinant DNA techniques. For example, it has been reported for <i>Corynebacterium </i>or <i>Brevibacterium </i>bacteria that introduction of a gene coding for citrate synthase derived from <i>Escherichia coli </i>or <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum </i>was effective to enhance the L-glutamic acid-producing ability of coryneform bacteria (see, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 7-121228). Furthermore, it has also been reported that introduction of a citrate synthase gene derived from a coryneform bacterium into enterobacteria belonging to the genera <i>Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia, Erwinia </i>or <i>Escherichia </i>was effective to enhance the bacteria's L-glutamic acid-producing ability (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-189175 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,459)).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Methods for improving the production of target substances such as amino acids are also known, including by modifying the uptake or secretion systems of target substances. Such methods include, for example, by deleting or attenuating the system for uptake of a target substance into cells. Specifically, known methods to improve production of L-glutamic acid include deleting the gluABCD operon, or a part thereof, to eliminate or attenuate uptake of L-glutamic acid into cells (see, for example, European Patent Application Laid-open No. 1038970), and enhancing production of purine nucleotides by attenuating uptake of purine nucleotides into cells (see, for example, European Patent Application Laid-open No. 1004663), and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Furthermore, methods of enhancing the secretion system for a target substance, and methods of deleting or attenuating the secretion system for an intermediate or substrate in the biosynthetic system of a target substance are known. Known methods of enhancing the secretion system of a target substance include, for example, production of L-lysine by utilizing a <i>Corynebacterium </i>strain in which the L-lysine secretion gene (lysE) is enhanced (see, for example, WO2001/5959), and production of L-glutamic acid by using an enterobacterium in which the L-glutamic acid secretion system gene (yhfK) is enhanced (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-278643 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2005196846)). Furthermore, methods for producing an L-amino acid using the rhtA, B, C genes, which have been suggested to be involved in the secretion of L-amino acids, have also been reported (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-189177 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2005239177)). Known methods for, for example, deleting a secretion system for an intermediate or substrate in a biosynthesis system of a target substance include, for L-glutamic acid, mutating or disrupting the 2-oxoglutarate permease gene to attenuate secretion of 2-oxoglutarate, which is an intermediate of the target substance (see, for example, WO97/23597).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Furthermore, use of the gene coding for the ATP binding cassette superfamily (ABC transporter), which is involved in transportation of substances through cell membranes, in the breeding of microorganisms in which transmembrane transportation of amino acids is modified has been suggested (see, for example, WO00/37647).</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Furthermore, it has also been reported that L-glutamic acid production efficiency can be improved in <i>Escherichia </i>bacteria by enhancing the expression of genes thought to participate in secretion of L-amino acids such as yfiK (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-189180 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,979,560)). Moreover, it has also been reported that L-glutamic acid-producing ability can be improved by enhancing expression of the yhfK gene (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-278643 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2005196846)).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Moreover, methods are known for producing L-glutamic acid by culturing a microorganism under acidic conditions to precipitate the L-glutamic acid (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2007134773)). When the pH is kept low, L-glutamic acid is precipitated, and the ratio of L-glutamic acid in free form with no electrical charge increases. As a result, the L-glutamic acid easily penetrates cell membranes. When L-glutamic acid is taken up into cells, it is converted into an intermediate of the TCA cycle, 2-oxoglutaric acid, in one step by glutamate dehydrogenase, and therefore it is generally thought that L-glutamic acid taken up into cells is easily metabolized. However, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity can be deleted or attenuated, or the like, in the fermentative production of L-glutamic acid (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2007134773), Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 7-203980 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,945)), but then 2-oxoglutaric acid is not degraded, intracellular 2-oxoglutaric acid concentration increases which inhibits the growth of the microorganism. Thus, the culture fails. Therefore, as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769 (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 2007134773), a strain was bred using a mutation that is deficient in 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and can produce L-glutamic acid accompanying precipitation, and this strain can be used for the production of L-glutamic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">For fermentative production of non-amino organic acids, including succinic acid, anaerobic bacteria including those belonging to the genus <i>Anaerobiospirillum </i>or <i>Actinobacillus </i>are usually used (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,142,834 and 5,504,004, Guettler, M. V. et al., 1999, International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, 49:207-216). Although the use of such anaerobic bacteria provides high product yields, many nutrients are required for sufficient proliferation, and therefore, it is necessary to add large amounts of organic nitrogen sources such as corn steep liquor (CSL) into the culture medium. The addition of large amounts of organic nitrogen sources can result in not only an increase in the cost of the culture, but also an increase in the cost for isolating or purifying the product, and therefore, their use is not economical.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In addition, methods are known in which aerobic bacteria such as coryneform bacteria are cultured once under aerobic conditions, then harvested, washed, and allowed to rest, producing a non-amino organic acid in the absence of supplied oxygen (Japanese Patent Laid-open Nos. 11-113588 and 11-196888). These methods are economical since a smaller amount of organic nitrogen can be added, and the bacteria will sufficiently grow in a simple culture medium. However, there is still a room for improvement in terms of production amount, concentration, and production rate per cell of the target organic acids, as well as simplification of the production process, and the like. Furthermore, the production of a non-amino organic acid by fermentation using a bacterium in which phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity is enhanced (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 11-196887), and the like have also been reported.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Furthermore, as for <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which is a facultative anaerobic gram negative bacterium, methods for producing a non-amino organic acid by culturing it once under aerobic conditions, and then allowing the cells to rest in the absence of supplied oxygen, resulting in an anaerobically produced non-amino organic acid (Vemuri G. N. et al., 2002, Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, 28(6):325-332). This is similar to the methods using coryneform bacteria. Alternatively, <i>E. coli </i>can be aerobically cultured to aerobically produce the non-amino organic acid (U.S. Patent Published Application No. 20050170482). However, since <i>Escherichia coli </i>is a gram negative bacterium, it is vulnerable to osmotic pressure, and there remains room for improvement in productivity per cell etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The ybjL gene is located on the genome of <i>Escherichia coli </i>(see, for example, Blattner, F. R. et al., 1997, Science, 277(5331):1453-74), and it is also thought to code for a transporter on the basis of the motifs, topology etc. of the deduced amino acid sequence. However, cloning of the gene, as well as expression of the gene and analysis of the expression product have not been reported, and the actual functions of the gene remained unknown.</p>

      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">&lt;1&gt; Microorganism Having Ability to Produce Acidic Substance Having a Carboxyl Group</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The microorganism in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter has an ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group and has been modified so that expression of the ybjL gene is enhanced. The term âability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ can mean the ability of a microorganism to produce and cause accumulation of an acidic substance having a carboxyl group in a medium or cells to such a degree that the acidic substance having a carboxyl group can be collected from the cells or medium when the microorganism of the present invention is cultured in the medium. The microorganism can originally have the ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, or the ability to produce an acidic substance can be obtained by modifying a microorganism such as those described below using mutation or recombinant DNA techniques. Also, a microorganism can be imparted with the ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, or the ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group can be enhanced by introducing the gene described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the present invention, the âacidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ can mean an organic compound having one or more carboxyl groups and which is acidic when the substance is in the free form, and not in the salt form. Specifically, examples include organic acids and L-amino acids having two carboxyl groups, for example, acidic amino acids. Examples of the L-amino acids include L-glutamic acid and L-aspartic acid, and examples of the organic acids include succinic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, oxalacetic acid, citric acid, isocitric acid, Î±-ketoglutaric acid, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The parent strain which can be used to derive the microorganism in accordance with the presently disclosed subject matter is not particularly limited, and can include bacteria, for example, Enterobacteriaceae, rumen bacteria, and coryneform bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The Enterobacteriaceae family encompasses bacteria belonging to the genera <i>Escherichia, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Photorhabdus, Providencia, Raoultella, Salmonella, Serratia, Shigella, Morganella, Yersinia</i>, and the like. In particular, bacteria classified into the family Enterobacteriaceae according to the taxonomy used by the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=91347) are examples. Among these, bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia, Enterobacter, Raoultella, Pantoea, Klebsiella</i>, or <i>Serratia </i>are particular examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">A âbacterium belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia</i>â means that the bacterium is classified into the genus <i>Escherichia </i>according to the classification known to a person skilled in the art of microbiology, although the bacterium is not particularly limited. Examples of the bacterium belonging to the genus <i>Escherichia </i>include, but are not limited to, <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>). Other examples include, for example, the bacteria of the phyletic groups described in the work of Neidhardt et al. (Neidhardt F. C. Ed., 1996, <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Salmonella</i>: Cellular and Molecular Biology/Second Edition, pp. 2477-2483, Table 1, American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.). Specific examples include <i>Escherichia coli </i>W3110 (ATCC 27325), <i>Escherichia coli </i>MG1655 (ATCC 47076), and the like, and others derived from the prototype wild-type strain, the K12 strain.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">These strains are available from, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (Address: 12301 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20108, United States of America). That is, registration numbers are given to each of the strains, and the strains can be ordered by using these numbers. The registration numbers of the strains are listed in the catalogue of the American Type Culture Collection.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <i>Pantoea, Erwinia, </i>and <i>Enterobacter </i>bacteria are classified as Î³-proteobacteria, and they are taxonomically very close to one another (J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol., 1997, 43, 355-361; Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 1997, 43, 1061-1067). In recent years, some bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Enterobacter </i>were reclassified as <i>Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea dispersa, </i>or the like, on the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments etc. (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 1989, 39:337-345). Furthermore, some bacteria belonging to the genus <i>Erwinia </i>were reclassified as <i>Pantoea ananas </i>or <i>Pantoea stewartii </i>(refer to Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 1993, 43:162-173).</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Examples of the <i>Enterobacter bacteria </i>include <i>Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter aerogenes, </i>and the like. Specifically, the strains exemplified in European Patent Application Laid-open No. 952221 can be used. Typical strains of the genus <i>Enterobacter </i>include <i>Enterobacter agglomerans </i>ATCC 12287, <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>ATCC 13048, <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>NBRC 12010 (Biotechnol Bioeng., 2007, Mar. 27; 98(2):340-348), and <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637 (FERM ABP-10955), and the like. The AJ110637 strain was obtained from the soil at the seashore of Susuki Kaigan, Makinohara-shi, Shizuoka-ken on March, 2006 by cumulative liquid culture using glycerol as the carbon source. The full-length 16S rDNA sequence was then determined, and it was found to be 99.9% homologous to that from <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>NCTC 10006. Moreover, in a physiological test using an API kit, the strain gave results similar to the prototype species of <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>, and therefore it was identified as <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>. This strain was deposited at International Patent Organism Depository, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305-8566, Japan) on Aug. 22, 2007, and assigned an accession number of FERM P-21348. Then, the deposit was converted to an international deposit based on the Budapest Treaty on Mar. 13, 2008, and assigned an accession number of FERM ABP-10955.</p>

        <i>Raouhella planticola </i>ATCC 33531 strain</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Although the AJ13399 strain and the AJ13410 strain were classified as <i>Klebsiella planticola </i>at the time of the deposit, <i>Klebsiella planticola </i>is currently classified into <i>Raoultella planticola </i>(Drancourt, M., 2001, Int.

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">&lt;1-1&gt; Imparting an Ability to Produce an Acidic Substance Having a Carboxyl Group</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Hereinafter, methods for imparting an ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group to bacteria, or methods for enhancing the ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group are described.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">To impart an ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, methods conventionally employed in the breeding of bacteria for producing substances by fermentation (see âAmino Acid Fermentationâ, Japan Scientific Societies Press, 1st Edition, published May 30, 1986, pp. 77-100) can be applied. Such methods include the acquisition of an auxotrophic mutant, an analogue-resistant strain, or a metabolic regulation mutant, or construction of a recombinant strain having enhanced expression of an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of acidic substances having a carboxyl group. In the breeding of bacteria that produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, one or more properties, such as auxotrophic mutation, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation, can be imparted. The expression of one or two or more enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of an acidic substance having a carboxyl group can be enhanced. Furthermore, the impartation of properties such as auxotrophic mutation, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation can be combined with the enhancement of the biosynthetic enzymes.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">A mutant strain auxotrophic for an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, a strain resistant to an analogue of an acidic substance having a carboxyl group, or a metabolic regulation mutant strain can be obtained by subjecting a parent or wild-type strain to a conventional mutagenesis, such as exposure to X-rays or UV irradiation, or a treatment with a mutagen such as N-methyl-Nâ²-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and then selecting bacteria which exhibit an autotrophy, analogue resistance, or metabolic regulation mutation and which also have the ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">Methods for imparting an amino acid- or organic acid-producing ability to microorganisms, and amino acid- or organic acid-producing bacteria will be specifically exemplified below.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">&lt;L-Glutamic Acid-Producing Bacteria&gt;</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Examples of the method of modifying a microorganism to impart L-glutamic acid-producing ability to the microorganism include, for example, enhancing expression of a gene coding for an enzyme involved in L-glutamic acid biosynthesis. Examples of an enzyme involved in L-glutamic acid biosynthesis include glutamate dehydrogenase (âGDHâ)(gdh), glutamine synthetase (glnA), glutamate synthetase (gltAB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icdA), aconitate hydratase (acnA, acnB), citrate synthase (âCSâ)(gltA), methylcitrate synthase (hereinafter also referred to as âPRPCâ (prpC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (âPEPCâ) (ppc), pyruvate carboxylase (pyc), pyruvate dehydrogenase (aceEF, lpdA), pyruvate kinase (pykA, pykF), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (ppsA), enolase (eno), phosphoglyceromutase (pgmA, pgml), phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk), glyceraldehyde-3-phophate dehydrogenase (gapA), triose phosphate isomerase (tpiA), fructose bisphosphate aldolase (fbp), phosphofructokinase (pfkA, pfkB), and glucose phosphate isomerase (pgi), and the like. The capital letter abbreviations in parentheses after the enzyme names are the enzyme abbrevation, while the lower case abbreviations indicate the name of the gene encoding the enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Methods for modifying a microorganism to increase expression of a target gene will be explained below.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The first method is to increase the copy number of the target gene by cloning the target gene on an appropriate plasmid and transforming the chosen host bacterium with the obtained plasmid. For example, when the target gene is the gene coding for CS (gltA gene), the gene coding for PEPC (ppc gene) or the gene coding for GDH (gdhA gene), nucleotide sequences of these genes from <i>Escherichia </i>bacteria and <i>Corynebacterium </i>bacteria have already been reported (Ner, S. et al., 1983, Biochemistry, 22:5243-5249; Fujita, N. et al., 1984, J. Biochem., 95:909-916; Valle, F. et al., 1984, Gene, 27:193-199; Microbiology, 140:1817-1828, 1994; Eikmanns, B. J. et al., 1989, Mol. Gen. Genet., 218:330-339; Bormann, E. R. et al., 1992, Molecular Microbiology, 6:317-326), and therefore they can be obtained by synthesizing primers based on their respective nucleotide sequences, and performing PCR using chromosomal DNA as the template.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Examples of plasmids which can be used for transformation include a plasmid which autonomously replicates in the host bacterium belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as pUC19, pUC18, pBR322, RSF1010, pHSG299, pHSG298, pHSG399, pHSG398, pSTV28, pSTV29 (pHSG and pSTV are available from Takara Bio), pMW119, pMW118, pMW219, pMW218 (pMW vectors are available from Nippon Gene), and the like. Moreover, a phage DNA can also be used as the vector instead of a plasmid. Examples of plasmids for simultaneously enhancing the activities of CS or PRPC, PEPC, and GDH as described above include RSFCPG which includes the gltA gene, ppc gene, and gdhA gene (refer to European Patent Laid-open No. 0952221), and RSFPPG which is the same as RSFCPG, but the gltA gene is replaced with the prpC gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Examples of transformation methods include treating recipient cells with calcium chloride so to increase permeability for DNA, which has been reported for <i>Escherichia coli </i>K-12 (Mandel, M. and Higa, A., 1970, J. Mol. Biol., 53:159-162), and preparing competent cells from cells which are in the growth phase, followed by transformation with DNA, which has been reported for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>(Duncan, C. H., et al., 1977, Gene, 1:153-167). Alternatively, a method of making potential host cells into protoplasts or spheroplasts, which can easily take up recombinant DNA, followed by introducing the recombinant DNA into the cells. This method is known to be applicable to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, actinomycetes and yeasts (Chang, S. and Choen, S. N., 1979, Molec. Gen. Genet., 168:111-115; Bibb, M. J. et al., 1978, Nature, 274:398-400; Hinnen, A., et al., 1978, Proc. Natl. Sci., USA, 75:1929-1933). In addition, microorganisms can also be transformed by the electric pulse method (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-207791).</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The copy number of a target gene can also be increased by introducing multiple copies of the gene into the chromosomal DNA of the microorganism. Multiple copies of a gene can be introduced into the chromosomal DNA by homologous recombination (Experiments in Molecular Genetics, 1972, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) using multiple copies of a sequence as targets in the chromosomal DNA. Sequences, which are present in multiple copies on the chromosomal DNA, repetitive DNAs, and inverted repeats present at the end of a transposable element, are exemplary. Also, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-109985, it is possible to incorporate a target gene into a transposon, and allow it to be transferred to introduce multiple copies of the gene into the chromosomal DNA. The target gene can also be introduced into the bacterial chromosome by using Mu phage (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-109985).</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The second method is to increase expression of the target gene by replacing an expression regulatory sequence of the target gene, such as promoter, on the chromosomal DNA or plasmid with a stronger promoter. For example, the lac promoter, trp promoter, trc promoter, etc. are known as strong promoters. Moreover, it is also possible to substitute several nucleotides in the promoter region of a gene so that the promoter is stronger, or to modify the SD sequence as disclosed in International Patent Publication WO00/18935. Examples of methods for evaluating the strength of promoters and strong promoters are described in the article of Goldstein et al. (Goldstein, M. A., and Doi, R. H., 1995, Biotechnol. Annu. Rev., 1:105-128), etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Substitution of an expression regulatory sequence can be performed, for example, in the same manner as for gene substitution using a temperature-sensitive plasmid. Examples of vectors having a temperature-sensitive replication origin and are usable for <i>Escherichia coli </i>and <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>include, for example, the pMAN997 plasmid described in International Publication WO99/03988, and the like.

Examples of the ybjL gene derived from <i>Photobacterium profundum </i>include a gene coding for a protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 35 (SEQ ID NO: 34).

The amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by the ybjL genes of <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Erwinia carotovora, Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas hydrophila </i>and <i>Photobacterium profundum </i>described above are 96%, 90%, 88%, 64%, 60% and 68% homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, respectively, and 86%, 90%, 84%, 63%, 60% and 67% homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively.

      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">The term âybjL gene homologueâ refers to a gene derived from a microorganism other than <i>Escherichia coli, Pantoea ananatis</i>, and <i>Enterobacter aerogenes</i>, which exhibits high structural similarity to the ybjL gene of <i>Escherichia coli, Pantoea ananatis</i>, or <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>and codes for a protein that improves an ability of a microorganism to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group when expression of the gene is enhanced in the microorganism. Examples of ybjL gene homologues include genes coding for a protein having a homology of 70% or more, 80% or more in another example, 90% or more in another example, 95% or more in another example, 97% or more in another example, to the entire amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4 or 87 or the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4 or 87, and which improves an ability to produce an acidic substance having a carboxyl group of a microorganism when expression of the gene is enhanced in the microorganism. The ybjL gene homologue can code for a protein having a homology of 70% or more, 80% or more in another example, 90% or more in another example, 95% or more in another example, or 97% or more in another example, to any of the aforementioned amino acid sequences, and the consensus sequences of the SEQ ID NOS: 5 or 88. Homology of the amino acid sequences and nucleotide sequences can be determined by using, for example, the algorithm BLAST of Karlin and Altschul (Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5873 (1993)) or FASTA (Methods Enzymol., 183, 63 (1990)). Programs called BLASTN and BLASTX were developed on the basis of the algorithm BLAST (refer to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The term âhomologyâ can also be used to mean âidentityâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">The ybjL gene can have one or more conservative mutations, and can be artificially modified, so long as enhancement of the tbjL gene's expression results in an improved ability to produce a target substance by a microorganism. That is, the ybjL gene can encode for an amino acid sequence of a known protein, for example, a protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35 or 87, but which includes a conservative mutation, specifically, substitution, deletion, insertion or addition, of one or several amino acid residues at one or several positions. Although the number meant by the term âseveralâ can differ depending on the position in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, or the type of amino acid residue. For example, it can be 1 to 20, 1 to 10 in another example, 1 to 5 in another example. Furthermore, the ybjL gene can encode for a protein having a homology of 70% or more, 80% or more in another example, 90% or more in another example, 95% or more in another example, or 97% or more in another example, to the entire amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35 or 87, and which improves an ability to produce a target substance by a microorganism when expression of the gene is enhanced in the microorganism.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">The aforementioned conservative substitution can be neutral, in that the function of the protein is not changed. The conservative mutation can take place mutually among Phe, Trp and Tyr, if the substitution site is an aromatic amino acid; among Leu, Ile and Val, if the substitution site is a hydrophobic amino acid; between Gln and Asn, if it is a polar amino acid; among Lys, Arg and His, if it is a basic amino acid; between Asp and Glu, if it is an acidic amino acid; and between Ser and Thr, if it is an amino acid having hydroxyl group. Specific examples of substitution considered conservative substitution include: substitution of Ser or Thr for Ala; substitution of Gln, His or Lys for Arg; substitution of Glu, Gln, Lys, His or Asp for Asn; substitution of Asn, Glu or Gln for Asp; substitution of Ser or Ala for Cys; substitution of Asn, Glu, Lys, His, Asp or Arg for Gln; substitution of Gly, Asn, Gln, Lys or Asp for Glu; substitution of Pro for Gly; substitution of Asn, Lys, Gln, Arg or Tyr for His; substitution of Leu, Met, Val or Phe for Ile; substitution of Be, Met, Val or Phe for Leu; substitution of Asn, Glu, Gln, His or Arg for Lys; substitution of Ile, Leu, Val or Phe for Met; substitution of Trp, Tyr, Met, Ile or Leu for Phe; substitution of Thr or Ala for Ser; substitution of Ser or Ala for Thr; substitution of Phe or Tyr for Trp; substitution of His, Phe or Trp for Tyr; and substitution of Met, Ile or Leu for Val.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Such a gene can be obtained by modifying the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 298 to 1986 in SEQ ID NO: 1, the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 101 to 1783 in SEQ ID NO: 3, the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 19 to 1704 in SEQ ID NO: 86, or the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 24, 26, 28, 30, 32 or 34 by, for example, site-specific mutagenesis, so that substitution, deletion, insertion or addition of an amino acid residue or residues occurs at a specific site in the encoded protein. Furthermore, such a gene can also be obtained by a known mutation treatment, examples of which include treating a gene having any of the nucleotide sequences described above with hydroxylamine or the like in vitro, and treating a microorganism, for example, an <i>Escherichia </i>bacterium, containing the gene with ultraviolet ray irradiation or a mutagen used in a usual mutation treatment such as N-methyl-Nâ²-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) or EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate). The mutation for the substitutions, deletions, insertions, additions, inversions or the like of amino acid residues described above also includes a naturally occurring mutation based on individual difference, difference in species of microorganisms that contain the ybjL gene (mutant or variant), and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">The ybjL gene can also be a DNA hybridizable with a complementary strand of DNA having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 298 to 1986 in SEQ ID NO: 1, a DNA having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 101 to 1783 in SEQ ID NO: 3, a DNA having the nucleotide sequence of the nucleotides 19 to 1704 in SEQ ID NO: 86, or a DNA having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34 or 86, or a probe that can be prepared from the DNAs having these sequences under stringent conditions and which codes for a protein which improves an ability to produce a substance of a microorganism when expression of the gene is enhanced in the microorganism.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">The âstringent conditionsâ can be conditions under which a so-called specific hybrid is formed, and non-specific hybrid is not formed. It is difficult to clearly express this condition by using any numerical value. However, the stringent conditions include, for example, when DNAs having high homology to each other, for example, DNAs having a homology of, for example, not less than 80%, not less than 90% in another example, not less than 95% in another example, or not less than 97% in another example, hybridize with each other, and DNAs having homology lower than the above level do not hybridize with each other, and when washing in ordinary Southern hybridization, i.e., washing once, twice or three times in another example, at salt concentrations and temperature of 1ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS at 60Â° C., 0.1ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS at 60Â° C. in another example, 0.1ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS at 65Â° C., 0.1ÃSSC in another example, or 0.1% SDS at 68Â° C. in another example.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">The probe can have a partial sequence of the ybjL gene. Such a probe can be produced by PCR using oligonucleotides prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the gene and a DNA fragment including the gene as the template and performed in a manner well known to those skilled in the art. When a DNA fragment having a length of about 300 bp is used as the probe, the washing conditions after hybridization can be exemplified by 2ÃSSC, 0.1% SDS at 50Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">The aforementioned descriptions concerning the gene homologue and conservative mutations can be similarly applied to the other enzyme genes described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">The expression of the ybjL gene can be enhanced by increasing the copy number of the ybjL gene, modifying an expression control sequence of the ybjL gene, amplifying a regulator that increases expression of the ybjL gene, or deleting or attenuating a regulator that decreases expression of the ybjL gene. Expression can be enhanced or increased using transformation or homologous recombination performed in the same manner as the methods for enhancing expression of a target gene described above for L-glutamic acid-producing bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">In the microorganism, an activity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl group can be improved by enhancing the expression of the ybjL gene. Whether âthe activity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl group is improvedâ can be confirmed by comparing the amount of the acidic substance having a carboxyl group which has been secreted into the medium in which the microorganism is cultured with the amount obtained by culturing a control microorganism into which the ybjL gene is not introduced. That is, the âimprovement in the activity for secreting the acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ is observed as an increase in the concentration of the acidic substance having a carboxyl group in the medium in which the microorganism is cultured as compared to the concentration obtained with a control microorganism. Furthermore, the âimprovement in the activity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ is also observed as a decrease in intracellular concentration of the acidic substance having a carboxyl group in the microorganism. As for the improvement of the âactivity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ, the intracellular concentration of the acidic substance having a carboxyl group can be decreased by 10% or more, 20% or more in another example, 30% or more in another example, as compared to the concentration in a strain in which expression of the ybjL gene is not enhanced. The absolute âactivity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ of a microorganism can be detected by measuring the difference between the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of the acidic substance having a carboxyl group. Furthermore, the âactivity for secreting an acidic substance having a carboxyl groupâ can also be detected by measuring the activity for taking up amino acids into the cells using reverted membrane vesicles with a radioisotope (J. Biol. Chem., 2002, vol. 277, No. 51, pp. 49841-49849). For example, the activity can be measured by preparing reverted membrane vesicles from cells in which the ybjL gene is expressed, adding a substrate which can act as a driving force such as ATP, and measuring the uptake activity for RI-labeled glutamic acid. Moreover, the activity can also be measured by detecting an exchange reaction rate of a labeled acidic substance having a carboxyl group and unlabeled acidic substance having a carboxyl group in live bacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">The microorganism can have an ability to accumulate L-glutamic acid in the liquid medium in an amount which is more than the amount at the saturation concentration of L-glutamic acid when it is cultured under acidic conditions (this ability is also referred to as the âL-glutamic acid accumulation ability under acidic conditionsâ). Such a microorganism can have the L-glutamic acid accumulation ability under acidic conditions by enhancing the expression of the ybjL gene. Alternatively, the microorganism can have a native ability to accumulate L-glutamic acid under acidic conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">Specific examples of microorganisms having L-glutamic acid accumulation ability under acidic conditions include the aforementioned <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>AJ13355 strain (FERM BP-6614), AJ13356 strain (FERM BP-6615), AJ13601 strain (FERM BP-7207) (for these, refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769), and the like. The <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>AJ13355 and AJ13356 strains were deposited at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry (currently, National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Address: Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305-8566, Japan) on Feb. 19, 1998 and given accession numbers of FERM P-16644 and FERM P-16645. The deposits were then converted to international deposits under the provisions of Budapest Treaty on Jan. 11, 1999 and given accession numbers of FERM BP-6614 and FERM BP-6615. The AJ13601 strain was deposited at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (currently, International Patent Organism Depository, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology) on Aug. 18, 1999 and given an accession number of FERM P-17516. The deposit was converted to an international deposit under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on Jul. 6, 2000 and given an accession number of FERM BP-7207. These strains were identified as <i>Enterobacter agglomerans </i>when they were isolated and deposited as <i>Enterobacter agglomerans </i>AJ13355, AJ13356, and AJ13601 strains.

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">When an organic acid, especially succinic acid, is produced, using a microorganism which is modified to decrease the activities of one or more enzymes among lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), in addition to increasing the expression of the ybjL gene, is more effective.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">The expression âmodified so that lactate dehydrogenase activity is decreasedâ can mean that the lactate dehydrogenase activity is decreased as compared to that of a strain in which lactate dehydrogenase is unmodified. The lactate dehydrogenase activity can be decreased to 10% per cell or lower as compared to that of a lactate dehydrogenase-unmodified strain. The lactate dehydrogenase activity can also be completely deleted. Decrease of the lactate dehydrogenase activity can be confirmed by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase activity by a known method (Kanarek, L. and Hill, R. L., 1964, J. Biol. Chem., 239:4202). Specific examples of the method for producing a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli </i>in which the lactate dehydrogenase activity is decreased include the method described in Alam, K. Y., and Clark, D. P., 1989, J. Bacteriol., 171:6213-6217, and the like. The microorganism with decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and enhanced expression of the ybjL gene can be obtained by, for example, preparing a microorganism in which the LDH gene is disrupted, and transforming this microorganism with a recombinant vector containing the ybjL gene, as described in Example 1. However, either the modification for decreasing the LDH activity or the modification for enhancing expression of the ybjL gene can be performed first. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, LDH is encoded by the ldhA and lldD genes. The DNA sequence of the ldhA gene is shown in SEQ ID NO: 36, the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is shown in SEQ ID NO: 37, the DNA sequence of the lldD gene is shown in SEQ ID NO: 38, and the amino acid sequence encoded thereby is shown in SEQ ID NO: 39.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">In order to decrease or delete activity of LDH, a mutation that decreases or deletes the intracellular activity of LDH can be introduced into the LDH gene on the chromosome by a known mutagenesis method. For example, the gene coding for LDH on the chromosome can be deleted, or an expression control sequence such as a promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence can be modified by gene recombination. Furthermore, a mutation can also be introduced to cause an amino acid substitution (missense mutation), a stop codon (nonsense mutation), or a frame shift mutation that adds or deletes one or two nucleotides into the coding region of the LDH on the chromosome, or a part of, or the entire gene can be deleted (Qiu Z. and Goodman M. F., 1997, J. Biol. Chem., 272:8611-8617). Furthermore, the LDH activity can also be decreased or deleted by gene disruption, for example, by deleting the coding region of the LDH gene in a DNA construct, and replacing the normal LDH gene with the DNA construct on the chromosome by homologous recombination or the like, or by introducing a transposon or IS factor into the gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">In order to introduce a mutation which results in decreasing or deleting the LDH activity by genetic recombination, for example, the following methods are used. The chromosomal LDH gene can be replaced with a mutant gene by preparing a mutant LDH gene in which a partial sequence of the LDH gene is modified so that it does not produce an enzyme that can function normally, and transforming a bacterium with a DNA containing the mutant gene to cause homologous recombination between the mutant gene and the gene on a chromosome. Such site-specific mutagenesis based on gene substitution utilizing homologous recombination has been already reported, and include a method called Red driven integration developed by Datsenko and Wanner (Datsenko, K. A, and Wanner, B. L., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97:6640-6645), a method of using a linear DNA such as by utilizing Red driven integration in combination with an excision system derived from Î» phage (Cho, E. H., et al., 2002, J. Bacteriol., 184:5200-5203), a method of using a plasmid containing a temperature sensitive replication origin (U.S. Pat. No. 6,303,383, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 05-007491, WO2005/010175), and the like. Such site-specific mutagenesis based on gene substitution using homologous recombination as described above can also be performed by using a plasmid that is unable to replicate in a host.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">The expression âmodified so that alcohol dehydrogenase activity is decreasedâ can mean that the alcohol dehydrogenase activity is decreased as compared to that of a strain in which alcohol dehydrogenase is unmodified. The alcohol dehydrogenase activity can be decreased to 10% per cell or lower as compared to an alcohol dehydrogenase-unmodified strain. The alcohol dehydrogenase activity can also be completely deleted. Decrease in the alcohol dehydrogenase activity can be confirmed by measuring the alcohol dehydrogenase activity by a known method (Lutstorf, U. M. et al., 1970, Eur. J. Biochem., 17:497-508). Specific examples of the method for producing a mutant strain of <i>Escherichia coli </i>in which the alcohol dehydrogenase activity is decreased include the method described in Sanchez A. M. et al., 2005, Biotechnol. Prog., 21:358-365, and the like. The microorganism in which alcohol dehydrogenase activity is decreased and expression of the ybjL gene is enhanced can be obtained by, for example, preparing a microorganism in which the gene coding for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is disrupted, and transforming this microorganism with a recombinant vector containing the ybjL gene. However, either the modification for decreasing the ADH activity or the modification for enhancing expression of the ybjL gene can be performed first. The alcohol dehydrogenase activity can be decreased by a method similar to that for decreasing the lactate dehydrogenase activity described above. The nucleotide sequence (partial sequence) of the ADH gene from the <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637 strain (FERM ABP-10955) is shown in SEQ ID NO: 74. The entire nucleotide sequence of this gene can be determined by, for example, isolating the ADH gene (adhE) from the chromosomal DNA of <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>on the basis of this partial sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">The expression âmodified so that pyruvate formate lyase activity is decreasedâ can mean that the pyruvate formate lyase activity is decreased as compared to that of a strain in which the pyruvate formate lyase is unmodified. The pyruvate formate lyase activity can be decreased to 10% per cell or lower as compared to a pyruvate formate lyase-unmodified strain. The pyruvate formate lyase activity can also be completely deleted. A decrease in the pyruvate formate lyase activity can be confirmed by measuring the pyruvate formate lyase activity by a known method (Knappe, J. and Blaschkowski, H. P., 1975, Meth. Enzymol., 41:508-518). The microorganism in which pyruvate formate lyase activity is decreased and expression of the ybjL gene is enhanced can be obtained by, for example, preparing a microorganism in which the PFL gene is disrupted, and transforming this microorganism with a recombinant vector containing the ybjL gene. However, either the modification for decreasing the PFL activity or the modification for enhancing expression of ybjL can be performed first. The pyruvate formate lyase activity can be decreased by a method similar to the method for decreasing the lactate dehydrogenase activity described above.</p>

Enhancing the pyruvate carboxylase activity can be combined with decreasing the lactate dehydrogenase activity, alcohol dehydrogenase activity, and/or pyruvate formate lyase activity. The expression âmodified so that pyruvate carboxylase activity is enhancedâ can mean that the pyruvate carboxylase activity is increased as compared to that of an unmodified strain such as a wild-type strain or parent strain. The pyruvate carboxylase activity can be measured by, for example, a method of measuring a decrease of NADH as described later.</p>

Furthermore, so long as the functions of the encoded PC protein, such as its involvement in carbon dioxide fixation, are not substantially degraded, nucleotides in the PC gene can be replaced with other nucleotides or deleted, or other nucleotides can be inserted into the sequence.

When pH drops during the culture, the medium can be neutralized by addition of, for example, calcium carbonate, or with an alkali such as ammonia gas. An acidic amino acid can accumulate in the culture broth, for example, after 10 to 120 hours of culture under such conditions as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">When the acidic amino acid is L-glutamic acid, L-glutamic acid can precipitate into the medium by using a liquid medium, the pH of which is adjusted so that L-glutamic acid precipitates. L-glutamic acid precipitates around, for example, pH 5.0 to 4.0, pH 4.5 to 4.0 in another example, pH 4.3 to 4.0 in another example, or pH 4.0 in another example.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0185">After completion of the culture, L-glutamic acid can be collected from the culture medium by any known collection method. For example, after cells are removed from the culture medium, L-glutamic acid can be collected by concentrating the culture medium so it crystallizes, or by ion exchange chromatography, or the like. When the culture is performed so that L-glutamic acid precipitates, the L-glutamic acid that has precipitated in the medium can be collected by centrifugation, filtration, or the like. In this case, it is also possible to crystallize L-glutamic acid that has dissolved in the medium, and then collect the precipitated L-glutamic acid in the culture broth together with the crystallized L-glutamic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0186">&lt;2-2&gt; Production of Organic Acid</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0187">An organic acid can be produced by allowing the microorganism, or a product obtained by processing the microorganism, to act on an organic raw material in a reaction mixture containing carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, or carbon dioxide gas, and collecting the organic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0188">In a first example, by culturing the microorganism in a medium containing carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, or carbon dioxide gas, and an organic raw material, proliferation of the microorganism and production of the organic acid simultaneously occur. In this example, the medium can be the reaction mixture. Proliferation of the microorganism and production of the organic acid can simultaneously occur, or there can be a period during the culture in which proliferation of the microorganism mainly occurs, and a period in which production of the organic acid mainly occurs.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0189">In a second example, by allowing cells that have proliferated in the medium to coexist with a reaction mixture containing carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, or carbon dioxide gas, and an organic raw material, and thereby allowing the microorganism to act on the organic raw material in the reaction mixture, an organic acid can be produced. In this example, a product obtained by processing the cells of the microorganism can also be used. Examples of the product obtained by processing cells include, for example, immobilized cells obtained with acrylamide, carragheenan, or the like, a disrupted cellular product, a centrifugation supernatant of the disrupted product, a fraction obtained by partial purification of the supernatant by ammonium sulfate treatment or the like, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">Although the bacteria can be obtained on a solid medium such as an agar medium by slant culture, bacteria previously cultured in a liquid medium (seed culture) are examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">A medium usually used for culture of microorganisms can be used. For example, a typical medium obtained by adding natural nutrients such as meat extract, yeast extract and peptone, to a composition comprising inorganic salts such as ammonium sulfate, potassium phosphate and magnesium sulfate can be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">In the aforementioned first example, the carbon source added to the medium also serves as the organic raw material for the production of the organic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">In the aforementioned second example, the cells after the culture are collected by centrifugation, membrane separation, or the like, and used for the organic acid production reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">The organic raw material is not particularly limited so long as the chosen microorganism can assimilate it to produce succinic acid. However, fermentable carbohydrates including carbohydrates such as galactose, lactose, glucose, fructose, glycerol, sucrose, saccharose, starch and cellulose, polyalcohols such as glycerin, mannitol, xylitol and ribitol, and the like are typically used. Glucose, fructose and glycerol are examples, and glucose is a particular example. When the organic acid is succinic acid, fumaric acid or the like can be added in order to efficiently produce succinic acid as described in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-68576, and malic acid can be added instead of fumaric acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">Furthermore, a saccharified starch solution, molasses, or the like containing the aforementioned fermentable carbohydrates can also be used. The fermentable carbohydrates can be used independently or in combination. Although concentration of the aforementioned organic raw material is not particularly limited, it is more advantageous that the concentration is as high as possible and within such a range that the culture of the microorganism and production of the organic acid are not inhibited. In the aforementioned first example, the concentration of the organic raw material in the medium is generally in the range of 5 to 30% (w/v), or 10 to 20% (w/v) in another example. Furthermore, in the aforementioned second example, the concentration of the organic raw material in the reaction mixture is generally in the range of 5 to 30% (w/v), or 10 to 20% (w/v) in another example. Furthermore, it may be necessary to add additional organic raw material as the concentration of the organic raw material decreases with the progress of the culture or reaction.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0196">The aforementioned reaction mixture containing carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, or carbon dioxide gas and the organic raw material is not particularly limited, and it can be, for example, a typical medium for culturing microorganisms, or it can be a buffer such as phosphate buffer. The reaction mixture can be an aqueous solution containing a nitrogen source, inorganic salts, and the like. The nitrogen source is not particularly limited so long the chosen microorganism can assimilate it to produce an organic acid, and specific examples include various organic or inorganic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts, nitrates, urea, soybean hydrolysate, casein degradation products, peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, and corn steep liquor. Examples of the inorganic salts include various phosphates, sulfates, and metallic salts such as those of magnesium, potassium, manganese, iron, and zinc. If necessary, growth-promoting factors including vitamins such as biotin, pantothenic acid, inositol, and nicotinic acid, nucleotides, amino acids and the like can be added. In order to suppress foaming during the reaction, an appropriate amount of a commercially available antifoam can be added to the medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0197">The pH of the reaction mixture can be adjusted by adding sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, or the like. Since the pH for the reaction is usually 5 to 10, or 6 to 9.5 in another example, the pH of the reaction mixture can be adjusted to be within the aforementioned range with an alkaline substance, carbonate, urea, or the like, even during the reaction, if needed.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0198">Water, buffer, medium or the like can be used as the reaction mixture, but a medium is a particular example. The medium can contain, for example, the aforementioned organic raw material, and carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, or carbon dioxide gas, and the reaction can be performed under anaerobic conditions. Magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, or potassium bicarbonate can be the source of the carbonate or bicarbonate ions, and these can also be used as a neutralizing agent. However, if necessary, carbonate or bicarbonate ions can also be supplied from carbonic acid or bicarbonic acid or salts thereof or carbon dioxide gas. Specific examples of salts of carbonic acid or bicarbonic acid include, for example, magnesium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and the like. Carbonate ions or bicarbonate ions can be added at a concentration of 0.001 to 5 M, 0.1 to 3 M in another example, or 1 to 2 M in another example. When carbon dioxide gas is present, it can be in an amount of 50 mg to 25 g, 100 mg to 15 g in another example, or 150 mg to 10 g in another example, per liter of the solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0199">The optimal growth temperature of the chosen microorganism is generally in the range of 25 to 40Â° C. Therefore, the reaction temperature is generally in the range of 25 to 40Â° C., or in the range of 30 to 37Â° C. in another example. The amount of bacterial cells in the reaction mixture is, although it is not particularly limited, 1 to 700 g/L, 10 to 500 g/L in another example, or 20 to 400 g/L in another example. The reaction time can be 1 to 168 hours, or 3 to 72 hours in another example. The reaction can be performed batchwise or on a column.</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0200">The culture of the bacteria can be performed under aerobic conditions. On the other hand, the organic acid production reaction can be performed under aerobic conditions, microaerobic conditions, or anaerobic conditions. When performed under microaerobic conditions or anaerobic conditions, the reaction can be performed in a sealed reaction vessel without aeration, with a supplied inert gas such as nitrogen gas, or with a supplied inert gas containing carbon dioxide gas, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0201">The organic acid can accumulate in the reaction mixture (culture medium) and can be separated and purified from the reaction mixture in a conventional manner. Specifically, solids such as bacterial cells can be removed by centrifugation, filtration, or the like, then the resulting solution can be desalted with an ion exchange resin or the like, and the organic acid can be separated and purified from the solution by crystallization or column chromatography.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0202">Furthermore, when the target organic acid is succinic acid, and after the production, a polymerization reaction can be carried out by using the produced succinic acid as a raw material to produce a polymer containing succinic acid. In recent years, with the increase of environmentally friendly industrial products, polymers prepared from raw materials of plant origin have been attracting attention. The produced succinic acid can be converted into polymers such as polyesters and polyamides and used (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 4-189822). Specific examples of succinic acid-containing polymers include succinic acid polyesters obtained by polymerizing a diol such as butanediol and ethylene glycol and succinic acid, succinic acid polyamides obtained by polymerizing a diamine such as hexamethylenediamine and succinic acid, and the like. In addition, succinic acid and succinic acid-containing polymers obtained by the production method described herein, and compositions containing these can be used for food additives, pharmaceutical agents, cosmetics, and the like.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0203">Hereinafter, the present invention will be explained more specifically with reference to the following non-limiting examples.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Reference Example 1 </heading>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Construction of <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>Strain Resistant to Î» Red Gene Product</heading>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0204">In order to disrupt the sdhA gene in <i>Pantoea ananatis</i>, a recipient strain for efficiently carrying out the method called âRed-driven integrationâ or âRed-mediated integrationâ (Datsenko, K A. and Wanner, B. L., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 97, 6640-6645) was constructed.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0205">First, the novel helper plasmid RSF-Red-TER which expresses the gam, bet and exo genes of Î»(âÎ» Red genesâ) was constructed (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). The details of this construction are described in Reference Example 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0206">This plasmid can be used in a wide range of hosts having different genetic backgrounds. This is because 1) this plasmid has the replicon of the RSF1010 wide host spectrum plasmid (Scholz, et al., 1989, Gene, 75:271-288; Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 1987, Nature, 328:172-175), which is stably maintained by many types of gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and even plant cells, 2) the Î» Red genes, gam, bet and exo, are under the control of the PlacUV5 promoter, which is recognized by the RNA polymerases of many types of bacteria (for example, Brunschwig, E. and Darzins, A., 1992, Gene, 111, 1, 35-41; Dehio, M. et al, 1998, Gene, 215, 2, 223-229), and 3) the autoregulation factor PlacUV5-lacI and the Ï-non-dependent transcription terminator (TrrnB) of the rrnB operon of <i>Escherichia coli </i>lower the basal expression level of the Î» Red genes (Skorokhodova, A. Y. et al, 2004, Biotekhnologiya (Rus), 5, 3-21). Furthermore, the RSF-Red-TER plasmid contains the levansucrase gene (sacB), and by the expression of this gene, the plasmid can be collected from cells in a medium containing sucrose.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0207">In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the frequency of integration of a PCR-generated DNA fragment along with the short flanking region provided by the RSF-Red-TER plasmid is as high as the frequency obtained when using the pKD46 helper plasmid (Datsenko, K. A., Wanner, B. L., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97, 6640-6645). However, expression of the Î» Red genes is toxic to <i>Pantoea ananatis</i>. Cells transformed with the RSF-Red-TER helper plasmid grow extremely slowly in LB medium containing IPTG (isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside, 1 mM) and an appropriate antibiotic (25 Î¼g/ml of chloramphenicol or 40 Î¼g/ml of kanamycin), and the efficiency of Î» Red-mediated recombination is extremely low (10<sup>â8</sup>), if observed at all.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0208">A variant strain of <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>which is resistant to expression of all three of the Î» Red genes was selected. For this purpose, the RSF-Red-TER plasmid was introduced into the <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>SC17 strain (U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,517) by electroporation. After an 18-hour culture, about 10<sup>6 </sup>transformants were obtained, and among these, 10 clones formed colonies of a large size, and the remainder formed extremely small colonies. After an 18 hour culture, the large colonies were about 2 mm, and the small colonies were about 0.2 mm. While the small colonies did not grow any more even when the culture was extended up to 24 hours, the large colonies continued to grow. One of the large colony <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>mutant strains which was resistant to expression of all three of the Î» Red genes (gam, bet, and exo) was used for further analysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0209">The RSF-Red-TER plasmid DNA was isolated from one clone of the large colony clones, and from several clones of the small colony clones, and transformed again into <i>Escherichia coli </i>MG1655 to examine the ability of the plasmid to synthesize an active Red gene product. A control experiment for Red-dependent integration in the obtained transformants was used to demonstrate that only the plasmid isolated from the large colony clone induced expression of the Î» Red genes required for the Red-dependent integration. In order to investigate whether the Red-mediated integration occurs in the selected large colony clone, electroporation was performed using a linear DNA fragment produced by PCR. This fragment was designed so that it contains a Km<sup>R </sup>marker and a flanking region of 40 bp homologous to the hisD gene, and is integrated into the hisD gene of <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>at the SmaI recognition site. Two small colony clones were used as control. The nucleotide sequence of the hisD gene of <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>is shown in SEQ ID NO: 40. For PCR, the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 41 and 42 were used as primers, and the pMW118-(Î»att-Km<sup>r</sup>-Î»att) plasmid was used as the template. The two small colony clones which were not resistant to the Î» Red genes were used as the control. Construction of the pMW118-(Î»attL-Kmr-Î»attR) plasmid will be explained in detail in Reference Example 3.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0210">The RSF-Red-TER plasmid can induce expression of the Red genes by the lacI gene carried on the plasmid. Two kinds of induction conditions were investigated. In the first group, IPTG (1 mM) was added 1 hour before the electroporation, and in the second group, IPTG was added at the start of the culture to prepare cells in which electroporation is possible. The growth rate of the progeny of the SC17 strain harboring RSF-Red-TER derived from the large colony clone was not significantly lower than that of a strain not having the RSF-Red-TER plasmid. The addition of IPTG only slightly decreased the growth rate of these cultures. On the other hand, the RSF-Red-TER-introduced SC17 strain derived from the progeny of the small colony clones grew extremely slowly even without the addition of IPTG, and after induction, growth was substantially arrested. After electroporation of RSF-Red-TER isolated from the cells of the progeny of the large colony clone, many Km<sup>R </sup>clones grew (18 clones after a short induction time, and about 100 clones after an extended induction time). All of the 100 clones that were investigated had a His phenotype, and about 20 clones were confirmed by PCR to have the expected structure of the chromosome in the cells. On the other hand, even when electroporation was performed with RSF-Red-TER isolated from cells of the progeny of the small colony clones, an integrated strain was not obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0211">The large colony clone was grown on a plate containing 7% sucrose to eliminate the plasmid, and transformed again with RSF-Red-TER. The strain without the plasmid was designated SC17(0). This strain was deposited at the Russian National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (VKPM), GNII Genetica (Address: 1 Dorozhny proezd., 1 Moscow 117545, Russia) on Sep. 21, 2005, and assigned an accession number of VKPM B-9246.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0212">All the clones which grew after the aforementioned re-transformation were large like the parent strain clone SC17(0). The Red-mediated integration experiment was performed in the SC17(0) strain which had been re-transformed with the RSF-Red-TER plasmid. Three of the independent transformants obtained were investigated using the same DNA fragment as that used for the previous experiment. A short induction time (1 hour before electroporation) was employed. Km<sup>R </sup>clones exceeding ten clones grew in each experiment. All the examined clones had the His phenotype. In this way, a mutant strain designated SC17(0) which is resistant to the expression of the Î» Red genes was selected. This strain can be used as a recipient strain suitable for the Red-dependent integration into the <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>chromosome.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">Construction of Helper Plasmid RSF-Red-TER</heading>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0213">The scheme for constructing the helper plasmid RSF-Red-TER is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0214">As the first step in the construction, an RSFsacBPlacMCS vector was designed. For this purpose, DNA fragments containing the cat gene of the pACYC184 plasmid and the structural region of the sacB gene of <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 43 and 44, and 45 and 46, respectively. These oligonucleotides contained the BglII, SacI, XbaI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites in the 5â² end regions. These sites are required and convenient for further cloning. The obtained sacB fragment of 1.5 kb was cloned into the previously obtained pMW119-P<sub>lac</sub>lacI vector at the XbaI-BamHI site. This vector was constructed in the same manner as that described for the pMW118-P<sub>lac</sub>lacI vector (Skorokhodova, A. Y. et al, 2004, Biotekhnologiya (Rus), 5:3-21). However, this vector contained a polylinker moiety derived from pMW219 instead of the pMW218 plasmid.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0215">Then, the aforementioned cat fragment of 1.0 kb was treated with BglII and SacI, and cloned into the RSF-P<sub>lac</sub>lacIsacB plasmid obtained in the previous step at the BamHI-SacI site. The obtained plasmid pMW-P<sub>lac</sub>lacIsacBcat contained the PlacUV5-lacI-sacB-cat fragment. In order to subclone this fragment into the RSF1010 vector, pMW-P<sub>lac</sub>lacIsacBcat was digested with BglII, blunt-ended with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, and successively digested with SacI. A 3.8 kb BglII-SacI fragment of the pMWP<sub>lac</sub>lacIsacBcat plasmid was eluted from a 1% agarose gel, and ligated with the RSF1010 vector which had been treated with PstI and SacI. <i>Escherichia coli </i>TG1 was transformed with the ligation mixture, and plated on the LB medium containing chloramphenicol (50 mg/L). The plasmids isolated from the grown clones were analyzed with restriction enzymes to obtain an RSFsacB plasmid. In order to construct an RSFsacBPlacMCS vector, a DNA fragment containing the PlacUV5 promoter was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 47 and 48 as primers and the pMW119-P<sub>lac</sub>lacI plasmid as a template. The obtained fragment of 146 bp was digested with SacI and NotI, and ligated with the SacI-NotI large fragment of the RSFsacB plasmid. Then, by PCR using the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 49 and 50 as primers, and the pKD46 plasmid (Datsenko, K. A., Wanner, B. L., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97, 6640-6645) as a template, a DNA fragment of 2.3 kb containing the Î»RedÎ±Î²Î³ genes and the transcription terminator tL3 was amplified. The obtained fragment was cloned into the RSFsacBPlacMCS vector at the PvuI-NotI site. In this way, the RSFRed plasmid was designed.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0216">In order to eliminate read through transcription of the Red genes, a Ï-dependent transcription terminator of the rrnB operon of <i>Escherichia coli </i>was inserted at a position between the cat gene and the PlacUV5 promoter. For this purpose, a DNA fragment containing the PlacUV5 promoter and the TrrnB terminator was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 51 and 48 as primers and the chromosome of <i>Escherichia coli </i>BW3350 as the template. These obtained fragments were treated with KpnI and ligated. Then, the 0.5 kb fragment containing both PlacUV5 and TrrnB was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 48 and 52 as primers. The obtained DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI, blunt-ended by a treatment with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, digested with BamHI, and ligated with the Ec1136II-BamHI large fragment of the RSFsacBPlacMCS vector. The obtained plasmid was designated RSF-Red-TER.</p>

      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0217">The pMW118-(Î»attL-Km<sup>r</sup>-Î»attR) plasmid was constructed from the pMW118-attL-Tc-attR (WO2005/010175) plasmid by replacing the tetracycline resistance marker gene with the kanamycin resistance gene of the pUC4K plasmid. For that purpose, the EcoRI-HindIII large fragment from pMW118-attL-Tc-attR was ligated to two fragments from the pUC4K plasmid: the HindIII-PstI fragment (676 bp) and EcoRI-HindIII fragment (585 bp).

      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="1">Search of L-Glutamic Acid Secretion Gene</heading>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0227">A search for an L-glutamic acid secretion gene was performed as follows. Since L-glutamic acid is converted into an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, 2-oxoglutarate, in one step by glutamate dehydrogenase, L-glutamic acid is thought to be easily metabolized in many microorganisms having glutamate dehydrogenase or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, since a strain in which 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase is deleted cannot degrade L-glutamic acid, growth of the cells is inhibited in the presence of a high concentration glutamic acid. In this example, the SC17sucAams strain derived from the <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>SC17sucA strain (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769) is deficient in the extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis system, and is also deficient in 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. Therefore, this strain was used to try to obtain an L-glutamic acid excretion gene utilizing resistance to a high concentration of L-glutamic acid as a marker.</p>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0228">Since the SC17sucA strain produced a marked amount of extracelluar polysaccharides when grown on an agar medium containing a sugar source, the handling of this strain is extremely difficult. Therefore, by deleting the ams operon coding for the extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis system genes, production of extracellular polysaccharides was suppressed. PCR was performed by using pMW118-Î»attL-Km<sup>r</sup>-Î»attR as the template and the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 6 and 7 to amplify a gene fragment containing a kanamycin resistance gene, attL and attR sequences of Î» phage at the both ends of the resistance gene, and 50 by upstream sequence of amsI and 50 bp downstream sequence of the amsC gene added to the outer ends of the Î» phage sequences. This fragment was purified by using Wizard PCR Prep DNA Purification System (Promega).</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0229">Then, the SC17(0) strain was transformed with RSF-Red-TER to obtain an SC17(0)/RSF-Red-TER strain. This strain was cultured overnight in L medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract and 5 g of NaCl in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/L of chloramphenicol, and then the culture medium after the overnight culture was inoculated in 1/100 volume into 100 mL of the L medium containing 25 mg/L of chloramphenicol and 1 mM isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and culture was performed at 34Â° C. for 3 hours. The cells prepared as described above were collected, washed three times with ice-cooled 10% glycerol, and finally suspended in 0.5 mL of 10% glycerol. The suspended cells were used as competent cells, and 100 ng of the PCR fragment prepared in the above section was introduced into the cells by using GENE PULSER II (BioRad) with a field strength of 18 kV/cm, capacitor capacity of 25 Î¼F and resistance of 200 Î©. Ice-cooled SOC medium (20 g/L of Bacto tryptone, 5 g/L of yeast extract, 0.5 g/L of NaCl and 10 g/L of glucose) was added to the cell suspension, and culture was performed at 34Â° C. for 2 hours with shaking. The culture was applied to a medium prepared by adding ingredients of minimal medium (5 g of glucose, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 3 g of monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 g of ammonium chloride and 6 g of disodium phosphate in 1 L) and 40 mg/L of kanamycin to the L medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl and 15 g of agar in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0). The colonies that appeared were purified with the same medium, and then it was confirmed by PCR that the ams gene had been replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0230">The chromosome was extracted from the ams gene-deficient strain using a Bacterial Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Edge Biosystems). Separately, the SC17sucA strain was cultured overnight on an agar medium obtained by adding the ingredients of the minimal medium described above to the L medium. The cells were scraped with a loop, washed three times with ice-cooled 10% glycerol, and finally suspended in 10% glycerol to a final volume of 500 Î¼L. The suspended cells were used as competent cells, and 600 ng of the aforementioned chromosome DNA was introduced into the competent cells using GENE PULSER II (BioRad) with a field strength of 17.5 kV/cm, capacitor capacity of 25 Î¼F and resistance of 200 Î©. Ice-cooled SOC medium was added to the cell suspension, and culture was performed at 34Â° C. for 2 hours with shaking. Then, the culture was applied on an agar medium prepared by adding ingredients of the minimal medium described above and 40 mg/L of kanamycin to the L medium. The colonies that appeared were purified with the same medium, and then it was confirmed by PCR that the ams gene had been replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene. This strain was designated as SC17sucAams.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0231">Chromosomal DNA extracted from the <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>AJ13355 strain was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Sau3AI. Then, fragments of about 10 kb were collected and introduced into the BamHI site of pSTV28 (Takara Bio) to prepare a plasmid library. This plasmid library was introduced into competent cells of the SC17sucAams strain prepared in a conventional manner by electroporation.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0232">Selection was performed for the SC17sucAams strain which had been introduced with a plasmid library on a plate of the L medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl and 15 g of agar in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0) added with ingredients of minimal medium (5 g of glucose, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 3 g of monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 g of ammonium chloride and 6 g of disodium phosphate in 1 L of pure water) using chloramphenicol resistance as a marker to obtain transformants. These transformants were plated on a glucose minimal medium containing a high concentration L-glutamic acid (the glucose minimal medium mixed with 0.2 M L-glutamic acid, 100 mg/L each of lysine, methionine and diaminopimelic acid as final concentrations), in which SC17sucAams cannot form colonies.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0233">The transformants were cultured at 34Â° C. for 3 days, and 64 clones among the colonies that appeared were allowed to again form single colonies on the same plate. As a result, 11 clones were found to form colonies after 48 hours, and the remaining colonies formed colonies after 72 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0234">Then, the genes inserted into the vectors harbored by the transformants were analyzed. Plasmids were extracted from the transformants, and nucleotide sequences were determined. It was found that among the 11 clones that formed colonies within 48 hours, 10 clones had the same loci, and all contained genes showing homology to ybjL, which was an <i>Escherichia coli </i>gene of unknown function. In addition, this ybjL gene could not be obtained under the same conditions that the glutamic acid secretion system gene described in WO2005/085419, yhfK, was obtained, and conversely, the yhfK gene could not be obtained under the selection conditions used in this example.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0235">In order to confirm that the factor which imparts glutamic acid resistance is ybjL, the ybjL gene was cloned. PCR was performed using the chromosomal DNA of AJ13355 strain as the template and oligonucleotides ybjL-F1 and ybjL-R2 shown in SEQ ID NOS: 8 and 9 to amplify the fragment of about 1.8 kb containing the ybjL gene of <i>P. ananatis</i>. This fragment was purified using Wizard PCR Prep DNA Purification System (Promega), and then treated with the restriction enzymes KpnI and SphI, and the product was ligated with pSTV28 (Takara Bio) which had been treated with the same enzymes to obtain pSTV-PanybjL. The SC17sucA strain was transformed with this pSTV-PanybjL plasmid, and using pSTV28 as a control for comparison (Takara Bio) to construct the SC17sucA/pSTV-PanybjL and SC17sucA/pSTV28 strains.</p>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0236">The SC17sucA/pSTV-ybjL strain was plated on minimal medium (5 g of glucose or sucrose, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 3 g of monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 g of ammonium chloride, 6 g of disodium phosphate, 0.2 M sodium L-glutamate, 100 mg/L each of lysine, methionine and diaminopimelic acid and 15 g of agar in 1 L of pure water) containing glutamic acid. Culture was performed at 34Â° C. for 2 days. As a result, it was confirmed that whereas the control vector-introduced strain, SC17sucA/pSTV28, could not form colonies, SC17sucA/pSTV-ybjL could form colonies on the minimal medium.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0237">Then, the SC17sucA/pSTV-PanybjL strain was cultured in liquid minimal medium (5 g of glucose, 2 mM magnesium sulfate, 3 g of monopotassium phosphate, 0.5 g of sodium chloride, 1 g of ammonium chloride, 6 g of disodium phosphate, 0.2 M sodium L-glutamate, 100 mg/L each of lysine, methionine and diaminopimelic acid in 1 L of pure water) containing glutamic acid to examine growth of the strain in the presence of a high concentration of L-glutamic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0238">The results are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. It was found that growth of SC17sucA/pSTV-PanybjL in which the ybjL gene had been enhanced was markedly improved in the presence of high concentration L-glutamic acid as compared to the control strain SC17sucA/pSTV28. Accordingly, it was confirmed that ybjL is a factor which imparts resistance to L-glutamic acid.</p>

      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0239">Then, in order to examine the effect of this gene on L-glutamic acid production, the plasmid for ybjL amplification, pSTV-PanybjL, was introduced into the L-glutamic acid producing bacterium SC17sucA/RSFCPG having the plasmid for L-glutamic acid production, RSFCPG, shown in SEQ ID NO: 10 (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2001-333769), and L-glutamic acid productivity thereof was examined.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0240">pSTV-PanybjL and the control plasmid, pSTV28 (Takara Bio), were each introduced into SC17sucA/RSFCPG by electroporation, and transformants were obtained using chloramphenicol resistance as a marker. After confirmation of the presence of the plasmids, the strain with the plasmid for ybjL amplification was designated SC17sucA/RSFCPG+pSTV-PanybjL, and the strain with pSTV29 was designated SC17sucA/RSFCPG+pSTV28.</p>

      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0269">Then, the ability of the ybjL-amplified strain to produce other amino acids was examined. W3110/pSTV-PanybjL, and the control strain W3110/pSTV28 were precultured in L medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl and 15 g of agar in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0) containing chloramphenicol, and one loop of cells were inoculated by using a 5-mL volume loop (Nunc) to 5 mL of a medium having the following composition in a test tube, and cultured at 37Â° C. for 7 hours with shaking. Cell densities and L-amino acid concentrations in the culture medium were measured in the same manner as in Example 2. The results are shown in Table 4.</p>

The strain in which ybjL derived from <i>Pantoea ananatis </i>had been amplified was designated as AJ13410/pSTV-PanybjL, and the control strain with pSTV28 was designated as AJ13410/pSTV28.</p>

AJ13410/pSTV-PanybjL and AJ13410/pSTV28 were precultured on L medium (10 g of Bacto tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl and 15 g of agar in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0) containing chloramphenicol, and one loop of cells were inoculated by using a 1-mL volume loop (Nunc) to 5 mL of a medium having the following composition in a test tube, and cultured at 37Â° C. for 17 hours with shaking. Cell density and L-glutamic acid concentration in the culture medium were measured in the same manner as in Example 2. The results are shown in Table 5.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0285">This gene was deleted by using the method called âRed-driven integrationâ developed by Datsenko and Wanner (Datsenko, K. A. and Wanner, B. L., 2000, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 97, No. 12, pp. 6640-6645), and the Î» phage excision system (Cho, E. H. Gumport, R. I. and Gardner, J. F., 2002, J. Bacteriol., 184 (18):5200-5203). According to this method, it is possible, to construct a gene-disrupted strain in a single step by using a PCR product obtained with synthetic oligonucleotide primers in which a part of the target gene is designed in the 5â² end and a part of an antibiotic resistance gene is designed in the 3â² end. Furthermore, by using the Î» phage excision system in combination, the antibiotic resistance gene which is integrated into the gene-disrupted strain can be removed.</p>

      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0287">According to the description of WO2005/010175, PCR was performed by using synthetic oligonucleotides having sequences corresponding to parts of the ldhA gene in the 5â² end and sequences corresponding to both ends of attL and attR of Î» phage at the 3â² end as primers and plasmid pMW118-attL-Cm-attR as the template. pMW118-attL-Cm-attR is a plasmid obtained by inserting attL and attR genes, which are the attachment sites for Î» phage, and the cat gene, which is an antibiotic resistance gene, into pMW118 (Takara Bio), and the genes are inserted in the order of attL-cat-attR. The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides used as the primers are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 13 and 14. The amplified PCR product was purified on an agarose gel and introduced into <i>Escherichia coli </i>MG1655 strain containing the plasmid pKD46, which is capable of temperature-sensitive replication by eletroporation. Then, an ampicillin-sensitive strain not harboring pKD46 was obtained, and the deletion of the ldhA gene was confirmed by PCR. PCR was performed by using the synthetic oligonucleotides shown in SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 16 as primers. Whereas the PCR product obtained for the parent strain was about 1.2 kb, the deficient strain was about 1.9 kb.</p>

Then, the strain in which att-cat and pMW-intxis-ts had been eliminated was confirmed by PCR on the basis of ampicillin sensitivity and chloramphenicol sensitivity. PCR was performed by using the synthetic oligonucleotides shown in SEQ NOS: 15 and 16 as primers. Whereas the PCR product obtained for the strain in which att-cat remained was about 1.9 kb, a band of about 0.3 kb was observed for the strain in which att-cat was eliminated.

      <p id="p-00326-en" num="0304">&lt;9-1&gt; Construction of an adhE-Deficient Strain of <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637</p>
      <p id="p-00327-en" num="0305">When <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637 is grown in a medium containing a sugar source under anaerobic conditions, it produces a marked amount of ethanol. Therefore, adhE coding for alcohol dehydrogenase was deleted to suppress the generation of ethanol.</p>
      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0306">A gene fragment for deleting adhE was prepared by PCR using the plasmid pMW-attL-Tc-attR described in WO2005/010175 as the template and oligonucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 72 and 73 as primers, pMW118-attL-Tc-attR is a plasmid obtained by inserting attL and attR genes, which are the attachment sites of Î» phage, and the Tc gene, which is a tetracycline resistance gene, into pMW118 (Takara Bio), and the genes are inserted in the order of attL-Tc-attR. By PCR described above, a gene fragment containing a tetracycline resistance gene, attL and attR sites of Î» phage at the both ends of the resistance gene, and 60 bp upstream sequence and 59 bp downstream sequence of the adhE gene added to the outer ends of the Î» phage sequences was amplified. This fragment was purified by using Wizard PCR Prep DNA Purification System (Promega).</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0307">Then, the <i>Enterobacter aerogenes AJ</i>110637 strain was transformed with RSF-Red-TER to obtain the <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637/RSF-Red-TER strain. This strain was cultured overnight in LB medium containing 40 Î¼g/mL of chloramphenicol, the culture medium was inoculated in a 1/100 volume to 50 mL of the LB medium containing 40 Î¼g/mL of chloramphenicol and 0.4 mM isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and culture was performed at 31Â° C. for 4 hours. The cells were collected, washed three times with ice-cooled 10% glycerol, and finally suspended in 0.5 mL of 10% glycerol. The suspended cells were used as competent cells, and the PCR fragment prepared in the above section was introduced into the cells by using GENE PULSER II (BioRad) under the conditions of a field strength of 20 kV/cm, capacitor capacity of 25 Î¼F and resistance of 200 Î©. Ice-cooled LB medium was added to the cell suspension, and culture was performed at 31Â° C. for 2 hours with shaking. Then, the culture was applied to a LB plate containing 25 Î¼g/mL of tetracycline. The colonies that appeared were purified with the same plate, and then it was confirmed by PCR that the adhE gene had been replaced with the tetracycline resistance gene.</p>

      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0309">The ability to produce succinic acid was imparted to the <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637ÎadhE strain by amplifying pyc coding for pyruvate carboxylase derived from <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0310">In order to express pyc derived from <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum </i>in the AJ110637ÎadhE strain, it was attempted to obtain a threonine operon promoter fragment of the <i>Escherichia coli </i>MG1655 strain. The total genomic sequence of <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>Escherichia coli </i>K-12 strain) has already been elucidated (Genbank Accession No. U00096, Science, 277, 1453-4474 (1997)). On the basis of this sequence, PCR amplification of the promoter region of the threonine operon (thrLABC) was performed. PCR was performed by using the synthetic oligonucleotide having an SacI site shown n SEQ ID NO: 75 as a 5â² primer, the synthetic oligonucleotide shown in SEQ ID NO: 76 as a 3â² primer, and the genomic DNA of <i>Escherichia coli </i>MG1655 strain (ATCC 47076, ATCC 700926) as the template to obtain a threonine operon promoter fragment (A) (SEQ ID NO: 77).</p>

      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0312">PCR was performed by using the fragments (A) and (B) as templates, the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 75 and 79 to obtain a gene fragment (C) including the fragments (A) and (B) ligated to each other. This gene fragment (C) was treated with the restriction enzyme SacI, and purified, and the product was ligated with the plasmid vector pSTV28 (Takara Bio) which had been digested with the restriction enzyme SacI to construct a plasmid pSTV28::Pthr::pyc for pyc amplification.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0313">The plasmid pSTV28::Pthr::pyc for pyc amplification was introduced into the aforementioned <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637ÎadhE strain by electroporation to obtain a transformant which are resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. This pyc-amplified strain of <i>Enterobacter aerogenes </i>AJ110637ÎadhE was designated as AJ110637ÎadhE/pSTV28::Pthr::pyc.</p>
