      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to cleaning devices and, more specifically, to cleaning device agitators having features for removing dirt and debris from the agitator.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is well known in the art of cleaning devices to use agitators to clean surfaces such as carpets, upholstery, and bare floors. These agitators can function in a variety of ways and appear in many forms. One typical embodiment of an agitator is a tube or shaft that rotates around its longitudinal axis and has one or more features that agitate the surface as it rotates. Such features typically include one or more bristle tufts, flexible flaps, bumps, and so on. These are commonly referred to as “brushrolls,” but other terms have been used to describe them. The agitator moves or dislodges dirt from the surface, making it easier to collect by the cleaning device. Agitators are useful in a variety of cleaning devices including vacuum cleaners, sweepers, wet extractors, and so on. In a sweeper, the agitator typically moves or throws the dirt directly into a receptacle. In a vacuum cleaner or similar device, the dirt may be entrained in an airflow generated by a vacuum within the cleaning device and thereby conveyed to a filter bag, cyclone separator or other kind of dirt collection device in the vacuum cleaner. U.S. Pat. No. 4,372,004, which reference is incorporated herein, provides an example of such an agitator.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It has been found that rotating agitators used in vacuum cleaners, floor sweepers, and the like, can collect a significant amount of various kinds of dirt and debris on the agitator itself. For example, the debris may include human and animal hairs, strings, threads, carpet fibers and other elongated fibers that wrap around or otherwise cling to the agitator. It has also been found that accumulated debris can reduce the performance of the agitator in a variety of ways. For example, debris may cover the agitation bristles and diminish the agitator's ability to agitate a surface. Further, debris on the agitator may impede the rotation of the agitator by wrapping around the axle or by creating additional friction with the cleaning head. If not removed, such debris can also accumulate on or migrate to the ends of the agitator and enter the bearing areas where it may cause binding, remove bearing lubrication, or otherwise generate high friction, excessive heat, or other undesirable conditions that can damage the bearings or mounting structure. In addition, debris collected on the agitator may create an imbalance in the agitator that may result in sound and/or vibrations when the agitator rotates.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Debris that has collected on an agitator is often difficult to remove because it has wrapped tightly around the agitator and intertwined with the bristles. Users of a cleaning device often must invert the device and remove the debris with manual tools such as knives, scissors or other implements. Manual removal can be unsanitary, time consuming and, if the user fails to follow instructions to deactivate the vacuum, may expose the user to contact with a moving agitator.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Some known devices use mechanisms and features to facilitate removing elongated fibers, such as string and hair, that may become wrapped around an agitator during use. For example, some agitators are provided with integral grooves that allow access by a pair of scissors or a knife blade to manually cut the fiber. Other cleaning devices use comb-like mechanisms to attempt to remove fibers. One example is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,960,714, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Still other devices, such as those shown in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/405,761, filed on Mar. 17, 2009 (Publication No. US 2009/0229075), which is incorporated herein by reference, use a movable blade to selectively press against the agitator to sever or abrade fibers. In the device in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/405,761, the agitator is provided with a raised support surface that provides a firm backing against which the blade presses to pinch and cut the fibers. Devices such as those in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/405,761 have been found to be effective for simple and durable user-friendly cleaning.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">While various features of vacuum cleaner agitators and agitator cleaning devices are known, there still exists a need to provide alternatives, modifications, and improvements to such devices.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In one exemplary embodiment, there is provided a a vacuum cleaner having a base, an agitator cleaner, an agitator, and a motor. The agitator extends in a longitudinal direction and is mounted to the base to rotate about a longitudinal axis of the agitator and to move between a first position in which the agitator is spaced from the agitator cleaner and a second position in which the agitator engages the agitator cleaner. The motor is operatively associated with the base and configured to rotate the agitator about the longitudinal axis of the agitator while the agitator is in the second position to remove debris from the agitator by interaction between the agitator and the agitator cleaner. An actuator may be operatively connected to the agitator to move the agitator from the first position to the second position.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">An exemplary embodiment of an upright vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In general, the vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> includes a base <b>102</b>, a handle <b>104</b>, and a pivot joint <b>106</b> connecting the base <b>102</b> to the handle <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The exemplary handle <b>104</b> includes a dirt collector <b>108</b>, such as a bag chamber or cyclone separator, and a suction motor <b>110</b> (i.e., a combined impeller and electric motor) configured to suck air through the dirt collector <b>108</b>. The handle <b>104</b> is connected to the base <b>102</b> by a suction hose <b>112</b>, and the suction hose <b>112</b> is fluidly connected to a suction inlet <b>114</b> located on the bottom of the base <b>102</b>. The vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> may be powered by a battery pack, a cord <b>116</b> to a household power supply, a combination of the foregoing, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The exemplary base <b>102</b> includes a rotating floor agitator <b>118</b> and an agitator cleaner (<b>200</b>, <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>). These may be visible to the user through a window or transparent housing on the surface of the base <b>102</b>. A pedal <b>120</b> or other actuator mechanism may be provided to operate the agitator cleaner <b>200</b>. Details of the agitator <b>118</b> and agitator cleaner <b>200</b> are provided below.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The pivot joint <b>106</b> joins the base <b>102</b> to the handle <b>104</b> to allow relative movement therebetween. The pivot joint <b>106</b> may provide a single pivot axis (e.g., tilting back and forth about a pivot that extends in the lateral direction) or multiple pivot axes (e.g., tilting about a laterally-extending pivot axis and swiveling about a long axis of the handle <b>104</b> or rotating about a second pivot axis that extends in the fore-aft direction). Pivot axes may be defined by bushings, shafts, bearings, and the like, as known in the art. One or more locking mechanisms (not shown) may be provided to selectively prevent the handle <b>104</b> from pivoting about one or more axes, in order to hold the handle <b>104</b> in an upright position or for other purposes.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> may include various other features. For example, the handle <b>104</b> may include a grip <b>122</b>, storage for accessory tools <b>124</b>, a power switch, a removable cleaning hose and associated wand, and other typical features of upright vacuum cleaners. The vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> also may include supplemental filters to provide fine dust separation. Also, the locations of the various working parts, such as the suction motor <b>110</b> and dirt collector <b>108</b> may be modified, such as by placing one or both in the base <b>102</b>. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate the exemplary base <b>102</b> with the top cover and various other parts removed for clarity. The agitator <b>118</b> is rotatably mounted in the base adjacent the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> and inside an agitator chamber that opens on the lower end to form the suction inlet <b>114</b>. The agitator <b>118</b> may be mounted to the base <b>102</b> by a pair of bearings <b>202</b> or other support structures. The agitator <b>118</b> also may have a pulley <b>204</b> or other driven element, that is connected to and driven be a suitable motor. In some cases, a dedicated motor <b>246</b> mounted in the base <b>102</b> may be used to drive the agitator <b>118</b>, but in other cases the agitator <b>118</b> may be driven by the suction motor <b>110</b>. In the latter case, a typical arrangement is to mount the suction motor <b>110</b> in the handle (as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), with an extended portion of the suction motor's drive shaft <b>206</b> extending through the pivot joint <b>106</b> and into an enclosed belt chamber in the base <b>102</b>. In such devices, a belt <b>208</b> may extend directly from the drive shaft <b>206</b> to the pulley <b>204</b>. Other embodiments may use intermediate drive elements joining the drive shaft <b>206</b> to the pulley <b>204</b>. Also, other embodiments may mount the suction motor <b>110</b> directly in the base <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The agitator <b>118</b> comprises a spindle <b>210</b> that is rotatably mounted to the base by the bearings <b>202</b>. A plurality of agitating devices, such as bristles <b>212</b> or flaps, extend from the spindle <b>210</b> a first radial distance to extend outside the suction inlet <b>114</b> to contact an underlying surface. As used herein, the term “radial distance” refers to a distance from the spindle's rotation axis <b>214</b> to the furthest point, as measured in a plane orthogonal to the rotation axis <b>214</b>, on the part in question. The bristles <b>212</b> may comprise tufts or rows of fibers. In the shown embodiment, the bristles <b>212</b> are provided as two helical rows of spaced fiber tufts. Each row reverses its helical direction at the midpoint of the spindle <b>210</b>, which may be helpful to prevent the generation of lateral forces during operation and help sweep dirt to a centrally-located suction passage. Other embodiments may be modified in various ways. For example, the spaced tufts may be replaced by an arrangement of fibers that extends continuously along the spindle <b>210</b>, with periodic gaps as required to avoid contact with support structures that may be located in the base <b>102</b> or suction inlet <b>114</b>. Other embodiments may provide more than two helical rows, use helical rows that do not reverse direction, or reverse direction more than once or at different locations, and so on. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">One or more support surfaces <b>216</b> also may extend a second radial distance from the spindle <b>210</b>. The second radial distance is less than the first radial distance, and preferably is not sufficient to reach outside the suction inlet <b>114</b>. This prevents the support surfaces <b>216</b> from striking the underlying surface, but this is not strictly required in all embodiments. The support surfaces <b>216</b> preferably are arranged in a pattern that matches the bristles <b>212</b>, and in this case they are shaped as helixes that reverse direction at about the middle of the spindle's length. This “herringbone” pattern may help distribute loads created by the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> and provide other benefits. The support surfaces <b>216</b> also preferably extend, without any interruptions and at an essentially constant radial distance, from a first end of each support surface <b>216</b> adjacent one end of the spindle <b>210</b> to a second end of each support surface <b>216</b> located adjacent the other end of the spindle <b>210</b>. This provides a continuous surface to bear against the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> throughout the agitator's full 360° rotation. This prevents the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> from moving up and down as the agitator <b>118</b> rotates, which may be uncomfortable to the operator and cause premature wear and damage.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Alternative support surfaces <b>216</b> may have other shapes, and may have different overall shapes than the agitating devices. The support surfaces <b>216</b> may include a series of radial ribs <b>218</b> with pockets between adjacent ribs <b>218</b> to assist with cleaning. The support surfaces <b>216</b> also may include outer surfaces <b>220</b> that are formed as segments of a circle centered on the spindle's rotation axis <b>214</b>, which may encourage contact with the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> over a substantial arc of the agitator's rotation. The outer surfaces <b>220</b> may all be at the same radial distance from the rotation axis <b>214</b>, or portions may be at different distances. For example, the left side of one of the two support surfaces <b>216</b> may taller than the right side, and the right side of the other support surface <b>216</b> may be taller than the left side. This may encourage more efficient cleaning by providing a higher contact force on a single point along each support surface <b>216</b> at any given time during rotation. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure. For example, the support surfaces <b>216</b> may be omitted or replaced by different structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The exemplary agitator cleaner <b>200</b> comprises a cleaning member <b>222</b> that is connected to a rigid bar <b>224</b>. The cleaning member <b>222</b> preferably comprises a blade-like edge that extends continuously along the portion of the spindle <b>210</b> that has bristles <b>212</b> or other agitating members extending therefrom. Gaps may be provided in the cleaning member <b>222</b> where supports or other structures would otherwise interfere with the cleaning member <b>222</b>. The cleaning member <b>222</b> optionally may be made of a flexible sheet of material, such as metal, to allow some flexure to prevent the generation of excessive force against the support surfaces <b>216</b>. However, other embodiments may use a cleaning member <b>222</b> made of relatively rigid metal, plastic, ceramic or other materials. While it is preferred to have a cleaning member <b>222</b> with a continuous straight edge, such as described above and shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, other embodiments may use serrations or discrete teeth to form some of all of the cleaning member <b>222</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The bar <b>224</b>, which may be integral to or separately formed from the cleaning member <b>222</b>, is pivotally mounted to the base <b>102</b> by pivots <b>226</b> such as bearings or bushings. The bar <b>224</b> includes an actuator, such as a lever <b>228</b>, that may be manipulated to move the cleaning member <b>222</b> into engagement with the bristles <b>212</b> to cut, abrade or otherwise remove fibers from the agitator <b>118</b>. The lever <b>228</b> may be operated directly, or through a linkage.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the exemplary embodiment, the lever <b>228</b> is rotated by the pedal <b>120</b>. The pedal <b>120</b> is mounted to the base <b>102</b> by a pivot <b>230</b>. A first end <b>232</b> of the pedal <b>120</b> is configured to receive an operating force, which may be applied directly or indirectly by a user. For example, the first end <b>232</b> may be shaped to receive a user's foot or hand, or may be connected to a drive linkage that is operated by an electric solenoid. A second end <b>234</b> of the pedal <b>120</b> includes a slot <b>236</b> that receives a pin <b>238</b> located at a free end of the lever <b>228</b>. The pivot <b>230</b> is located between the first and second ends <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> of the pedal <b>120</b>, so that a downward force applied to the first end <b>232</b> moves the second end <b>234</b> upward. As the second end <b>234</b> moves upward, the slot <b>236</b> and pin <b>238</b> also rise. During this movement, the pin <b>238</b> (which may have a roller) slides along the slot <b>236</b>. As the pin <b>238</b> rises, it rotates the bar <b>224</b>, and moves the cleaning member <b>222</b> down to engage the agitator <b>118</b> to perform the agitator cleaning operation. This operative position is shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">If desired, the amount of force transmitted to the cleaning member <b>222</b> to hold it in the operative position may be regulated or limited. For example, the lever <b>228</b> may be formed as a leaf spring that flexes to limit the amount of force that can be transmitted between the pedal <b>120</b> and the cleaning member <b>222</b>. Similarly, the cleaning member <b>222</b> may be flexible. In these embodiments, a lower surface <b>236</b>′ of the slot <b>236</b> may push the pin <b>238</b> upwards to generate the force necessary to move the cleaning member <b>222</b> to the operative position.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In another embodiment, the force to move the cleaning member <b>222</b> to the operative position may be modulated by applying the force with a spring <b>240</b> having a predetermined spring constant. In this embodiment a first spring <b>240</b> is connected to the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> to bias the cleaning member <b>222</b> towards the agitator <b>118</b>, and a second spring <b>242</b> is connected to the pedal <b>120</b> to bias it towards the idle position. The two springs <b>240</b>, <b>242</b> are shown as coil springs that operate in tension, but other types of spring may be used (e.g., coil springs in compression, torsion springs, leaf springs, elastomer blocks, etc.). In this embodiment, when the second spring <b>242</b> holds the pedal <b>120</b> in the idle position, an upper surface <b>236</b>″ of the slot <b>236</b> presses down on the pin <b>238</b> against the bias of the first spring <b>240</b> to hold the cleaning member <b>222</b> out of engagement with the agitator <b>118</b>. To maintain this position, the effective force of the second spring <b>242</b> must be sufficient to hold the first spring <b>240</b> in the extended position. To perform agitator cleaning, the user applies a force (manually or through electromotive means) to overcome the bias of the second spring <b>242</b> to move the pedal <b>120</b> to the operative position. When the pedal <b>120</b> rotates, the slot <b>236</b> rises, allowing the first spring <b>240</b> to pull the pin <b>238</b> upwards to rotate the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> to place the cleaning member <b>222</b> into contact with the agitator <b>118</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>. To isolate the cleaning member <b>222</b> from the force applied to move the pedal <b>120</b>, the slot <b>236</b> may be oversized so that the lower surface <b>236</b>′ does not contact and push up on the bottom of the pin <b>238</b> when the parts are in the operative position. Also, a travel stop <b>244</b> may be provided to prevent over-rotation of the pedal <b>120</b>, which could result in direct application of force on the agitator cleaner <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The foregoing exemplary embodiment may be modified in various ways. For example, the pin <b>238</b> and slot <b>236</b> arrangement may be replaced by a four-bar linkage, or the positions of the pin <b>238</b> and slot <b>236</b> may be swapped. As another example, the lower surface <b>236</b>′ of the slot <b>236</b> may be omitted. Also, the travel stop <b>244</b> may be movable (e.g., adjustable or removable) to allow the pedal <b>120</b> sufficient rotation for the lower surface <b>236</b>′ to push up on the pin <b>238</b> when the parts are in the operative position. This may be desirable to provide the option to clean with a higher force than the first spring <b>240</b> can generate, or as a backup in the event the first spring <b>240</b> breaks or loses tension. Also, other emb4odiments may configure the cleaning member <b>222</b> for linear reciprocation or other kinds of movement, and other mechanisms may be used to articulate the cleaning member <b>222</b>. Some such variations are shown in previously-incorporated references, and other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">It has been discovered that the forces applied to operate an agitator cleaning mechanism can be transmitted to the underlying floor surface, possibly resulting in damage to the floor. For example, a relatively large force may be applied to the base <b>102</b> by a user stepping on an agitator cleaner pedal <b>120</b>, such as described above. This force can push the base <b>102</b> and agitator <b>118</b> into the underlying surface, and contact between the rotating agitator <b>118</b> and the surface can damage either the agitator <b>118</b> or the surface. Furthermore, even when a large force is not transmitted to the surface (e.g., when a solenoid or the like operates the pedal <b>120</b>), the agitator cleaning operation may be performed with the rotating agitator <b>118</b> constantly brushing against a single spot on the underlying surface, and such prolonged contact can generate sufficient friction heat to damage (e.g., burn or melt) the surface or the agitating devices. Thus, it may be desirable in some embodiments to provide a system to prevent contact between the agitator <b>118</b> and the surface during agitator cleaning operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> schematically illustrate an exemplary agitator cleaning system having a mechanism to disengage the agitator <b>118</b> from the underlying floor surface <b>300</b> during agitator cleaning. <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> shows the system in the idle position, and <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> shows the system in the operative position.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In this embodiment (which may be integrated into the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> or into other embodiments, or used separately), the vacuum cleaner base <b>102</b> is supported on the surface <b>300</b> by a front support assembly <b>302</b> and a rear support assembly <b>304</b>. The front and rear support assemblies <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> cooperate to define a stable platform to hold the base <b>102</b> at a predetermined orientation on the surface <b>300</b>. The front and rear support assemblies <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> each may comprise one or more wheels, rollers, casters, skids, or the like, as known in the art. In the shown example, the front support assembly <b>302</b> includes one or more wheels <b>306</b> that are mounted to the base <b>102</b> on a movable support, such as the shown pivot arm <b>308</b>, to selectively position the wheels <b>306</b> at different vertical distances with respect to the rest of the base <b>102</b>. When the front support assembly <b>302</b> is raised to position the wheels <b>306</b> relatively close to the rest of the base <b>102</b> (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>), the base <b>102</b> rests with the agitator <b>118</b> closer to the surface <b>300</b>. When the front support assembly <b>302</b> is lowered to position the wheels <b>306</b> relatively far from the rest of the base <b>102</b> (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>), the base <b>102</b> rests with the agitator <b>118</b> farther from the surface <b>300</b>. In the position of <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, the agitator <b>118</b> preferably is far enough from the surface <b>300</b> that the agitator <b>118</b> will not contact typical carpets and other floor coverings. The pivot arm <b>308</b> may be connected to the rest of the base <b>102</b> by a spring (not shown) to bias the wheels <b>306</b> into the raised position, as known in the art. The construction of such movable supports for vacuum cleaner bases is known in the context of height adjustment mechanisms to position the suction inlet to clean different height carpets, and “kick-up” mechanisms to lift the agitator out of contact with the underling surface when the handle is placed into the upright position for accessory cleaning. Examples of such devices are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,683,448; 4,446,594; 5,974,625; 6,363,573; and 7,246,407, which are incorporated herein by reference. The agitator <b>118</b> is mounted to the base <b>102</b> in front of the front wheels <b>306</b>, but may be located elsewhere.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The front support assembly <b>302</b> may be moved into the lowered position during agitator cleaning operations to prevent the agitator <b>118</b> from potentially damaging (or being damaged by) the underlying surface <b>300</b>. To do so, the pedal <b>120</b> may include a driving member that acts on the front support assembly <b>302</b> to move the wheels <b>306</b> from a raised position (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>) to a the lowered position (<figref>FIG. 3B</figref>). For example, the pedal <b>120</b> may include a pin <b>310</b> that is mounted at a radial distance from the pedal's pivot <b>230</b>, so that the pin <b>310</b> travels through an arc as the pedal <b>120</b> rotates. The pin <b>310</b> contacts a driven member, such as a ramp <b>312</b>, located on the front support assembly <b>302</b>, and applies a force to move the ramp <b>312</b> and the rest of the front support assembly <b>302</b> downwards as the pin <b>310</b> rotates with the pedal <b>120</b>. The pin <b>310</b> may comprise a roller or bushing to reduce friction, and the parts may be made of relatively durable materials to ensure longevity and smooth operation over many cycles.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">It will be appreciated that the front support assembly <b>302</b> may double as a height adjusting mechanism, and in this case, the pin <b>310</b> may be spaced from the ramp <b>312</b> when the pedal <b>120</b> is idle and the front support assembly <b>302</b> is adjusted down to for cleaning high carpets. However, upon moving the pedal <b>120</b> to the operative position, any gap between the pin <b>310</b> and the ramp <b>312</b> will be closed prior to the pin <b>310</b> forcing the ramp <b>312</b> down further. It is also envisioned that the highest setting of the height adjustment mechanism may be sufficient to place the front support assembly <b>302</b> in the position shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, in which case the pin <b>310</b> is still operatively associated with the front support assembly <b>302</b>, but is only necessary and used when the height adjustment mechanism is left in settings that do not place the front support assembly <b>320</b> in the position of <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The foregoing embodiment may be modified in various ways. For example, the locations of the pin <b>310</b> and ramp <b>312</b> may be swapped, or they may be replaced with different driving and driven devices (e.g., a pushrod or linkage). The driven device also may comprise a pre-existing part of the front support assembly <b>302</b>. For example, the driving member may press down on the front wheel <b>306</b> or its axle, or on a part that is also used with a height adjusting mechanism for the suction inlet. Also, the front support assembly <b>302</b> may be indirectly driven by the pedal <b>120</b>. For example, the driving member may rotate a pre-existing height adjustment knob that raises and lowers the front support assembly <b>302</b>, or it may contact a microswitch that activates a solenoid that drives the front support assembly <b>302</b> downward. Also, in other embodiments, the front support assembly <b>302</b> may be a part or assembly that is separate from a pre-existing front wheel carriage that is used to adjust the height of the suction inlet during normal use. It is also envisioned that the movable front support assembly <b>302</b> may be replaced by a movable rear support assembly <b>304</b>, or both of the support assemblies <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may be movable. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The foregoing embodiments describe ways to lift the agitator <b>118</b> relative to the surface <b>300</b> as part of the agitator cleaning operation. In other embodiments, the agitator cleaning mechanisms may be disabled until some other mechanism is used to raise the agitator <b>118</b> out of engagement with the floor surface <b>300</b>. For example, In the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the front support assembly <b>302</b> may include a blocker <b>400</b> that prevents the pedal <b>120</b> from moving out of the idle position until the front support assembly <b>302</b> has reached a predetermined lowered position. Thus, agitator cleaning operations cannot be performed until the front support assembly <b>302</b> is lowered by some other mechanism to the lowered position shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. Any other conventional device may be used to lower the front support assembly <b>302</b> to the lowered position. For example, the handle <b>104</b> may include a driving member, such as a radial protrusion <b>402</b>, and the front support assembly <b>302</b> may have a corresponding driven member, such as a ramp <b>404</b>. When the handle <b>104</b> is leaned back for normal floor cleaning, the radial protrusion <b>402</b> does not engage the ramp <b>404</b>, and the front support assembly <b>302</b> is free to rise up to place the agitator <b>118</b> close to the surface <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. In this position, the blocker <b>400</b> impedes the pin <b>310</b> and prevents the pedal <b>120</b> from being moved to perform agitator cleaning. When the handle <b>104</b> is tilted forward, the radial protrusion <b>402</b> presses against the ramp <b>404</b>, to place the front support assembly <b>302</b> in the lowered position, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>. In this position, the blocker <b>400</b> does not impede the pin <b>310</b>, and the user is free to depress the pedal <b>120</b> to perform agitator cleaning operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The foregoing embodiment may be modified in various ways. For example, a conventional nozzle height adjustment mechanism may be used to move the front support assembly <b>302</b> into the lowered position of <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> to permit agitator cleaning. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Still other embodiments may lift the agitator <b>118</b> out of engagement with the surface <b>300</b> without necessarily repositioning the rest of the base relative the surface <b>300</b>. For example, in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the agitator <b>118</b> may be mounted to the base <b>102</b> on a pivot arm <b>500</b>. Arrangements for mounting an agitator in this manner are known in the art, and described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,286,180, which is incorporated herein by reference. In this embodiment, the pedal <b>120</b> may be connected to the agitator pivot arm <b>500</b> by a linkage <b>502</b>. When the pedal <b>120</b> is in the idle position, shown in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, the agitator <b>118</b> extends outside the base <b>102</b> and can contact the underlying surface <b>300</b>. When the pedal is depressed to the operative position, the pedal <b>120</b> rotates the linkage <b>502</b> and lifts the agitator <b>118</b> into the base <b>102</b> where it can no longer contact the surface <b>300</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>. In this embodiment, the pedal <b>120</b> also may rotate the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> towards the agitator <b>118</b> (as in the embodiments illustrated above), but alternatively, the agitator cleaner <b>200</b> may be fixedly mounted in the base <b>102</b> at a location where the elevated agitator <b>118</b> comes into contact with it to perform the cleaning operation. As in some foregoing embodiments, the user can depress the pedal <b>120</b> to simultaneously remove the agitator <b>118</b> from contact with the surface <b>300</b>, and initiate the agitator cleaning process.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As with other embodiments shown herein, the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> also can be modified in various ways. For example, the agitator pivot arm <b>500</b> may be part of or connected to a height adjusting mechanism that is used to tune the agitator's height to particular floor surfaces. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another example of an agitator cleaning mechanism. The base <b>102</b> is removed from this view for clarity of illustration. In this example, the pedal <b>120</b> has a hook-shaped protrusion <b>600</b> that moves the agitator cleaner pin <b>238</b> down (as shown) to hold the cleaning member <b>222</b> out of engagement with the agitator <b>118</b>. The pedal <b>120</b> is mounted on a pivot <b>230</b>, so that depressing the end of pedal <b>120</b> lifts the protrusion <b>600</b> to allow a spring (e.g. spring <b>240</b> in <figref>FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>) to pull the cleaning member <b>222</b> into engagement with the agitator <b>118</b>. The pedal <b>120</b> also includes a pushrod <b>602</b> that moves the front support assembly <b>302</b> downwards when the pedal <b>120</b> is depressed. The pushrod <b>602</b> is operated by a pin <b>604</b> that is mounted on the pedal <b>120</b>. The pin <b>604</b> fits in a slot <b>606</b> that allows a limited amount of pedal rotation before the pin <b>604</b> presses on the pushrod <b>602</b> to displace the front support assembly <b>302</b>. The distal end of the pushrod <b>602</b> is connected to the pivot arm <b>308</b> via a pivoting arrangement or other suitable mechanism. When the pedal <b>120</b> is returned to the idle position, the pin <b>604</b> pulls back up on the pushrod <b>602</b> to lift the front support assembly back towards the base <b>102</b>, to place the agitator <b>118</b> closer to the surface for floor cleaning operations. The free travel provided by the slot <b>606</b> allows the front support assembly <b>302</b> to move up and down by a predetermined distance when the pedal <b>120</b> is in the idle position, and thereby allows the front support assembly <b>302</b> to be manipulated by a conventional height-adjusting device during floor cleaning operations. In devices in which such a height-adjusting mechanism is not desired or other means to provide relative free movement are provided, the slot <b>606</b> may be omitted. Alternative variations may use other mechanisms, such as a cable, to lift the front support assembly. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The exemplary embodiments are described herein in the context of an upright vacuum cleaner, but it will be readily apparent that other embodiments may be used in stick vacuums, canister or central vacuum cleaner powerheads, robotic vacuum cleaners, wet extractors, and other cleaning devices having rotating agitators that are likely to experience fouling by wrapped fibers. Furthermore, the embodiments described herein may be combined together, if desired (e.g., features of <figref>FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> may be combined with features of <figref>FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>).
