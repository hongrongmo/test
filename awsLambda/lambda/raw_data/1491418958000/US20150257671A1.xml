      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">While the disclosure is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specifics thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the intention is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">For the following defined terms, these definitions shall be applied, unless a different definition is given in the claims or elsewhere in this specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">All numeric values are herein assumed to be modified by the term âabout,â whether or not explicitly indicated. The term âaboutâ generally refers to a range of numbers that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited value (e.g., having the same function or result). In many instances, the terms âaboutâ may include numbers that are rounded to the nearest significant figure.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ, and âtheâ include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term âorâ is generally employed in its sense including âand/orâ unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">It is noted that references in the specification to âan exampleâ, âsome examplesâ, âother examplesâ, etc., indicate that the example described may include one or more particular features, structures, and/or characteristics. However, such recitations do not necessarily mean that all examples include the particular features, structures, and/or characteristics. Additionally, when particular features, structures, and/or characteristics are described in connection with one example, it should be understood that such features, structures, and/or characteristics may also be used connection with other examples whether or not explicitly described unless clearly stated to the contrary. Also, when particular features, structures, and/or characteristics are described in connection with one example, it is implicit that other examples may include less than all of the disclosed features, structures, and/or characteristics in all combinations.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings in which similar elements in different drawings are numbered the same. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict illustrative embodiments and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Mapping the electrophysiology of heart rhythm disorders often involves the introduction of a constellation catheter or other mapping/sensing device having a plurality of electrodes and/or sensors (e.g., CONSTELLATIONÂ®, commercially available from Boston Scientific) into a cardiac chamber. The sensors, for example electrodes, detect cardiac electrical activity at sensor locations. It may be desirable to have the cardiac electrical activity processed into electrogram signals that accurately represent cellular excitation through cardiac tissue relative to the sensor locations. A processing system may then analyze and output the signal to a display device. Further, the processing system may output the signal as an activation or vector field map. A user, such as a physician, may use the activation or vector field map to perform a diagnostic procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Some example catheters may include sixty-four or more electrodes which each detect cardiac electrical activity. Accordingly, the processing system may process each of the sixty-four or more detected cardiac electrical activity signals into electrogram signals. In some examples, a user may then input information for each of the sixty-four or more electrogram signals which the processing system uses in determining pieces of data to populate an activation map. This inputting of information for such a high number of electrogram signals can result in lengthy procedure times. The methods and systems disclosed herein are designed to reduce the amount of information a user needs to input for the processing system to determine pieces of data to populate an activation map. For example, some of the methods disclosed herein may reduce the number of electrogram signals for which a user needs to input information or suggest information to a user for review for at least some of the electrogram signals. Other methods and medical devices are also disclosed.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a system <b>10</b> for accessing a targeted tissue region in the body for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> generally shows the system <b>10</b> deployed in the left atrium of the heart. Alternatively, system <b>10</b> can be deployed in other regions of the heart, such as the left ventricle, right atrium, or right ventricle. While the illustrated embodiment shows system <b>10</b> being used for ablating myocardial tissue, system <b>10</b> (and the methods described herein) may alternatively be configured for use in other tissue ablation applications, such as procedures for ablating tissue in the prostrate, brain, gall bladder, uterus, nerves, blood vessels and other regions of the body, including in systems that are not necessarily catheter-based.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">System <b>10</b> includes mapping probe <b>14</b> and ablation probe <b>16</b>. Each probe <b>14</b>/<b>16</b> may be separately introduced into the selected heart region <b>12</b> through a vein or artery (e.g., the femoral vein or artery) using a suitable percutaneous access technique. Alternatively, mapping probe <b>14</b> and ablation probe <b>16</b> can be assembled in an integrated structure for simultaneous introduction and deployment in the heart region <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Mapping probe <b>14</b> may include flexible catheter body <b>18</b>. The distal end of catheter body <b>18</b> carries three-dimensional multiple electrode structure <b>20</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, structure <b>20</b> takes the form of a basket defining an open interior space <b>22</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), although other multiple electrode structures could be used. Structure <b>20</b> carries a plurality of mapping electrodes <b>24</b> (not explicitly shown on <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, but shown on <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) each having an electrode location on structure <b>20</b> and a conductive member. Each electrode <b>24</b> may be configured to sense or detect intrinsic physiological activity in an anatomical region adjacent to each electrode <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some examples, electrodes <b>24</b> may be configured to detect activation signals of the intrinsic physiological activity within the anatomical structure. For example, intrinsic cardiac electrical activity may comprise repeating or semi-repeating waves of electrical activity with relatively large spikes in activity at the beginning of activation events. Electrodes <b>24</b> may sense such activation events and the times at which such activation events occur. Generally, electrodes <b>24</b> may sense activation events at different times as an electrical activity wave propagates through the heart. For instance, an electrical wave may begin near a first group of electrodes <b>24</b>, which may sense an activation event at relatively the same time or within a relatively small window of time. As the electrical wave propagates through the heart, a second group of electrodes <b>24</b> may sense the activation even of the electrical wave at times later than the first group of electrodes <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Electrodes <b>24</b> are electrically coupled to processing system <b>32</b>. A signal wire (not shown) may be electrically coupled to each electrode <b>24</b> on structure <b>20</b>. The signal wires may extend through body <b>18</b> of probe <b>14</b> and electrically couple each electrode <b>24</b> to an input of processing system <b>32</b>. Electrodes <b>24</b> sense cardiac electrical activity in the anatomical region, e.g., myocardial tissue, adjacent to their physical location within the heart. The sensed cardiac electrical activity (e.g., electrical signals generated by the heart which may include activation signals) may be processed by processing system <b>32</b> to assist a user, for example a physician, by generating an anatomical map (e.g., a vector field map, an activation time map) to identify one or more sites within the heart appropriate for a diagnostic and/or treatment procedure, such as an ablation procedure. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may identify a near-field signal component (e.g., activation signals originating from cellular tissue adjacent to mapping electrodes <b>24</b>) or an obstructive far-field signal component (e.g., activation signals originating from non-adjacent tissue). In such examples where structure <b>20</b> is disposed in an atrium of the heart, as in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the near-field signal component may include activation signals originating from atrial myocardial tissue whereas the far-field signal component may include activation signals originating from ventricular myocardial tissue. The near-field activation signal component may be further analyzed to find the presence of a pathology and to determine a location suitable for ablation for treatment of the pathology (e.g., ablation therapy).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Processing system <b>32</b> may include dedicated circuitry (e.g., discrete logic elements and one or more microcontrollers; application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs); or specially configured programmable devices, such as, for example, programmable logic devices (PLDs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)) for receiving and/or processing the acquired cardiac electrical activity. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> includes a general purpose microprocessor and/or a specialized microprocessor (e.g., a digital signal processor, or DSP, which may be optimized for processing activation signals) that executes instructions to receive, analyze and display information associated with the received cardiac electrical activity. In such examples, processing system <b>32</b> can include program instructions, which when executed, perform part of the signal processing. Program instructions can include, for example, firmware, microcode or application code that is executed by microprocessors or microcontrollers. The above-mentioned implementations are merely exemplary, and the reader will appreciate that processing system <b>32</b> can take any suitable form for receiving electrical signals and processing the received electrical signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may be configured to measure the sensed cardiac electrical activity in the myocardial tissue adjacent to electrodes <b>24</b>. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may be configured to detect cardiac electrical activity associated with a dominant rotor or divergent activation pattern in the anatomical feature being mapped. Dominant rotors and/or divergent activation patterns may have a role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation, and ablation of the rotor path, rotor core, and/or divergent foci may be effective in terminating the atrial fibrillation. Processing system <b>32</b> processes the sensed cardiac electrical activity to generate a display of relevant characteristics, such as an isochronal map, activation time map, action potential duration (APD) map, a vector field map, a contour map, a reliability map, an electrogram, a cardiac action potential and the like. The relevant characteristics may assist a user to identify a site suitable for ablation therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Ablation probe <b>16</b> includes flexible catheter body <b>34</b> that carries one or more ablation electrodes <b>36</b>. The one or more ablation electrodes <b>36</b> are electrically connected to radio frequency (RF) generator <b>37</b> that is configured to deliver ablation energy to the one or more ablation electrodes <b>36</b>. Ablation probe <b>16</b> may be movable with respect to the anatomical feature to be treated, as well as structure <b>20</b>. Ablation probe <b>16</b> may be positionable between or adjacent to electrodes <b>24</b> of structure <b>20</b> as the one or more ablation electrodes <b>36</b> are positioned with respect to the tissue to be treated. Processing system <b>32</b> may output data to a suitable device, for example display device <b>40</b>, which may display relevant information for a user. In some examples, device <b>40</b> is a CRT, LED, or other type of display, or a printer. Device <b>40</b> presents the relevant characteristics in a format useful to the user.

Mapping catheter <b>14</b> may include flexible catheter body <b>18</b>, the distal end of which may carry three-dimensional multiple electrode structure <b>20</b> with mapping electrodes or sensors <b>24</b>. Mapping electrodes <b>24</b> may sense cardiac electrical activity, including activation signals, in the myocardial tissue. The sensed cardiac electrical activity may be processed by the processing system <b>32</b> to assist a user in identifying the site or sites having a heart rhythm disorder or other myocardial pathology via generated and displayed relevant characteristics. This information can then be used to determine an appropriate location for applying appropriate therapy, such as ablation, to the identified sites, and to navigate the one or more ablation electrodes <b>36</b> to the identified sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The illustrated three-dimensional multiple electrode structure <b>20</b> comprises base member <b>41</b> and end cap <b>42</b> between which flexible splines <b>44</b> generally extend in a circumferentially spaced relationship. As discussed herein, structure <b>20</b> may take the form of a basket defining an open interior space <b>22</b>. In some examples, the splines <b>44</b> are made of a resilient inert material, such as Nitinol, other metals, silicone rubber, suitable polymers, or the like and are connected between base member <b>41</b> and end cap <b>42</b> in a resilient, pretensioned condition, to bend and conform to the tissue surface they contact. In the example illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, eight splines <b>44</b> form three dimensional multiple electrode structure <b>20</b>. Additional or fewer splines <b>44</b> could be used in other examples. As illustrated, each spline <b>44</b> carries eight mapping electrodes <b>24</b>. Additional or fewer mapping electrodes <b>24</b> could be disposed on each spline <b>44</b> in other examples of three dimensional multiple electrode structure <b>20</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, structure <b>20</b> is relatively small (e.g., 40 mm or less in diameter). In alternative examples, structure <b>20</b> is even smaller or larger (e.g., less than or greater than 40 mm in diameter).</p>

Moving sheath <b>50</b> distally relative to catheter body <b>18</b> may cause sheath <b>50</b> to move over structure <b>20</b>, thereby collapsing structure <b>20</b> into a compact, low profile condition suitable for introduction into and/or removal from an interior space of an anatomical structure, such as, for example, the heart. In contrast, moving sheath <b>50</b> proximally relative to the catheter body may expose structure <b>20</b>, allowing structure <b>20</b> to elastically expand and assume the pretensed position illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>

The signal wires may extend through body <b>18</b> of mapping catheter <b>20</b> (or otherwise through and/or along body <b>18</b>) into handle <b>54</b>, in which they are coupled to external connector <b>56</b>, which may be a multiple pin connector. Connector <b>56</b> electrically couples mapping electrodes <b>24</b> to processing system <b>32</b>. It should be understood that these descriptions are just examples. Some addition details regarding these and other example mapping systems and methods for processing signals generated by a mapping catheter can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,070,094, 6,233,491, and 6,735,465, the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">To illustrate the operation of system <b>10</b>, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic side view of an example of basket structure <b>20</b> including a plurality of mapping electrodes <b>24</b>. In the illustrated example, the basket structure includes <b>64</b> mapping electrodes <b>24</b>. Mapping electrodes <b>24</b> are disposed in groups of eight electrodes (labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) on each of eight splines (labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H). While an arrangement of sixty-four mapping electrodes <b>24</b> is shown disposed on basket structure <b>20</b>, mapping electrodes <b>24</b> may alternatively be arranged in different numbers (more or fewer splines and/or electrodes), on different structures, and/or in different positions. In addition, multiple basket structures can be deployed in the same or different anatomical structures to simultaneously obtain signals from different anatomical structures.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">After basket structure <b>20</b> is positioned adjacent to the anatomical structure to be treated (e.g. left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, or right ventricle of the heart), processing system <b>32</b> is configured to record the cardiac electrical activity from each electrode <b>24</b> channel, and the cardiac electrical activity is related to physiological activity of the adjacent anatomical structure. For instance, cardiac electrical activity may include activation signals which may indicate an onset of physiological activity, such as a contraction of the heart. Electrodes <b>24</b> sense such cardiac electrical activity which includes activation signals. The cardiac electrical activity of physiological activity may be sensed in response to intrinsic physiological activity (e.g. intrinsically generated electrical signals) or based on a predetermined pacing protocol instituted by at least one of the plurality of electrodes <b>24</b> (e.g. delivered electrical signals delivered by a pacing device).</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The arrangement, size, spacing and location of electrodes along a constellation catheter or other mapping/sensing device, in combination with the specific geometry of the targeted anatomical structure, may contribute to the ability (or inability) of electrodes <b>24</b> to sense, measure, collect and transmit electrical activity of cellular tissue. As stated, because splines <b>44</b> of a mapping catheter, constellation catheter or other similar sensing device are bendable, they may conform to a specific anatomical region in a variety of shapes and/or configurations. Further, at any given position in the anatomical region, structure <b>20</b> may be manipulated such that one or more splines <b>44</b> may not contact adjacent cellular tissue. For example, splines <b>44</b> may twist, bend, or lie atop one another, thereby separating splines <b>44</b> from nearby cellular tissue. Additionally, because electrodes <b>24</b> are disposed on one or more of splines <b>44</b>, they also may not maintain contact with adjacent cellular tissue. Electrodes <b>24</b> that do not maintain contact with cellular tissue may be incapable of sensing, detecting, measuring, collecting and/or transmitting electrical activity information. Further, because electrodes <b>24</b> may be incapable of sensing, detecting, measuring, collecting and/or transmitting electrical activity information, processing system <b>32</b> may be incapable of accurately displaying diagnostic information. For example, some necessary information may be missing and/or displayed inaccurately.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In addition to that stated above, electrodes <b>24</b> may not be in contact with adjacent cellular tissue for other reasons. For example, manipulation of mapping catheter <b>14</b> may result in movement of electrodes <b>24</b>, thereby creating poor electrode-to-tissue contact. Further, electrodes <b>24</b> may be positioned adjacent fibrous, dead or functionally refractory tissue. Electrodes <b>24</b> positioned adjacent fibrous, dead or functionally refractory tissue may not be able to sense changes in electrical potential because fibrous, dead or functionally refractory tissue may be incapable of depolarizing and/or responding to changes in electrical potential. Finally, far-field ventricular events and electrical line noise may distort measurement of tissue activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">However, electrodes <b>24</b> that contact healthy, responsive cellular tissue may sense cardiac electrical activity such as a change in the voltage potential of a propagating cellular activation wavefront. Further, in a normal functioning heart, electrical discharge of the myocardial cells may occur in a systematic, linear fashion. Therefore, detection of non-linear propagation of the cellular excitation wavefront may be indicative of cellular firing in an abnormal fashion. For example, cellular firing in a rotating pattern may indicate the presence of dominant rotors and/or divergent activation patterns. Further, because the presence of the abnormal cellular firing may occur over localized target tissue regions, it is possible that electrical activity may change form, strength or direction when propagating around, within, among or adjacent to diseased or abnormal cellular tissue. Identification of these localized areas of diseased or abnormal tissue may provide a user with a location for which to perform a therapeutic and/or diagnostic procedure. For example, identification of an area including reentrant or rotor currents may be indicative of an area of diseased or abnormal cellular tissue. The diseased or abnormal cellular tissue may be targeted for an ablative procedure. An activation time map may be used to identify areas of circular, adherent, rotor or other abnormal cellular excitation wavefront propagation.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As described previously, in order to generate an activation time map, processing system may need to receive input from a user. For example, after sensing cardiac electrical activity at each electrode <b>24</b>, processing system <b>32</b> may display the sensed cardiac electrical activity at display <b>40</b> as an electrogram. A user may then input information associated with each electrogram, and processing system <b>32</b> may use this input information to generate the activation time map. However, requiring a user to input information for each electrogram may be time consuming. Accordingly, one or more techniques described herein may reduce the number of electrograms for which processing system <b>32</b> needs a user to input information, and/or generate suggested input information.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In some examples, after collecting cardiac electrical activity sensed by electrodes <b>24</b>, processing system <b>32</b> may generate a number of electrograms based on the sensed cardiac electrical activity equal to the number of electrodes of the system. Processing system may additionally display the generated electrograms, for example at display device <b>40</b>. In some examples, the electrograms may simply be the raw sensed cardiac electrical activity. Processing system <b>32</b> may display each electrogram in a single graphical display, with all of the electrograms overlapping. Graph <b>400</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> displays signals <b>402</b> in such a fashion. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may display each electrogram in a separate graph. Displaying such electrograms may allow a user to assess the quality of the sensed cardiac electrical activity. For example, normal cardiac electrical activity appears as a noticeable, repeating waveform. Abnormal looking cardiac electrical activity may indicate problems with the electrodesâfor example the electrodes may not be in good electrical contact with the tissue. Using such abnormal electrograms to generate an activation time map may result in an inaccurate activation time map, which if used in ablation therapy could result in ineffective or even harmful therapy. Accordingly, if a user determines that the sensed cardiac electrical activity are abnormal, the user may reposition electrodes <b>24</b> and instruct processing system <b>32</b> to again collect cardiac electrical activity for each electrode. In some examples, each electrogram may span one to four seconds and are stored in a memory of processing system <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In at least some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may identify a characteristic signal. A characteristic signal may be one of the electrograms which display characteristics of a normal electrogram, e.g. a series of obvious repeating or semi-repeating peaks and valleys. Such features may indicate that the electrode associated with the characteristic signal is in good electrical contact with the tissue. Processing system <b>32</b> may identify a characteristic signal by comparing each electrogram to a reference electrogram and generating a difference score, for example using one or more statistical techniques for indicating how similar each electrogram is to the reference electrogram. Processing system <b>32</b> may identify the electrogram with the highest scoreâthat is, the most similar to the reference electrogramâas the characteristic signal. In other examples, processing system may use other techniques for identifying a characteristic electrogram. In still other examples, a user may select one of the electrograms as the characteristic signal. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may display each electrogram, and the user may select one of the displayed electrogram at display device <b>40</b> using a peripheral input device, e.g. a keyboard or mouse, or through touch input if display device <b>40</b> is a touch-sensitive display device. Alternatively, processing system <b>32</b> may identify one of the electrograms as an initial characteristic signal and may display the initial characteristic signal at display device <b>40</b>. A user may then enter input either confirming the initial characteristic signal as the characteristic signal or selecting a different electrogram as the characteristic signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">After identifying or determining a characteristic signal, processing system <b>32</b> may identify activation events and timings of any identified activation events in the characteristic signal. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may determine a derivative of the characteristic signal and identify locations within the derivative of the characteristic signal that are less than a predetermined threshold as activation events. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may user other techniques for identifying activation events in the characteristic signal. For instance, processing system <b>32</b> may employ a peak finding algorithm and determine that any identified peaks are activation events. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may display the characteristic signal at display device <b>40</b> and a user may select one or more locations in the characteristic signal as activation events. In still other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may identify one or more activation events and display the characteristic signal and determined activation events at display device <b>40</b>. A user may modify the activation events identified by processing system <b>32</b>, for example by removing identified activation events, adding activation events, and/or moving identified activation events. In any case, processing system <b>32</b> may additionally record the timings of the identified activation events. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> displays an example result of identifying activation events and activation event timings. For instance, graph <b>500</b> includes example characteristic signal <b>502</b> along with identified activation events <b>504</b> and activation event timings <b>506</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">Processing system <b>32</b> may additionally process each of the electrograms, as depicted in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6D</figref>. <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> depicts graph <b>600</b> which includes example electrogram <b>602</b>. Processing system <b>32</b> may utilize one or more signal processing techniques to transform example electrogram <b>602</b> to minimize or remove particular features. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a wavelet transform on example electrogram <b>602</b>. Any number of wavelet transforms may be used. In at least some examples the wavelet transform is a Haar wavelet transform. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> depicts graph <b>604</b> which includes example electrogram <b>606</b>, where example electrogram <b>606</b> represents example electrogram <b>602</b> after processing using a Haar wavelet transform.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may additionally rectify example electrogram <b>606</b>. <figref>FIG. 6C</figref> illustrates graph <b>608</b> which depicts example electrogram <b>610</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Example electrogram <b>610</b> is a depiction of example electrogram <b>606</b> after processing system performs rectification of example electrogram <b>606</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In additional examples, processing system <b>32</b> may further generate a power envelope of example electrogram <b>610</b>. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a low-pass filtering of example electrogram <b>610</b>. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may utilize other techniques for generating a power envelope. <figref>FIG. 6D</figref> depicts graph <b>612</b> including example electrogram <b>614</b>, which represents example electrogram <b>610</b> after processing system <b>32</b> processes example electrogram <b>610</b> to generate a power envelope. Graph <b>612</b> additionally depicts example electrogram <b>602</b> overlaid on example electrogram <b>614</b> as a comparison of the original electrogram to the fully processed electrogram.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Although the above description described a technique for processing electrograms using multiple signal processing techniques, in other examples, only one or two of the processing techniques may be used. For example, processing the electrograms may only consist of performing a wavelet transform on the electrogram. In other examples, the processing may only consist of rectification. In still other examples, the processing may only consist of generating a power envelope. In yet other examples, any combination of two of these processes may be combined to perform processing on the electrogram. It is also noted that these processing techniques should not be viewed as limiting. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may use other and/or additional signal processing techniques to process the electrogram. Additionally, the above described process has been described with respect to a single electrogram, however, in practice, processing system <b>32</b> may perform similar processing techniques on each of the electrograms generated from each electrode <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">After processing each of the electrograms, processing system <b>32</b> may additionally perform a statistical analysis on all of the processed electrograms. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a cross correlation analysis between the characteristic signal and the processed electrograms. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a Linear Discriminant Analysis on the processed electrograms. In at least some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a principal component analysis on the processed electrograms. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> depicts graph <b>700</b>, which includes data points <b>702</b>, and depicts the results of a principal component analysis on the sixty-four processed electrograms. Graph <b>700</b> also includes zero-point <b>704</b>, which merely indicates the (0,0) point on graph <b>700</b>. Each data point <b>702</b> represents one of the processed electrograms graphed with respect to a first principal component and a second principal component. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may transform the processed electrograms utilizing other statistical analysis techniques common in exploratory data analysis. In still other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may employ multiple statistical analysis techniques to analyze the processed electrograms.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Once processing system <b>32</b> has completed the statistical transformations of the processed electrograms, processing system <b>32</b> may cluster the results of the statistical transform. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may separate the results into multiple separate groups or clusters. In general, this clustering processing may identify groups of electrograms which are similar to one another, or on the basis of certain features within each electrogram. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a density-based clustering technique in order to group or cluster the results of the statistical transform. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a distribution-based clustering technique in order to group or cluster the results of the statistical transform. More specifically, in some examples where processing system <b>32</b> uses a distribution-based clustering technique, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) analysis on the results of the statistical transform. In at least some examples, the GMM analysis may be a two-dimensional analysis, and the results of the GMM analysis may be two separate groups or clusters of electrograms. <figref>FIG. 8</figref> depicts graph <b>800</b> including results of a two-dimensional GMM analysis. Electrogram groups <b>802</b> and <b>804</b> represent the output of the GMM analysis. In general, processing system <b>32</b> may use any of a number of known clustering techniques (such as the ones described above, or others known in the art, for example k-means clustering) for separating the electrograms into two or more groups or clusters.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">In some examples, the clustering process may produce more than two groups or clusters of electrograms. For example, in a GMM analysis, a user may select a specific number of groups or clusters as output of the GMM analysis. Accordingly, in examples where a user selects three groups or clusters, the output of the GMM analysis is three groups or clusters. However, in other examples, a user may select any number of groups or clusters. Selecting more than two groups or clusters may be advantageous in situations where the results of the statistical processing do not produce clear distinctions between electrograms.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In any event, one of the groups of electrograms contains the characteristic signal. In the example of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, electrogram group <b>802</b> contains the characteristic signal. This disclosure generally refers to electrogram group <b>802</b>, which contains the characteristic signal, as the âfirst groupâ and electrogram group <b>804</b> as the âsecond group.â In examples where the output of the GMM analysis is more than two groups, the âsecond groupâ may consist of two or more subgroups. For example, the âfirst groupâ may still be the group or cluster of electrograms that contains the characteristic signal. The âsecond group,â however, may consist of all other groups or clusters that do not contain the characteristic signal. Ultimately, when populating an activation time map, one or more of the known data points may be generated from one or more of the electrograms in the first group. Additionally, one or more of the unknown data points may be generated from the second group. In other examples, a known data point may be generated from each electrogram in the first group and an unknown data point may be generated from each electrogram in the second group.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In some examples, performing a clustering process may begin with one or more estimated or guessed parameters, and different parameters may produce different results. For example, using a first set of parameters may end in a result that is a local minimum. Using a second set of parameters may also end in a result that is a local minimum, but the local minimum is a lower minimum that the local minimum using the first set of parameters. Accordingly, in order to determine a global minimum, that is a local minimum that is lowest of all local minimum, processing system <b>32</b> may perform the clustering process multiple times. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may perform the clustering process <b>25</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, or any other suitable number of times. Processing system <b>32</b> may then use the results with the lowest overall local minimum as the results of the clustering processâe.g. the groupings resulting from the clustering process resulting in the lowest overall local minimum.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In other examples, a user may not identify a characteristic signal. In such examples, processing system <b>32</b> may determine which group or cluster of electrograms is the âfirst groupâ and which group(s) or cluster(s) are the âsecond group.â For instance, after performing a statistical analysis, such as principal component analysis or other appropriate statistical processing techniques, processing system <b>32</b> may further test electrogram characteristics of each group. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may perform an organizational index calculation on the fast-fourier transform (FFT) of each electrogram within each group or cluster. Then, processing system <b>32</b> may determine the group or cluster which shows the greatest amount of organization in the FFTs of the electrograms as the âfirst groupâ and all of the other groups as part of the âsecond group.â</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Once processing system <b>32</b> has separated the electrograms into at least a first and a second group, processing system <b>32</b> may additionally determine activation times for populating an activation time map. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may determine an activation time from the characteristic signal in a slightly different manner from the other electrograms in the first group. For example, processing system <b>32</b> already has stored in memory timings of activation events for the characteristic signal. Processing system may then identify one or more fiducial points in the characteristic signal. For example, one of the electrograms may be a reference electrogram. The reference electrogram may additionally have identified activation events and activation event timings associated with the activation events. Processing system <b>32</b> may identify one or more fiducial points in the characteristic signal with the same timings as the identified activation events in the reference electrogram. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may identify one or more particular features of the characteristic signal as fiducial points, such as the first data point of the characteristic signal. In examples where processing system <b>32</b> determines multiple fiducial points in the characteristic signal, processing system <b>32</b> may determine set data points as fiducial points, for example, every 10<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, 100<sup>th</sup>, or the like data points may be fiducial points. Processing system <b>32</b> additionally determines the timings of the fiducial points within the characteristic signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In any event, processing system <b>32</b> may determine an activation time from the timings of the activation events and the fiducial points. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may determine a difference in timings between a fiducial point and an activation event, with the difference being the activation time for the characteristic signal. In other examples, processing system may determine multiple differences in times between fiducial points and activation times, with the average of the differences being the activation time for the characteristic signal. Processing system <b>32</b> may store such a determined activation time in memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">As described above, processing system <b>32</b> may determine activation times for the other electrograms in the first group differently than for the characteristic signal. For example, none of the other electrograms have associated activation events and timings of activation events. Processing system <b>32</b> may begin by determining one or more activation events in the other electrograms. One technique processing system <b>32</b> may employ is to use a peak-finding algorithm to identify activation events in the other electrograms. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> depicts graph <b>900</b> showing electrogram <b>902</b>. After employing the peak finding-algorithm, processing system <b>32</b> may identify peaks <b>904</b>. Each peak <b>904</b> may have an associated peak timing <b>906</b>. In some examples, the peak-finding algorithm may identify peaks that do not represent activation events.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In order to reduce the number of identified peaks to peaks that only represent activation events, processing system <b>32</b> may compare the timings of the activation events in the characteristic signal to the timings of the peaks in the other electrograms. As described above, at the beginning of a physiological event, an electrical wave may propagate through the tissue adjacent to the electrodes. As this wave propagates through the tissue, each electrode may sense this wave, albeit at slightly different times. Accordingly, each electrodes may sense an activation event, but with slight differences in timing. Since activation events are already associated with the characteristic signal, the peaks in the other electrograms which identify activation events occur relatively closely in time to the timings of the activation events in the characteristic signal. Accordingly, processing system <b>32</b> may remove peaks identified in the other electrograms that fall outside of a time window defined around the timing of each activation event in the characteristic signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">
        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> depicts graph <b>1000</b> which includes electrogram <b>1002</b>. Electrogram <b>1002</b> is the same as electrogram <b>902</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. Graph <b>1000</b> also depicts peaks <b>1004</b> that processing system identified with a peak-finding algorithm. Associated peak timings <b>1006</b> represent the times at which peaks <b>1004</b> occur. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> also depicts activation event timings <b>1008</b>. Activation event timings <b>1008</b> represent the times at which the activation events occur in the characteristic signal. Activation windows <b>1010</b> are windows of time centered around each of activation event timings <b>1008</b>. Processing system may remove identified peaks whose associated peak timing does not fall within any activation window <b>1010</b>, as it is unlikely that these identified peaks do not represent actual activation events. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may remove peaks <b>1004</b><i>a, </i><b>1004</b><i>b, </i>and <b>1004</b><i>c, </i>as their associated peak timings <b>1006</b> do not within any activation windows <b>1010</b>. Although <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> generally depict a single electrogram, processing system <b>32</b> may perform a similar process on each other the other electrograms (e.g. each of the electrograms other than the characteristic signal) in the first group. Peak timings <b>1006</b> of remaining peaks <b>1004</b> may represent activation event timings in each of the other electrograms.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In some examples, multiple identified peaks may fall within an activation window <b>1010</b> (not shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). In such examples, processing system <b>32</b> may use one or more algorithms to remove the one or more extra peaks that fall within an activation window <b>1010</b>. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may employ a nearest-neighbor algorithm to find the identified peak that is closest in time to the activation event timing <b>1008</b> of the activation window <b>1010</b>. Processing system <b>32</b> may then remove all identified peaks within the activation window <b>1010</b> other than the ânearest-neighborâ identified peak. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may use other algorithms to remove peaks that fall within an activation window.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The above process for identifying activation events in the other electrograms is just one example. In other examples, processing system <b>32</b> may use other techniques for identifying activation events in the other electrograms. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may determine a derivative of the characteristic signal and identify locations within the derivative of the characteristic signal that are less than a predetermined threshold as activation events. Processing system <b>32</b> may additionally use other techniques for determining activation events in the other electrograms.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">After removing peaks in the other electrograms, or otherwise determining activation events in the other electrograms, processing system <b>32</b> may display each electrogram in the first group of electrograms at display device <b>40</b>, including the determined activation events and activation event timings. In some of these examples, a user may modify the determined activation events. For example, a user may add activation events, remove determined activation events, or move determined activation events for each of the other electrograms in the first group. Processing system <b>32</b> may then store the activation events and activation event timings for each of the electrograms in the first group in memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Processing system <b>32</b> may then determine activation times for each of the other electrograms. For example, processing system <b>32</b> identify one or more fiducial points in each of the other electrograms. The fiducial point or points may be the same fiducial point or points as the fiducial points in the characteristic signal. For example, the timing of the fiducial point or points in the other electrograms may be the same as the timing of the fiducial point or points in the characteristic signal. Processing system <b>32</b> may then determine a difference in times between a fiducial point and an activation event for each of the other electrograms. This difference in timing is the activation time. In other examples, processing system may determine multiple differences in times between fiducial points and activation times for each of the other electrograms, with the average of the differences being the activation time. Processing system <b>32</b> may store such determined activation times in memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Processing system <b>32</b> may then display each of the electrograms in the second group of electrograms at display device <b>40</b>. Processing system <b>32</b> may further receive input indicating activation events and activation event timings for each of the electrograms in the second group of electrograms. For example, a user may view one of the displayed electrograms and input information indicating an activation event. In some examples, the user may select a point on the electrogram with a peripheral input device, or using touch input if display device <b>40</b> is a touch-sensitive display, where the selected point represents an activation event. Processing system <b>32</b> may then determine an associated activation event timing for each received input indicating an activation event. Processing system <b>32</b> may additionally determine activation times for each of the electrograms in the second group in a similar manner as that described with respect to the characteristic signalâe.g. using one or more fiducial points and determining a difference or differences in timings of the fiducial point or points and activation events.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In this manner, processing system <b>32</b> may determine activation times for each of the electrograms in both the first and second groups of electrograms. Processing system may further populate an activation time map with these determined activation times and display the activation map at a display device, such as display device <b>40</b>. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> depicts an example activation map <b>1100</b>. Activation map <b>1100</b> takes the form of a grid that is designed to display activation times for all electrograms. As described previously, these electrograms are generated based on cardiac electrical activity sensed by electrodes <b>24</b> of multiple electrode structure <b>20</b> (and in some cases are the raw sensed cardiac electrical signals). Accordingly, the determined activation times may be associated with particular electrodes, as each electrogram is generated from data sensed by a single electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">Space <b>1102</b> on map <b>1100</b> represents a known data point, e.g. a known activation time. Each of the spaces filled in with a value represent known data points. As described previously, in some examples, a known data point may be generated from each electrogram in the first group of electrograms. Accordingly, each filled in space represents one of the electrograms in the first group of electrograms, which is associated with the electrode labeled with a reference number the same as the combination of the row and column of the space.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">In some examples, even after receiving input from a user, processing system <b>32</b> may not be able to determine activation times for one or more of the electrograms in the second group of electrograms. For example, a user may not be able to identify any activation events in one or more of the electrograms in the second group of electrograms and thus may not input any activation events to processing system <b>32</b>. One reason may be that the electrode that sensed the cardiac electrical activity was not in good electrical contact with the tissue and therefore did not sense the propagating wave. Accordingly, the electrogram based off of the sensed cardiac electrical activity may not include any features that a user may identify as activation events. In such instances, processing system <b>32</b> may populate activation map <b>1100</b> with a symbol indicating an absence of an activation time for that electrode. In the example of <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, processing system displays a â?â symbol, as in space <b>1104</b>. The â?â may indicate an unknown data point. In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> is unable to determine an activation time for each electrogram in the first group. In such examples, even spaces in activation map <b>1100</b> which reference electrodes/electrograms in the first group may include the â?â symbol (or other symbol indicating an unknown data point).</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">In some examples, processing system <b>32</b> may modify activation map <b>1100</b> in a number of different ways for display on display device <b>40</b>. For example, processing system <b>32</b> may assign a unique, differentiating color to each space in table <b>1100</b>. In some examples, the specific color is assigned based on the value of the activation time in the space. The color map may help a clinician identify the propagation direction of cellular firing. Activation map <b>1100</b> may display an activation time or color for known signals and not display an activation time or color for unknown and/or missing activation time data. The use of color to differentiate activation times is just an example. It is contemplated that other means may be used to differentiate activation times. For example, texture, symbols, numbers, or the like may be used as differentiating characteristics.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">In order to maximize the utility of activation map <b>1100</b>, it may be desirable to populate unknown activation times. Therefore, in some embodiments it may be desirable to interpolate activation times for missing signal data and populate and/or fill in the activation time map <b>1100</b> accordingly. Processing system <b>32</b> may perform any of the techniques disclosed in âMEDICAL DEVICES FOR MAPPING CARDIAC TISSUE,â a provisional patent application filed on Jan. 13, 2014, No. 61/926,737, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, for assigning values to the missing data.</p>
