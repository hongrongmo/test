      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">This invention relates generally to a crop spraying vehicle having outwardly extending booms.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Description of the Related. Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">There are many different types of agricultural vehicles used to spray a field of crops. The spray generally includes a chemical which protects the crops from pests, fungi and/or weeds. Some of these agricultural vehicles, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,821 to Nejsum and U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,407 to Knight, include a boom extending outwardly from both of its sides. The boom is used to carry nozzles connected to a tank of chemicals through piping. The chemicals are applied to the crops by flowing them from the lank, through the piping and spraying them out the nozzles over a spray area.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Examples of other crop spraying vehicles include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,738,226 to Bals, U.S. Pat. No. 3,371,879 to Dijkhof, U.S. Pat. No. 4,200,255 to Schmidt, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,353 to Kuhn, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,591 to Ballu, U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,117 to Dudley, U.S. Pat. No. 4,834,249 to Dahl, 4,880,160 to Patterson, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,385 to Trusty, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,821 to Nejsum and U.S. Pat. No. 6,234,407 to Knight, et al., U.S. Design Pat. No. D344,737 appears to show a prime mover capable of carrying a crop spraying apparatus. Another example of a crop spraying vehicle is the SPRACOUPE, which is manufactured by AGCO Corporation.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The spray area can be increased by increasing the length of the booms and by increasing the number of nozzles spaced along their length. It is desirable to increase the spray area so that the field can be sprayed more efficiently. The field is sprayed more efficiently as the spray area is increased because the vehicle requires a fewer number of passes to cover it with chemicals.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The present invention employs a crop spraying vehicle which includes a mast arm having a mast arm sleeve slidingly engaged with it. The engagement between the mast arm and mast arm sleeve restricts and allows the transverse and longitudinal rotation, respectively, of a crop spraying apparatus coupled to the mast arm. In some embodiments, the crop spraying apparatus includes outwardly extending booms which carry trim weight containers. The weight carried by the trim weight containers is adjustable to adjust the longitudinal rotation of the crop spraying apparatus so the booms are balanced. The trim weight containers can also be used to tilt bias the booms, which is useful when spraying on a tilted surface, such as a hill side, while maintaining a self-leveling capability of the crop spraying apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings and description.</p>

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a rear view of a crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b>. In this embodiment, the vehicle <b>100</b> includes a chassis <b>101</b> carried by rear wheels <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b, </i>and a crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> coupled to the chassis <b>101</b> with a pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. It should be noted that the crop spraying apparatus disclosed herein are sometimes referred to as crop sprayers. It should also be noted that the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>, as well as the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>, can include many different materials, such as metal, composites, plastic and/or wood. The chassis <b>101</b> is generally that of an agricultural tractor, which are made by many different manufactures, such as John Deere. These agricultural tractors can be of many different types, such as utility, row-crop, and four wheel drive tractors, among others. It should be noted, however, that the chassis <b>101</b> can be a structural element that allows attachment and detachment of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> to the carrying vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In this embodiment, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> includes a center support section <b>104</b> coupled with the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. The booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are attached to the center support section <b>104</b> and extend outwardly therefrom and away from the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. The booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are repeatably moveable between deployed and stowed positions, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. It should be noted that the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are shown in the deployed position in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>carry fluid lines <b>156</b><i>a </i>and <b>156</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) connected between the spray nozzles <b>130</b> and a chemical container <b>155</b> for holding chemicals. In operation, the chemicals flow from the tank and through the fluid lines <b>156</b><i>a </i>and <b>156</b><i>b, </i>and are sprayed out the spray nozzles <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The spray nozzles <b>130</b> are carried by and distributed along the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>and spray the chemicals downwardly and away from the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. It is desirable to have the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>extend further away from the chassis <b>101</b> so that more the spray nozzles <b>130</b> can be carried by the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>and the sprayers can be distributed over a larger distance away from the center support section <b>104</b>. In this way, the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b> has a larger spray area so that a field can be sprayed more efficiently.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In this embodiment, the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b> is coupled to center support section <b>104</b> with a mast arm and mast arm sleeve. The mast arm sleeve is engaged with the mast arm so that the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is allowed to roll. In this way, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is self-leveling and the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>remain balanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a partial side view of the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b> and <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. In this embodiment, the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b> includes the chemical container <b>155</b>, which is carried by the chassis <b>101</b>, wherein the chemical container is in fluid communication with the nozzles <b>130</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>) through fluid lines <b>155</b><i>a </i>and <b>155</b><i>b. </i>In this embodiment, the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b> includes a mast <b>106</b> attached to and extending upwardly from the chassis <b>101</b>. If should be noted that the mast <b>106</b> can be attached to the chassis <b>101</b> in many different ways, such as with bolts and/or welding. Here, the mast <b>106</b> extends upwardly from an upwardly facing surface of the chassis <b>101</b>, although it can be attached to other surfaces in other examples. For example, a side surface or a slanted surface of the chassis <b>101</b> can be used. While the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b> includes a single mast, if can include more than one mast in other embodiments, a few of which will be discussed below with <figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>a, </i><b>7</b><i>b </i>and <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In this embodiment, a mast arm <b>108</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>106</b>, and a mast arm <b>108</b> is connected, to the mast sleeve <b>107</b> so it extends outwardly therefrom and away from the chassis <b>101</b>. In this embodiment, a mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast arm <b>108</b>. Further, a pendulum arm <b>110</b> is connected to the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> so it extends downwardly therefrom where it is connected to the center support section <b>104</b>. In this way, the center support section <b>104</b> is coupled to the mast arm <b>108</b> through the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and center support section <b>104</b> is coupled to the chassis <b>101</b> with the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">As mentioned above, the mast sleeve <b>107</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>106</b> so it is moveable in a direction <b>129</b>. When the mast sleeve <b>107</b> moves upwardly along the mast <b>106</b> away from the chassis <b>101</b>, the mast arm <b>108</b> also moves upwardly. Further, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is moved upwardly away from the ground (not shown) in response to the upward movement of the mast arm <b>108</b>. When the mast sleeve <b>107</b> moves downwardly along the mast <b>106</b> towards the chassis <b>101</b>, the mast arm <b>108</b> also moves downwardly. Further, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is moved downwardly towards the ground (not shown) in response to the downward movement of the mast arm <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">It should be noted that the components included in the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b> can have many different shapes. In this embodiment the mast arm <b>108</b> and mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> are cylindrical in shape, and the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> includes a central opening shaped and dimensioned for slidingly engaging the mast arm <b>108</b>. Further, the mast <b>106</b> is rectangular in shape and the mast sleeve <b>107</b> is square in shape with a central opening shaped and dimensioned for slidingly engaging the mast <b>106</b>. The shape of the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> will be discussed in more detail presently.</p>

        <i>a </i>is a perspective view of the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b>. In this embodiment, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> includes a sleeve body <b>120</b> having a channel <b>121</b> extending therethrough between opposed openings <b>122</b> and <b>123</b>. The channel <b>121</b> and openings <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> are shaped and dimensioned so that the mast arm <b>108</b> can extend through them and the sleeve body <b>120</b>. In this way, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> slidingly engages the mast arm <b>108</b>. It should be noted that the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> can have many other configurations, one of which will be discussed presently.</p>

        <i>b </i>shows another embodiment of a mast arm sleeve, denoted as mast arm sleeve <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, the mast arm sleeve <b>112</b> includes the sleeve body <b>120</b> with the channel <b>121</b> extending between the opening <b>123</b> and a sidewall <b>124</b>. Here, the channel <b>121</b> and opening <b>123</b> are shaped and dimensioned so that the mast arm <b>108</b> can extend through them and the sleeve body <b>120</b> so it engages the sidewall <b>124</b>. In this way, the mast arm sleeve <b>112</b> slidingly engages the mast arm <b>108</b>. It should be noted that, in these embodiments, the mast arm sleeves <b>109</b> and <b>112</b> are cylindrical in shape, but they can have other shapes in other examples, as mentioned above. However, their shape is generally chosen to match the shape of the mast arm <b>108</b> to facilitate them being slidingly engaged together. It should also be noted that the mast arm sleeves <b>109</b> and <b>112</b> can include many different materials, but they generally include metal, such as steel.</p>

        <b>5</b>
        <i>b </i>and <b>5</b><i>c </i>are top, front and side views, respectively, looking in directions <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> and <b>116</b>, respectively, of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, showing the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> slidingly engaged with the mast arm <b>108</b>. As will be discussed in more detail presently, the engagement between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and mast arm <b>108</b> restricts and allows the transverse and longitudinal rotation, respectively, of the center support section <b>104</b>. In this way, the transverse and longitudinal rotation of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is also restricted and allowed, respectively, by the engagement between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and mast arm <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">It should be noted that the longitudinal rotation, of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> corresponds to its roll and the transverse rotation of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> corresponds to its pitch and yaw. Hence, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is coupled with the mast arm <b>108</b> through the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> so its roll movement is allowed, but its pitch and yaw movement is restricted. The roll is the rotation about an axis <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the mast arm <b>108</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) and is indicated by rotation arrows <b>118</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>). The yaw is the rotation about an axis <b>113</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) of the mast <b>106</b> and is indicated by rotation arrows <b>117</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>). The pitch is the rotation about an axis <b>113</b><i>c </i>(<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) and is indicated by rotation arrows <b>119</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">In this embodiment, when the center support section <b>104</b> rotates in the direction of the rotation arrows <b>117</b> and/or <b>119</b> (<figref>FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>c</i>), the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> engages the mast arm <b>108</b> so this rotational movement is restricted. Hence, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> engages the mast arm <b>108</b> in response to being transversely rotated and this restricts the transverse rotation of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. In this way, the yaw and pitch of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is restricted by the engagement between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and mast arm <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Further, in this embodiment, when the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> rotates in the direction of the rotation arrows <b>118</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>), the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> rotates about the mast arm <b>108</b>. Hence, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> is allowed to rotate relative to the mast arm <b>108</b> in response to being longitudinally rotated and this allows the longitudinal rotation of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. In this way, the roll of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is allowed by the engagement between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and mast arm <b>108</b> and the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> can self-level.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a rear view of another embodiment of a crop spraying vehicle, which is denoted as a crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b><i>a. </i>In this embodiment, the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a </i>coupled with the chassis <b>101</b> with a pendulum apparatus <b>131</b>. The crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a </i>includes the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> with the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>connected to the center support section <b>104</b>, as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In this embodiment, the pendulum apparatus <b>131</b> includes the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b> and, in this embodiment, it further includes hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>connected between the mast sleeve <b>107</b> and center support section <b>104</b>. The hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>are in fluid communication with a source of hydraulic fluid (not shown). It should be noted that the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>can be positioned at many different locations, but they are generally connected to the center support section <b>104</b> and the mast sleeve <b>107</b>. In this way, the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>operate as locking mechanisms to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> relative to the mast sleeve <b>107</b>. In this embodiment, the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>are connected between the beams <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b, </i>respectively, of the center support section <b>104</b> and opposed sides of the mast sleeve <b>107</b>. It should be noted that the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>allow the operator to tilt the center support section <b>104</b> manually. Further, the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>allow the operator to lilt and lock the center support section <b>104</b> in a desired position. The center support section <b>104</b> is shown tilted in <figref>FIGS. 11</figref><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>14</b><i>a, </i><b>15</b><i>a, </i><b>17</b><i>a, </i>and <b>18</b><i>a</i>. the center support section <b>104</b> is shown untilted in <figref>FIGS. 10</figref><i>a, </i><b>13</b><i>a, </i>and <b>16</b><i>a. </i>The hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>allow- the center support section <b>104</b> to be locked when the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are in the stowed position, further, the hydraulic cylinders <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>allow the center support section <b>104</b> to be locked when the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>are in the deployed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">It is useful to be able to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> in several different situations. For example, it is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when the operator is spraying and does not want self-leveling. It is also useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when moving booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>between the deployed and stowed positions. It is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when it is desirable to spray with one boom in the deployed position and the other boom in the stowed position, it is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when turning the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b><i>a, </i>such as at the end of the field or during other maneuvers. It is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when it is desirable to tilt the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>to clear an obstacle. It is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> when driving over furrows. It is useful to restrict the movement of the center support section <b>104</b> during transport, such as when driving on a road or hauling the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b> with a tractor.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">As mentioned above, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a </i>includes the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. In this embodiment, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a </i>also includes the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>carried by the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b, </i>respectively. In this embodiment, the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>are positioned at or near the distal ends <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b </i>of the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b, </i>respectively. In this embodiment, the weights of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>are adjustable to adjust the roll of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. This is useful to provide the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>with a desired tilt bias, while maintaining self-leveling, such as when using the vehicle <b>100</b> to spray on a tilted surface like a hillside.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">It should be noted that the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>include containers for containing a trim weight material, such as rocks and/or metal. The rocks and metal can be manually positioned within and removed from, the trim weight containers to provide the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>with a desired amount of weight. However, in this particular embodiment, the trim weight material includes a liquid, which can be of many different types, such as water. Hence, the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>can be provided with a desired amount of weight by having them include a desired amount of trim weight material. Further, the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>can be provided with a desired amount of weight by having them contain a desired amount of trim weight material. The weight of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>increases as the amount of trim weight material included therein increases. Further, the weight of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>decreases as the amount of trim weight material included therein decreases. It should also be noted that the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>can have the same empty weight, which is the corresponding weight with no trim weight material included therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The weights of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>are adjustable by flowing a fluid into and out of the corresponding containers. Further, the weights contained by the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>are adjustable by flowing the fluid into and out of the corresponding containers. The fluid can be flowed into and out of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>in many different ways, such as by manually placing the fluid therein. In this particular embodiment, however, a pump <b>136</b> is used to flow the fluid into and out of the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b. </i>The pump <b>136</b> is in fluid communication with the trim weight containers <b>133</b><i>a </i>and <b>133</b><i>b </i>through the fluid conduits <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b, </i>respectively. The fluid conduits <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b </i>extend from the pump <b>136</b> and along the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b, </i>respectively. The pump <b>136</b> can be of many different types, such as a water pump. Further, the fluid conduits <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b </i>can be of many different types, such as rubber and/or plastic tubing.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In this embodiment, the pump <b>136</b> is carried by the chassis <b>101</b>. However, in some embodiments, the pump <b>136</b> is carried by the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a, </i>it is useful to have the pump <b>136</b> be carried by the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b><i>a </i>so that the fluid conduits <b>135</b><i>a </i>and <b>135</b><i>b </i>can be shorter in length. As will be discussed in more detail below, the pump <b>136</b> includes a controller for controlling its operation. The controller is typically positioned so that it can be operated by the operator while driving the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The pumps disclosed herein can be of many different types, such as a gear pump, a diaphragm pump, and a roller pump, among others. Some of these pumps, such as the gear pump, are bidirectional pumps. The bidirectional pump allows the flow of fluid in a first direction, in a first mode of operation, and a second direction, in a second mode of operation. The first and second directions are opposed directions. Others of these pumps are unidirectional pumps, which have one mode of operation that allows the flow of the fluid in the first direction and not the second direction. The bidirectional and unidirectional operation of the pumps disclosed herein will be discussed in more detail below. It is desirable to have a small pump so that the fluid lines are smaller, and the fluid will flow in response to a lower pressure.

In this embodiment, the dual mast pendulum apparatus <b>151</b> is carried by the chassis <b>101</b> and includes a cross-beam <b>152</b> which couples the mast <b>106</b> to a mast <b>153</b>. The cross-beam <b>152</b> is attached between the lower portions of the masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>, although the cross-beam <b>152</b> can also be attached to the chassis <b>101</b> if desired, as in <figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>b. </i>It should be noted that, in some embodiments, a cross-beam can be positioned so it extends between the upper ends of the masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In this embodiment, the mast <b>106</b> is attached to and extends upwardly from a side surface of the chassis <b>101</b>. It should be noted, however, that the mast <b>106</b> can be attached to an upwardly facing surface of the chassis <b>101</b> in other embodiments, with one being shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, Further, in other embodiments, the mast <b>106</b> can be attached to the cross-beam <b>152</b> instead of the chassis <b>101</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the cross-beam <b>152</b> is attached to the chassis <b>101</b> and carries the mast <b>106</b> so that the mast <b>106</b> is not directly attached to the chassis <b>101</b>. An embodiment wherein the mast <b>106</b> and cross-beam <b>152</b> are not directly attached to the chassis <b>101</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In this embodiment, the mast sleeve <b>107</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>106</b> and a mast sleeve <b>154</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>153</b>. Here, the mast sleeve <b>154</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>153</b> in the same manner that the mast sleeve <b>107</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast <b>106</b>. In this way, the mast sleeves <b>107</b> and <b>154</b> are moveable relative to the masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>, respectively, in the direction <b>129</b>. The mast arm <b>108</b> has opposed ends connected to the mast sleeves <b>107</b> and <b>154</b> so it extends between the masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>. In this embodiment, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> is slidingly engaged with the mast arm <b>108</b> so it is moveable between the mast sleeves <b>107</b> and <b>154</b>, as well as the masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>. In other embodiments, such as that discussed with <figref>FIG. 8</figref> below, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> is fixedly attached to the mast arm <b>108</b>. The pendulum arm <b>110</b> is coupled with the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and extends downwardly therefrom, where it is connected to the center support section <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">As described in more detail above, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> is engaged with the mast arm <b>108</b> so that its roll movement is allowed, but its pitch and yaw movement is restricted. Hence, the engagement between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and mast arm <b>108</b> restricts and allows the transverse and longitudinal rotation, respectively, of the center support section <b>104</b>. In this way, the dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>151</b> restricts and allows the transverse and longitudinal rotation, respectively, of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>151</b> is sturdy because it includes the masts (i.e. masts <b>106</b> and <b>153</b>) connected to opposed end of the mast arm <b>108</b> instead of one mast connected to an end of the arm <b>108</b>, as in the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. Hence, the mast arm <b>108</b> is able to counteract a larger torque applied to it by its engagement with the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> in response to the transverse rotation of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. By being able to counteract a larger torque, the pendulum apparatus <b>151</b> allows the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>to extend further away from the chassis <b>101</b>, which provides a larger spray area as discussed in more detail above. In this way, the chassis <b>101</b> can carry a larger boom.</p>

        <i>b </i>is a partial side view of a crop spraying vehicle <b>160</b> which includes a dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>161</b>. The dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> is carried by chassis <b>101</b> and includes the dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>151</b> as described with <figref>FIG. 7</figref><i>a. </i>In this embodiment, the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> further includes a pendulum arm <b>162</b> connected between the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> and center support section <b>104</b>. Hence, the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> includes dual pendulum arms defined by the pendulum arms <b>110</b> and <b>162</b>. Dual pendulum arms are useful because it allows the dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> to carry a heavier crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b>. For example, the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> can extend outwardly by a further distance since. This is useful because it provides the crop spraying vehicle <b>100</b> with a larger spray area.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In this embodiment, the pendulum arms <b>110</b> and <b>162</b> are parallel, but they can be at a non-zero angle relative to each other in other embodiments so they are not parallel. Further, the pendulum arms <b>110</b> and <b>162</b> are spaced apart from each other so that the torque applied to the mast arm <b>108</b> is distributed over a larger area of the mast arm <b>108</b>. In this way, the dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can counteract a larger torque. Further, the weight of the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is distributed over a larger area of the mast arm <b>108</b>. In this way, the dual-mast pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can support more weight. The torque is provided in many different ways, such as in response to the transverse rotation of the center support section <b>104</b> providing torque to the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b>. The torque can also be provided in response to having the booms <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>in the stowed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">It should be noted that in some embodiments, the dual pendulum arms of the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can be used with a pendulum apparatus having a single mast, such as the pendulum apparatus <b>111</b>. A single mast pendulum apparatus with dual pendulum arms is generally sturdier than a pendulum apparatus with a single pendulum arm, and can counteract a larger torque and support a larger weight. It should also be noted that the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can be a part of the center support structure <b>104</b> and it can be separate from it.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In some embodiments, the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> can extend all the way between the mast sleeves <b>107</b> and <b>154</b> instead of partially between them as shown in <figref>FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b. </i>As the length of the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> increases, the torque and weight applied to the mast arm <b>108</b> by the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is distributed over a larger area of the mast arm <b>108</b>. In this way, the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can counteract a larger maximum torque and support a larger maximum weight. As the length of the mast arm sleeve <b>109</b> decreases, the torque and weight applied to the mast arm <b>108</b> by the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is distributed over a smaller area of the mast arm <b>108</b>. The maximum amount of torque and weight that the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can counteract is smaller if the torque and weight applied to the mast arm <b>108</b> by the crop spraying apparatus <b>103</b> is distributed over a smaller area of the mast arm <b>108</b>. It is generally desirable to increase the maximum torque and weight that the pendulum apparatus <b>161</b> can support so that it is less likely to break.</p>
