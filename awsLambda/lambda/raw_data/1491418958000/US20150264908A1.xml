    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Fishing is an outdoor activity enjoyed by many throughout the United States. Successful fishing requires the fisherman to be able to successfully tie knots in fishing line. Fly-fishing, in particular, requires the fisherman to be skilled in knot-tying.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In fly-fishing, the bait is a lightweight fly or lure. Often the fly or lure is artificial. In general, artificial flies are imitations of natural food sources which fly fishers present to their target species of fish while fly-fishing. Artificial flies are constructed by fly tying, in which furs, feathers, thread or any of very many other materials are tied onto a fish hook. The fly is designed to look like an insect that is indigenous to the location of the fish. The hook is tied to the end of a thin, lightweight length of fishing line referred to as a leader.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">When fly-fishing, the fisherman generally stands in a stream or other body of water and presents the fly to the fish by casting the fly on or just above the surface of the water in which the fish is swimming. Because it is generally undesirable for the fly to sink beneath the surface of the water, the fly and leader line should be lightweight so that the fisherman's casting motion is sufficient to keep the fly at or above the surface of the water.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The leader line is attached to the main fishing line of the fisherman's fishing rod by means of a knot. When fly-fishing, the fisherman often must tie a new fly/leader onto the fishing line. For example, the fisherman may wish to try a new fly if the current fly does not appear to be attractive to the fish, or if the fisherman loses the fly by snagging the line in brush or for some other reason.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Rather than leaving the water to tie a new knot, it is preferable to tie the new knot while maintaining one's position in the water. Accordingly, the fisherman must be able to tie knots while standing in water. This aspect of fly-fishing is particularly challenging for fishermen who lack fine motor skills, hand-to-eye coordination, and/or have poor eye-sight, such as children, the elderly, and the disabled. A need exists, therefore, for a tool to help such fishermen successfully tie knots while in the water, or when out of the water.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention fills the need for a tool to help fishermen who lack fine motor skills, hand-to-eye coordination, and/or have poor eye-sight, to tie knots by providing a device for holding, entwining and pulling nylon lines and cords or others materials of varying thickness (hereinafter âlinesâ) to create or recreate knots. More specifically, the present invention provides a knot tying device comprising a body, wherein the body comprises a right side, a left side, and a center; a controller, wherein the controller is attached to the body, and is capable of being manually rotated by a user of the device; a right terminal wheel, wherein the right terminal wheel is attached to the right side of the body and is capable of securely holding a line to be knotted; a left terminal wheel, wherein the left terminal wheel is attached to the left side of the body and is capable of securely holding a line to be knotted; a means for transferring rotational energy imparted to the controller to the right terminal wheel and the left terminal wheel, such that rotation of the controller results in rotation of the left terminal wheel and rotation of the right terminal wheel, wherein the left terminal wheel and the right terminal wheel rotate simultaneously, at the same speed, and in opposite directions; one or more clips, wherein the one or more clips are attached to the center of the body and positioned between the left terminal wheel and the right terminal wheel; a right side aperture, wherein the right side aperture extends from outside the body through the center of the right terminal wheel; and a left side aperture, wherein the left side aperture extends from outside the body through the center of the left terminal wheel.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings.</p>

In another embodiment, the means for transferring rotational energy from the controller to the terminal wheels is an arrangement of gears and axles.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The knot-tying device of the present invention is operated when the user manually rotates a controller. The rotational energy imparted to the controller is transferred through any combination of gears, chains, straps, or axles, to terminal wheels, causing the terminal wheels to rotate. The rotation of the terminal wheels is used to entwine one or more lines to be tied. One or more clips are positioned between the terminal wheels and hold or position the one or more lines and aid the user in producing the desired knot.</p>

The left and right side lateral elevations are attached to the left and right sides of the base, respectively. The left and right side lateral elevations together with the base form the body of the device. The left side of the body comprises the left-side lateral elevation; the right side of the body comprises the right-side lateral elevation. The center of the body comprises the base. Each of the left and right terminal wheels is attached to the corresponding lateral elevation by a hollow upper sprocket. The terminal wheels, which are parallel and opposite to each other, are capable of securely holding the line or lines to be entwined and knotted. The clip, which is attached to the base, is positioned between the two terminal wheels. The user rotates the controller horizontally which results in vertical rotation of the terminal wheels. The hollow upper sprockets transfer rotational energy from the controller to the terminal wheels through a series of gears and chains.</p>

      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The internal components of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>) include controller <b>4</b>, left horizontal miter gear <b>17</b>, right horizontal miter gear <b>18</b>, left vertical miter gear <b>19</b>, right vertical miter gear <b>20</b>, base roller chain <b>14</b>, left lateral elevation roller chain <b>15</b>, and right lateral elevation roller chain <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Controller <b>4</b> is attached to sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>(<figref>FIG. 4A</figref>). Both controller <b>4</b> and sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>rotate about screw <b>13</b>. As controller <b>4</b> is rotated by the user, sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>rotates about screw <b>13</b> in the same direction and in proportion to the rotation of controller <b>4</b>. Left horizontal miter gear <b>17</b> is attached to the left side of base <b>1</b> and is mounted on sprocket <b>17</b><i>a </i>such that left horizontal miter gear <b>17</b> and sprocket <b>17</b><i>a </i>rotate at the same rate and in the same direction around axle <b>17</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIGS. 4A and 4D</figref>).

Rotation of controller <b>4</b> causes rotation of sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>which advances base roller chain <b>14</b>, thereby causing rotation of sprockets <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>a </i>and corresponding rotation of miter gears <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>E). It should be noted that screw <b>13</b> and axles <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>are all vertical axles which in addition to providing an axis about which rotation of a sprocket can occur, also structurally stabilize base <b>1</b>.</p>

Left vertical miter gear <b>19</b> is attached to the lower portion of left lateral elevation <b>2</b> and is mounted on sprocket <b>19</b><i>a </i>such that left vertical miter gear <b>19</b> and sprocket <b>19</b><i>a </i>rotate at the same rate and in the same direction around axle <b>19</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). Similarly, right vertical miter gear <b>20</b> is attached to the lower portion of right lateral elevation <b>3</b> and is mounted on sprocket <b>20</b><i>a </i>such that right vertical miter gear <b>20</b> and sprocket <b>20</b><i>a </i>rotate at the same rate and in the same direction around axle <b>20</b><i>b </i>(<figref>FIGS. 3A and 5D</figref>).</p>

This arrangement of horizontal and vertical miter gears allows the rotational energy imparted to controller <b>4</b> to be transferred to the vertical miter gears, and ultimately to the terminal wheels.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The rotational energy transferred from controller <b>4</b> to vertical miter gears <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> is further transferred to terminal wheels <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> through left and right lateral elevation roller chains <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). Left lateral elevation roller chain <b>15</b> engages sprocket <b>19</b><i>a </i>and left hollow upper sprocket <b>8</b>. Right lateral elevation roller chain <b>16</b> engages sprocket <b>20</b><i>a </i>and right hollow upper sprocket <b>9</b> (<figref>FIG. 3A</figref>). Rotation of controller <b>4</b> by the user transfers rotational energy through sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>to center roller chain <b>14</b> which rotates left horizontal miter gear <b>17</b> causing rotation of left vertical miter gear <b>19</b>, which in turn causes corresponding rotation of sprocket <b>19</b><i>a</i>. The rotation of sprocket <b>19</b><i>a </i>drives left lateral elevation roller chain <b>15</b> which causes rotation of left hollow upper sprocket <b>8</b>. Left terminal wheel <b>5</b>, being attached to left hollow upper sprocket <b>8</b>, rotates as left hollow upper sprocket <b>8</b> rotates. Rotation of controller <b>4</b> by the user also transfers rotational energy through sprocket <b>4</b><i>a </i>to center roller chain <b>14</b> which rotates right horizontal miter gear <b>18</b> causing rotation of right vertical miter gear <b>20</b>, which in turn causes corresponding rotation of sprocket <b>20</b><i>a</i>. The rotation of sprocket <b>20</b><i>a </i>drives right lateral elevation roller chain <b>16</b> which causes rotation of right hollow upper sprocket <b>9</b>. Right terminal wheel <b>6</b>, being attached to right upper sprocket <b>9</b>, rotates as right hollow upper sprocket <b>9</b> rotates.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Terminal wheels <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are attached to left and right hollow upper sprockets <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, respectively, by means of internal and external lockets. Terminal wheel <b>6</b>, for example, is attached to right hollow upper sprocket <b>9</b> by internal locket <b>21</b> and external locket <b>22</b>. (<figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>). It will be appreciated that the terminal wheels, hollow upper sprockets, and internal and external lockets have hollow cores. The terminal wheel and sprocket assemblies (see, e.g., <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>) therefore also have a hollow core. In the assembled knot-tying device, these hollow cores create a right side aperture, <b>9</b><i>a</i>, extending from the outside of the right lateral elevation through the inside of the lateral elevation and through the right terminal wheel, through which the line or lines to be knotted may be passed (<figref>FIG. 5C</figref>). It will be appreciated that a left side aperture, analogous to the right side aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref>FIG. 5C</figref> with respect to the right lateral elevation, is present in the terminal wheel/hollow upper sprocket assembly on the left lateral elevation (see left side aperture <b>8</b><i>a </i>in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The presence of right side and left side apertures passing from the outside of the device through the terminal wheels is a feature of all embodiments of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">It should be noted that a feature of the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> of the present invention is that terminal wheels <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> rotate at equal speeds, but in opposite direction (when viewed from the same side of the device).</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Clip <b>7</b> in the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a simple alligator clip. In other embodiments of the present invention, the clip may take other forms or may comprise two or more separate clips. The essential aspects of the clip are that it is:</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0000">(1) capable of securely holding the one or more lines to be joined by a knot; and (2) positioned on the device between the two terminal wheels.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">A second embodiment of the present invention is described in reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, this embodiment of the present invention comprises body <b>23</b>, left controller <b>24</b>, right controller <b>25</b>, left pinion gear <b>26</b>, right pinion gear <b>27</b>, and axle <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, body <b>23</b> is contoured such that it comprises a substantially flat, horizontal center portion (<b>23</b><i>a</i>) with left (<b>23</b><i>b</i>) and right (<b>23</b><i>c</i>) sides that elevate in a direction perpendicular to the flat horizontal center portion. Thus, body <b>23</b> is generally shaped like a cylinder from which a scoop has been removed.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">Axle <b>28</b> extends through the interior of body <b>23</b> such that the left and right ends of axle <b>28</b> protrude from the left and right sides, respectively, of body <b>23</b>. The left end of axle <b>28</b>, which protrudes from the left side of body <b>23</b>, extends through the center of left pinion gear <b>26</b> and then attaches to left controller <b>24</b>. The right end of axle <b>28</b>, which protrudes from the right side of body <b>23</b>, extends through the center of right pinion gear <b>27</b> and then attaches to right controller <b>25</b>. Controllers <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, and pinion gears <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are fixed to axle <b>28</b> with pins <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>27</b><i>a</i>, respectively, such that rotation of axle <b>28</b> about its longitudinal axis results in rotation of the controllers (<b>24</b> and <b>25</b>) and the pinion gears (<b>26</b> and <b>27</b>). In this embodiment, the user imparts rotational energy to axle <b>28</b> by rotating left controller <b>24</b>, right controller <b>25</b>, or both controllers (<b>24</b> and <b>25</b>). Rotation of axle <b>28</b> causes corresponding rotation of left and right pinion gears <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0064">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, left pinion gear <b>26</b> engages left inner spur gear <b>29</b>. Left inner spur gear <b>29</b> engages left inner spur gear <b>30</b>. Left inner spur gear <b>30</b> engages left upper spur gear <b>31</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Left upper spur gear <b>31</b> is attached to left terminal wheel <b>32</b>. Rotation of left pinion gear <b>26</b> (as caused by rotation of axle <b>28</b>) causes rotation of left inner spur gear <b>29</b>, which causes rotation of left inner spur gear <b>30</b>, which causes rotation of left upper spur gear <b>31</b>, which causes rotation of left terminal wheel <b>32</b>. Thus, the rotational energy of axle <b>28</b> is transferred through the series of spur gears <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> to cause rotation of terminal wheel <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, right pinion gear <b>27</b> engages right inner spur gear <b>33</b>. Right inner spur gear <b>33</b> engages right upper spur gear <b>34</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Right upper spur gear <b>34</b> is attached to right terminal wheel <b>35</b>. Rotation of right pinion gear <b>27</b> (as caused by rotation of axle <b>28</b>) causes rotation of right inner spur gear <b>33</b>, which causes rotation of right upper spur gear <b>34</b>, which causes rotation of right terminal wheel <b>35</b>. Thus, the rotational energy of axle <b>28</b> is transferred through the series of spur gears <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> to cause rotation of terminal wheel <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">In this embodiment of the present invention, left upper spur gear <b>31</b> is attached to left terminal wheel <b>32</b>, and right upper spur gear <b>34</b> is attached to right terminal wheel <b>35</b>. Each of parts <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>35</b> has a hollow core, such that the mounting of left terminal wheel <b>32</b> onto left upper spur gear <b>31</b> creates a left side aperture (<b>31</b><i>a</i>) that extends from outside the left side of the body through the left terminal wheel <b>32</b> and the mounting of right terminal wheel <b>35</b> onto right upper spur gear <b>34</b> creates a right side aperture (<b>34</b><i>a</i>) that extends from outside the right side of the body through the right terminal wheel <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">It will be appreciated that the configuration of spur gears on the left side of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> differs from the configuration of spur gears on the right side of the embodiment in that the configuration on the left side includes three spur gears (<b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b>) while the configuration on the right side includes only two spur gears (<b>33</b> and <b>34</b>) (See <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). This difference makes the rotation of the terminal wheels proceed in opposite directions (as viewed from the same side of the device). It will be appreciated further that the choice of which side of the device (i.e., left or right) is to have three spur gears and which is to have two spur gears is arbitrary. Moreover, it will be appreciated more generally that different embodiments of the device of the present invention may have a different numbers of spur gears, provided that one side has an even number of spur gears, and the other side has an odd number of spur gears.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0068">The left-side and right-side gear configurations of the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> have gear ratios such that the rotational speed of the left terminal wheel <b>32</b> is the same as that of right terminal wheel <b>35</b> (although, as discussed previously, rotation is in opposite directions).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0069">The gear arrangement of the present invention is designed to produce synchronized rotational motion of the terminal wheels in opposite directions. This gear arrangement is shown more generally in <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. Axle <b>45</b> has pinion gears <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> attached at either end. Pinion gear <b>46</b> engages spur gear <b>48</b>. Spur gear <b>48</b> engages upper spur gear <b>49</b>. On the other end of axle <b>45</b>, pinion gear <b>47</b> engages spur gear <b>50</b>. Spur gear <b>50</b> engages spur gear <b>51</b>. Spur gear <b>51</b> engages upper spur gear <b>52</b>. When viewed from the same side of the device, clockwise rotation of axle <b>45</b> causes clockwise rotation of pinion gear <b>46</b>. Clockwise rotation of pinion gear <b>46</b> causes counter-clockwise rotation of spur gear <b>48</b>. Counterclockwise rotation of spur gear <b>48</b> causes clockwise rotation of upper spur gear <b>49</b>. Because upper spur gear <b>49</b> is attached to terminal wheel <b>53</b>, terminal wheel <b>53</b> undergoes clockwise rotation. Clockwise rotation of pinion gear <b>47</b> causes counter-clockwise rotation of spur gear <b>50</b>. Counter-clockwise rotation of spur gear <b>50</b> causes clockwise rotation of spur gear <b>51</b>. Clockwise rotation of spur gear <b>51</b> causes counter-clockwise rotation of upper spur gear <b>52</b>. Because upper spur gear <b>52</b> is attached to terminal wheel <b>54</b>, terminal wheel <b>54</b> undergoes counter-clockwise rotation. As viewed from the same perspective therefore, terminal wheels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> rotate in opposite directions. Moreover, in the present invention the gear ratios are arranged so that the rotational speeds of terminal wheels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> are equal.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">As is evident from <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, one uses the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> by imparting rotational energy to either or both of left and right controllers <b>24</b> and <b>25</b>, thereby causing rotation of axle <b>28</b>, and thereby rotation of left and right pinion gears <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>. The rotational energy of left pinion gear <b>26</b> is transferred through left spur gears <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>31</b> to result in rotation of left terminal wheel <b>32</b>. The rotational energy of right pinion gear <b>27</b> is transferred through right spur gears <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> to result in rotation of right terminal wheel <b>35</b>. Thus, left and right terminal wheels <b>32</b> and <b>35</b> rotate at the same speed in opposite directions (as viewed from the same side of the device), wherein the rotational speed is proportional to the rotational energy imparted to the controller(s) by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0071">The embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> also includes a clip <b>36</b> attached to body <b>23</b> at a position centered between left and right terminal wheels <b>32</b> and <b>35</b>.

As is evident from <figref>FIGS. 10A and 10C</figref>, axle <b>63</b> and gears <b>61</b>, <b>67</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>65</b>, in this embodiment of the invention are attached to body <b>55</b> in a manner that supports the axles and gears and permits their rotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0076">The left-side and right-side gear configurations of the embodiment referred to in <figref>FIGS. 9-14C</figref> have gear ratios such that the rotational speed of left upper spur gear <b>66</b> (and hence left terminal wheel <b>58</b>) is the same as that of right upper spur gear <b>65</b> (and hence right terminal wheel <b>57</b>), although, as discussed previously, rotation is in opposite directions when viewed from the same face of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0077">The embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 9-14C</figref>, like all embodiments of the present invention, includes, on either side of the device, an aperture extending from the outside of the device, through the upper spur gear, and through the center of the terminal wheel (see left side aperture <b>68</b> and right side aperture <b>69</b>, <figref>FIGS. 9-14C</figref>). The one or more lines to be entwined are fed through these apertures from the outside of the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0078">The embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> has two clips, which happen to be alligator clips. When two lines are to be knotted, the presence of two clips allows each of the two lines to be knotted to be individually clipped, thereby making the device easier to use than a device having a single clip. It will be appreciated that other embodiments of the present invention may also have multiple clips attached to the body and centered between the terminal wheels.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0079">The terminal wheels in every embodiment of the present invention must be capable of securely holding the one or more lines to be entwined and knotted. A number of terminal wheel designs are able to accomplish this function. In one embodiment, the terminal wheel has one or more slots <b>70</b> cut into the terminal wheel extending in a straight radial line from the perimeter of the terminal wheel and extending toward the center of the terminal wheel (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>). The slots may all be of the same width, or may have different widths to accommodate different line thicknesses. These terminal wheels are used by pushing the line into the slot from the perimeter of the terminal wheel toward the center of the terminal wheel. The line is secured by friction between the surface of the line and the walls of the slot. This type of terminal wheel is exemplified by terminal wheels <b>32</b> and <b>35</b> in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0080">In another embodiment, the terminal wheel has one or more tapered slots cut into the terminal wheel and extending in a straight radial line from the perimeter of the terminal wheel toward the center of the terminal wheel, wherein the slot is wider at the perimeter of the terminal wheel and gets narrower as it moves toward the center of the terminal wheel. These terminal wheels are used by pushing the line into the slot from the perimeter of the terminal wheel toward the center of the terminal wheel. The line is secured by friction between the surface of the line and the walls of the slot. The tapered slot permits the terminal wheel to hold lines of varying thickness because the line will be secured by the slot at the point at which the line's width matches or is larger than the slot's width. This type of terminal wheel is exemplified by terminal wheels <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> (<figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0081">In yet another embodiment, the terminal wheel has a âram's hornâ design (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>). The ram's horn design has one or more slots <b>71</b> that gradually taper and get narrower moving from the outside of the terminal wheel to the center of the terminal wheel so as to accommodate line of varying widths at different points along the slot (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>). Moreover, the slots in the âram's hornâ design extend from the perimeter of the terminal wheel toward the center of the terminal wheel in a spiral manner, creating an infinite screw (<figref>FIG. 16</figref>). These terminal wheels are used by pushing the line into the slot from the perimeter of the terminal wheel toward the center of the terminal wheel. The line is secured by friction between the surface of the line and the walls of the slot. The âram's hornâ terminal wheel is exemplified by terminal wheels <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> (<figref>FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0082">The knot tying device of the present invention can be used to entwine and knot monofilament fishing line. The use of the device in tying knots is described below in reference to the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. It will be readily appreciated, however, that other embodiments of the present invention are used in an analogous manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0083">The basic function of the device of the present invention is the entwining of one or more fishing lines. Such entwinement is common to many of the knots that are useful in fishing. The clinch knot, Trilene knot, and Snell knots are all generally used to tie the fishing line to a hook, swivel, or lure. In forming these knots with the device of the present invention, line x is first passed through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by the right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and terminal wheel <b>6</b>, passed through the eye of the hook or swivel to which the line is to be attached, wrapped around clip <b>7</b>, and attached at its end to terminal wheel <b>6</b> (<figref>FIG. 6A</figref>). The hook or swivel to which the line is to be attached is positioned on the side of clip <b>7</b> opposite to the terminal wheel to which line x is attached. The user then rotates controller <b>4</b> to produce rotational energy which wraps line x around itself (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>). To complete the basic clinch knot, the user detaches the terminal end of line x from terminal wheel <b>6</b> and attaches the terminal end of line x to clip <b>7</b> above the loop of line (<figref>FIG. 6C</figref>). The user then inserts a finger under the entwined line x and pulls up (see circle with upward arrow in <figref>FIG. 6C</figref>), sliding the loop of line up over clip <b>7</b> and over the terminal end of the line that is being held by clip <b>7</b>, and then pulls the non-entwined portion of line x that is not attached to clip <b>7</b> in a direction away from clip <b>7</b>, thereby causing the entwinements of line x to compress thereby forming the knot. After forming the knot, the user releases the terminal end of line x from clip <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0084">In an alternative method, the hook or swivel to which the line is to be attached is held by clip <b>7</b> with the eye of the hook or swivel pointing toward terminal wheel <b>6</b>. The line is passed through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and terminal wheel <b>6</b>, passed through the eye of the hook or swivel to which the line is to be attached, and attached at its end to terminal wheel <b>6</b>. The user then rotates controller <b>4</b> to produce rotational energy which causes the line to entwine over itself (see <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>). The basic clinch knot is completed when the user detaches the terminal end of the line from terminal wheel <b>6</b>, passes the terminal end of the line inside the loop formed by the line around the eye of the hook or swivel, and then pulls the terminal end of line x and the non-terminal portion of line x that is not entwined in opposite directions, thereby causing the entwinements of line x to compress, forming the knot. The knotted hook is then released from clip <b>7</b>. Using either method, the line with attached hook (or swivel or lure) is removed from the knot-tying device by passing the line and hook out through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by the right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and terminal wheel <b>6</b>. It will be evident, therefore, that aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>must be large enough to allow passage of the hook, swivel or lure. Indeed, different embodiments of the present invention may have differently sized apertures extending from the outside of the body and through the terminal wheels so as to facilitate hooks, swivels, or lures of varying sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0085">It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that other knots related to the clinch knot (e.g., Trilene knot, Snell knot) can be made using the device of the present invention by simple modification of these basic methods. The Trilene knot, for example, is made in a manner similar to the basic clinch knot, except that the line is looped through the eye of the hook (or swivel or lure) twice.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0086">The knot-tying device of the present invention can also be used to connect two separate lines to each other, such as in a nail knot, blood knot, or Albright knot. The nail knot, for example, can be made using the device of the present invention by passing line y in through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by the right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and right terminal wheel <b>6</b>, and then out through aperture <b>8</b><i>a </i>formed by left terminal wheel <b>5</b> and left upper sprocket <b>8</b> (<figref>FIG. 6D</figref>). Line x is then passed through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by the right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and terminal wheel <b>6</b>, wrapped around clip <b>7</b>, and attached near its end to terminal wheel <b>6</b> (<figref>FIG. 6D</figref>). The user then rotates controller <b>4</b> to produce rotational energy which wraps line x around line y (<figref>FIG. 6E</figref>). The user completes the nail knot by detaching the terminal end of line x from terminal wheel <b>6</b>, feeding the terminal end of line x back through the tunnel created by the entwinement of line x around line y, sliding the loop of line x around clip <b>7</b> up off of clip <b>7</b>, and then pulling the terminal end of line x and the portion of line x that is not entwined in opposite directions, thereby causing compression of the entwinements of line x around line y and forming the knot.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">Another common knot for joining two different lines is the blood knot. The blood knot is formed using the device of the present invention as follows. Line x is passed through aperture <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed by the right upper sprocket <b>9</b> and terminal wheel <b>6</b> and then attached to left terminal wheel <b>5</b> (<figref>FIG. 6F</figref>). Line y is passed through aperture <b>8</b><i>a </i>formed by the left upper sprocket <b>8</b> and terminal wheel <b>5</b> and then attached to right terminal wheel <b>6</b> (<figref>FIG. 6F</figref>). Lines x and y are positioned on opposite sides of clip <b>7</b> (<figref>FIG. 6F</figref>). The user rotates controller <b>4</b> to produce rotational energy which causes line x and y to entwine (see <figref>FIG. 6G</figref>). The user then detaches the end of line x from terminal wheel <b>5</b> and attaches it to clip <b>7</b>. The user then detaches the end of line y from terminal wheel <b>6</b> and attaches it to clip <b>7</b> (<figref>FIG. 6G</figref>). The user then inserts a finger under the entwined lines under either side of clip <b>7</b> and pulls up (see circles with upward arrow in <figref>FIG. 6G</figref>), sliding the loop of line up over clip <b>7</b> and over the terminal ends of lines x and y (which are being held by clip <b>7</b>), and then pulls the non-terminal portions of lines x and y in opposite directions. The pulling motion causes the entwinements of line x and line y to compress thereby forming the blood knot.</p>
