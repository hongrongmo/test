      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to juicing devices and, more particularly (although not necessarily exclusively), to two-stage cold press juicers.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Juice is a liquid found in fruits and vegetables. Juice can provide a significant source of nutrients and often has a rich, potent flavor. Fruits and vegetables are often processed to extract juice in order to obtain a concentrated form of nutrients and/or flavor from the fruits and vegetables. Many techniques for juicing have been developed. Juicing techniques are often evaluated by criteria such as yield, cleanliness, and alteration. For example, if selecting between different juicing techniques, most people will prefer the juicing technique that produces higher yields of juice from a starting amount of raw materials, the juicing technique that involves less and/or easier cleaning at the end of the process, and/or the juicing technique that results in fewer changes to attributes of the juice (such as the oxygenation level and/or temperature level) from the state in which the juice naturally occurs in the fruits or vegetables.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Certain aspects and examples of the present disclosure are directed to a two stage cold press juicer. The juicer can include components for a two-stage process of extracting juice from comestibles such as fruits or vegetables. In the first stage (sometimes called trituration), the juicer can grind the comestibles into a pulp. In the second stage, the pulp can be subjected to pressure, such as by being pressed between two surfaces. The pressure applied to the pulp can squeeze the juice from the pulp so that the juice can flow into a collection vessel.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In some aspects, the juicer can include a grinding subsystem that includes a feed housing and a cutter. The feed housing can be positioned around the cutter to form a grinding chamber. An input chute of the feed housing feeds into the grinding chamber and an output chute feeds out of the grinding chamber. The cutter can rotate so that cutting teeth will encounter comestibles inserted through the input chute and grind the comestibles into a pulp that can be ejected through the output chute. The input chute can be offset from a position directly over the cutter and/or grind chamber. For example, the input chute may be offset laterally away from a side of the cutter that is spinning upwards, which may reduce a risk of ground comestibles being ejected upward through the input chute.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The feed housing may be releasably connected with the juicer, for example, to facilitate cleaning and/or maintenance of the feed housing, the cutter, or other components of the juicer. In some aspects, the juicer includes a mounting system to facilitate releasably connecting the feed housing with the juicer. For example, the mounting system may include bayonet-style mounting features or other locking features on the feed housing and/or a mounting plate on the juicer. In some aspects, the mounting system permits the feed housing to be moved by a single twisting or rotating motion from a position in which the feed housing is aligned with the juicer for installation to a fully installed, locked, and/or secured position. The mounting system may additionally or alternatively include a spring loaded detent or other retention feature to secure the feed housing in an installed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In some aspects, the juicer can include a pressing subsystem that includes a press chamber. The press chamber can include a tray that can receive pulp from comestibles ground by the grinding subsystem. The tray may be positioned beneath a press plate in the press chamber. The tray can be pushed against the press plate, such as by a hydraulic press. The tray may be prevented from rotating by an arm extending from the tray into a groove in a vertical upright along a side of the press chamber. Such an arrangement may prevent rotation of the tray in a manner that reduces or eliminates any number of other openings for receiving rotation-preventing features, such as other openings (e.g., through a bottom of the press chamber) that may otherwise permit passage of comestibles into an interior of the juicer. In some aspects, the juicer includes a press chamber form that includes a single continuous piece of material forming a bottom, a side, and a top of the press chamber. Forming a continuous, gapless joint between adjacent surfaces of the press chamber by such a continuous press chamber form can reduce a number of joints through which juice might otherwise seep to cause cleaning difficulties and/or other sanitation concerns.</p>

The pressing subsystem <b>104</b> can include the motor <b>122</b>, a pump <b>140</b>, a hydraulic (or other form of) press <b>142</b>, a press chamber form <b>144</b>, a platen <b>146</b>, a juice tray <b>148</b>, a guide arm <b>150</b>, and a juice pallet <b>152</b>. Although omitted from <figref>FIG. 2</figref> so to not obscure other components, the juicer <b>100</b> can also include an exterior housing <b>154</b>. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the exterior housing <b>154</b> may include panels or plates attached to the frame so as to define an interior volume of the juicer <b>100</b>. The interior volume may house internal components that may be shielded from view and/or exposure to an exterior of the juicer <b>100</b> by the exterior housing <b>154</b>. The exterior housing <b>154</b> can be made of metal or any other suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The motor <b>122</b> can be supported by the first vertical support <b>114</b> and the second vertical support <b>116</b>. The motor <b>122</b> can rotate the shaft <b>124</b>. The shaft <b>124</b> can extend through and/or past the first vertical support <b>114</b> to an exterior position external to the exterior housing <b>154</b>. For example, the shaft <b>124</b> may extend to and/or through the mount plate <b>126</b>. The mount plate <b>126</b> may be positioned external to the exterior housing <b>154</b>. In some aspects, the mount plate <b>126</b> includes an internal bearing for receiving the shaft <b>124</b>. Such an arrangement can provide convenient access to the bearing for replacement without requiring that the motor <b>122</b> be removed from the juicer <b>100</b> in the process. The mount plate <b>126</b> can additionally or alternatively include one or more seals (such as O-rings or other seals against passage of liquid). The one or more seals may reduce a risk of passage of oil and/or other lubricant from the motor <b>122</b> toward an exterior of the mount plate <b>126</b> and/or passage of liquid such as fruit and/or vegetable juice from an exterior of the mount plate <b>126</b> along the shaft <b>124</b> toward the motor <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The cutter <b>128</b> can be coupled to the shaft <b>124</b> such that rotation of the motor <b>122</b> will cause rotation of the cutter <b>128</b>. The cutter <b>128</b> may be releasably connected to the shaft <b>124</b>, which may facilitate removal of the cutter <b>128</b> for maintenance and/or cleaning. In some aspects, the cutter <b>128</b> is held in place on the shaft <b>124</b> by the feed housing <b>130</b> when the feed housing <b>130</b> is coupled with the mount plate <b>126</b>. The cutter <b>128</b> may include a shaped channel <b>198</b> matching the shape of a key at the end of the shaft <b>124</b>. As may be best seen in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the channel <b>198</b> may extend through a full length of the cutter <b>128</b>, which may facilitate ease of cleaning the cutter <b>128</b> (e.g., by passage of water or other cleaning liquids through the cutter <b>128</b>). The cutter <b>128</b> may also include a set screw <b>197</b> having a spring-biased ball to further secure the cutter <b>128</b> to the shaft <b>124</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In some aspects the cutter <b>128</b> has blades that sweep along an axial length of the cutter <b>128</b> at an angle to the axis of rotation. The sweep of the blades of the cutter <b>128</b> can provide a biasing moment for retaining the cutter <b>128</b> on the shaft <b>124</b> during rotation. Although the cutter <b>128</b> is illustrated with eight radially extending blades in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and other figures herein, any number of teeth or blades may be utilized including, eight, more than eight, or less than eight.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In some aspects, the pump <b>140</b> can be driven by the motor <b>122</b>. For example, the pump <b>140</b> may have a shaft coupled by a belt or other suitable mechanism to the shaft <b>124</b> of the motor <b>122</b>, such as on an end of the shaft <b>124</b> opposite an end engaging the cutter <b>128</b>. The pump <b>140</b> can provide pressure for operating the hydraulic press <b>142</b>. The hydraulic press <b>142</b> can be coupled with the platen <b>146</b> so that the platen <b>146</b> is movable in response to actuation of the hydraulic press <b>142</b>. The juice tray <b>148</b> may be shaped to engage the platen <b>146</b> so that the juice tray <b>148</b> moves in response to movement of the platen <b>146</b>. Although the juice tray <b>148</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> as a distinct and readily separable component from the platen <b>146</b>, in some aspects, the platen <b>146</b> and the juice tray <b>148</b> may be a single integrated component. One advantage of a juice tray <b>148</b> that is separable from the platen <b>146</b> is that the juice tray <b>148</b> may be more easily removed from the juicer <b>100</b> for cleaning and/or maintenance purposes. In some aspects, the platen <b>146</b> and/or the juice tray <b>148</b> is rectangular instead of square, which can increase a surface area for application of force for squeezing.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of the juicer <b>100</b>, with the feed housing <b>130</b> shown in a cutaway view so as to better illustrate operation of the juicer <b>100</b> according to certain aspects. The feed housing <b>130</b> can be attached to the juicer <b>100</b>, for example via the mount plate <b>126</b>. In some aspects, the feed housing <b>130</b> can be rotated or twisted in order to install the feed housing <b>130</b> with respect to the juicer <b>100</b>. For example, the feed housing <b>130</b> may be installed by rotating the feed housing <b>130</b> from the position shown in phantom line in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> to the position shown in solid line in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. In various aspects, the feed housing <b>130</b> may be locked into place in a fully installed position in response to the rotating installing motion. Various examples of mounting systems that may facilitate such a twisting installation are described herein with respect to <figref>FIGS. 5-13</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">When installed, the feed housing <b>130</b> can provide a grind chamber <b>156</b> about the cutter <b>128</b>. For example, the feed housing <b>130</b> may include an opening on a rear side into which the cutter <b>128</b> fits when the feed housing <b>130</b> is installed. The grind chamber <b>156</b> may be defined between an inside of the feed housing <b>130</b> and the surface of the mount plate <b>126</b> to which the feed housing <b>130</b> attaches.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The feed housing <b>130</b> can include an input chute <b>158</b> and an output chute <b>160</b>, each in fluid communication with the grind chamber <b>156</b>. The feed pan <b>132</b> can be coupled with the input chute <b>158</b>. In operation, comestibles can be placed in the feed pan <b>132</b> and/or into the input chute <b>158</b> and driven through the input chute <b>158</b> into the grind chamber <b>156</b> by the pusher <b>134</b>. The cutter <b>128</b> can be rotated (such as by the motor <b>122</b> via the shaft <b>124</b>) so the teeth on the cutter <b>128</b> engage the comestibles introduced into the grind chamber <b>156</b>. In some aspects, the rotating teeth on the cutter <b>128</b> can pull the comestibles into the grind chamber <b>156</b> without intervention of the pusher <b>134</b>. The cutter <b>128</b> can cut or grind the comestibles into smaller pieces to produce a pulp from the comestibles.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The feed housing <b>130</b> can include a slot <b>162</b>. The slot <b>162</b> can receive a grid tray <b>136</b> carrying a grid <b>138</b> (best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). The grid <b>138</b> can include a set of perforations or openings sized so as to permit passage of comestible particles of a certain size. As may be best seen with reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the slot <b>162</b> may be positioned so that the grid <b>138</b> supported by the grid tray <b>136</b> in the slot <b>162</b> can provide a boundary of the grind chamber <b>156</b>, for example, along a bottom side of the grind chamber <b>156</b>. Hence, the grid <b>138</b> can provide a mechanism by which comestible pulp will remain or be retained in the grind chamber <b>156</b> until the cutter <b>128</b> has acted on the pulp a sufficient amount to produce a pulp of a consistency fine enough to pass through the openings in the grid <b>138</b>. In some aspects, the inside of the grind chamber <b>156</b> includes one or more stationary blades (such as sharp edges formed by a bore <b>190</b> or other gouge in the surface of the grind chamber <b>156</b>), which can supplement the amount of cutting or grinding occurring in the grind chamber <b>156</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The pulp produced by the cutter <b>128</b> in the grind chamber <b>156</b> can be ejected through the output chute <b>160</b>. In some aspects, the output chute <b>160</b> is flared, having a larger outer diameter at an end away from the grind chamber than an end proximate the grind chamber. Such a tapered output chute <b>160</b> may reduce a risk of pulp becoming lodged in the output chute <b>160</b> and increase a likelihood that the pulp will fall under the effect of gravity instead of sticking to the inside of the output chute <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The pulp discharged from the output chute <b>160</b> can be collected in a cloth <b>106</b> (e.g., <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In some aspects, a bumper <b>164</b> is provided on the exterior housing <b>154</b> of the juicer <b>100</b>. The bumper <b>164</b> can reduce a risk of the exterior housing <b>154</b> becoming scratched or worn by contact with a bowl or other receptacles for holding a cloth <b>106</b> beneath the output chute <b>160</b>. The bumper <b>164</b> may be any suitable material, including, but not limited to rubber or plastic. In some aspects, the bumper <b>164</b> may be positioned in an indentation embossed in the exterior housing <b>154</b> so that the bumper <b>164</b> is substantially flush with the exterior housing <b>154</b>. In some aspects, a hook <b>193</b> (e.g., <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), knob, handle, or other appropriate feature can be provided on the grid tray <b>136</b> or at another suitable position along a front of the feed housing <b>130</b> for securing a bag of cloth <b>106</b> around the output chute <b>160</b>. For example, the hook <b>193</b> may be positioned near an opening so that a drawstring or other cord from a bag of cloth <b>106</b> can be routed through the opening and over the hook <b>193</b>. In some aspects, a thermometer may be included for indicating a temperature in the grind chamber <b>156</b>. For example, a thermometer may allow a user to monitor temperature to determine if conditions in the grind chamber <b>156</b> are affecting a quality of the pulp being collected in the cloth <b>106</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, the thermometer may include a display in any suitable location, including, but not limited to, the feed housing <b>130</b>, the exterior housing <b>154</b>, the mount plate <b>126</b>, or the grid tray <b>136</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As best seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the cloth <b>106</b> can be folded around the pulp generated by the grinding subsystem <b>102</b> in order to form a packet <b>108</b> that can be placed in the juice tray <b>148</b>. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the juice tray <b>148</b> can be moved within a press chamber <b>166</b> (e.g., by operation of the hydraulic press <b>142</b>, such as by turning a control lever <b>192</b>). The press chamber <b>166</b> can include a press plate <b>168</b>. As the juice tray <b>148</b> is moved toward the press plate <b>168</b> (e.g., from the position of the juice tray <b>148</b> illustrated in solid lines in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> to the position of the juice tray <b>148</b> illustrated in phantom lines in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>), the juice packet <b>108</b> can be sandwiched between the juice tray <b>148</b> and the press plate <b>168</b>. Continued pressure from the hydraulic press <b>142</b> pushing the juice tray <b>148</b> and the press plate <b>168</b> toward one another can compress the juice packet <b>108</b> and cause juice to be squeezed out of the pulp. The juice can flow through the cloth <b>106</b> forming the boundaries of the packet <b>108</b> while the pulp is retained inside the packet <b>108</b> and further compressed to release more juice. The juice flowing through the cloth <b>106</b> can flow out of the spout <b>170</b> (or other appropriate routing structure) of the press plate <b>168</b> and into the collection vessel <b>110</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In some aspects, a bumper similar to the bumper <b>164</b> can be positioned on the exterior housing <b>154</b> beneath the juice tray <b>148</b>, e.g., to reduce wear from contact with collection vessels <b>110</b>. In some aspects, the spout <b>170</b> is replaced and/or supplemented by hosing between the juice tray <b>148</b> and the collection vessel <b>110</b>. For example, hosing may reduce an amount of time that the juice is exposed to oxygen and/or facilitate application of a vacuum to the vessel <b>110</b>, such as for preserving the juice in a fresh-squeezed state. In some aspects, the juicer <b>100</b> may include a vacuum pump and/or other components to facilitate such an arrangement.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In some aspects, juice may be extracted from the packet <b>108</b> at a rate greater than the juice can flow out of the spout <b>170</b>. This may cause juice to overflow one or more sides of the juice tray <b>148</b>. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the juice tray <b>148</b> may include channels <b>172</b> (such as around a perimeter of the juice tray <b>148</b>), which can provide additional volume in which juice can collect for flowing out of the juice tray <b>148</b> as intended instead of overflowing over the sides. In some aspects, the juice pallet <b>152</b> can additionally or alternatively be used to reduce a risk of overflow of the juice tray <b>148</b>. The juice pallet <b>152</b> can include a series of raised portions, channels, and/or openings, thereby providing additional volume beneath the packet <b>108</b> into which juice can flow when the packet <b>108</b> is being compressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some aspects (and as best seen with reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>), the press chamber <b>166</b> is defined at least in part by the press chamber form <b>144</b>. The press chamber <b>166</b> can include a first surface and a second surface on opposite sides of the press chamber <b>166</b> and joined by a third surface extending between the two surfaces. For example, the press chamber <b>166</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> with a bottom <b>174</b>, a top <b>175</b>, and a sidewall <b>176</b> extending between the bottom <b>174</b> and the top <b>175</b>. Although described as a bottom <b>174</b> and a top <b>175</b>, embodiments are not limited to arrangements in which the bottom <b>174</b> and the top <b>175</b> are arranged so that the top <b>175</b> is positioned above the bottom <b>174</b> when the juicer <b>100</b> is in operation. The press chamber form <b>144</b> can be a single, continuous piece of material defining adjacent portions of the press chamber <b>166</b> and the transitions between the adjacent portions. For example, the press chamber form <b>144</b> can include the bottom <b>174</b>, the sidewall <b>176</b>, and a transition or seam <b>178</b> between the bottom <b>174</b> and the sidewall <b>176</b>. The seam <b>178</b> may be smooth and unbroken, formed without gaps into which stray juice might otherwise seep and cause sanitation concerns. The seam <b>178</b> may be curved to facilitate ease of cleaning of the press chamber <b>166</b>, such as for wiping up of any juice that spills or splatters over the sides of the juice tray <b>148</b>. In some aspects, the press chamber form <b>144</b> further includes the top <b>175</b> and/or the press plate <b>168</b>, along with additional gapless transitions.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a section view of the feed housing <b>130</b> of the juicer <b>100</b> according to certain aspects. In some aspects, the feed housing <b>130</b> has an offset input chute <b>158</b>. For example, the input chute <b>158</b> may be offset from a position directly over the grind chamber <b>156</b> (e.g., offset from a position directly over the cutter <b>128</b> when the feed housing <b>130</b> is installed). The amount that the input chute <b>158</b> is offset can be quantified with respect to a grind chamber axis <b>188</b> and an input chute axis <b>186</b>, which may each be vertical axes.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The grind chamber axis <b>188</b> can be defined through the grind chamber <b>156</b>. When the feed housing <b>130</b> is installed, the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> can pass through a center of the cutter <b>128</b> and/or intersect an axis of rotation of the cutter <b>128</b>. The axis of rotation of the cutter <b>128</b> can be horizontal. The cutter <b>128</b> can be rotated about the axis of rotation in a first direction (e.g., illustrated by the arrow <b>180</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) in response to rotation of the motor <b>122</b>. Rotation of the cutter <b>128</b> can cause one side of the cutter <b>128</b> to move in an upward direction (e.g., illustrated by arrow <b>182</b> on a left lateral side of the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) and an opposite side of the cutter <b>128</b> to move in a downward direction (e.g., illustrated by arrow <b>184</b> on a right lateral side of the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The input chute axis <b>186</b> can be defined generally aligned along a center of the input chute <b>158</b> of the feed housing <b>130</b>. The input chute axis <b>186</b> can have a proximal end P proximal to the grind chamber <b>156</b> and a distal end D distal to the grind chamber <b>156</b>. The proximal end P of the input chute axis <b>186</b> can be offset from the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> by an amount Î. The amount Î can correspond to an amount that the input chute <b>158</b> is offset away from the side of the cutter <b>128</b> that is rotating upward. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the input chute axis <b>186</b> is offset to the right (e.g., away from the upward arrow <b>182</b>) by the amount Î from the grind chamber axis <b>188</b>. Such an offset can reduce a risk that pulp generated by the cutter <b>128</b> will be propelled upward out of the input chute <b>158</b> during operation of the juicer <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In some aspects, the input chute <b>158</b> is offset by an amount within a particular spectrum. For example, in one spectrum, a first end of the spectrum (e.g., 0%) may correspond to an amount Î of zero (e.g., in which the input chute <b>158</b> would be positioned directly above the grind chamber <b>156</b>), an opposite end of the spectrum (e.g., 100%) may correspond to an amount Î in which an edge of the input chute <b>158</b> that is closest to the side of the cutter <b>128</b> that is moving upward is aligned with the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> (e.g., in the position shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>), and the offset is a certain amount within that spectrum. In one example embodiment, a suitable offset range is between 30% and 135% of this example spectrum, and in another example embodiment, the offset range is between 60% and 100% of this example spectrum. Such offset ranges may provide a balance between reducing a risk that pulp will be ejected upward out of the input chute <b>158</b> along a tangency of the cutter <b>128</b> on the one hand and on the other hand facilitating introduction of comestibles to the cutter <b>128</b> at an angle suited for the cutter <b>128</b> to engage and grind the comestibles. As further illustrative examples, the feed housing <b>130</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is shown at a position substantially corresponding to 100% of the example spectrum, and the feed housing <b>130</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is shown at a position substantially corresponding to 67% of the example spectrum.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some aspects, the input chute <b>158</b> additionally or alternatively may be angled relative to the grind chamber axis <b>188</b>. For example, the input chute <b>158</b> may be aligned along an angled component <b>186</b>â² so that the distal end D of the input chute <b>158</b> is angled away from the grind chamber axis <b>188</b><i>by </i>an angle Î±. Although the input chute <b>158</b> is illustrated as substantially not angled (e.g., at an angle Î± of 0Â°), in some embodiments, the input chute <b>158</b> may be angled at an angle Î± of a small angle such as 5Â°, or any other angle larger or smaller than 5Â°. An input chute <b>158</b> angled at a positive angle Î± (e.g., tilted toward the right side of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) can be easier to access by a right hand of a user, while an input chute <b>158</b> angled at a negative angle Î± (e.g., tilted toward the left side of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>) can be easier to access by a left hand of a user. In some aspects, the grind chamber axis <b>188</b> is aligned so as to pass through a center of the output chute <b>160</b>. In such cases, the amount Î of the offset may be quantified as an amount of offset between the central axes of the input chute <b>158</b> and the output chute <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some aspects, the feed housing <b>130</b> can include a separator section <b>196</b> positioned between the ends of the input chute <b>158</b> and the output chute <b>160</b>. The separator section <b>196</b> can provide a section of separation between the geometry of the input chute <b>158</b> and the output chute <b>160</b>. For example, in the absence of a separator section <b>196</b>, comestibles input into the input chute <b>158</b> may slip partially past the cutter <b>128</b> into the geometry of the output chute <b>160</b> and jam the cutter <b>128</b>. The separator section <b>196</b> may be contoured to match a shape of the cutter to increase a likelihood that any comestibles will be engaged with the cutter <b>128</b> for grinding before moving from the geometry of the input chute <b>158</b> and the output chute <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Various mounting systems may be utilized to secure the feed housing <b>130</b> to the juicer <b>100</b>. For example, <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a rear perspective view of a mount plate <b>226</b> and a feed housing <b>230</b> of an example of a mounting system <b>200</b> according to certain aspects. The feed housing <b>230</b> is shown releasably connected to the mount plate <b>226</b> and locked in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is an exploded assembly view illustrating corresponding features of the mount plate <b>226</b> and the feed housing <b>230</b> of the mounting system <b>200</b> according to certain aspects. The mount plate <b>226</b> can include features for receiving the feed housing <b>230</b>. For example, the mount plate <b>226</b> can include a central boss <b>205</b> sized to receive a ring <b>207</b> of the feed housing <b>230</b>. The ring <b>207</b> can define an outer edge of an opening <b>294</b> on a rear side of the feed housing <b>230</b>. For example, the opening <b>294</b> may permit a cutter (e.g., the cutter <b>128</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to be received and positioned within the feed housing <b>230</b> when the feed housing <b>230</b> is installed. In some aspects, the boss <b>205</b> can have a tapered radial edge, which may facilitate alignment of the feed housing <b>230</b> with respect to the mount plate <b>226</b>. In some aspects, the taper of the boss <b>205</b> can produce an interference fit between the boss <b>205</b> and the ring <b>207</b> (e.g., for sealing a rear side of the grind chamber <b>156</b> about the cutter <b>128</b> of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In some aspects, a radial edge of the boss <b>205</b> includes an indentation <b>253</b> for receiving an O-ring or other suitable seal to provide an additional amount of sealing between the boss <b>205</b> and the ring <b>207</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The mount plate <b>226</b> can include locking structures for locking the feed housing <b>230</b> into an installed position. For example, the mount plate <b>226</b> can include lips <b>215</b> for locking engagement with corresponding cleats <b>213</b> of the feed housing <b>230</b>. The lips <b>215</b> can be formed in a disk <b>209</b> extending away from a rear of the mount plate <b>226</b>. The disk <b>209</b> can include slots <b>211</b> associated with the lips <b>215</b>. The slots <b>211</b> can be arranged to facilitate moving the cleats <b>213</b> by a rotating motion into locking engagement with the lips <b>215</b>. The slots <b>211</b> can be open in the radially outward direction of the disk <b>209</b> so as to facilitate water flow or other access for cleaning. The mount plate <b>226</b> can also include a retention mechanism <b>201</b> that can engage a feature such as a notch <b>203</b> on the feed housing <b>230</b>. In some aspects, the feed housing <b>230</b> includes a shroud <b>251</b> sized so as to shield features of the mount plate <b>226</b> and the feed housing <b>230</b> from view when the feed housing <b>230</b> is installed.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a partial view illustrating one of the cleats <b>213</b> and one of the lips <b>215</b> of the mounting system <b>200</b> being aligned for mounting according to certain aspects. The lip <b>215</b> can extend partially along the slot <b>211</b>. For example, a first section <b>217</b> of the slot <b>211</b> may be positioned behind the lip <b>215</b> (e.g., on a side of the lip <b>215</b> facing a rear of the mount plate <b>226</b>) and extend over a radial edge of the lip <b>215</b>. Stated another way, the first section <b>217</b> may form an L-shape, with the leg of the L extending behind the lip <b>215</b> in a radially inward direction and with the column of the L extending over the lip <b>215</b> in an axial direction. A second section <b>219</b> of the slot <b>211</b> can be adjacent the first section <b>217</b> along a length of the slot <b>211</b> (such as along the circumference of the disk <b>209</b>). The second section <b>219</b> can act as an entry portion through which the cleat <b>213</b> can initially enter the slot <b>211</b>, and the first section <b>217</b> can act as a receiving portion for securing the cleat <b>213</b> upon rotation from the second section <b>219</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The second section <b>219</b> of the slot <b>211</b> can be sized to permit entry of the cleat <b>213</b> when the feed housing <b>230</b> is axially translated toward the mount plate <b>226</b>. For example, the cleat <b>213</b> can include an axial portion <b>221</b> and a radial portion <b>223</b>. The radial portion <b>223</b> can depend from the axial portion <b>221</b>, e.g., so that the cleat <b>213</b> forms an L-shape with the axial portion <b>221</b> forming a column of the L and the radial portion <b>223</b> forming the leg of the L. The second section <b>219</b> of the slot <b>211</b> can have a cross-sectional opening large enough to receive the cross-sectional area of the radial portion <b>223</b> of the cleat <b>213</b> when axially translated.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The mount plate <b>226</b> and the feed housing <b>230</b> can include indicia <b>225</b> (individually shown as indicia <b>225</b>A, <b>225</b>B, and <b>225</b>C). The indicia <b>225</b> can be used to assist a user in aligning and securing the feed housing <b>230</b> to the mount plate <b>226</b>. For example, a first indicia <b>225</b>A can be aligned with a second indicia <b>225</b>B to align the cleat <b>213</b> with the second section <b>219</b> of the slot <b>211</b>. The cleat <b>213</b> can be axially translated into the second section <b>219</b> of the slot <b>211</b> so that the feed housing <b>230</b> is in an aligned position from which rotation can shift the feed housing <b>230</b> into an installed and/or locked position. From the aligned position, the feed housing <b>230</b> can be rotated relative to the mount plate <b>226</b> (such as shown by arrow <b>227</b>) to secure the cleat <b>213</b> within the slot <b>211</b>. For example, the feed housing <b>230</b> can be rotated relative to the mount plate <b>226</b> by twisting at least some part of the feed housing <b>230</b> with respect to the mount plate <b>226</b> and/or by twisting at least some part of the mount plate <b>226</b> with respect to the feed housing <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">As may be appreciated, in this and other embodiments, a mounting system (such as mounting system <b>200</b>) can feature a mount (such as a mount plate <b>226</b>) with structures that generally project outward from the juicer in order to receive corresponding features of a feed housing (such as feed housing <b>230</b>). Such outwardly projecting structures may be easier to clean than inwardly projecting openings or other inwardly projecting features that may readily collect comestible particles in a geometry that is difficult to access. Additionally, difficult-to-clean structures can be arranged on a removable part that can be readily removed for cleaning in a dishwasher or other automated cleaning apparatus to facilitate greater ease of cleaning. For example, the feed housing <b>230</b> and/or the mount plate <b>226</b> can be readily removable from a juicer such as the juicer <b>100</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> to facilitate cleaning of the cleats <b>213</b>, lips <b>215</b>, recesses <b>211</b>, etc. in a dishwasher.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates engagement of the cleat <b>213</b> and the lip <b>215</b> according to certain aspects. Rotating the feed housing <b>230</b> (e.g., according to the arrow <b>227</b>) can move the cleat <b>213</b> into engagement with the lip <b>215</b> (e.g., into the first section <b>217</b> of the slot <b>211</b>). For example, the L-shape of the cleat <b>213</b> can be aligned with the L-shape of the first section <b>217</b> of the slot <b>211</b> such that the radial portion <b>223</b> of the cleat <b>213</b> is behind the lip <b>215</b> and the axial portion <b>221</b> is over the lip <b>215</b>. In some aspects, the lip <b>215</b> includes a ramped surface <b>229</b> to guide the cleat <b>213</b> during rotation so as to pull the cleat <b>213</b> in the axial direction toward the mount plate <b>226</b>. The cleat <b>213</b> can additionally or alternatively include a ramped surface <b>229</b> (such as best seen in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>) to facilitate this function. As may be appreciated from the foregoing description, engagement of the cleat <b>213</b> and the lip <b>215</b> can lock the feed housing <b>230</b> into the installed position in response to rotation of the feed housing <b>230</b> relative to the mount plate <b>226</b>. In some aspects, once the feed housing <b>230</b> is rotated, the first indicia <b>225</b>A may align with a third indicia <b>225</b>C to indicate that the feed housing <b>230</b> is properly or completely secured to the mount plate <b>226</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a retention mechanism <b>201</b> of the mounting system <b>200</b> of <figref>FIG. 6</figref> according to certain aspects. The retention mechanism <b>201</b> can include a wedge <b>231</b>. The wedge <b>231</b> can be constrained by a guide <b>233</b> to be movable within a predefined range. The wedge <b>231</b> can be biased toward one end of the range by a biasing member <b>235</b> (such as a spring). The wedge <b>231</b> can be coupled with a tab <b>237</b> such that movement of the tab <b>237</b> can move the wedge <b>231</b> against the biasing force exerted by the biasing member <b>235</b>. The feed housing <b>230</b> can include features for interacting with the retention mechanism <b>201</b>. For example, the feed housing <b>230</b> can include a groove <b>239</b> and a notch <b>203</b>. The wedge <b>231</b> can be received in the groove <b>239</b> when the feed housing <b>230</b> is aligned for installation. The wedge <b>231</b> can engage the notch <b>203</b> and act as a detent to lock the feed housing <b>230</b> into an installed position. For example, rotation of the feed housing <b>230</b> from the aligned position (e.g., in the direction shown by arrow <b>241</b>) can cause the relative position of the retention mechanism <b>201</b> to change from the position shown in phantom lines in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> to the position shown in solid lines in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. As the feed housing <b>230</b> is rotated, the wedge <b>231</b> can engage a ramp <b>243</b> at the end of the groove <b>239</b>. Movement of the wedge <b>231</b> along the ramp <b>243</b> can move the wedge <b>231</b> against the biasing force of the biasing member <b>235</b>. As the feed housing <b>230</b> continues in rotation, the wedge <b>231</b> can be pushed into locking engagement with the notch <b>203</b> by the biasing force exerted by the biasing member <b>235</b>. In this way, the retention mechanism <b>201</b> can prevent rotation of the feed housing <b>230</b> until uninstallation is desired. When uninstallation is desired, the tab <b>237</b> can be moved with sufficient force to overcome the biasing force of the biasing member <b>235</b> and shift the wedge <b>231</b> out of the notch so the feed housing <b>230</b> can be rotated out of the installed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In some aspects, a variety of features described herein can contribute to locking the feed housing <b>230</b> into the installed position in response to an installing rotation. For example, rotation can move cleats <b>213</b> relative to lips <b>215</b> along ramped surfaces so as to draw the feed housing <b>230</b> toward the mount plate <b>226</b> and increase a tightness of a seal between a ring <b>207</b> of the feed housing <b>230</b> and one or more features of the central boss <b>205</b> of the mount plate <b>226</b> (e.g., a taper and/or an O-ring), while the same rotation causes the retention mechanism <b>201</b> of the mount plate <b>226</b> to engage a the notch <b>203</b> on the feed housing <b>230</b>. However, such features can be included or omitted independently of one other. Other arrangements are also possible. For example, although <figref>FIGS. 6-9</figref> illustrate some features (such as cleats <b>213</b>) on the feed housing <b>230</b> and corresponding features (such as lips <b>215</b>) on the mount plate <b>226</b>, arrangements in which features are reversed between the feed housing <b>230</b> and the mount plate <b>226</b> are still within the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, although <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates three lips <b>215</b>, three corresponding cleats <b>213</b>, and one retention mechanism, any number of particular features may be utilized, including combinations in which multiple of one feature correspond to a common other feature (such as two cleats <b>213</b> engaging to a single lip <b>215</b>). Furthermore, although some features (such as the cleats <b>213</b> and the lips <b>215</b>) are shown as equally spaced apart in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, in some aspects features can be spaced apart by non-uniform amounts.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is an exploded assembly view illustrating a mount plate <b>326</b> and a feed housing <b>330</b> of another example of a mounting system <b>300</b> according to certain aspects. Similar to the mounting system <b>200</b> of <figref>FIGS. 5-9</figref>, the mounting system <b>300</b> can include a mount plate <b>326</b> with slots <b>311</b> and lips <b>315</b> for receiving cleats <b>313</b> of a feed housing <b>330</b>. In contrast to the mounting system <b>200</b>, the slots <b>311</b> and lips <b>315</b> in the mounting system <b>300</b> are arranged to receive cleats <b>313</b> having radial portions <b>323</b> that face away from a center of the feed housing <b>330</b>, rather than toward a center of the feed housing <b>330</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">
        <figref>FIG. 11</figref> is a partial view illustrating one of the cleats <b>313</b> and one of the lips <b>315</b> of the mounting system <b>300</b> of <figref>FIG. 10</figref> being aligned for mounting according to certain aspects. <figref>FIG. 12</figref> illustrates engagement of the cleat <b>313</b> and the lip <b>315</b> of <figref>FIGS. 10-11</figref> according to certain aspects. Rotating the feed housing <b>330</b> according to the arrow <b>327</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> can cause the radial portion <b>323</b> of the cleat <b>313</b> to rotate behind the lip <b>315</b>. A ramped surface on <b>329</b> on the cleat <b>313</b> (and/or on the lip <b>315</b>) can guide the feed housing <b>330</b> axially toward the mount plate <b>326</b>. In some aspects, each slot <b>311</b> can also be in fluid communication with a scupper <b>345</b> that provides an opening extending radially to an edge of the disk <b>309</b> so that at least a portion of the slot <b>311</b> is open in the radial direction. The scuppers <b>345</b> can provide an avenue for water to flow through to facilitate cleaning.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 13</figref> is an exploded assembly view illustrating a mounting plate <b>426</b> and a feed housing <b>430</b> of a further example of a mounting system <b>400</b> according to certain aspects. As may be appreciated with respect to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, in some aspects, a mounting plate <b>426</b> can include slots <b>411</b> or other features that extend into the mount plate <b>426</b> (e.g., rather than features such as the disk <b>309</b> of <figref>FIG. 10</figref> that extends out of the mount plate <b>336</b> or away from the rear of the mount plate <b>326</b>). Furthermore, in some aspects, a retention mechanism <b>401</b> may engage a notch <b>403</b> in a cleat <b>413</b> of the feed housing <b>430</b>. In some aspects, the feed housing <b>430</b> can also include a magnet <b>447</b> detectable by a sensor <b>449</b> in the mounting plate <b>426</b>. The sensor <b>449</b> may be configured to prevent rotation of a cutter (such as the cutter <b>128</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) when the magnet <b>447</b> is not detected due to the feed housing <b>430</b> not being secured in the installed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Other variations of mounting systems are within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, although several described mounting systems may utilize a feed housing that is rotated to engage a stationary mount plate, mounting systems may additionally or alternatively utilize a mount plate that is rotated to engage a stationary feed housing. In some aspects, a component that is rotated to cause engagement of the mount plate and the feed housing may be a subcomponent of the mount plate or the feed housing. For example, the mount plate may include a stationary central boss and a rotatable ring with lips or other features that lockingly engage cleats or other features of a feed housing as a result of the ring being rotated when the feed housing is aligned with the stationary central boss. Systems that utilize rotation to engage and/or secure the feed housing to the mount can provide advantages such as ease of installation and/or minimal amounts of alignment of features apart from the rotating movement. Additionally, although several described mounting systems may utilize relative rotation between a feed housing and a mount plate to cause engagement, mounting systems may additionally or alternatively utilize axial, lateral, and/or other relative translation to cause engagement. For example, the mount plate and/or the feed housing may include lips and/or cleats with sufficient flexibility and/or resilience (e.g., from the materials from which the lips and/or cleats are formed, and/or from complementary components utilized such hinges or biasing members) so as to flex around and/or shift into engagement with complementary features in response to the mount plate and/or the feed housing being pushing toward the other along an axis of rotation of the cutter.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view of a press chamber <b>166</b> according to certain aspects, and <figref>FIG. 15</figref> is a partial view of one side of the press chamber <b>166</b> of <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, illustrating a guide arm <b>150</b> relative to a vertical support <b>118</b> according to certain aspects. The guide arm <b>150</b> can be attached to the platen <b>146</b> and received in a recess <b>199</b> in the third vertical support <b>118</b>. The guide arm <b>150</b> can thus prevent rotation of the platen <b>146</b> when the platen <b>146</b> is being raised or lowered by the hydraulic press <b>142</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In some aspects, the press chamber <b>166</b> has a rectangular profile having four corners. The first vertical support <b>114</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>) can be positioned adjacent the first corner, the second vertical support <b>116</b> can be positioned adjacent the second corner, and the third vertical support <b>118</b> can be positioned between the third corner and the fourth corner. The first vertical support <b>114</b> and the second vertical support <b>116</b> can be aligned along opposite ends of the sidewall <b>176</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) of the press chamber <b>166</b>, and the third vertical support <b>118</b> can be positioned on an opposite side of the press chamber <b>166</b> from the sidewall and between the first vertical support <b>114</b> and the second vertical support <b>116</b>. Such an arrangement can increase an amount of access into the press chamber <b>166</b>, e.g., the press chamber <b>166</b> can be accessible from a lateral side from either side of the third vertical support <b>118</b>. Such an arrangement can provide greater access or easier access to the press chamber <b>166</b> for accessing or removing components therein. Although illustrated herein as a âtripodâ configuration with the first vertical support <b>114</b>, the second vertical support <b>116</b>, and the third vertical support <b>118</b>, other arrangements are possible. For example, in some embodiments, the first vertical support <b>114</b> and/or second vertical support <b>116</b> may each be replaced by two vertical supports supporting a motor mount. In some aspects, the third vertical support <b>118</b> is replaced with multiple vertical supports along an end of the juicer <b>100</b> (e.g., along the right end of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> or <b>3</b>, where the third vertical support <b>118</b> is illustrated.) Using the tripod configuration illustrated in the figures may provide a balance between sufficient strength and rigidity for functions of the juicer, and simplicity of manufacture or use as a result of greater access to the press chamber <b>166</b>.</p>
