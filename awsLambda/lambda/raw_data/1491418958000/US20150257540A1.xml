      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a support cushion and a method for converting a temperature difference within the same into an electric voltage. In particular, the present invention relates to support cushions, such as mattress assemblies, that make use of thermoelectric elements positioned and configured to convert a temperature difference within the same into an electric voltage.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">An aspect of successful and restful sleep is individual sleep comfort. Medical research suggests that sleep deprivation (âsleep debtâ) can have significant negative impacts on longevity, productivity, and overall mental, emotional, and physical health. Chronic sleep debt has been linked to weight gain and, more specifically, has been observed to not only affect the way the body processes and stores carbohydrates, but has also been observed to alter hormone levels that affect appetite. Moreover, sleep debt may result in irritability, impatience, inability to concentrate, and moodiness, which has led some researchers to suggest a link between sleep debt and worksite accidents, traffic incidents, and general afternoon inattentiveness. Furthermore, sleep disorders have been linked to hypertension, increased stress hormone levels, and irregular heartbeat, and additional research has recently suggested that a lack of sleep can affect immune function, resulting in increased susceptibility to illness and disease, e.g., cancer. In all, researchers have now suggested that sleep debt costs the United States $63 billion annually in lost productivity due to these various effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">To date, one strategy for improving sleep comfort and lowering individual sleep debt has been to incorporate various air-conditioning assemblies into support cushions, such as mattresses and the like. The incorporation of these air-conditioning assemblies into support cushions, however, has often required the use of noisy fans or other similar devices to distribute heated or cooled air toward or away from the support cushions, and has also required a significant amount of electrical power to operate the air-conditioning assemblies. Accordingly, a support cushion that improves sleep comfort and lowers individual sleep debt, without the use of noisy fans or other similar devices and without resulting in a significant consumption of energy, would be both highly desirable and beneficial.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention relates to support cushions and methods for controlling the surface temperature of a support cushion. In particular, the present invention relates to support cushions, such as mattress assemblies, that make use of thermoelectric elements positioned and configured to selectively heat or cool the surface of the support cushion, and that are capable of converting a temperature difference within the support cushion into an electric voltage. Thus, the support cushions of the present invention allow a user to individualize their level of comfort, including sleep comfort, by controlling the temperature of the surface of the support cushion, but also allow for the generation of an electrical voltage that can then be used to reduce the consumption of energy at a location, such as by providing power to the batteries of small electronics.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a support cushion is provided in the form of a mattress assembly that includes a body supporting portion having a first surface and a second surface that is opposite the first surface. The mattress assembly further includes a plurality of thermoelectric elements that are positioned and configured to selectively provide heating or cooling at the first surface of the body supporting portion. The mattress assembly also includes a heat dissipating portion that is comprised of a thermally-absorbent material and is operably connected to the thermoelectric elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The body supporting portion of the mattress assembly is generally comprised of a flexible foam for suitably distributing pressure from a user's body or portion thereof across the body supporting portion. In some embodiments, the flexible foam is a visco-elastic foam that has a desired density and hardness, and allows pressure to be absorbed uniformly and distributed evenly across the body supporting portion of the mattress assembly. In this regard, in certain embodiments, the body supporting portion can be further covered by a comfort portion or layer that is positioned atop the body supporting portion to provide a level of comfort to a body of a user or a portion thereof that is resting on the mattress assembly. Such a comfort support portion, in certain embodiments, is also comprised of a visco-elastic foam or other foam, but typically has a density less than that of the body supporting portion of the mattress assembly so as to provide a softer surface on which to rest, and so as to provide a sufficiently, soft barrier between the body of a user and the thermoelectric elements of the mattress assembly, as described in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">With respect to the thermoelectric elements of the mattress assembly, the thermoelectric elements are positioned in the mattress assembly and are configured to allow a user to control the temperature of the first (or upper) surface of the body supporting portion of the mattress assembly. For example, in certain embodiments, the thermoelectric elements are comprised of a plurality of Peltier elements that, upon flowing an amount of electrical current in a first direction through the Peltier elements, cool the first surface of the body supporting portion by drawing heat away from the first surface and toward the second surface of the body supporting portion. Similarly, in certain embodiments, upon flowing an amount of electrical current in a second (e.g., opposite) direction through the Peltier elements, the Peltier elements heat the first surface of the body supporting portion by drawing heat away from the second surface of the body supporting portion and toward the first surface of the body supporting portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">To further take advantage of the heating and cooling capabilities of the Peltier elements, in certain embodiments, the Peltier elements are arranged in a series, such that the Peltier elements are arranged one after another and are capable of providing heating or cooling across the entire surface of the body supporting portion or a desired portion thereof. In other embodiments, the Peltier elements are arranged in an array, such that a group of Peltier elements can be positioned on a desired area of the body supporting portion and used to selectively heat or cool an area of the body supporting portion that would be in contact with a particular portion of the body of a user that is prone to excessive heating (e.g., the torso or head of a user). In some embodiments, to provide a greater amount of control over the selective heating and cooling of the first surface of the body supporting portion, the Peltier elements are comprised of discrete Peltier elements, are individually addressable, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">To facilitate the heating and cooling of the first surface of body supporting portion, each Peltier element typically spans the width of the body supporting portion of the mattress assembly, such that a first side of each Peltier element is positioned above or adjacent to the first surface of the body supporting portion and the opposite side of each Peltier element is positioned below or adjacent to the second surface of the body supporting portion. In these embodiments, the body supporting portion includes a plurality of columnar voids that each include a portion of the Peltier elements that are transmitting heat from one surface of the body supporting surface to the other. Thus, in certain embodiments, the Peltier elements are positioned adjacent to the body supporting portion and are directly transferring heat from one surface of the body supporting portion, through the interior of the body supporting portion, and to the other surface of the body supporting portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In addition to being configured to selectively heat or cool the first surface of the body supporting portion, the thermoelectric elements are also operably connected to a heat dissipating portion of the mattress assembly that is comprised of a thermally absorbent material. In some embodiments, the heat dissipating portion of the mattress assembly is comprised of an elastomeric gelatinous material that encases at least a portion of the Peltier elements adjacent to or near the second surface of the body supporting portion. By operably connecting the Peltier elements to the heat dissipating portion, the heat dissipating portion provides, in addition to structural support for the Peltier elements, a thermal dump or heat sink into which heat can be dissipated when the first surface of the body supporting portion is being cooled. Alternatively, when the first surface of the body supporting portion is being heated, the heat dissipating portion can also be used as a source of heat by transferring any collected heat in the heat dissipating portion to the first surface of the body supporting portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In some embodiments of the present invention, the heat dissipating portion is comprised of a substantially uniform layer of elastomeric gelatinous material. Such a substantially uniform layer of elastomeric gelatinous material is, in certain embodiments, used to cover the entirety of the second surface of the body supporting portion. In other embodiments that make use of an elastomeric gelatinous material, the heat dissipating portion is comprised of a plurality of three-dimensional blocks of elastomeric gelatinous material. In these embodiments, the three-dimensional blocks can be spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent blocks of elastomeric gelatinous material, but are typically positioned adjacent to one or more of the plurality of Peltier elements to thereby provide individual heat sinks for each Peltier element, as opposed to providing a heat sink in the form of a continuous layer of elastomeric gelatinous material that is in contact with each of the Peltier elements included in the mattress assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In yet further embodiments of the present invention, the heat dissipating portions are comprised of a thermally absorbent material that does not include an elastomeric gelatinous material. In one such embodiment, the heat dissipating portion is comprised of a fluid layer that, like the substantially uniform layer of elastomeric gelatinous material, is capable of serving as a heat sink when the first surface of the body supporting portion is being cooled, and is capable of acting as a source of stored heat when the first surface of the body supporting portion is to be heated. In other embodiments, the heat dissipating portion is comprised of a flexible foam that includes a plurality of cells having a reticulated cellular structure and that is operably connected to the Peltier elements such that the heat that is transferred from the first surface of the body supporting portion is transferred into the reticulated cellular structure. Upon transferring heat into the reticulated cellular structure, the heat can then be transferred out of the heat dissipating portion by conveying an amount of air through the reticulated cellular structure of the heat dissipating portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In certain embodiments of the mattress assemblies that make use of a reticulated cellular structure in the heat dissipating portion, the air is conveyed through the heat dissipating portion, at least in part, by including an inlet port and an outlet port in the heat dissipating portion to thereby provide a route through which air can flow into, through, and out of the heat dissipating portion. Moreover, in some embodiments, the heat can be forced to only flow through and out of certain portions of the heat dissipating layer by including a seal (i.e., a skin) that covers the outer surface of the heat dissipating portion. In such embodiments, the seal is used to effectively trap the heat in the heat dissipating portion until it is removed by conveying air through the reticulated cellular structure of the heat dissipating portion, such as by making use of inlet and outlet ports placed into the seal, by operably connecting fans to the heat dissipating portion to disperse the heat away, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Regardless of the materials used for the heat dissipating portion, each mattress assembly of the present invention further includes a power supply for supplying electrical current to the plurality of thermoelectric elements, and a controller for controlling the electrical current that is supplied to the plurality of thermoelectric elements. By including a controller in the mattress assemblies, the amount of electrical current supplied to the thermoelectric elements can be controlled to provide a desired amount of heating or cooling to the first surface of the body supporting portion. For example, in certain embodiments, the controller is configured to automatically control the electrical current supplied to Peltier elements, such that the electrical current can be supplied to the Peltier elements in a particular direction to heat or cool the first surface of the body supporting portion when the first surface of the body supporting portion reaches a particular temperature. As another example, the controller, in some embodiments, is configured to allow the electrical current to be supplied to the Peltier elements for a predetermined time period, such as for an 8-hour sleeping period or for a length of time that corresponds to the time a user usually spends in a specific stage of the sleep cycle (e.g., REM sleep).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">To provide an additional level of control over the thermoelectric elements included in the mattress assemblies of the present invention, in certain embodiments, the mattress assemblies further include one or more features that are operably connected to the body supporting portion, the heat dissipating portion, or both of the mattress assembly and provide input to the controller. Such features include, in some embodiments, pressure sensors that provide pressure feedback to the controller and allow the controller to automatically begin heating or cooling the mattress assembly when a user lies on the mattress or otherwise places an amount of pressure on the mattress assembly. In other embodiments, temperature sensors are included in an exemplary mattress assembly and provide temperature feedback to the controller to allow the controller to selectively heat or cool the first surface of the body supporting portion in response to received temperature feedback and to maintain a desired temperature. Such desired temperature or pressure feedback settings are, in certain embodiments, directly inputted or adjusted at the controller itself or, in other embodiments, can be transmitted to the controller from a remote control that is also operably connected to the controller and allows a user to remotely adjust the first surface of the body supporting portion to a desired temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">To further obtain some of the benefits associated with incorporating a plurality of thermoelectric elements into a mattress assembly, in some embodiments, the thermoelectric elements incorporated into the mattress assembly are positioned and configured to convert a temperature difference between the body supporting portion and the heat dissipating portion into an electric voltage at a charging port. Such an embodiment has essentially the same structural configuration as the embodiments described above, with the substitution of the charging port in lieu of the controller, power supply, or both. The charging port is operably connected to the thermoelectric elements such that, when a temperature difference exists between the body supporting portion and the heat dissipating portion, an electric voltage is generated at the charging port, which can then be used to charge a battery (e.g., a battery of an electronic device such as a cellular telephone, portable music player, alarm clock, portable computing device, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">As an additional refinement to the mattress assemblies of the present invention, in some embodiments, mattress assemblies are provided that include additional features to further increase the comfort and convenience of the user of the mattress assembly. For example, as described above, each of the mattress assemblies of the present invention generally includes at least two portions or layers, namely a body supporting portion or layer and a heat dissipating portion or layer. In some embodiments, however, additional layers are incorporated into the mattress assemblies to provide an increased level of comfort, to provide additional support for the mattress assemblies, or both. For instance, in certain embodiments, a base portion or layer is included in the mattress assembly to provide support to the body supporting portion, the heat dissipating portion, or both. In some embodiments, the base portion is adjustable to allow a user to place the mattress assembly into one or more desired ergonomic positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">With further regard to the support cushions of the present invention, an exemplary support cushion can also be used as part of a method of controlling a surface temperature of a support cushion. In some implementations, a method of controlling the surface temperature of a support cushion includes first providing a support cushion having a body supporting portion, a heat dissipating portion comprised of an elastomeric gelatinous material, and a plurality of Peltier elements positioned in the support cushion and operably connected to the body supporting portion and the heat dissipating portion. Electrical current is then supplied to the plurality of Peltier elements, such that when electrical current is supplied in a first direction, the surface temperature of the body supporting portion decreases, or such that when electrical current is supplied in a second direction, the surface temperature of the body supporting portion increases. Any heat generated by supplying electrical current to the plurality of Peltier elements is subsequently dissipated into the heat dissipating portion that, by virtue of the elastomeric gelatinous material, acts as a thermal dump or heat sink and allows the body supporting portion to be cooled without the use of fans or other similarly noisy devices that are commonly used to dissipate heat away from a support cushion and into the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Further features and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those of ordinary skill in the art after a study of the description, figures, and non-limiting examples in this document.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The present invention relates to support cushions, methods for controlling the surface temperature of a support cushion, and methods for converting a temperature difference within a support cushion into an electric voltage. In particular, the present invention relates to support cushions, such as mattress assemblies, that include a plurality of thermoelectric elements operably connected to a heat dissipating portion that is comprised of a thermally absorbent material. The support cushions of the present invention allow a user to control the temperature of the surface of the support cushion without also requiring the use of a fan or similar device to dissipate heated or cooled air generated by the thermoelectric elements away from the support cushion and into the surrounding atmosphere. Furthermore, by making use of thermoelectric elements in the support cushions, the thermoelectric elements can be positioned in the support cushion and configured to convert a temperature difference into an electric voltage that can then be used to power small electronics. Thus, the support cushions of the present invention not only allow a user to individualize their level of comfort, including sleep comfort, by controlling the temperature of the surface of the support cushion without making use of fans or other similar devices, but also allow a user to reduce their consumption of electrical power by advantageously converting a temperature difference within the support cushion into an electrical voltage.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Referring first to <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, in one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a support cushion in the form of a mattress assembly <b>10</b> is provided that includes a body supporting portion <b>20</b> having a first surface <b>22</b>, which is generally an upper surface of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, and a second surface <b>24</b>, which is generally the lower surface of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and is opposite the first surface <b>22</b>. The mattress assembly <b>10</b> further includes a plurality of thermoelectric elements in the form of Peltier elements <b>30</b> that are positioned in the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and are configured to selectively provide heating or cooling at the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. Also included in the mattress assembly <b>10</b> is a heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> that is comprised of a thermally-absorbent material and is operably connected to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> is generally comprised of a continuous layer of flexible foam for suitably distributing pressure from a user's body or portion thereof across the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. Such flexible foams include, but are not limited to, latex foam, reticulated or non-reticulated visco-elastic foam (sometimes referred to as memory foam or low-resilience foam), reticulated or non-reticulated non-visco-elastic foam, polyurethane high-resilience foam, expanded polymer foams (e.g., expanded ethylene vinyl acetate, polypropylene, polystyrene, or polyethylene), and the like. In the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the body supporting portion <b>20</b> is comprised of a visco-elastic foam that has a low resilience as well as a sufficient density and hardness, which allows pressure to be absorbed uniformly and distributed evenly across the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>. Generally, such visco-elastic foams have a hardness of at least about 10 N to no greater than about 80 N, as measured by exerting pressure from a plate against a sample of the material to a compression of at least 40% of an original thickness of the material at approximately room temperature (i.e., 21Â° C. to 23Â° C.), where the 40% compression is held for a set period of time as established by the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 2439 hardness measuring standard. In some embodiments, the visco-elastic foam has a hardness of about 10 N, about 20 N, about 30 N, about 40 N, about 50 N, about 60 N, about 70 N, or about 80 N to provide a desired degree of comfort and body-conforming qualities.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The visco-elastic foam described herein for use in the mattress assembly <b>10</b> can also have a density that assists in providing a desired degree of comfort and body-conforming qualities, as well as an increased degree of material durability. In some embodiments, the density of the visco-elastic foam used in the body supporting portion <b>20</b> has a density of no less than about 30 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to no greater than about 150 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. In some embodiments, the density of the visco-elastic foam used in the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> is about 30 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 40 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 50 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 60 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 70 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 80 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 90 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 110 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 120 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 130 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, about 140 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, or about 150 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Of course, the selection of a visco-elastic foam having a particular density will affect other characteristics of the foam, including its hardness, the manner in which the foam responds to pressure, and the overall feel of the foam, but it is appreciated that a visco-elastic foam having a desired density and hardness can readily be selected for a particular application or mattress assembly as desired. Additionally, it is appreciated that the body supporting portions of the mattress assemblies need not be comprised of a continuous layer of flexible foam at all, but can also take the form of more traditional mattresses, including spring-based mattresses, without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring still to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> is further covered by a comfort portion or layer <b>70</b> that is positioned atop the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and provides a level of comfort to a body of a user or a portion of thereof that is resting on the mattress assembly <b>10</b>. The comfort layer <b>70</b> can also be comprised of a visco-elastic foam. However, the comfort layer <b>70</b> typically has a density, hardness, or both that is less than that of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>, such that the comfort layer <b>70</b> provides a softer surface on which to rest the body of a user or a portion thereof, while also providing a sufficiently soft barrier between the body of a user and the Peltier elements <b>30</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>, as described in further detail below. For example, in certain embodiments, the mattress assembly <b>10</b> includes a body supporting portion <b>20</b> that is comprised of visco-elastic foam with a density of about 80 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and a hardness of about 13 N, while the comfort layer is comprised of a visco-elastic foam with a density of about 35 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and a hardness of about 10 N.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Regardless of the particular densities of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and the comfort layer <b>70</b>, the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and the comfort layer <b>70</b> are generally secured to one another to prevent the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and the comfort layer <b>70</b> from moving relative to one another during use. Various means of securing one layer of material to another can be used in this regard, including tape, hook and loop fasteners, conventional fasteners, stitches, and the like. In one particular embodiment, the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and the comfort layer <b>70</b> are bonded together by an adhesive or cohesive bonding material to create a substantially continuous assembly where the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and the comfort layer <b>70</b> are fully adhered to one another. Such adhesive bonding materials include, for example, environmentally-friendly, water based adhesives, like SABA AQUABOND RSD, a two-component water-based adhesive product produced by SABA DINXPERLO BV, B-7090 AA, Dinxperlo, Belgium.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">With further regard to the body supporting portion <b>20</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the body supporting portion <b>20</b> generally has a composition different than that of the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>, as is described in further detail below, but it is additionally contemplated that an exemplary body supporting portion can be further comprised of one or more different or additional layers having various densities and hardnesses. For instance, it is contemplated that a layer of high-resilience polyurethane foam can be secured to the second surface of a layer of low-resilience visco-elastic foam used in a body supporting portion. Such multi-layered body supporting portions are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,469,437; 7,507,468; 8,025,964; and 8,034,445, as well as in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0252562, each of which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Turning now to the thermoelectric elements included in the support cushions of the present invention, various thermoelectric elements can be incorporated into a support cushion and used to heat or cool a surface of an exemplary support cushion, including resistive heaters that convert electrical energy to heat, as well as other thermoelectric elements. In the exemplary mattress assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, and as indicated above, the thermoelectric elements are Peltier elements <b>30</b> that are positioned in the mattress assembly <b>10</b> and are configured to allow a user to control the temperature of the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>, which can then change the temperature of the comfort layer <b>70</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> by virtue of the proximity of the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> to the comfort layer <b>70</b>. The Peltier elements <b>30</b>, which may also be referred to as Peltier devices, Peltier heaters or heat pumps, solid-state refrigerators or thermoelectric heat pumps, are solid-state active heat pumps which transfer heat from one side of body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> to the other side of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> by flowing an amount of electrical current through the Peltier elements <b>30</b> to produce a Peltier effect or, in other words, the presence of heat at an electrified junction of two different metals.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In the Peltier elements <b>30</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the junctions of two different metals are in the form of a n-type semiconductor or element <b>32</b> and a p-type semiconductor or element <b>34</b>. In these Peltier elements <b>30</b>, when an amount of electrical current flows in a first direction through the n-type element <b>32</b>, crosses a metallic interconnect <b>33</b>, and passes into the p-type element <b>34</b>, a Peltier effect is created whereby electrons in the n-type elements <b>32</b> move in the opposite direction of the current and holes in the p-type element <b>34</b> move in the direction of current, such that both remove heat from the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> toward the second surface <b>24</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. Similarly, with the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, upon flowing an amount of electrical current in a second (e.g., opposite) direction through the Peltier elements <b>30</b> and the n-type elements <b>32</b> and p-type elements <b>34</b>, the Peltier effect can be reversed, and the Peltier elements <b>30</b> can be used to heat the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> by drawing heat away from the second surface <b>24</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and toward the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, to facilitate the heating and cooling of the first surface <b>22</b> of body supporting portion <b>20</b>, the Peltier elements <b>30</b> substantially span the width of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> such that an upper portion <b>31</b> of each of the Peltier elements <b>30</b> is positioned above and adjacent to the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, and the metallic interconnects <b>33</b> of the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are positioned below and adjacent to the second surface <b>24</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. To allow the Peltier elements <b>30</b> to pass through the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, the body supporting, portion <b>20</b> includes a plurality of columnar voids <b>26</b> where parts of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> have been removed to allow a portion of the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, including the n-type elements <b>32</b> and the p-type elements <b>34</b> to be positioned in and pass through the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and allow heat to be transferred from one surface of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> to the other. In other words, and as best shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are positioned adjacent to the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and direct transfer heat from one surface of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and through the body supporting portion <b>20</b> to the other surface of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref>, to further take advantage of the heating and cooling capabilities of the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are arranged in a series, where the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are arranged one after another to provide substantially uniform and continuous heating or cooling across the entire first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> or a portion thereof. In this regard, and as best shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are further arranged in arrays <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>c</i>, <b>35</b><i>d</i>, such that groupings of Peltier elements <b>30</b> are positioned on certain areas of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> and used to selectively heat or cool an area of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. Each such area would be in contact with a particular portion of the body of a user that is prone to excessive heating or cooling (e.g., the torso or head of a user vs. the legs of a user). For example, and as described in further detail below, in some embodiments, the arrays <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>c</i>, <b>35</b><i>d </i>of Peltier elements <b>30</b> are individually addressable such that it is possible to cool the arrays <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>c </i>that would be in contact with the torso or head of a user lying in a supine or prone position, while heating the arrays <b>35</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>d </i>that would be in proximity to the legs of a user lying in a supine or prone position. Of course, to provide a greater amount of control over the selective heating and cooling of the first surface <b>22</b>, individual rows or columns of the Peltier elements <b>30</b> in the arrays <b>35</b><i>a</i>, <b>35</b><i>b</i>, <b>35</b><i>c</i>, <b>35</b><i>d </i>can also be individually addressable such that more specific portions of the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> can be selectively heated and cooled to allow a particular portion of a user's body to be heated or cooled, or to allow only the Peltier elements <b>30</b> that are in closest contact with the body of a user to be selectively heated or cooled (e.g., when a user is lying on their side). Likewise, although not shown in <figref>FIGS. 2-4</figref>, it is also appreciated that the Peltier elements used in the mattress assemblies of the present invention can be provided in the form of discrete Peltier elements that are not connected to one another in a series, so as to provide an even greater amount of control over the heating and cooling of the first surface of a body supporting portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, in addition to being configured to selectively heat or cool the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, the Peltier elements <b>30</b> are also operably connected to the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b>. Such a heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> is comprised of a thermally absorbent material. More particularly, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b>, the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> is comprised of a substantially uniform layer of elastomeric gelatinous material that is secured to and covers the entirety of the second surface <b>24</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. The elastomeric gelatinous material of the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> also encases the metallic interconnects <b>33</b> of the Peltier elements <b>30</b> near the second surface <b>24</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. In this regard, by operably connecting the Peltier elements <b>30</b> to the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b>, the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> provides, in addition to structural support for the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, a thermal dump or heat sink into which heat can be dissipated when the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> is being cooled. Alternatively, when the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> is being heated, the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> can also be used as a source of heat by transferring any collected heat in the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> from the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> to the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>. As such, the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b> allows, at least in part, the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> of the mattress assembly <b>10</b> to be selectively heated and cooled without requiring a fan or other similar device to vent the heat byproducts of the Peltier effect into the surrounding atmosphere, and without also requiring a separate heat source to supply heat to the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As a refinement, in another embodiment of the present invention that makes use of an elastomeric gelatinous material as a thermal dump or heat sink, and referring now to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary mattress assembly <b>110</b> is provided that includes a comfort layer <b>170</b>, a body supporting portion <b>120</b> having a first surface <b>122</b> and a second surface <b>124</b>, a plurality of Peltier elements <b>130</b>, and a heat dissipating portion <b>140</b> that includes an elastomeric gelatinous material. Unlike the mattress assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, however, the elastomeric gelatinous material included in the heat dissipating layer <b>140</b> is not in the form of a substantially continuous layer, but is instead in the form of three-dimensional blocks <b>142</b> of elastomeric gelatinous material. Each of the blocks <b>142</b> of elastomeric gelatinous material can be spaced at a predetermined distance from adjacent blocks <b>142</b>, but are, in generally positioned such that the blocks <b>142</b> each encase the metallic interconnects <b>133</b> of the Peltier elements <b>130</b> and thereby provide individualized heat sinks for the Peltier elements <b>130</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Heat dissipating portions having various other configurations or comprised of various other materials that are capable of serving as a heat sink when the first surface of an exemplary body supporting portion is being cooled and that are also capable of acting as a source of heat when the first surface of a body supporting portion is being heated, such fluid layers and the like, can also be included in a mattress assembly or other support cushion made in accordance with the present invention. For example, as another refinement to the heat dissipating portion of the mattress assemblies of the present invention, and referring now to <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, an exemplary mattress assembly <b>610</b> is provided that includes a comfort layer <b>670</b>, a body supporting portion <b>620</b> having a first surface <b>622</b> and a second surface <b>624</b>, a plurality of Peltier elements <b>630</b>, each of which is positioned in a columnar void <b>626</b> of the body supporting portion <b>620</b>, and a heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>. Unlike the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>, however, the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> is not comprised of an elastomeric gelatinous material, but is comprised of a flexible foam that includes a plurality of cells having a reticulated cellular structure and that is operably connected to the Peltier elements <b>630</b>, such that the heat that from the first surface <b>622</b> of the body supporting portion <b>620</b> can be transferred into the reticulated cellular structure of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Reticulated foam (visco-elastic or otherwise) is a cellular foam structure in which the cells of the foam are essentially skeletal. In other words, the cells of the reticulated foam are each defined by a plurality of apertured windows surrounded by cell struts, where the cell windows of reticulated foam can be entirely absent (leaving only the cell struts) or substantially missing. In some embodiments, the foam is considered âreticulatedâ if at least 50% of the windows of the cells are missing (i.e., windows having apertures therethrough, or windows that are completely missing and therefore leaving only the cell struts). Such structures can be created by destruction or other removal of cell window material, by chemical or mechanical means, or by preventing the complete formation of cell windows during the manufacturing process of the foam.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Regardless of the manufacturing process used to produce the reticulated foam, reticulated foam, by virtue of its reticulated cellular structure, has characteristics that are well suited for use in the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> of the mattress assembly <b>610</b>, including the enhanced ability to permit fluid movement through the reticulated foam and, consequently, the ability to provide enhanced air and/or heat movement within, through, and away from the body supporting portion <b>620</b> and the comfort layer <b>670</b> of the mattress assembly <b>610</b>. In this regard, by encasing the metallic interconnects <b>633</b> in the reticulated foam of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>, the heat that is transferred to the heat dissipating layer <b>640</b> by the Peltier elements <b>630</b> as part of the cooling of the first surface <b>622</b> of the body supporting portion <b>620</b> is allowed to easily disperse throughout the reticulated foam of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>. Upon transferring heat into the reticulated cellular structures, the heat can then easily be transferred out of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> by conveying an amount of air through the reticulated cellular structure of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">To assist in conveying air through the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> of the mattress assembly <b>610</b>, in one exemplary embodiment and referring still to <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> includes an inlet port <b>690</b> and an outlet port <b>692</b> that are included in the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> to provide a route through which air can flow through the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>. Moreover, in the mattress assembly <b>610</b>, the heat that is transferred into the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> from the Peltier elements <b>630</b> during the cooling of the first surface <b>622</b> of the body supporting portion <b>620</b> can be forced to only flow out of certain portions of the heat dissipating layer by the inclusion of a seal <b>645</b> (i.e., a skin) that covers the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> and effectively traps the heat in the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> and prevents it from flowing back into the body supporting portion <b>620</b>. By including the seal <b>645</b>, the heat can then only be removed by conveying air through the reticulated cellular structure of the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b>, either by making use of the inlet port <b>690</b> and outlet port <b>692</b> that are cut into the seal <b>645</b>, by making use of a fan <b>680</b> that is operably connected to the outlet port <b>692</b>, or both. Such a seal <b>645</b> can created by making use of a poured flexible foam where the foam is produced by pouring its components into a mold and allowing them to set. Of course, various other skins or seals, such as seals that are comprised of nylon polyurethane materials and are commonly used as mattress covers, may also be used as seals or outer coverings for the heat dissipating portion <b>640</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>12</b>, regardless of the materials used for the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b>, each mattress assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> of the present invention further includes a power supply <b>52</b>, <b>152</b>, <b>652</b> for supplying electrical current to the plurality of Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b>, as well as a controller <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> for controlling the electrical current that is supplied to the plurality of Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b>. By including a controller <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> in the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b>, the amount of electrical current supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> can be controlled to provide a desired amount of heating or cooling to the first surface <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of each mattress assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b>. For example, the controller <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can be configured to automatically control the electrical current supplied to Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b>, such that electrical current can be supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> to heat or cool the first surface <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of each body supporting portion <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> when the first surface <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> reaches a particular temperature, such as after a user has been lying on the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> for an extended period of time. As another example, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can also be configured to allow the electrical current to be supplied to the Peltier elements for a predetermined time period, such as for an 8-hour sleeping period.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">As yet another example, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can further be configured to supply electrical current to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> in a manner that corresponds to a user's sleep rhythms. For instance, it is appreciated that during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, a user generally loses at least some of their ability to control the temperature of his or her body. As such, in certain embodiments, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can be configured to begin cooling the first surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> at a time during the course of a night's sleep when a user would generally be in REM sleep. Alternatively, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can further be operably connected to a device that monitors sleep rhythms, such as, for example, the ZEO SLEEP MANAGERâ¢ manufactured by ZEO, Newton, Mass., such that the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can be configured to provide electrical current to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> upon receiving input that the user lying on the mattress assembly <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> has entered a particular stage of the sleep cycle (e.g., REM sleep).</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In addition to providing control over the amount of current that is being supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b>, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> of the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> further allow the direction of the electrical current being supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> to be controlled. In this regard, the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b> can be used to alter the direction of the electrical current being supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> to either selectively heat or cool the first surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> of the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b>, but can further be configured to dissipate heat from the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b> of the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> after an extended period of cooling the first surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b>. For instance, after an overnight period of cooling the first surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b>, a significant amount of heat will have been transferred to the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b> of the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b>. As such, to dissipate that heat and release it from the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b>, the direction of the electrical current being supplied to the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> can be reversed, and the heat in the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b> can be transferred from the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b> to the first surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>622</b> of the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b> and released into the surrounding atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">To provide an additional level of control over the Peltier elements <b>30</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>630</b> included in the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> of the present invention, the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> can further include one or more features that are operably connected to the body supporting portions <b>20</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>620</b>, the heat dissipating portions <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>640</b>, or both of the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>610</b> and provide input to the controllers <b>50</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>650</b>. For example, and referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the mattress assembly <b>10</b> includes pressure sensors <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>that provide pressure feedback to the controller <b>50</b> in response to a user resting upon the first surface <b>22</b> of the body supporting portion <b>20</b> to thereby allow the controller <b>50</b> to automatically begin providing electrical current and heating or cooling the mattress assembly <b>10</b> as soon as the user lies on the mattress assembly <b>10</b> or otherwise places an amount of pressure on the mattress assembly <b>10</b>.

Such desired temperature or pressure feedback settings are, in certain embodiments, directly inputted or adjusted at the controller <b>50</b> itself or, in other embodiments, are transmitted to the controller <b>50</b> from a remote control <b>500</b> that includes temperature control buttons <b>510</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, and that is also operably connected to the controller <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As a further refinement to the use of thermoelectric elements in accordance with the present invention, in some embodiments, the thermoelectric elements of the support cushions can be used not only to selectively heat and cool the support cushion, but can further be used to convert thermal energy into electrical energy. Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, in another exemplary embodiment, a support cushion <b>710</b> includes a plurality of Peltier elements <b>730</b> that are positioned in a body supporting portion <b>720</b> and are configured to convert a temperature difference between the body supporting portion <b>720</b> and a heat dissipating portion <b>740</b> into an electric voltage at a charging port <b>711</b>. The support cushion <b>710</b> has essentially the same structural configuration of body supporting portion <b>720</b>, heat dissipating portion <b>740</b>, and Peltier elements <b>730</b> as the embodiments described above, and it should be understood that the detailed description of the basic structural configuration of the above embodiments applies equally to the support cushion <b>710</b>, where similar elements are identified according to a corresponding labeling convention (e.g., <b>20</b>-<b>720</b>, <b>22</b>-<b>722</b>, <b>24</b>-<b>724</b>, etc.). Notably, however, the support cushion <b>710</b> further includes the charging port <b>711</b> operably connected to the Peltier elements <b>730</b> such that when a temperature difference exists between the body supporting portion <b>720</b> and the heat dissipating portion <b>740</b>, thermal energy from the body supporting portion <b>720</b> drives electrons in the n-type element <b>732</b> toward the cooler heat dissipating portion <b>740</b>, which creates a current while holes in the p-type element <b>734</b> flow in the direction of the current and an electric voltage is subsequently generated at the charging port <b>711</b>. The electric voltage at the charging port <b>711</b> can then be used to charge a battery (e.g., a battery of an electronic device such as a cellular telephone, portable music player, alarm clock, portable computing device, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Referring more specifically now to <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic diagram of a circuit of the exemplary support cushion <b>710</b>, where an electric voltage is generated at terminals <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> of the charging port <b>711</b>, and where a Seebeck effect is created by the circuit. The Seebeck effect is the conversion of temperature differences directly into electricity caused by charge-carrier diffusion and phonon drag when conductors or semi-conductors having different thermal properties are connected. Of course, it is understood that the Seebeck effect illustrated in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, with the âapplied heatâ and the âhot-to-coldâ directional indicators resulting in the current flow and voltage shown, could easily be reversed. In this regard, it is possible that the thermal energy stored in a heat dissipating portion of a support cushion of the present invention, such as the thermal energy that is created and stored following an extended period of cooling at the first surface of the body supporting portion, could be converted to an electrical voltage and subsequently used to charge a battery.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">As yet another refinement to the mattress assemblies of the present invention, the mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b> further include a base portion or layer <b>60</b>, <b>160</b> that provides support to the body supporting portion <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> and the heat dissipating portion <b>40</b>, <b>140</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>12</b>. In a further exemplary embodiment, however, and referring now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, a mattress assembly <b>210</b> is provided that includes additional features in the base layer <b>260</b> to increase the comfort and convenience of the user of the mattress assembly <b>210</b>. Like the mattress assemblies shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>12</b>, the mattress assembly <b>210</b> includes a comfort layer <b>270</b>, a body supporting portion <b>220</b> having a first surface <b>222</b> and a second surface <b>224</b>, a plurality of Peltier elements <b>230</b> operably connected to a controller <b>250</b> and a power supply <b>252</b>, and a heat dissipating layer <b>240</b>. The base portion or layer <b>260</b> that provides support to the body supporting portion <b>220</b> and the heat dissipating portion <b>240</b>, however, is adjustable to allow a user to place the mattress assembly <b>210</b> into one or more desired ergonomic positions. Additionally, included in the base portion <b>260</b> of the mattress assembly <b>210</b> are two fans <b>280</b><i>a</i>, <b>280</b><i>b </i>that are operably connected to heat dissipating portion <b>240</b> and are capable of assisting in dissipating heat generated as a result of the Peltier effect to thereby supplement the heat capturing properties of the heat dissipating portion <b>240</b> and provide greater control over the selective heating and cooling of the first surface <b>222</b> of the body supporting portion <b>220</b>. In some embodiments, the base layer <b>260</b> and fans <b>280</b><i>a</i>, <b>280</b><i>b </i>can be adjusted or utilized by changing the settings of the base layer <b>260</b> or fans <b>280</b><i>a</i>, <b>280</b><i>b </i>directly on the controller <b>250</b> or, alternatively, can be adjusted or utilized by making use of base layer and fan control buttons <b>520</b> on the remote control <b>500</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">As an even further refinement to the present invention, although the support cushions shown in <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b> are in the form of mattress assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>610</b>, <b>710</b>, and are dimensionally sized to support a user lying in a supine or prone position, it is contemplated that the features described herein are equally applicable to head pillows, seat cushions, seat backs, neck pillows, leg spacer pillows, mattress topers, overlays, and the like. As such, the phrase âbody supportâ or âbody supportingâ is used herein to refer to any and all such objects having any size or shape, and that are capable of or are generally used to support the body of a user or a portion thereof. For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in an additional exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a support cushion in the form a contoured neck pillow <b>310</b> is provided that includes a comfort layer <b>370</b>, a head and neck supporting layer <b>320</b>, a plurality of Peltier elements <b>330</b> operably connected to a controller <b>350</b> and a power supply <b>352</b>, and a heat dissipating portion <b>340</b> to assist in the selective heating and cooling of the supporting layer <b>320</b> and the comfort layer <b>370</b>. Similarly, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> and as another example, support cushions made in accordance with the present invention are incorporated into the seat <b>412</b> and the back <b>414</b> of a desk chair <b>410</b>. Each support cushion of the desk chair <b>410</b> includes a comfort layer <b>470</b>, a body supporting layer <b>420</b>, a plurality of Peltier elements <b>430</b> operably connected to a controller <b>450</b> and a power supply <b>452</b>, and a heat dissipating portion <b>440</b> to assist in the selective heating and cooling of the seat <b>412</b> and the back <b>414</b> of the desk chair <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">Each of the exemplary support cushions described herein can also be used as part of a method of controlling a surface temperature of a support cushion. In some implementations, a method of controlling the surface temperature of a support cushion includes first providing a support cushion of the present invention. Electrical current is then supplied to the plurality of Peltier elements, such that when electrical current is supplied in a first direction, the surface temperature of the body supporting portion decreases, but when electrical current is supplied in a second direction, the surface temperature of the body supporting portion increases. Then, any heat generated by supplying electrical current to the plurality of Peltier elements is dissipated into the heat dissipating portion that acts as a thermal dump or heat sink to allow the body supporting portion to be cooled without the use of fans or other similarly noisy devices to dissipate the heat into away from the support cushion and into the surrounding atmosphere. In some embodiments, heat is further dissipated away from the heat dissipating portion by conveying air through the heat dissipating portion and/or by activating one or more fans operably connected to the heat dissipating portion to thereby dissipate heat away from the heat dissipating portion. In some embodiments, the surface temperature of the support cushion is controlled by first receiving feedback from a temperature or pressure sensor positioned in the body supporting portion of the support cushions, and then supplying electrical current to a plurality of Peltier elements incorporated into the support cushion, either in a first or second direction, based on the feedback received from the temperature sensor, the pressure sensor, or both.</p>
