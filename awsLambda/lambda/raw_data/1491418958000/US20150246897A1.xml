      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to new, improved steps in manufacturing processes for pyrimidine derivatives, to intermediates thereof and to the manufacturing of intermediates. The present invention is directed to improved processes for manufacturing 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine (Compound A, see below), the monohydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine and intermediates thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">WO 2007/084786 (priority date: Jan. 20, 2006) describes certain pyrimidine derivatives having phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (hereinafter referred to as âPI3Kâ) inhibiting properties, their use as pharmaceuticals and manufacturing processes thereof. One pyrimidine derivative disclosed in WO 2007/084786 is the selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor compound 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine, hereinafter referred to as âCompound Aâ or âthe compound of formula Aâ.</p>

        <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="00001">
          <img id="img-00001-en" he="41.99mm" wi="64.35mm" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" file="US20150246897A1_00006.PNG" img-format="png" original="US20150246897A1-20150903-C00001.TIF" />

      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0003">Compound A is described in WO 2007/084786 in free form and as the hydrochloric acid salt. The manufacturing process for preparing Compound A is described in Example 10 of this document. The manufacturing processes described therein are, although suitable for small scale production, regarded as disadvantageous for commercial production.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0004">WO International Patent Application PCT/US2011/053808 discloses a process for manufacturing pyrimidine compounds, including Compound A, and their corresponding salts and polymorphs. The process of preparing compound A and the monohydrochloride salt is summarized in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The second step of the process that leads to the boronic acid or boronic ester is complicated, with yields ranging from 30-60%. The choice of the base required to react with the acidic proton of the amide is critical and requires 5 equivalents of lithium amide in addition to 2.5 equivalents of butyl lithium at low temperature for the the Li/Br exchange reaction. Additional complications arise from precipitation of the anion. Moreover the boronic acid is unstable at high pH (&gt;9) and low pH (&lt;1). The Suzuki coupling step is also complicated by the Pd catalyst required and removal of the Pd catalyst during work up. The salt forming step is also complicated, as addition of more than 1 equivalent of HCl results in formation of the monohydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine along with amounts of the dihydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine, the latter salt limiting the purity of the monohydrochloride salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0005">There is a need for improved manufacturing methods of such compounds, especially where the purity of the intermediate compounds improve the purity of the active product ingredient, Compound A and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In particular there is a need to provide processes that fulfill one or more of the following criteria: scalable, safer; higher overall purity; higher yielding and more economical, as compared to the process disclosed.</p>

Accordingly, the compound is valuable for the treatment of various diseases, in particular for the prophylaxis or treatment of proliferative diseases. Thus, there is a great need to provide improved manufacturing methods for 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0036">The invention will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof, including the following glossary of terms, the concluding examples and the figures. The following general definitions shall apply in this specification, unless otherwise specified:</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0037">The term âprotectedâ with respect to hydroxyl groups, amine groups, and sulfhydryl groups refers to forms of these functionalities which are protected from undesirable reaction with a protecting group known to those skilled in the art such as those set forth in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New Jersey, (4<sup>th </sup>Edition, 2007) which can be added or removed using the procedures set forth therein.

In addition, a carboxy protecting group can be attached to a solid support whereby the compound remains connected to the solid support as the carboxylate until cleaved by hydrolytic methods to release the corresponding free acid. Representative carboxy-protecting groups include, for example, alkyl esters, secondary amides and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0039">As used herein, the term âpharmaceutically acceptable saltsâ refers to the nontoxic acid or alkaline earth metal salts of the pyrimidine compounds of the invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the pyrimidine compounds, or by separately reacting the base or acid functions with a suitable organic or inorganic acid or base, respectively. Representative salts include, but are not limited to, the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, cyclopentanepropionate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemi-sulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, pyridine hydrochloride, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methane-sulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphth-alenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluene-sulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such agents as alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides, and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0040">Where the plural form (e.g., compounds, salts) is used, this includes the singular (e.g., a single compound, a single salt). âA compoundâ does not exclude that (e.g., in a pharmaceutical formulation) more than one compound of the formula A (or a salt thereof) is present.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0041">Where the singular form (e.g., solvent, base) is used, this includes the plural (e.g., solvents, bases). âA solventâ, âthe solventâ, âa baseâ or âthe baseâ does not exclude that (e.g., in a reaction mixture) more than one solvent or base is present.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Step (a)</heading>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0049">In an exemplary embodiment, 5-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine is acylated to form N-(5-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide in a reaction mixture comprising one or more solvents and an acid anhydride of formula (R<sup>5</sup>CâO)<sub>2</sub>O, such that R<sup>5 </sup>is C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl and phenyl. The one or more solvents are selected from aromatic solvents, aliphatic solvents, halogenated solvents, polar aprotic solvents, ester solvents and ethereal solvents. In one embodiment, the one or more solvents of step (a) comprises ethyl acetate and heptane and the acid anhydride is acetic anhydride. Typical reaction times are in the range of 4 to 8 hours. Typical reaction temperatures are in the range of 70Â° C. to 90Â° C. under reflux conditions. In one embodiment, acetic anhydride was continuously added within a time period of 3 hours and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. for 5 hours. The one or more solvents are removed in vacuo and the product was precipitated by adding additional heptane and cooling. The product N-(5-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide was collected by filtration, dried under vacuum and used in step (b). Advantages of the improved process are that the solvent dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), previously used as a solvent in step (a) of WO International Patent Application PCT/US2011/053808, is eliminated and that product purity is consistently high (&gt;99%), coupled with product yields from 94-96%.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Step (b)</heading>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0050">In an exemplary embodiment, N-(5-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide is reacted with an alkyl Grignard reagent, followed by adding a triaklylborate and by further adding 2,2â²-azanediyldiethanol to form N-(5-(1,3,6,2-dioxazaborocan-2-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide in a reaction mixture comprising one or more solvents. The one or more solvents are selected from aromatic solvents, aliphatic solvents, and ethereal solvents. Typical alkyl Grignard reagents are selected from C<sub>1-6</sub>MgX (X is Cl, Br, I). Typical Grignard reagents are those that can be used to perform selective metalations, namely a Grignard reagent, salt complex. In one embodiment, the alkyl Grignard reagent is isopropylmagnesiumchloride, lithium chloride complex and the one or more solvents is tetrahydrofuran and the trialkylborate is triisopropylborate.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0051">In one embodiment, the process of step (b) for manufacturing N-(5-(1,3,6,2-dioxazaborocan-2-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide further comprises the steps of: <ul id="ul-00032-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00033-en" list-style="none"><li>(i) reacting N-(5-bromo-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide with isopropylmagnesiumchloride, lithium chloride in tetrahydrofuran;</li><li>(ii) adding triisopropylborate in one or more solvents; and</li><li>(iii) further adding 2,2â²-azanediyldiethanol in one or more solvents.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0055">Typical reaction temperatures for step (i) are in the range of 0Â° C. to 10Â° C. Advantages of using an alkyl Grignard reagent is that it functions as a selective base during deprotonation and produces a stable di-anion via the transmetalation reaction. The process has a further advantage over deprotonation/transmetalation using butyllithium at low temperatures in that the mono-anion does not precipitate and less equivalents of the alkyl Grignard reagent are employed as compared to the organolithium reagent for the bromide/metal exchange. Typical reaction temperatures for step (ii) are in the range of 10Â° C. to 30Â° C. In one embodiment, after the addition of triisopropylborate is complete, the tetrahydrofuran solvent is replaced with 2-methylterahydrofuran. Typical reaction temperatures for step (iii) are in the range of 0Â° C. to 30Â° C. In one embodiment, the one or more solvents are 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and isopropanol. The boronic ester product, N-(5-(1,3,6,2-dioxazaborocan-2-yl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)acetamide has several advantages over the boronic acid compound, including purity, yield and thermal stability as compared to the boronic acid.</p>

Aqueous hydrochloric acid (in amounts from less than one, e.g. 0.94 to over one equivalent, e.g. 1.1 equivalents) in alcoholic solution in the presence of pyridine at elevated temperature when added to 1 equivalent of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine provides the monohydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine as crystalline form A, in high purity, with no impurities from the dihydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine. Pyridine functions to buffer amounts of HCl more than one equivalent so that a monohydrochloride salt is formed. Pyridinehydrochloride acid salt (less than 1 equivalent to 2 equivalents, e.g. 1.1 equivalents) in an alcohol/aqueous solvent(s) can also be employed to form the monohydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine as crystalline form A. Typical elevated temperatures range from 25-80Â° C. Typical solvents include for example ethanol, isopropanol, and aqueous mixtures thereof. Typical concentrations of HCl used range from 0.1N to 6N HCl, including 2.25N and 4.5 N HCl.</p>

Crystalline form A of the monohydrochloride salt was confirmed by XRD, the XRD as disclosed in WO PCT/US2011/053808. One advantage of the improved process is that formation of the di-hydrchloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine is prevented, which acts as an impurity to the monohydrochloride salt of 5-(2,6-Di-4-morpholinyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-4-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-amine.</p>
