      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This invention relates to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process using microchannel technology, and a novel catalyst and microchannel reactor. The catalyst and reactor are useful in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis processes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction involves converting a reactant composition comprising H<sub>2 </sub>and CO in the presence of a catalyst to aliphatic hydrocarbon products. The reactant composition may comprise the product stream from another reaction process such as steam reforming (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/COË3), partial oxidation (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/COË2), autothermal reforming (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/COË2.5), CO<sub>2 </sub>reforming (H<sub>2</sub>/COË1), coal gasification (product stream H<sub>2</sub>/COË1), and combinations thereof. The aliphatic hydrocarbon products may range from methane to paraffinic waxes of up to 100 carbon atoms or more.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Conventional reactors such as tubular fixed bed reactors and slurry reactors have various problems in heat and mass transfer resulting in limitations of choice of process conditions for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactions. Hot spots in the fixed bed reactors significantly promote methane formation, reduce the heavy hydrocarbon selectivity and deactivate the catalyst. On the other hand, strong mass transfer resistance inherent in a catalyst suspended in a slurry system generally reduces the effective reaction rate and also causes difficulty in separation of catalysts from the products. This invention provides a solution to these problems.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">This invention relates to a process for conducting a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction in a microchannel reactor wherein the one-pass conversion of CO within the reactor is enhanced and the selectivity to methane is reduced. With the inventive process the tendency to form hot spots in the microchannel reactor is reduced. This reduction in the tendency to form hot spots is believed to be due, at least in part, to the fact that the microchannel reactor provides enhanced heat transfer characteristics and more precise control of temperatures and residence times as compared to prior art processes wherein microchannel reactors are not used. With this process, it is possible to obtain relatively high levels of conversion of the CO and high levels of selectivity to the desired product (e.g., hydrocarbons in the middle distillate range) as compared to such prior art. A novel catalyst as well as a novel microchannel reactor design are provided.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The term âmicrochannelâ refers to a channel having at least one internal dimension of height or width of up to about 10 millimeters (mm), and in one embodiment up to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 1 mm. The flow of fluid through the microchannel may proceed along the length of the microchannel normal to the height and width of the microchannel. An example of a microchannel that may be used with the inventive process as a process microchannel and/or a heat exchange microchannel is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The microchannel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> has a height (h), width (w) and length (l). Fluid flows through the microchannel <b>10</b> along the length of the microchannel in the direction indicated by arrows <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. The height (h) or width (w) of the microchannel may be in the range of about 0.05 to about 10 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 2 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1.5 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.75 mm, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.5 mm. The other dimension of height or width may be of any dimension, for example, up to about 3 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 3 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 3 meters. The length (l) of the microchannel may be of any dimension, for example, up to about 10 meters, and in one embodiment about 0.2 to about 10 meters, and in one embodiment from about 0.2 to about 6 meters, and in one embodiment from 0.2 to about 3 meters. Although the microchannel <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> has a cross section that is rectangular, it is to be understood that the microchannel may have a cross section having any shape, for example, a square, circle, semi-circle, trapezoid, etc. The shape and/or size of the cross section of the microchannel may vary over its length. For example, the height or width may taper from a relatively large dimension to a relatively small dimension, or vice versa, over the length of the microchannel.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The term âadjacentâ when referring to the position of one channel relative to the position of another channel means directly adjacent such that a wall separates the two channels. This wall may vary in thickness. However, âadjacentâ channels are not separated by an intervening channel that would interfere with heat transfer between the channels. In one embodiment, one channel may be adjacent to another channel over only part of the dimension of the another channel. For example, a process microchannel may be longer than and extend beyond one or more adjacent heat exchange channels.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The term âfluidâ refers to a gas, a liquid, or a gas or a liquid containing dispersed solids or liquid droplets.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The term âcontact timeâ refers to the volume of the reaction zone within the microchannel reactor divided by the volumetric feed flow rate of the reactant composition at a temperature of 0Â° C. and a pressure of one atmosphere.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The term âresidence timeâ refers to the internal volume of a space (e.g., the reaction zone within a microchannel reactor) occupied by a fluid flowing through the space divided by the average volumetric flowrate for the fluid flowing through the space at the temperature and pressure being used.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The term âreaction zoneâ refers to the space within the process microchannels wherein the reactants contact the catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The term âconversion of COâ refers to the CO mole change between the reactant composition and product divided by the moles of CO in the reactant composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The term âselectivity to methaneâ refers to the moles of methane in the product divided by the moles of methane plus two times the number of moles of C<sub>2 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, plus three times the number of moles of C<sub>3 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, plus four times the number of moles of C<sub>4 </sub>hydrocarbons in the product, etc., until all of the moles of hydrocarbons in the product have been included.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The term âone-pass conversion of COâ refers to the conversion of CO after one pass through the microchannel reactor employed with the inventive process.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The term âyield of productâ refers to conversion of CO multiplied by selectivity to the indicated product(s).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The term âmetal dispersionâ refers to the percent of catalytically active metal atoms and promoter atoms on the surface of the catalyst as compared to the total number of metal atoms in the catalyst as measured by hydrogen chemisorption which is described in âHeterogeneous Catalysis in Industrial Practice,â 2<sup>nd </sup>ed., Charles N. Satterfield, p. 139, McGraw Hill (1996), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the expression âabout 0.5 gram of aliphatic hydrocarbon having at least about 5 carbon atoms per gram of catalyst per hourâ the weight or number of grams of catalyst refers to the total weight of the catalyst consisting of the catalytic metal (e.g., Co) or oxide thereof, optional co-catalyst (e.g., Re or Ru), and/or promoter (e.g., Na, K, etc.) as well as the weight of any support (e.g., alumina). However, if the catalyst is supported on an engineered support structure such as a foam, felt, wad or fin, the weight of such engineered support structure is not included in the calculation of the weight or number of grams of catalyst. Similarly, if the catalyst is adhered to the microchannel walls, the weight of the microchannel walls is not included in the calculation.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The term âCo loadingâ refers to the weight of the Co in the catalyst divided by the total weight of the catalyst, that is, the total weight of the Co plus any co-catalyst or promoter as well as the support. If the catalyst is supported on an engineered support structure such as a foam, felt, wad or fin, the weight of such engineered support structure is not included in the calculation. Similarly, if the catalyst is adhered to the microchannel walls, the weight of the microchannel walls is not included in the calculation.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the process may be conducted using microchannel reactor <b>100</b> which includes microchannel reactor core <b>102</b>, reactant header <b>104</b>, product footer <b>106</b>, heat exchange header <b>108</b> and heat exchange footer <b>110</b>. The microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> contains a plurality of process microchannels and a plurality of heat exchange channels adjacent to the process microchannels. The heat exchange channels may be microchannels. The process microchannels and heat exchange channels may be aligned in layers, one above the other, or side by side. A Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is contained within the process microchannels. The process header <b>104</b> provides a passageway for fluid to flow into the process microchannels with an even or substantially even distribution of flow to the process microchannels. The process footer <b>106</b> provides a passageway for fluid to flow from the process microchannels in a rapid manner with a relatively high rate of flow. The reactant composition flows into the microchannel reactor <b>100</b> through the reactant header <b>104</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>112</b>. The reactant composition may be preheated prior to entering the reactant header <b>104</b>. The reactant composition flows through the process microchannels in the microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> in contact with the catalyst and reacts to form the desired product. In one embodiment, the flow of reactant composition and product through the reactor core <b>102</b> is in a vertical direction, from the top of the reactor core <b>102</b> to its bottom. The product, and in one embodiment unreacted components from the reactant composition, flow from the reactor core <b>102</b> through the product footer <b>106</b>, and out of product footer <b>106</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>114</b>. Although an advantage of the inventive process is that a high level of conversion of CO may be obtained with one pass through the process microchannels, in one embodiment, unreacted components from the reactant composition or a portion thereof may be recycled back through the process microchannels in contact with the catalyst. The unreacted components of the reactant composition being recycled through the process microchannels may be recycled any number of times, for example, one, two, three, four times, etc. A heat exchange fluid flows into heat exchange header <b>108</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>116</b>, and from heat exchange header <b>108</b> through the heat exchange channels in microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> to heat exchange footer <b>110</b>, and out of heat exchange footer <b>110</b>, as indicated by directional arrow <b>118</b>. The microchannel reactor <b>100</b> is employed in conjunction with storage vessels, pumps, valves, flow control devices, and the like, which are not shown in the drawings, but would be apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In one embodiment, the microchannel reactor core <b>102</b> may contain layers of process microchannels and heat exchange microchannels aligned side by side. An example of such microchannels layers is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, process microchannel layers <b>130</b> and heat exchange microchannel layers <b>150</b> are stacked side by side to provide repeating unit <b>170</b>. Microchannel layer <b>130</b> provides for the flow of reactant and product. Microchannel layer <b>150</b> provides for the flow of heat exchange fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Microchannel layer <b>130</b> contains a plurality of microchannels <b>132</b> aligned in parallel, each process microchannel <b>132</b> extending in a vertical direction along the length of microchannel layer <b>130</b> from end <b>134</b> to end <b>136</b>, the process microchannels <b>132</b> extending along the width of microchannel layer <b>130</b> from end <b>138</b> to end <b>140</b>. Bonding strips <b>142</b> and <b>144</b> are positioned at the ends <b>138</b> and <b>140</b>, respectively, of microchannel layer <b>130</b> to permit bonding of the microchannel layer <b>130</b> to the next adjacent heat exchange layers <b>150</b>. A catalyst is contained within the process microchannels <b>132</b>. The flow of reactant and product through the process microchannels <b>132</b> may be in the direction indicated by arrows <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. Each of the process microchannels <b>132</b> may have a cross section having any shape, for example, a square, rectangle, circle, semi-circle, etc. The internal height of each process microchannel <b>132</b> may be considered to be the vertical or horizontal distance or gap between the microchannel layer <b>130</b> and the next adjacent heat exchange layer <b>150</b>. Each process microchannel <b>132</b> may have an internal height of up to about 10 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 6 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 4 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 2 mm.

The heat exchange fluid may flow through the heat exchange microchannels <b>152</b> in the direction indicated by arrows <b>166</b> and <b>168</b>.
