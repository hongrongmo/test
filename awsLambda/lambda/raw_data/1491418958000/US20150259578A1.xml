    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention is directed to formulating hot melt adhesive compositions that include polypropylene and ethylene copolymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hot melt adhesive compositions are solid at room temperature and melt at higher temperatures. Hot melt adhesive compositions are often made from a variety of different base polymers including amorphous polyalphaolefins and ethylene vinyl acetate. Many amorphous polypropylene polymers exhibit a long open time, are quite tacky immediately after solidifying from a molten state, and remain tacky for an undesirable period of time after solidifying. These properties are undesirable for applications that require short open times and non-tacky properties after solidification.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It is often difficult to formulate hot melt adhesive compositions that include both polypropylene and ethylene vinyl acetate as the base polymers and that exhibit suitable adhesive properties. One reason for this difficulty is that ethylene vinyl acetate tends to be incompatible with polypropylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It would be useful to formulate a hot melt adhesive composition that exhibits good bonding properties at a low coat weight and in which the base polymer of the formulation can be changed while maintaining good adhesive properties.</p>

      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Propylene Polymer</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The propylene polymer is a polypropylene homopolymer, a propylene copolymer (i.e., copolymer, terpolymer, and higher order polymer), or a mixture thereof. The propylene polymer can be uni- or multi-modal and can be a mixture of at least two different propylene polymers. The term âmulti modalâ means the polymer has a multi-modal molecular weight distribution (Mw/MN) as detennined by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC). A multi-modal molecular weight distribution exists when the the SEC trace has more than one peak or inflection point (i.e., two or more inflection points). An inflection point is the point at which the second derivative changes in sign (e.g., from negative to positive or vice versa). The term âuni-modelâ means the polymer has a uni-modal molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) as determined by SEC. A uni-modal molecular weight distribution exists when the SEC trace has only one peak or inflection point. Methods for determining molecular weight (i.e., Mw, Mn, and Mz) and modality using SEC are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,294,681 B2, col. 91, line 11 through col. 92, line 64, which is incorporated herein.</p>

      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Fiber Tear Test Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The percentage fiber tear is the percentage of fiber that covers the area of the adhesive after two substrates, which have been previously bonded together through the adhesive, are separated by force. The percentage of fiber tear exhibited by an adhesive composition is determined as follows. A bead of the adhesive composition measuring 15.24 cm (6 inch)Ã0.24 cm ( 3/32 inch) is applied to a first substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, using a ROCKTENN bond simulator at the specified application temperature. Two seconds after the bead of adhesive is applied to the first substrate, the bead of adhesive is contacted with a second substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, which is pressed against the adhesive and the first substrate with a pressure of 0.21 MPa (30 pounds per square inch (psi)) for a period of 2 seconds. The resulting constructions are then conditioned at room temperature for at least 4 hours and then conditioned at the specified test temperature for at least 12 hours. The substrates of the construction are then separated from one another at the conditioning temperature (e.g., immediately after removing the sample from the conditioning chamber) by pulling the two substrates apart from one another by hand. The surface of the adhesive composition is observed and the percent of the surface area of the adhesive composition that is covered by fibers is determined and recorded. A minimum of five samples are prepared and tested for each hot melt adhesive composition. The results are reported in units of % fiber tear.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="2">Set Time Test Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">A bead of adhesive composition measuring 15.24 cm (6 inch)Ã0.24 cm ( 3/32 inch) is applied to a first substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, using a ROCKTENN bond simulator at the specified application temperature. A timer is started as the bead is applied to the first substrate. 0.4 seconds after the bead of adhesive is applied to the first substrate, the bead of adhesive is contacted with a second substrate of ROCKTENN 44 pound 87% virgin liner board, which is pressed against the adhesive and the first substrate with a pressure of 0.21 MPa (30 pounds per square inch (psi)) for a period of 0.4 seconds. When the timer is at 3 seconds, the now formed bond is pulled apart. If the bond results in less than 100% fiber failure, another bond is made and pulled after 3.5 seconds. In this manner, the amount of time that is allowed to elapse prior to pulling the bond is increased in 0.5 second increments until the set time is arrived upon. The set time is the shortest amount of time in which a pulled bond results in 100% fiber failure. Once a set time is achieved, the test is repeated one more time to confirm the result. If the bond gives 100% fiber failure at 3 seconds, the set time is recorded as no greater than 3 seconds. The results are reported in seconds (s).</p>

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Heat stress resistance is measured according to standard number IOPP T-3006 entitled, âSuggested Test Method for Determining the Heat Stress Resistance of Hot Melt Adhesives,â using a starting temperature of 46Â° C. (115Â° F.) and five bonded samples per adhesive. After 24 hours, the number of samples that are no longer supporting the weight is recorded, and the temperature is increased. The pass temperature for each adhesive, which is defined as the maximum temperature at which 80% of the samples remain bonded, is the heat stress resistance and is reported in degrees Celsius (Â° C.).</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Tensile Test Method</heading>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Tensile properties are determined using ASTM D638 modified by the film thickness and aging time. Films of each sample are created by using a draw down square, which is preheated to 350Â° F. (177Â° C.), with a cut out of 40 mils, which when cooled provides a sample film thickness of 25 mils. Each sample is heated to 350Â° F. (177Â° C.), poured onto a Teflon board, and quickly drawn down using the square. Once cooled, the thickness of each film is measured using a micrometer. The target film thickness is 25 mils+/â5 mils, where 1 mil is equal to 0.001 inch (0.00254 mm). Tensile specimens are punched out of the film using a Type IV dog bone die. The thickness of the film specimen is not to vary by greater than 1 mil along the gauge length of a given specimen. Specimens are aged at room temperature for at least 12 hours prior to testing. The specimens are run on an INSTRON 4502 at 23Â° C., 50% relative humidity, and 2 inch/min extension rate. A calibrated 100 N INSTRON static load cell is used to quantify the force and an INSTRON 2663-821 Advanced Video Extensometer, calibrated using a custom calibration bar, is used to measure the change in the gauge length. BLUE HILL 2 software is used for data acquisition and analysis.</p>
