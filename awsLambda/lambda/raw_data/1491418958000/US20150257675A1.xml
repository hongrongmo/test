      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">1. Field of Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The field of the currently claimed embodiments of this invention relates to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems and methods, and more particularly to MRI systems and methods that include motion correction and/or accelerated processing for increased frame rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The advantageous use of magnetic resonance technology in providing safe, rapid images of a patient has long been known. It has also been known to employ resonance technology in producing chemical shift spectra to provide information regarding the chemical content of a material.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In a general sense, magnetic resonance imaging involves providing bursts of radio frequency energy on a specimen positioned within a main magnetic field in order to induce responsive emission of magnetic radiation from the hydrogen nuclei or other nuclei. The emitted signal may be detected in such a manner as to provide information as to the intensity of the response and the spatial origin of the nuclei emitting the responsive magnetic resonance signal.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In general, imaging may be performed in a slice or plane or multiple planes or three-dimensional volume with information corresponding to the responsively emitted magnetic radiation being received and conveyed to a computer which stores the information in the form of numbers or data corresponding to the intensity and phase of the signal. The pixel value may be established in a computer by employing Fourier Transformation (FT) which converts the signal amplitude and phase as a function of time to signal as a function of frequency, which translates to spatial position within the volume. The signals may be stored in the computer and may be delivered with or without enhancement to a video screen display, such as a cathode-ray tube, for example, wherein the image created by the computer output will be presented through black and white presentations varying in intensity, or color presentations varying in hue and intensity. See, generally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,381.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Recently, MRI technology has been used in connection with endoscopes, where a stream of images is provided from the viewpoint of an MRI probe introduced internally into the imaging volume<sup>1</sup>. For example, the probe may be moved through orifices, or blood vessels, or tissues in a human body with the intrinsic high sensitivity to pathology that characterizes MRI. However, the probe advancement has been limited by scan time which renders the images sensitive to motion artefact.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Current speeds for intravascular (IV) MRI and MRI endoscopy<sup>1 </sup>are limited to Ë2 frames/s at 3T, although it will be appreciated that higher and lower frame rates are often desirable to enhance particular aspects of the responsive signals, such as image contrast or flow sensitivity etc. In any case it will be appreciated that high-resolution (e.g. Ë50-500 Î¼m) images may be susceptible to degradation by physiological and random motions when their amplitudes are of the order of mm at time-frames shorter than the scan period.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Compressed sensing has been previously proposed and implemented to speed up conventional MRI and angiography<sup>2-7</sup>. It is also used in other image applications involving data and image compression. However, it has not been adapted for use in MRI endoscopy with either radial projection or Cartesian MRI pulse sequences, nor in conjunction with internal MRI detectors.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Therefore, there remains a need for improved MRI systems and methods for motion correction and/or accelerated processing for increased frame rates.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Some embodiments of the current invention are discussed in detail below. In describing embodiments, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other equivalent components can be employed and other methods developed without departing from the broad concepts of the current invention. All references cited anywhere in this specification, including the Background and Detailed Description sections, are incorporated by reference as if each had been individually incorporated.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The present invention pertains to MRI internal detectors on MRI endoscopy providing a continuous stream of images from the viewpoint of an internal MRI probe, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,801, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0256480, and Sathyanarayana S, Bottomley P A, âMRI endoscopy using intrinsically localized probesâ, Med Phys 2009; 36: 908-919 (PMCID: PMC2673676), which are incorporated by reference herein. Referring now to the various figures of the drawing wherein like reference characters refer to like parts, there is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> a schematic illustration of a MR (magnetic resonance) system as is known to those skilled in the art which also generally illustrates the concept of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Such an MR system includes a RF (radio frequency) source <b>2</b>, magnetic field generator(s) <b>6</b> (e.g., main and gradient magnetic field generators), a receiver <b>8</b>, a signal processing mechanism and a display device <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The RF source <b>2</b> provides pulsed RF energy to the specimen which, in the form shown, is a patient <b>4</b> in the main magnetic field which is created by magnetic field generator <b>6</b>. The RF energy is provided by an RF power amplifier <b>11</b>, which is in turn fed by an RF transmitter <b>13</b>, with analog signals converted in digital-to-analog (D/A) converters <b>14</b> a from the MRI scanner's main computer <b>12</b>. The specimen is generally aligned with the main magnetic field and the RF pulses are imposed perpendicular thereto. Where oblique imaging is employed, the angle of impingement of the vector representing the spatial gradient in the magnetic field will be angularly offset relative to the main field. This arrangement results in excitation of the nuclei within the region of interest, which is the area or volume to be imaged, and causes responsive emission of magnetic energy which is picked up by the receiver <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The receiver <b>8</b> is connected to a detector <b>200</b>. Detector <b>200</b> can be an active internal MRI detector, a catheter antenna, or any other suitable type of detector. Detector <b>200</b> can have a voltage induced in it as a result of such responsive emissions of electro-magnetic energy. The signal emerging from the receiver <b>8</b> passes through the signal processing mechanism. In the illustrated embodiment, the signal processing mechanisms includes an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter <b>10</b> and a computer. The signal emerging from the receiver <b>8</b> is typically an analog signal so the A/D converter <b>10</b> converts the analog signal to a digital signal for processing within the computer <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The computer <b>12</b> typically includes one or more applications programs for execution therein, which applications programs typically control image acquisition and signal processing. The applications programs for signal processing can include for example, instructions and criteria for performing FT image construction in one, two or three dimensions, wherein the plot of amplitude versus time corresponding to the incoming signals is converted by FT to a map of the spatial distribution of the signals by plotting amplitude versus frequency or phase in one, two or three dimensions. The FTs are performed in order to establish the MR signal intensity values and the locations of specific pixels. These values may be stored, enhanced or otherwise processed and emerge to be displayed on a suitable screen or display <b>16</b>. The display can be any of a number of devices or systems known to those skilled in the art, including a cathode-ray tube, a liquid crystal display device, a plasma display device, a light emitting diode (LED) display device, or digital projection device such as that embodying DLP technology, or a printer.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a specimen <b>30</b>, which in the illustrated case is a human being, has a head <b>31</b>, a trunk <b>32</b>, arms <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, and legs <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>. The specimen <b>30</b> is disposed adjacent to a body coil <b>100</b> within the main magnetic field generated by magnet system <b>110</b>. The magnet system <b>110</b> may be any magnet suitable for use in a MRI scanner, such as a permanent magnet, a superconductor or a resistive magnet, for example, and provided also with gradient magnetic field coils to spatially encode the responsive signals, and may also include RF magnetic coils for exciting the responsive signals, in accordance with the principles of MRI. A detector <b>200</b> which may be a loop or a loopless antenna has been introduced into the patient <b>30</b> in a conventional manner, for example, through the femoral artery and into the trunk <b>32</b> with the antenna being adjacent to the region of interest <b>41</b>. It should be recognized that this is illustrative and that a detector <b>200</b> of the present invention is adaptable so as to be inserted through a naturally existing openings such as a pancreatic duct (e.g., accessible during surgery on the duodenum), bile duct, urethra, urethra, esophagus, the bronchial passages and the like, or a man-made opening such as a catheter sleeve opening in the femoral or other artery, or into the abdomen, or in any other manner consistent with endoscopy, or into tissue via a needle etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The detector <b>200</b> is operatively associated with a MR scanner <b>120</b>. The long axis of the detector <b>200</b> can be generally aligned with the main magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>. In this alignment, for example, the sensitivity of the loopless antenna is orthogonal to B<sub>0 </sub>and is therefore suitable for MR. Similarly, in other embodiments, it should be understood that the alignment of catheter antennae is such that they have a B<sub>1 </sub>RF field sensitivity to MR signals whose magnetic fields are oriented in planes orthogonal to B<sub>0</sub>. The detector <b>200</b> of the present invention also may be employed with any of a number of encoding methods known to those skilled in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The detector <b>200</b> can be moved through orifices, blood vessels or tissues in the body with the intrinsic high-sensitivity to pathology that characterizes MRI. Images constructed using detector <b>200</b> can allow users to see through vessel walls, detect plaques etc, at high resolution. See, Qian D, Bottomley P A, âHigh-resolution intravascular magnetic resonance quantification of atherosclerotic plaque at 3Tâ, Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, 2012: 14:20, doi:10.1186/1532-429X-14-20.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Conventional techniques can allow imaging to proceed at up to approximately 2 frames per second, for example (see, Sathyanarayana S, SchÃ¤r M, Kraitchman D L, Bottomley P A, âTowards real-time intravascular endoscopic MRIâ, J Am Coll Cardiol Img 2010; 3: 1158-1165. NIHMSID #251914). This means that probe advancement is limited by the scan time (â0.5 s) if the effect of motion associated with advancement on image quality is to be avoided. Generally, to avoid such âmotion artefactsâ during that Ë0.5 s, a full set of image projections must be acquired before the image can be seen. This is typically 50-256 projections, which would mean that each projection is acquired in about 2-10 ms, equal to the sequence repetition time, TR. Even when the probe is not being advanced motion artefacts may result from physiological or sporadic events that occur during the finite time required for an image acquisition.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> shows an example of a process for increasing this image acquisition speed when performing internal MRI. At step <b>302</b>, magnet system <b>110</b> can apply an MRI pulse sequence to a sample of interest. In some embodiments, the MRI pulse sequence can include spatial encoding projections. In some embodiments, this MRI pulse sequence can be, for example, a projection MRI sequence or a Cartesian MRI sequence.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The sample of interest can include a detector <b>200</b>, which at step <b>304</b> can receive MRI signals caused by the MRI pulse sequence. At step <b>306</b>, scanner <b>120</b>, using for example a computer such as computer <b>12</b>, can reconstruct a magnetic resonance (MR) image or images from the MR signals. Computer <b>12</b> can reconstruct these images using, for example an error minimizing algorithm. In some embodiments, the error minimization algorithm can be an iterative error minimization algorithm. In further embodiments, the error minimization algorithm can be an l<sub>1</sub>-norm minimization algorithm, and images can be reconstructed using a Wavelet Transform</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The MRI pulse sequence used in the process of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> can provide an increase in an acquisition speed when reconstructing the MR image or images by sparsely under-sampling an image k-space in at least one dimension. This increase in acquisition speed can be proportionate to an undersampling factor of the MRI pulse sequence, which can be a measure of the amount of undersampling conducted when compared to a fully-sampled pulse sequence. In some embodiments, a projection MRI sequence can be randomly undersampled. In further embodiments, the MRI pulse sequence can be a Cartesian MRI sequence with a variable-density random under-sampled Cartesian MRI sequence with minimum undersampling at the center of k-space.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the MRI pulse sequence can be applied repeatedly and the reconstructed MRI image or images can be part of a cine stream. This cine stream can be created by successively replacing the oldest acquired of said spatially-encoding projection of the MRI sequence, with the most recently acquired spatially-encoding projection.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">High-resolution intravascular (IV) MRI is susceptible to degradation from physiological motion, and requires high frame-rates for true endoscopy. Fortunately, IV MRI detectors, for example detector <b>200</b>, can have intrinsically radial and sparsely-localized sensitivity profiles, and high local signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Some embodiments of the current invention can combine compressed sensing with sparse reconstruction and motion correction using frame-by-frame projection shifting that is based on a singularity at the probe's location to provide a many-fold effective speed-up in image acquisition as well as a significant reduction in motion sensitivity. In some examples according to embodiments of the current invention, we present data acquired in phantoms, and human vessel specimens. These strategies can greatly facilitate high-resolution (Ë100 Î¼m) real-time internal MRI and/or MRI endoscopy.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Under-sampling schemes are being applied to dramatically speed up conventional MRI for real-time imaging applications where dynamic response or motion-suppression is key, including the heart and functional MRI (fMRI), but not intra-vascular (IV) or internal MRI. As first demonstrated here, internal MRI and/or MRI endoscopy with its very high local SNR, intrinsically localized/sparse characteristics, and need for speed, can be a candidate for these techniques. Accordingly, some embodiments of the current invention provide under-sampling methods for MRI, which can provide a significant speed-up in scan time (examples here are up to 4-fold).</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The technique can be combined with the method of reducing motion sensitivity, described in U.S. App. No. 61/703,674 âMotion-insensitive, projection-based MRI endoscopy methodâ, filed Sep. 20, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. That method takes advantage of the intrinsic radial symmetry of internal detectors, replacing inter-scan image-shifting of the original internal MRI method, with intra-scan projection shifting. This not only fixes the endoscope's viewpoint to the center of the image FOV in real time, but also enables âsliding windowâ acquisitions wherein the oldest projections are replaced with the newest projections, since all the projections will be co-registered. Combining the two methods involves replacing the conventional set of MRI projections, with an under-sampled set of projections and employing sparse reconstruction methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Referring back <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, at step <b>308</b>, an undersampled pulse sequence can be applied to a region of interest, and at step <b>310</b> a detector can be located within that region of interest, for example detector <b>200</b>. At step <b>312</b> this motion correction can be applied, and at step <b>314</b> MR image or images can be reconstructed, using for example an error minimizing algorithm. In this motion correction technique, every projection frame can be motion-corrected before it is fed to the image reconstruction. In addition, switching to the projection reconstruction method, means that every frame in the image sequence can be a projection.

      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">This motion correction can include reconstructing the MR image or images from a viewpoint of detector <b>200</b> at a center of a MRI field of view. In at least one spatially-encoding projection excited by an MRI pulse sequence, an MRI signal of detector <b>200</b> can exhibit at least one singularity in a vicinity of a location of detector <b>200</b>. A location of the singularity can be detected in the at least one projection using a detection algorithm, and the projection can be shifted to the center of the MRI field of view prior to image reconstruction. In other embodiments, one or more of the projections which are determined to be corrupted by motion can be discarded, and another projection, for example a projection with the same encoding, can be acquired as a replacement.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The singularity can be defined as one or more points in the projection where a sensitivity of the detector <b>200</b> undergoes a transition from substantially an MRI signal maximum immediately adjacent to detector <b>200</b> to substantially a signal void at the location of the detector <b>200</b>. In other embodiments, a singularity can be defined as one or more points in the projection where a phase of the detector <b>200</b> undergoes a substantial reversal from at least at one location adjacent to detector <b>200</b> as compared to a location diametrically opposite the at least one adjacent location. The detection algorithm can be a cross-correlation algorithm or a maximum gradient detection algorithm applied to either the sensitivity singularity or the phase singularity, or to a combination of both sensitivity and phase singularities</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Using this motion correction, the MRI system can generate under-sampling MRI pulse sequence creating a stream of spatially-encoding projections wherein singularities are detected, and can shift each projection to the center of the FOV thereby creating a set of spatially shifted projections, and then at step <b>314</b> reconstruct at least one image from said set of projections.</p>

Since internal coils are embedded in the body, any motion of the subject can cause coil motion. The sensitivity profile of the probes allows coil detection in individual radial projections.

The following Examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0073">(A) Motion correction. IV MRI with and without mechanical motion, was performed on a Philips 3T MRI scanner using a 2 mm diameter 3T loopless antenna receiver, and a radial k-space traversal. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 4A-4F</figref>, we note that in each projection: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>(i) there is intense signal surrounding the probe, but the probe itself produces no signal. The amplitude peaks with two gradient reversals adjacent to a nadir at the probe wire (<figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>).</li><li>(ii) Further, there is a phase reversal that occurs at the probe (<figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>).</li><li>(iii) these two signal âsingularitiesâ aren't always at the exact center of the projection, and their location may vary with time in the presence of motion (<figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, <b>4</b>E).</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0077">The method according to an embodiment of the current invention involves detection of the amplitude and phase singularities at the probe's location using a signal derivative algorithm or a cross-correlation algorithm. After detection of the singularity, the entire projection is shifted to the center of the field-of-view (FOV). This is repeated for successive projections, so that all projections are aligned with respect to the location of the projection (<figref>FIG. 4C</figref>, <b>4</b>F). Images reconstructed from these re-aligned projections always have the probe at the center of the FOV.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0078">Results from a loopless antenna MRI detector inserted into an orange (<figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, at rest) show severe motion artefacts when the orange is manually shaken (+/â3 mm) in a 3T scanner while imaging using a loopless antenna (<figref>FIGS. 5B</figref>, <b>14</b>A). Two-hundred projections spanning the entire circle were obtained in each case of the orange at rest and in motion. To obtain <figref>FIGS. 5C</figref>, <b>14</b>B, the probe location was detected and each projection aligned with the probe as center in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, followed by image reconstruction performed by filtered-back projection of the aligned projections. As is evident, the motion artefact is greatly reduced by applying the correction to the same data set, according to an embodiment of the current invention, as compared to the uncorrected image (<figref>FIGS. 5C</figref> vs <b>5</b>B).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0079">(B) Compressed sensing is a method wherein a number of frames of the image k-space are omitted during image acquisition permitting a sharp reduction in scan time<sup>2-7</sup>. The resultant âsparsely sampledâ image is usually reconstructed with wavelet transform (WT) techniques, that can produce speed-up factors of 3-4-fold or potentially more. The image reconstructionâoften with little loss in image qualityâcan use an iterative error minimization algorithm such as the so-called âl<sub>1</sub>-normâ minimization. The utility of the WT, which underlies compression methods including JPEG, lies in its ability to transform image content into a vector of sparse components that permits encoding with just a few significant coefficients. For MRI, only the limited subset of image k-space acquisitions that correspond to this sparsely sampled data set need be directly measured, reducing the scan-time proportionately<sup>3</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0080">Compressed sensing has been previously proposed and implemented to speed up conventional MRI and angiography. It is also used in other image applications involving data and image compression. It has not, however, been used for MRI endoscopy with either radial projection or Cartesian MRI pulse sequences, nor in conjunction with internal MRI detectors. Nevertheless, it is well-suited to be adapted for these applications because the endoscopic MRI signal is highly localized to regions close to the probe (<figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>), and wherein regions far from the probe in image space possess little or no signal. For radial projection imaging, the data set is âsparsifiedâ by means of random or uniform under-sampling<sup>2</sup>. Variable-density random under-sampling may be used on MRI data acquired from Cartesian data sets, retaining most of the frames close to the center of image k-space<sup>2-3 </sup>in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The images are reconstructed using âl<sub>1</sub>-normâ minimization and WT.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0081">The sparse sampling method is based on information theory where it has been shown that an unknown signal can be reconstructed with a sampling rate significantly below the Nyquist frequency, if the underlying unknown signal is sparse or can be sparsified in some transform domain. According to compressed sensing theory, in order to reconstruct an MRI image, Ï, from an undersampled Fourier encoded signal, s<sub>u</sub>, it should satisfy<sup>3</sup>:</p>

(2) ensures that the result is consistent with the acquired signal. The second l<sub>1</sub>-norm term promotes sparseness in the Ï-transformed domain, and the total variation term preserves image gradients or edge information. Numeric optimization of Eq. (2) yields the unknown image, Ï which is largely free of Nyquist aliasing artifacts, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0083">Sparsely under-sampled reconstruction was tested with Cartesian MRI endoscopy data acquired from a rabbit in vivo in a 3 Tesla clinical research MRI scanner with 80 Î¼m resolution (8 slices, 5 min, Ë38 s/slice<sup>1</sup>. Applying the (38%) variable density random under-sampling pattern shown in <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> to the phase-encoding (k<sub>y</sub>) MRI steps, yields, after reconstruction to minimize the âl<sub>1</sub>-normâ of the WT-transformed images<sup>3</sup>, results that are virtually equivalent to the original image (<figref>FIG. 7B</figref> vs. <b>7</b>C), effectively 2.5-times fasterâabout 15 s for this 80 Î¼m resolution image.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0084">With radial projections, k-space is sampled randomly or uniformly (exemplified in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>). In another experiment on an orange, we cut the original data set to 25%, and used an l<sub>1</sub>-norm minimization of the total variation of pixel signals to produce a radial projection image effectively 4-times faster (see <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> vs <b>8</b>A). Radial and Cartesian compressed sensing produced virtually indistinguishable images with only Â¼<sup>th </sup>to â<sup>rd </sup>of the original data.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0085">Since the motion correction algorithm acts on each projection, it was also applied to a radially under-sampled data set (not shown).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0086">These novel techniques can take advantage of the intrinsic radial symmetry of these detectors. By replacing inter-scan image-shifting of prior methods including MRI endoscopy<sup>1</sup>, with intra-scan projection shifting, not only fixes the internal antenna's viewpoint to the FOV center in real time, but also enable âsliding windowâ acquisitions replacing the oldest with the newest projections, since all the projections are already co-registered. Thus, implementing the motion correction method in real-time can significantly reduce artifacts from physiologic motion and probe advancement. Under-sampling can dramatically speed-up conventional MRI for applications where dynamic response or motion-suppression is key, as first demonstrated here for internal MRI, with high local SNR, intrinsically localized/sparse characteristics, and need for speed, make it an ideal application.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0087">As a result, intra-vascular (IV), intra-orifice, and/or needle-mounted MRI detectors operating in human scanners operating at, for example at 1-7 Tesla, can be well-suited to compressed sensing and motion correction strategies based on their intrinsically radial and sparsely-localized sensitivity profiles and high signal-to-noise ratios. The benefits can include much faster IV MRI-approaching real-time (Ë10 fr/s) and reduced motion sensitivity, while retaining the high-resolution (80-300 Î¼m) image information.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0088">
        <figref>FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> further illustrate the example of motion correction in corresponding to <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. An orange was manually shaken (+/â3 mm) in a 3T scanner while imaging using a loopless antenna. Two-hundred projections spanning the entire circle were obtained. Each projection was aligned with the probe as center. Image reconstruction was performed by filtered-back projection of aligned projections. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> (<i>a</i>) illustrates a stack of projections, motion affected, by amplitude according to the features of the present invention. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> (<i>b</i>) illustrates a stack of projections, each centered on probe, by amplitude according to the features of the present invention. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> (<i>c</i>) illustrates a stack of projections, motion affected, by phase according to the features of the present invention. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> (<i>d</i>) illustrates a stack of projections, each centered on probe, by phase according to the features of the present invention.</p>
