      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to extractor cleaning machines and, more particularly, to airflow exhaust for extractor cleaning machines.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Extractor cleaning machines typically include a supply tank for storing a cleaning fluid or a mixture of cleaning fluids. The extractor discharges the cleaning fluid onto a surface to be cleaned. A suction source, such as a motor and fan, draw the cleaning fluid and dirt from the surface through a suction nozzle and into a recovery tank. In the recovery tank, the airflow generated by the suction source is separated from the cleaning fluid and dirt and the cleaning fluid and dirt are stored in the recovery tank. The airflow is discharged from the extractor.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In embodiment the invention provides an extractor cleaning machine that includes a supply tank configured to store a cleaning fluid and a base movable along a surface to be cleaned. The base includes a base exhaust duct having an exhaust outlet directed toward the surface, and the base further includes a suction nozzle and an aperture configured to spray the cleaning fluid onto the surface. The extractor further includes a recovery tank in fluid communication with the suction nozzle and the recovery tank is configured to store cleaning fluid drawn through the suction nozzle. A suction source is in fluid communication with the suction nozzle and the recovery tank, and the suction source is operable to draw the cleaning fluid through the suction nozzle and into the recovery tank. The suction source is operable to generate an airflow that is discharged through the exhaust outlet of the base and onto the surface. The extractor further includes a body pivotally coupled to the base such that the body is pivotable between an upright position and an inclined position, and the body includes a body exhaust duct that is movable relative to the base exhaust duct as the handle pivots between the upright position and the inclined position. The base exhaust duct and the body exhaust duct cooperate to form an exhaust passageway between the suction source and the exhaust outlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In another embodiment, the invention provides a floor cleaning machine including a base movable along a surface to be cleaned, the base including a suction nozzle and a base exhaust duct and an exhaust outlet. The extractor further includes a suction source in fluid communication with the suction nozzle, and the suction source is operable to generate an airflow that is discharged through the exhaust outlet. The extractor further includes a body portion pivotally coupled to the base, and the body portion includes a body exhaust duct that is movable relative to the base exhaust duct as the handle pivots relative to the base. The base exhaust duct and the body exhaust duct cooperate to form an exhaust passageway between the suction source and the exhaust outlet.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the extractor <b>10</b> is an upright extractor operable to clean a surface <b>14</b>, such as, for example, a floor (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). In some embodiments, the extractor <b>10</b> may be adapted to clean a variety of surfaces, such as carpets, hardwood floors, tiles, or the like. The extractor <b>10</b> distributes or sprays a cleaning fluid (e.g., water, detergent, or a mixture of water and detergent) onto the surface to clean the surface. The extractor <b>10</b> then draws the cleaning fluid and dirt from the surface, leaving the surface relatively clean. As discussed in more detail below, the extractor <b>10</b> includes an airflow discharge that at least partially dries the surface <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The illustrated extractor <b>10</b> includes a base <b>18</b>, a body <b>22</b> coupled to the base <b>18</b>, a recovery tank <b>26</b> coupled to the body <b>22</b>, a fluid distribution system (not shown), and a supply tank assembly <b>34</b> coupled to the body <b>22</b>. Other extractors within the scope of the invention may include a different type of base, such as including the recovery tank and or supply tank coupled to the base. The supply tank assembly <b>34</b> is configured to store cleaning fluid to be distributed by the extractor <b>10</b> onto the surface <b>14</b>. The recovery tank <b>26</b> is configured to store cleaning fluid and any dirt extracted from the surface <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The base <b>18</b> is movable along the surface to be cleaned. In reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, two primary wheels <b>38</b> and optionally two secondary wheels <b>42</b> are coupled to the base <b>18</b> to facilitate movement of the base <b>18</b> along the surface. In the illustrated embodiment, the wheels <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> are idle wheels. In other embodiments, one or more of the wheels <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> may be driven wheels.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the base <b>18</b> further includes a distribution nozzle (not shown) for delivering cleaning fluid, a suction nozzle <b>50</b>, and a brush assembly <b>54</b> adjacent a lower surface <b>58</b> of the base <b>18</b>. The distribution nozzle directs cleaning fluid toward the surface <b>14</b> to be cleaned. The suction nozzle <b>50</b> draws fluid and dirt from the surface into the recovery tank <b>26</b> of the extractor <b>10</b>. The brush assembly <b>54</b> is coupled to the lower surface <b>58</b> adjacent the distribution nozzle and suction nozzle <b>50</b> to scrub the surface <b>14</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The brush assembly <b>54</b> also helps inhibit fluid from flowing beyond a periphery of the base <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, individual brushes of the brush assembly <b>54</b> may be electrically or pneumatically rotated to agitate and scrub the surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The fluid distribution system is in fluid communication with the supply tank assembly <b>34</b> to draw cleaning fluid from the supply tank assembly <b>34</b> and distribute the fluid to the surface <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid distribution system may include a pump that propels the cleaning fluid to the surface <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the base <b>18</b> further includes a base exhaust duct <b>62</b> having an exhaust outlet <b>70</b> directed toward the surface to be cleaned and generally positioned opposite from the suction nozzle <b>50</b> and the brush assembly <b>54</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> is rigidly attached to the base <b>18</b> for movement with the base <b>18</b>. The base exhaust duct <b>62</b> defines a curved member extending from an exhaust inlet <b>66</b> to the exhaust outlet <b>70</b>. The exhaust outlet <b>70</b> is located at a distal end of the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> directed generally towards the surface <b>14</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The base exhaust duct <b>62</b> generally has a rectangular cross-sectional profile. In other embodiments, the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> may be located elsewhere on the base <b>18</b> and include a different geometric profile (e.g., semicircle, oval, etc.). As discussed in more detail below, the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> directs an airflow to at least partially aid in the drying of the surface <b>14</b> being cleaned.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the body <b>22</b> supports a trigger <b>74</b> and optionally a mode switch <b>78</b>. The trigger <b>74</b> is actuatable to spray cleaning fluid from the supply tank assembly <b>34</b> through the distribution nozzle and onto the surface <b>14</b>. The mode switch <b>78</b> adjusts the operating mode (i.e., wash, rinse, auto-rinse, etc.) of the extractor <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In addition, the illustrated body <b>22</b> is pivotally coupled to and extends from the base <b>18</b>. The body <b>22</b> is pivotable or tiltable relative to the base <b>18</b> from a generally vertical, or upright, storage position <b>82</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> to one or more non-vertical, or inclined, operating positions <b>86</b>, one of which is shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. Pivoting the body <b>22</b> to an operating position <b>86</b> facilitates moving the base <b>18</b> along the surface <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the body <b>22</b> includes a motor housing <b>90</b> supporting a suction source <b>94</b>. The motor housing <b>90</b> is generally attached to the body <b>22</b> underneath the recovery tank <b>26</b> and is designed in a generally cylindrical configuration. In other embodiments, the suction source <b>94</b> may be supported by the base <b>18</b> or may be positioned elsewhere on the extractor <b>10</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The suction source <b>94</b> is in fluid communication with the suction nozzle <b>50</b> to draw fluid and dirt from the surface <b>14</b> through the suction nozzle <b>50</b> and into the recovery tank <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In one embodiment, the suction source <b>94</b> includes an electric motor <b>98</b> operable to drive a primary fan <b>102</b> and a cooling fan <b>106</b> located at distal ends of the motor <b>98</b> (<figref>FIG. 4</figref> and <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The fans <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> generate a primary airflow <b>110</b> and a cooling airflow <b>114</b>, respectively, that are fluidly isolated from one another within the body <b>22</b>. The primary airflow <b>110</b> is in fluid communication with the suction nozzle <b>50</b>. However, the primary airflow <b>110</b> is fluidly isolated from the motor <b>98</b> and flows out of the machine <b>10</b> through a primary air duct <b>126</b> having a primary duct outlet <b>142</b>. In addition, the cooling airflow <b>114</b> is in fluid communication with the motor <b>98</b> through a cooling air duct <b>118</b> having a cooling duct inlet <b>134</b> and a cooling duct outlet <b>138</b>. The cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> and the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> are positioned to deliver the airflows <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to the exhaust outlet <b>70</b> of the base directed toward the surface <b>14</b> to at least partially aid in the drying of the surface <b>14</b>, which is described in more detail below. The cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> and the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> are generally separated from each other prior to exiting a body exhaust duct <b>162</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In continued reference to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a body exhaust duct <b>162</b> is generally formed in a semicircular configuration in the illustrated embodiment. The body exhaust duct <b>162</b> is positioned over the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> and the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> to receive the cooling airflow <b>114</b> and the primary airflow <b>110</b>. A wall <b>174</b> may be provided in the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> to isolate the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> from the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> inhibiting the primary airflow <b>110</b> from entering the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b>. Stated another way, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> forms a first inlet aperture <b>166</b> adjacent the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> that receives the cooling airflow <b>114</b> and a second inlet aperture <b>170</b> adjacent the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> that receives the primary airflow <b>110</b>. The first and second inlet apertures <b>166</b>, <b>170</b> are defined by an inner surface <b>178</b> of the body exhaust duct <b>162</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the wall <b>174</b> is shown as a two-sided member extending from the inner surface <b>178</b>. In other embodiments, the wall <b>174</b> may be differently configured to guide airflow from the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> and the primary duct outlet <b>142</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> is attached to body panel <b>130</b> adjacent the motor housing <b>90</b>. The body exhaust duct <b>162</b> may be secured to the body panel <b>130</b> by fasteners <b>186</b>, for example by fastening through fastener holes <b>182</b> in the illustrated embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Furthermore, in reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>, the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> and the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> cooperate to form an exhaust passageway <b>190</b> between the suction source <b>94</b> and the exhaust outlet <b>70</b>. A portion of the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> is positioned within the exhaust inlet <b>66</b> of the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> such that airflow through the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> passes through the base exhaust duct <b>62</b>. Stated another way, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> in combination with the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> defines the exhaust passageway <b>190</b> between the suction source <b>94</b> and the exhaust outlet <b>70</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). Additionally, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> moves relative to the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> as the handle pivots between the upright position <b>82</b> and the inclined position <b>86</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the shape of the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> cooperates with the shape of the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> such that the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> slides within the base exhaust duct <b>62</b> as the handle pivots between the upright position <b>82</b> and the inclined position <b>86</b>, providing the exhaust passageway <b>190</b> in an extended or lengthened state in the upright position <b>82</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> and a shortened or retracted state in the inclined position <b>86</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In operation, in reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the electric motor <b>98</b> is operable to rotate the primary fan <b>102</b> and the cooling fan <b>106</b>. The primary fan <b>102</b> creates the primary airflow <b>110</b> that extracts dirt and liquid from the surface <b>14</b> through the suction nozzle <b>50</b>. The primary airflow <b>110</b> is initially processed by the extractor <b>10</b> through the recovery tank <b>26</b>. Before the primary airflow <b>110</b> reaches the recovery tank <b>26</b>, the primary airflow contains a substantial amount of moisture from the surface <b>14</b>. The recovery tank <b>26</b> collects the moisture from the primary airflow <b>110</b> before the primary airflow <b>110</b> travels towards the suction source <b>94</b>. The primary airflow <b>110</b> travels adjacent the electric motor <b>98</b> and exits the body <b>22</b> through the primary air duct <b>126</b> and the primary duct outlet <b>142</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The cooling fan <b>106</b> creates the cooling airflow <b>114</b> that draws ambient air through the cooling duct inlet <b>134</b> and into the cooling air duct <b>118</b>. The cooling airflow <b>114</b> then passes adjacent the motor <b>98</b> which absorbs heat from the motor <b>98</b>. The cooling airflow <b>114</b> exits the body <b>22</b> through the cooling duct outlet <b>138</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">With reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref> and <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, when the extractor <b>10</b> is in the upright position <b>82</b>, the exhaust passageway <b>190</b> is in fluid communication with the exhaust outlet <b>70</b>. The exhaust outlet <b>70</b> directs the primary airflow <b>110</b> and the cooling airflow <b>114</b> towards the surface <b>14</b> to act in aiding of drying the surface <b>14</b>. When the extractor <b>10</b> is in the inclined operating position <b>86</b>, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> slides downward within the base exhaust duct <b>62</b>. As a result, the body exhaust duct <b>162</b> extends beyond the exhaust outlet <b>70</b> and directs the primary airflow <b>110</b> and the cooling airflow <b>114</b> generally towards the suction nozzle <b>50</b> and the surface <b>14</b>. The primary airflow <b>110</b> and the cooling airflow <b>114</b> act to dry the surface <b>14</b>.</p>
