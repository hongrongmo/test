      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method and system providing a rapid discovery, validation and assessment of genetic variations or chromosomal disorders throughout the whole genome including both sex chromosomes and/or the mitochondrial genomes in samples containing low amounts of target nucleic acids, such as relatively small analytes, such as few or single cells or free-flowing tumor or fetal nucleic acids.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The most common form of genetic variation in the human genome is a class of genetic variation known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). SNPs are important markers in many studies that link sequence variations to phenotypic changes. Hence, the identification of SNPs also known as SNP-typing is an important tool in molecular diagnostics and aims to determine on which positions at least one of the bases differs from the reference sequence. Genotyping is the process of allele discrimination for an individual. Genotypes are typically identified using DNA extracted from thousands of cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In contrast to using DNA extracted from a large number of cells, more recently, technology has been developed which allows, high capacity, low cost genome-wide genotyping of small analytes such as single cells or a limited number of cells. SNP- and Geno-typing single cells or a limited number of cells are daunting tasks due to the small amount of DNA available (Ë7 pg for a normal diploid human cell or Ë3.3 pg for a haploid cell). To overcome this small amount of input material, an extensive whole genome amplification (WGA) is usually performed prior to further downstream analysis. Different WGA methods have been described, and are based on either a Multiple Displacement amplification (MDA) (e.g. Genomiphi and Repli-G kit) or a PCR-based genome wide amplification method (e.g. GenomePlex). Subsequent to this amplification, successful genotyping has been achieved via âSNP chipâ microarray-based platforms as known in the art. Those platforms require a substantial prior knowledge of both genome sequence and variability, and once designed are suitable only for those targeted variable nucleotide sites. This method introduces substantial ascertainment bias and inherently precludes detection of rare or population-specific variants or its use in highly diverse species.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Novel sequencing technologies enabled to assess the variation of several <b>10</b>,<b>000</b>'s of targets at a genome-wide level through high-throughput massively parallel sequencing (i.e. next-generation sequencing or NGS) that enabled fast genome-wide sequencing. NGS typically yields several orders of magnitude more data than traditional Sanger Sequencing. In order to retrieve SNP- and/or genotype data from NGS studies, extensive bioinformatic/statistical interpretation of the data is needed including algorithms for base calling and genome alignment followed by tools for SNP identification and/or genotype determination. Besides whole genome amplification, partial genome amplification (PGA) is sometimes preferred to promote enrichment of certain DNA fragments of interest (e.g. a collection of genes or exons, the mitochondrial genome, etc.). Both, whole genome and targeted amplification strategies have been reported in relation with high-throughput massive parallel sequencing efforts.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Recently, single cell sequencing was achieved from both complete genomes and capture exome libraries and, as a result, deeper insights were gained in different fields such as tumor biology and gametogenesis. Navin and colleagues developed a FACS-based method to isolate individual nuclei from different sections of a breast cancer sample and performed whole genome amplification followed by massive parallel sequencing. The WGA-products were sequenced at low coverage (Ë0.2Ã), sufficient to calculate copy number variations. However, their approach disadvantageously did not allow detecting somatic base mutations in single cells. Xu et al. (Cell 2012 148(5):886-95) and Hou et al. (Cell 2012 148(5):873-85) used mouth pipetting to isolate individual cells from a solid and hematopoietic tumor. Following amplification, exome capture was performed previous to high-throughput single cell sequencing which enabled both groups to analyze the genetic landscape of somatic base mutations in complex tumors. Sequencing depths between 30Ã and 40Ã could be obtained, but the majority of single-cell exomes were sequenced to a minimum depth of 5Ã. In order to assess true somatic mutations within the coding regions, the putative variation was filtered according to multiple criteria including the presence of the mutation in at least 3 to 5 different single cell samples. In contrast, Wang and colleagues used a revolutionary microfluidic system to separate individual sperm cells and performed sample processing in parallel that includes whole-genome amplification to improve amplification performance. Following WGA, high-throughput whole genome sequencing analysis was performed to determine homologous recombination and gene conversion events as well as de novo mutation rates of base substitutions and chromosome aneuploidies. Only 30 to 50% of the genome was represented due to an amplification bias at a sequence coverage of 6 to 8 times. In addition, Wang et al sequenced MDAed single sperm cells at lower genome coverage in a multiplex reaction to perform aneuploidy detection. WO2012108920 provides methods for non-invasive prenatal ploidy calling. DNA from single cells or fetal DNA from plasma samples obtained from pregnant women are amplified with Specific Target Amplification (STA) using hundreds to thousands of primer pairs in a semi-nested multiplex PCR. Amplicons are sequenced to determine the ploidy state of three chromosomes. Overall, complete genome analysis of the read count information enabled the genome wide detection of large-scale copy number aberrations in the genome and multiplexing of single exome sequencing enabled to detect individual mutations. However thus far, no accurate SNP-calling has been achieved from high-throughput massive sequencing data from a single cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Besides the lack of a method that can achieve high-throughput massive sequencing from small analytes of samples containing a limited amount of DNA, prior art methods also carry several drawbacks. For example, prior art methods require the development and design of SNP arrays or multiplex primer sets. In each instance, these methods require a detailed knowledge of the genome, a lot of time and computing efforts and several trial- and -error runs and optimizations in order to apply the method to a new genome. Furthermore, users need to obtain expensive arrays and primers/probes and the methods take a long time to perform, often necessitating multiple days from sample to result. In addition, prior art methods do not allow a high-throughput analysis of several samples at once, as arrays do not allow for large amounts of samples to be detected at the same time and multiplex PCR analysis, such as described in WO2012108920, does not allow for increasing the numbers of assays that can be run simultaneously. In contrast, the present invention provides a straightforward method for sequencing samples containing a low amount of target DNA, which is easily transferable for application to other genomes (e.g. unsequenced or partially sequenced genomes), allows for a high-throughput analysis and the sequencing of multiple samples at once, is low in operator time and cost and doesn't necessitate expensive consumables (such as arrays or thousand of specific primer sets). Generating a reduced representation library according to the methods of the invention can be performed in about 3-6 h, while next generation sequencing allows the sequencing to be performed in about 2-4 h (e.g. using the ion torrent platform). Thus, results can be obtained in about 5-10 h, which is much faster than prior art methods which often require multiple days. Especially in pre-implantation diagnostics, such a time reduction is a crucial advantage.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Considering the relative high cost and complexity to sequence and assemble a complete genome, several strategies have been developed that enable the rapid and cost-efficient genome wide discovery and genotyping of genetic variants (SNPs, INDELs, CNVs) from only partially sequenced genomes. Up to now, several new methods have been developed to reduce the sequencing effort and to restrict screening to a few thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at a highly reduced cost compared to whole genome sequencing or biased SNP-chip analyses. These methods have been aiming at constructing reduced representation libraries (or RRLs) to reduce the complexity of the genome before sequencing, by (1) enrichment for subsets of the genome either by capturing/targeting known fragments or (2) by the removal of highly repetitive, large complex fragments by restriction enzyme digestion. Examples of the latter method include complexity reduction of polymorphic sequences (CRoPS), multiplexed shotgun genotyping, restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and Genotyping-by-Sequencing or GBS. All methods are based on a straightforward and flexible restriction enzyme digestion and adaptor ligation, followed by deep sequencing, especially of use for those species without the reference genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach is straightforward, quick, highly specific and reproducible, and allows to access genomic regions that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. In species lacking a complete genome sequence, GBS allows a reference map to be constructed during the process of sample genotyping, while genome-enabled species can greatly benefit from the additional sequence information to improve the discovery of novel polymorphisms outside exons. GBS is particularly useful, as it enables us to reduce the genomic regions queried to a scalable number of loci, typically from a few thousands to 100,000 depending on the applications envisaged.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0032">In preferred embodiments amplifying is performed on the whole genome. Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) amplifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mutations and copy number variations across the entire genome for analysis.

      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0041">In another particular embodiment, selecting a subset of adaptor-ligated fragments comprises an amplification reaction using a selective primer. In particular, said selective primer contains from 1 to 5 selective nucleotides at its <b>3</b>â² end. Amplification using the selective primer only amplifies a subset of said adaptor-ligated fragments, namely those to which the selective primer hybridizes with sufficient stringency to allow its elongation.

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0042">Preferably the reduced representation library of the genetic material amplification product or the at least one cell's amplification product is produced by restriction digestion using at least one or a combination of restriction enzymes and subsequent adaptor ligation and size-selection by PCR-amplification, or any sequence library reduction method known in the art. The generation of a reduced representation library using fragmentation or restriction digestion is especially preferred, as it is a straightforward method that does not require the design and use of specific primers and/or probes. The reduced representation method can be applied easily to different genomes, even when having limited information about these genomes, without the need for complex (primer/probe/array) design considerations and reducing bias inherent in prior art methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0043">In another particular embodiment of the invention the sequence library reduction method may further comprise exon capture. Preferably the exon capture can be performed using any of exome sequencing methods know in the art or any targeted exome capture methods in the art. The latter can be an efficient strategy to selectively sequence the coding regions of the genome as a cheaper but still effective alternative to whole genome sequencing. Exons are short, functionally important sequences of DNA which represent the regions in genes that are translated into protein and the untranslated region (UTR) flanking them. UTRs are usually not included in exome studies. In the human genome there are about 180,000 exons: these constitute about 1% of the human genome, which translates to about 30 megabases (Mb) in length. It is estimated that the protein coding regions of the human genome constitute about 85% of the disease-causing mutations. In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention do not comprise exon capture. In another particular embodiment, the methods of the invention do not comprise bisulfite conversion.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0044">It has been found that the generation of a reduced representation library in combination with sequencing allows for larger sequencing depths, while maintaining genome-wide information. The amount of library reduction can be chosen by the skilled person dependent on the number of variants one wants to identify, the sequencing depth one wants to obtain for these variants, the available sequencing infrastructure and the sequencing costs. For example, very large reductions can be obtained by using stringent fragment selection. Such a strongly reduced representation library can be sequenced at high depths with minimal efforts. Nonetheless, they provide a genome-wide picture of variants, which can be used for e.g. ploidy calling or haplotype determination. In instances where genome-wide information should be available at a higher resolution, the skilled person can apply a less stringent reduction of the sequencing library. In a particular embodiment, the library reduction reduces the complexity at least 5 times. In another embodiment at least 10 times, in particular at least 50 times, more in particular at least 100 times. In yet another particular embodiment, the complexity is reduced at least 200 times, in particular at least 500 times, more in particular at least 1000 times. For example, a complexity reduction of 100 times means that the reduced representation library provides fragments covering about 1% of the genome, thereby strongly reducing sequencing efforts and allowing for larger sequencing depths of the remaining fragments. Nonetheless, as these fragments are scattered throughout the genome, the methods of the present invention provide genome-wide variant information.</p>

The goal of this approach is to identify the functional variation that is responsible for both mendelian and common diseases, e.g. such as Miller syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, without the high costs associated with whole-genome sequencing while maintaining high coverage in sequence depth.</p>

In addition, embodiments of the genotyping/haplotyping method of the present invention allow further characterization of drivers of haplotype diversity, primarily meiotic homologous recombination, but also mitotic recombination processes that may occur at elevated frequencies during tumorigenesis.

Thus, the scope of the expression âa system comprising means A and Bâ should not be limited to systems consisting only of components A and B. It means that with respect to the present invention, the relevant components of the system are A and B.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0169">Furthermore, the terms first, second, third and the like in the description and in the claims, are used for distinguishing between similar elements and not necessarily for describing a sequential or chronological order. It is to be understood that the terms so used are interchangeable under appropriate circumstances and that the embodiments of the invention described herein are capable of operation in other sequences than described or illustrated herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0170">In the drawings, like reference numerals indicate like features; and, a reference numeral appearing in more than one figure refers to the same element. The drawings and the following detailed descriptions show specific embodiments of the system and method for high-throughput genotyping by sequencing of single cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0171">Embodiments of the invention advantageously provide a method whereby at least a single cell DNA-isolation, with or without (n/mtDNA) amplification, can be combined with a complexity reduction of the target, e.g. single cell, DNA product, PCR-based amplification and next generation sequencing to produce a set of markers for genotyping and haplotyping complete genomes, or parts of it, of one to multiple cells. In addition to the novel combination of those steps, other embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide a novel method to filter by for instance bioinformatics/statistical means the artifacts generated by any whole- or partial-genome amplification (WGA or PGA respectively) or PCR of (reduced representation) sequencing library as well as sequencing method.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0172">The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the way biologists produce, analyze and interpret data. Although NGS platforms provide a cost-effective way to discover genome-wide variants from a single experiment, variants discovered by NGS need follow up validation due to the high error rates associated with various sequencing chemistries, in addition molecular analysis of single cells is challenging due to the low amounts of DNA available. Advantageously whole exome sequencing has been proposed as an affordable option compared to whole genome runs but it still requires follow up validation of all the novel exomic variants. Customarily, a consensus approach is used to overcome the systematic errors inherent to the sequencing technology, alignment and post alignment variant detection algorithms. However, the aforementioned approach warrants the use of multiple sequencing chemistry, multiple alignment tools, multiple variant callers which may not be viable in terms of time and money for individual investigators with limited informatics know-how. Biologists often lack the requisite training to deal with the huge amount of data produced by NGS runs and face difficulty in choosing from the list of freely available analytical tools for NGS data analysis. Hence, there is a need to customize the NGS data analysis pipeline to preferentially retain true variants by minimizing the incidence of false positives and make the choice of right analytical tools easier. To this end, embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide methods which can overcome these drawbacks, by providing advanced data correction methods, resulting in efficient and robust results.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0173">In addition, current single-cell genotyping problems, mainly due to allele drop out and drop in and/or preferential allele amplification bias following single-cell DNA-amplification methods can be largely overcome by deep sequencing according to preferred embodiments of the present invention to assure that each base pair is sampled with high redundancy. Embodiments of the method and related bioinformatic means advantageously enable one to identify those (rare) variants.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0174">A method according to embodiments of the invention can comprise at least one of the following steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0000">(i) Isolate single cells, DNA extraction and whole genome amplification (WGA). Briefly, when single or more cells get isolated by either picking of facsing cells, their nuclei containing the DNA and the mitochondrial DNA may then be amplified after cell lysis via genome wide amplification methods based on Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) or PCR-based genome-wide amplification. The result is a collection of fragments (large or small depending on the WGA-method used). This collection will then be processed for genotyping by sequencing (GBS) using restriction enzymes to construct a representation library (RRL) for high-throughput massive parallel sequencing. In an optional step, WGA of the single-cell DNA is omitted and only particular or desired fractions of the single-cell genome are amplified. These partial genome amplification (PGA) methods already significantly reduce the complexity of the single-cell genome before massively parallel sequencing/GBS. In another optional step, WGA and PGA of the single-cell DNA are omitted, and the single-cell DNA following cell-lysis is immediately processed for GBS (i.e. direct GBS). <br /> (ii) In silico digestion and enzyme selection. <br /> Restriction Enzymes can be selected preferably based upon following criteria: <br /> (1) predicted fragments length/nr of restriction sites, <br /> (2) the proportion of overlap with repetitive elements/methylation sites, <br /> (3) the putative SNP content, <br /> (4) the frequency of enzyme cutting, <br /> (5) predicted coverages of single-cell whole-genome amplification methods. </p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0175">Embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide means to construct and integrate âzero-coverageâ maps of a genome, i.e. maps highlighting those bases that are recurrently missed by sequences of single-cell amplification products.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0176">Each single-cell WGA-library sequenced for a particular amount of bases preferably produces a WGA-characteristic pattern of sequence coverage breadth and depth across the reference genome. E.g. single-cell PCR-based sequences recurrently miss more parts of the genome than sequences of multiple displacement amplified (MDAed) cells, but loci covered by single-cell PCR-based sequences are often covered deeper when compared to sequences of MDAed cells although both have been sequenced for the same amount of bases.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0177">Preferred embodiments of the invention provide a combination of Restriction Enzymes which preferably can be chosen to perform double or more digests to increase SNP discovery rates and thus increase the overall sensitivity of genotyping assays. When the enzymes are chosen, a digest is preferably prepared on the WGA samples followed by a fragment selection based upon size.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0000">(iii) Library construction and DNA sequencing</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0178">Next a purification of the chosen fragments is preferably performed followed by the addition of adaptors with (preferably) a single nucleotide overhang.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0000">(iv) SNP calling (e.g. identification and/or typing) and data handling</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0179">Results of using a method according to embodiments of the invention advantageously demonstrate that sequencing of single-cell WGA-products enables to determine digital frequencies of both alleles of a genetic marker (SNP, Indel . . . ) in the WGA-DNA. This has the advantage that e.g. SNPs in single cells may be typed more accurately when compared to conventional methods that use e.g. SNP-arrays. Indeed, preferential amplification of one allele of a heterozygous SNP will for instance result in a homozygous SNP-call when analyzed on a SNP-array because of the overwhelming signal of this preferentially amplified allele on the SNP-probes of the array. In contrast, in the sequencing approach the heterozygous SNP can be called with much more accuracy and confidence because e.g. hundreds to thousands of sequence reads report the preferentially amplified allele, but also a minority of reads will report the other allele of the SNP. Hence, this insight will allow a genotyping algorithm according to embodiments of the invention (see below) to tilt with statistical confidence the single-cell SNP-call towards a correct heterozygous instead of a false homozygous call. Similar rules apply when single-cell DNA is processed via PGA or direct GBS without intervening WGA/PGA. Although nucleotide substitutions can be identified in single-cell WGA-sequences, WGA-polymerases do not copy every base correctly during the amplification. Those errors may be mistaken for genuine nucleotide substitutions in the cell's genome. To investigate the base-fidelity of WGA-polymerases, the mismatch frequency of bases (having a base-call quality of 30) has been charted to the reference genome across the entire length of reads (having a mapping quality of 30). Strikingly, the mismatch frequency was significantly higher following single-cell PCR-based WGA-sequencing than following single-cell MDA-based or non-WGA DNA-sequencing (as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> which shows a two-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, with p-values &lt;2.2e-16), suggesting that certain PCR-based polymerase(s) make significantly more nucleotide copy-errors. The MDA's phi29 polymerase applies 3â²-&gt;5â² proofreading exonuclease activity and preliminary results indicate that the MDA-sequence error-rate is very low and almost comparable to conventional non-WGA DNA-sequencing when applying base-call and mapping qualities of 30 or more as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0180">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> moreover illustrates nucleotide mismatch frequency with the hg19-reference genome at each base of the read. Only bases with a base-call quality of 30 or more in reads having a minimum mapping quality of 30 were considered. It is clear that the single-cell PCR-based WGA-method introduces significantly more WGA-nucleotide errors than single-cell MDA-WGA and non-WGA DNA sequencing.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0181">Besides the fidelity of single-cell WGA-polymerases, also the precision of GBS-PCR polymerases and sequence chemistry reactions (e.g. bridge-PCR polymerases) have to be taken into account in the methods for genotyping following single-cell (WGA/PGA-)GBS.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0182">There are two main approaches for interpreting the sequence reads resulting from a single-cell (WGA/PGA-)GBS method according to preferred embodiments of the invention:</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0000">(1) Genotyping of the cells for a known set of polymorphic markers (SNPs, Indels, . . . ) or DNA-mutations covered by the single-cell (WGA/PGA-)GBS reads. Although the workflow can be applied for any nucleotide genetic variant that one wishes to genotype in the resulting single-cell sequences, current known SNP positions in the human genome hg19 can for instance be retrieved from databases as dbSNP or from the 1000 Genomes project. Similar databases exist for other species. The physical positions of the nucleotide genetic variants are preferably applied to generate pileups of the bases covering a particular position. Although there may be various algorithmic methods to achieve this, moreover preferred embodiments of the invention provides a pipeline based on e.g. Burrows Wheeler Alignment (BWA), SAMtools, Perl and R-scripts. In brief, for each position that is interrogated by the algorithm according to embodiments of the invention, a list of the amounts of A-, C-, G- and T-bases covering that position is preferably generated, the reference allele is preferably identified as well as all putative alternative (variant) alleles for that position. Thresholds on read mapping quality, base call quality, start and end of reads (e.g. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> indicates that the first and last bases of sequence reads should be omitted from the analysis as they contain more mismatch errors with the reference genome) can be applied to increase accuracy at a cost of coverage. If the reference and alternative allele of the SNP are known (e.g. cytosine and thymidine bases for the major and minor allele of the SNP in the general population respectively), the algorithm according to preferred embodiments of the invention advantageously will return the amount of sequence reads carrying the reference allele (e.g. <b>20</b> reads reporting a C-base at that position in the WGA-sequence) and similarly for the alternative allele (e.g. 980 reads reporting a T-base at that position in the WGA-sequence). Subsequently, for instance by using statistical testing these digital allelic counts can be evaluated to be significantly different from a situation where sequence error and/or putative WGA nucleotide-copy error would lead to a similar observation if the underlying SNP is homozygous. Based on subsequent P-value thresholds, heterozygous, homozygous and SNP-No calls may be established. Considering that WGA allele drop-out and preferential amplification artifacts often encompass multiple kilobases, SNPs or nucleotide genetic variants in the haplotype of a near variant are expected to have similar allelic variant frequencies in the single-cell WGA-GBS product. By applying this principle, according to preferred embodiments of the invention, advantageously the accuracy in the final genotype calls are further increased. Similar rules apply when single-cell DNA would undergo PGA-GBS or direct GBS without intervening WGA. For direct GBS, single-cell DNA was immediately digested following lysis, adaptors were ligated, DNA-fragments amplified by PCR, size-selected and the amplicons would be massively parallel sequenced. In this process, also allele amplification bias as well as nucleotide copy errors will be introduced when started from a single cell. Hence, the same algorithmic pipelines, according to embodiments of the invention, can be applied. As the algorithms, according to embodiments of the invention, enable detecting variant alleles with (ultra) low frequencies in the sequences, this pipeline has tremendous value for the detection of (ultra) low-grade genetic mosaicism in deep-sequenced samples as well. <br /> (2) De novo discovery of genetic variants in the cell. </p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0183">The principles presented above may be applied, according to embodiments of the invention, to all bases covered by the single-cell (WGA/PGA-)GBS for de novo discovery of SNPs in single-cell (WGA/PGA-)GBS products. In addition, these pipelines, according to preferred embodiments of the invention, may be supplemented with standard genetic variant callers (e.g. SAMtools with BCFtools, SOAPsnp, GATK, . . . ), but because of discrepancies in the frequencies of both alleles of a SNP in the single-cell amplification sequences, as well as WGA/PGA-GBS sequence errors, off-the-shelf available variant callers may produce less accurate single-cell genotypes.</p>

      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0191">The aim is to determine the genetic diversity within the Arabian purebred horses based on large scale SNP identification using GBS. Hereto, we collected 56 blood samples. DNA extractions were done with puregene kit (Qiagen). Sample concentrations were checked with the nanodrop and fragmentation was checked on agarose gel.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0192">In silico digestion based on the EquCab2 reference sequence using ApekI was performed using custom Perl/BioPerl scripts and predicted 2,937,656 fragments &lt;=500 bp or 3,766,233 fragments &lt;=1000 bp. This number reflects the efficiency of the genome complexity reduction. However this does not takes methylation patterns into consideration.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0193">DNA Libraries were prepared as described (Elshire et al. PLoS One. 2011 6(5):e19379. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0019379) with minor modifications. Restriction enzyme ApekI was used to reduce the genome complexity per sample. ApekI is a type II restriction endonuclease that recognizes the DNA target sequence 5â²-GACWGC-3â² (where W=A or T) and cleaves after the first G to produce fragments with three-base 5â²-overhangs. The adapters comprised a set of 56 different barcode-containing adapters and a common adapter and had a concentration of 0.3 ng/Î¼l instead of 0.6 ng/Î¼l. quality control was done for 4 samples, horse 1,2,9 and 10. Fragment size and the presence of adaptor dimmers were determined via the Agilent bioanalyzer 2100 (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). After determining the concentration of the samples via a picogreen test, the library was pair-end sequenced on one lane on the Illumina HiSeq2000.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0194">The FASTQ Illumina DNA sequences were processed via our data-analysis pipeline. With custom scripts data were sorted by sample based on the inline barcode (first 6-8 bp of read1). After trimming the reads were aligned with BWA v0.6.2 to EquCab2 and regions with a peak coverage &gt;5Ã identified with SNIFER and custom scripts. Sequence results showed on average 1.8 million reads per sample and on average 1Ã coverage per sample. Table 1 provides an overview of the data generated after sequencing the standard library of 56 Arabian horses. The sample number is shown in column 1. Column 2 shows the number of raw reads per sample, column 3 shows the processed reads per sample counting all region per sample larger than 80 bp.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0195">Fragments size distributions of those samples with ApekI showed a similar pattern amongst all samples (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The bam files of all 56 samples were combined and uploaded in the Integrative genomic viewer (IGV). SNPs were analysed by visual inspection (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>

This selective primer covers the entire common adapter, the 3â² restriction site and extends 2 bases into the insert region. Due to the 2 selective bases at the 3â² end of the primer, only a subset of adaptor-ligated fragments is amplified.</p>

      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0197">Furthermore, the library preparation was single-end sequenced on a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500. Raw sequence reads were processed similar to the above pipeline. Proper quality control was performed to check the correct organisation of the barcode and the restriction site. Poor quality reads, not confirming to our standards, were discarded. Overall, the results show a reduction by half of the genomic complexity in the selective library compared to this of the standard library (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) and an improvement of the average coverage up to 7Ã sequencing depth.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0198">SNP identification was done similar to the above example and subsequently visualised in the integrative genomic viewer (IGV) (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>). The efficiency of the primer is shown as there are fewer regions called in the selective than in the standard library.</p>

      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0199">A skin biopt of a male horse was taken and cultured in a standard incubator at 37Â° C. and 5% CO2. Fibroblasts of large T175 falcon flask were cultivated, washed and DNA extracted using the blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). The concentration was checked via the nanodrop and DNA fragmentation was checked on agarose gel.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0200">From the same cell line, a single fibroblast was used for further downstream processing. The cell was lysed and DNA amplified according to WO2011/157846.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0201">Library preparations were done using Pst1 restriction enzyme and further processed similar as the procedure in example 1. Pst1 was predicted to generate 968,569 fragments in the horse genome (The EquCab2 reference sequence) whereas ApeKI 4461178 fragments in total. Since we wanted to maximise the sequencing power, we decided to test the Pst1 digestion on the horse genome. The Pst1 enzyme recognises following sequence CTGCAAG and is methylation sensitive. Further in silico predictions estimated 238405 fragments and 388822 fragments smaller than 500 bp and 1000 bp, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0202">Sequencing was done of both multicell and single cell on an Illumina HiSeq2000. This resulted in 52K paired-end 100 bp reads for the multicell sample and 144K for the single cell sample. Sequence data were processed as described in Example 1. The coverage analyses revealed 15K and 19K regions with a depth of at least 5Ã, in respectively the multicell and single cell sample, of which 2585 regions were overlapping between both samples. The later is within the expectations given that the total number of predicted regions will be in the range of 250K of which we only observed less than 10% because of the low amount of bases sequenced per sample. Despite a low amount of bases is sequenced per sample, it can lead to local deep-sequencing coverage (e.g. &gt;5Ã in this example) by applying the RRL. Samtools v 0.1.17 was used for snp calling in both samples. The positions for which a snp call was observed in both samples were 99% concordant.</p>
