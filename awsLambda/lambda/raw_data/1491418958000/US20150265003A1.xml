      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE ENABLING EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views, an interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> for a basic flat shoe <b>20</b>, <b>122</b> is generally shown in the Figures. Many individuals, especially women, purchase shoes to match every outfit. Basic flat shoes are especially popular as they go well with many clothing styles. However, owning numerous pairs of shoes <b>22</b>, <b>122</b> can be expensive. The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> of the present invention allows the individual to match a single pair of basic flat shoes <b>22</b>, <b>122</b> with many different outfits at a fraction of the cost of owning many pairs of shoes <b>22</b>, <b>122</b>. The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> can be designed with any color, style, pattern, or texture. The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> is not only decorative, but also durable. Initial test results indicate the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, <b>120</b> of the present invention is both comfortable and durable when worn as a typical shoe and exposed to everyday conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> according to a first exemplary embodiment. The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed to cover the basic flat shoe <b>22</b>, for example the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. As explained in detail below, each interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed according to the size and geometry of the shoe <b>22</b> for which it is intended to cover. Thus, the size and geometry of the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> will vary in order to match the size and geometry of the shoe <b>22</b> it is intended to cover. In other words, the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> does not comprise a universal design made to cover shoes of all sizes and geometries.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The shoe <b>22</b> for which the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is made to cover typically includes a base portion <b>24</b>, a sole <b>26</b>, and no heel, or a very small heel <b>28</b>. The base portion <b>24</b> of the shoe <b>22</b> can be formed of fabric, leather, plastic, rubber, wood, metal, or any other material suitable for surrounding a foot. The base portion <b>24</b> extends longitudinally from a top edge <b>32</b> to a bottom edge <b>34</b>. The top edge <b>32</b> defines a foot opening for receiving the foot and the bottom edge <b>34</b> defines a sole <b>26</b> opening surrounding and attached to the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. The top edge <b>32</b> of the base portion <b>24</b> presents a height h<sub>1 </sub>relative to the ground and a length l<sub>1 </sub>extending from a toe region of the shoe <b>22</b> to a heel region of the shoe <b>22</b>. The toe region of the base portion <b>24</b> extends upwardly from the sole <b>26</b> and along and generally parallel to a portion of the sole <b>26</b> for surrounding and covering toes of the foot, and the heel region also extends upwardly from the sole <b>26</b> to surround a heel of the foot. The sole <b>26</b> and the heel <b>28</b> of the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> are typically formed of plastic, rubber, leather, wood, metal, or any other suitable material. The heel <b>28</b> of the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> extends not more than one inch outwardly from the sole <b>26</b>, but typically less than half an inch. The sole <b>26</b> and the heel <b>28</b> of the shoe <b>22</b> each present a flat surface for supporting the foot and engaging the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> includes a covering material <b>36</b>, typically formed of a decorative fabric, having a contour matching the contour of the base portion <b>24</b> of the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> for which the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed to cover. The fabric used to form the covering material <b>36</b> can comprise any color, pattern, style, or texture. Alternatively, another type of material having a decorative pattern can be used in place of the decorative fabric.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The covering material <b>36</b> typically only covers the base portion <b>24</b> of the shoe <b>22</b> and leaves the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b> exposed. The covering material <b>36</b> presents an outer surface which faces away from the shoe <b>22</b> and an inner surface which faces toward the shoe <b>22</b>. The covering material <b>36</b> extends longitudinally from a toe section for covering the toe region of the shoe <b>22</b> to a heel section for covering the heel region of the shoe <b>22</b>. The covering material <b>36</b> presents a length l<sub>2 </sub>extending from the toe section to the heel <b>28</b> section which is slightly greater than the length l<sub>1 </sub>of the shoe <b>22</b> for which it is designed. The covering material <b>36</b> also includes an upper edge <b>38</b> presenting an upper opening for aligning with the foot opening of the shoe <b>22</b> and a lower edge <b>40</b> presenting the lower opening for aligning with the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. The covering material <b>36</b> also presents a height h<sub>2 </sub>extending from the upper edge <b>38</b> to the ground. The height h<sub>2 </sub>of the covering material <b>36</b> around the entire upper opening is preferably slightly greater than or equal to the height h<sub>1 </sub>of the shoe <b>22</b> relative to the ground when the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is disposed on the shoe <b>22</b>. At least a portion of the toe section extends upwardly from the lower edge <b>40</b> and along and generally parallel to a portion of the lower opening for surrounding the toe region of the shoe <b>22</b>, and at least a portion of the heel section of the covering material <b>36</b> extends upwardly from the lower edge <b>40</b> and along a portion of the lower opening for surrounding the heel region of the shoe <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The covering material <b>36</b> is preferably smooth and free of wrinkles so that it presents an appearance which is almost indistinguishable from the appearance of a typical basic flat shoe. The covering material <b>36</b> fits securely against the base portion <b>24</b> of the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> and is relatively thin, which also allows it resemble a basic flat shoe. In one embodiment, the covering material <b>36</b> has a thickness of about 8 millimeters or less. The covering material <b>36</b> can optionally include grommets or other types of cut-outs, depending on the style of the shoe <b>22</b> which the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed to cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> also includes a protective sheet <b>42</b> secured to the entire inner surface of the covering material <b>36</b> and having a contour matching the contour of the covering material <b>36</b>. The protective sheet <b>42</b> is formed of polymer or plastic and shrinks tightly against an objection when heat is applied. For example, shrink wrap or shrink film can be used as the protective sheet <b>42</b>. The polymer or plastic used to form the protective sheet <b>42</b> can be cross-linked or non cross-linked. In one exemplary embodiment, the protective sheet <b>42</b> is formed of at least one of polyolefin, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, copolyester, ethylene-propylene, and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer. The protective sheet <b>42</b> typically has a thickness of not greater than 50 micrometers, for example 12.5 micrometers. The protective sheet <b>42</b> is especially useful during the method of manufacturing the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, which will be discussed further below. However, the protective sheet <b>42</b> can also provide increased durability. The protective sheet <b>42</b> is secured to the inner surface of the covering material <b>36</b> with an adhesive, referred to as a first adhesive, such as contact cement.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> of the first exemplary embodiment also includes at least one supporting strip <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> extending across the lower opening of the covering material <b>36</b> and typically attached to the protective sheet <b>42</b>. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> includes a first supporting strip <b>44</b> extending across the lower opening between the toe section and the heel section of the covering material <b>36</b>, and a second supporting strip <b>46</b> extending across the lower opening along at least a portion of the toe section of the covering material <b>36</b>. However, the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> could alternatively include supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> located in other areas. At least a portion of the lower opening remains open to expose the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Each supporting strip <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> of the exemplary embodiment has a length l<sub>3 </sub>less than one third of the length l<sub>2 </sub>of the covering material <b>36</b>. The supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are typically formed of an elastic material, but can be formed of another type of material. Each supporting strip <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> includes an interior surface facing toward the upper opening of the covering material <b>36</b> and an exterior surface facing outwardly of the lower opening of the covering material <b>36</b>. The opposite ends of the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are typically attached to the protective sheet <b>42</b> on opposite sides of the lower opening with a second adhesive. The second adhesive can be the same as or different from the first adhesive used to attach the protective sheet <b>42</b> to the covering material <b>46</b>. In one alternate embodiment, the protective sheet <b>42</b> extends along the interior surface of the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. In yet another embodiment, the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are formed of the covering material <b>36</b> and the protective sheet <b>42</b> which extend across the lower opening. The supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> could also be formed of the covering material <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Preferably, at least one decorative item <b>50</b> is attached to the covering material <b>36</b>, such as trim or ribbon, tulle, sequins, buttons, paint, additional fabric, or other additional materials. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a ribbon is adhered to the covering material <b>36</b> along the upper edge <b>38</b> and around a periphery of the upper opening of the covering material <b>36</b>, and also along the lower edge <b>40</b> of the covering material <b>36</b>. The ribbon also forms a bow along the top of the toe section of the covering material <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">To increase durability of the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>, rubber can be applied to surfaces of the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> which will be in contact with the ground when an individual wears the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, the rubber is applied to a bottom surface of the lower edge <b>40</b> of the covering material <b>36</b> around a periphery of the lower opening. The rubber <b>30</b> can also be applied to the exterior surfaces of the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. A protective coating of polyurethane is also preferably applied to the outer surface of the covering material <b>36</b> to increase durability.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> including the covering material <b>36</b>, the protective sheet <b>42</b>, and the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is removable from the shoe <b>22</b> for which it is designed to cover. An individual can thus use a plurality of the interchangeable shoe skins <b>20</b> with a single pair of shoes <b>22</b>. For example, the individual can own numerous pairs of the interchangeable shoe skins <b>20</b> having many different designs or decorative features to match many different outfits.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Another aspect of the invention provides a method of manufacturing the decorative and durable interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The method first includes providing the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> for which the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed to cover, such as the basic flat shoe <b>22</b> described above. The method next includes covering the entire basic flat shoe <b>22</b> including the base portion <b>24</b>, the foot opening, the sole <b>26</b>, and the heel <b>28</b> with the protective sheet <b>42</b>. The protective sheet <b>42</b> is preferably formed of plastic or polymer which shrinks when heat is applied and has a thickness of not greater than 50 micrometers. In the exemplary embodiment, shrink wrap or shrink film is used as the protective sheet <b>42</b>. The method next includes conforming the protective sheet <b>42</b> to the contour of the basic flat shoe <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. This step typically includes heating the protective sheet <b>42</b> such that the protective sheet <b>42</b> shrinks and tightly conforms to all of the surfaces of the shoe <b>22</b>. The protective sheet <b>42</b> can also be pressed onto the shoe <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The method next includes providing the covering material <b>36</b>, and applying adhesive, referred to as a first adhesive to at least one of the protective sheet <b>42</b> and the inner surface of the covering material <b>36</b>. The covering material <b>36</b> is typically formed of decorative fabric, but may be formed of another material. The adhesive preferably includes contact cement, but may include glue or another type of fastener. The step of applying the adhesive can include spreading the adhesive along both the protective sheet <b>42</b> and the covering material <b>36</b>, and preferably over a majority of the surface area of the protective sheet <b>42</b> and the covering material <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">After applying the adhesive, the method includes disposing the covering material <b>36</b> on the protective sheet <b>42</b> to secure the covering material <b>36</b> to the protective sheet <b>42</b>. The step of disposing the covering material <b>36</b> on the protective sheet <b>42</b> typically includes covering the entire shoe <b>22</b> with the covering material <b>36</b>, including the entire base portion <b>24</b>, the foot opening, the sole <b>26</b>, and the heel <b>28</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The method then includes conforming the covering material <b>36</b> to the contour of at least the base portion <b>24</b> of the shoe <b>22</b> such that the covering material <b>36</b> presents the toe section and the heel section. This step can include applying pressure along the outer surface of the covering material <b>36</b>, and smoothing the covering material <b>36</b> so that the covering material <b>36</b> is free of wrinkles. After smoothing the covering material <b>36</b>, the method includes removing excess covering material <b>36</b> that extends beyond the contour of the base portion <b>24</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. For example, the removing step can include cutting out the upper opening aligned with the foot opening of the shoe <b>22</b> and cutting out the lower opening aligned with the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. The step of removing excess covering material <b>36</b> should be done so that the height h<sub>2 </sub>of the upper edge <b>38</b> of the covering material <b>36</b> relative to the ground is equal to or greater than the height h<sub>1 </sub>of the shoe <b>22</b> when the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is disposed on the shoe <b>22</b>. When removing the excess material, the manufacturer should also make sure the covering material <b>36</b> has a length l<sub>2 </sub>extending along the openings from the toe section to the heel section which is greater than the length l<sub>1 </sub>of the shoe <b>22</b>. After removing the excess material, the shoe <b>22</b> for which the interchangeable shoe skin <b>20</b> is designed can be removed through the upper opening of the covering material <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The method also includes providing the at least one supporting strip <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> which extends across the width of the lower opening and the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the method includes disposing the first supporting strip <b>44</b> across the lower opening between the toe section and the heel section, and disposing the second supporting strip <b>46</b> across the lower opening and along the toe section. However, at least a portion the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>, and preferably the majority of the sole <b>26</b>, remains exposed to the ground. The opposite ends of the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> are attached to the protective sheet <b>42</b> along the inner surface of the covering material <b>36</b>, on opposite sides of the lower opening. In an alternative embodiment, the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> can be attached to the outer surface of the covering material <b>36</b> if the covering material <b>36</b> and the protective material extend along the sole <b>26</b> of the shoe <b>22</b>. In another embodiment, the at least one supporting strip <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is provided by the covering material <b>36</b>, with or without the attached protective sheet <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The method preferably includes applying at least one decorative item <b>50</b> to the covering material <b>36</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, this step includes applying trim or ribbon along the upper edge <b>38</b> of the covering material <b>36</b> and around a periphery of the upper opening. The step of applying the decorative item <b>50</b> typically includes adhering the decorative items <b>50</b> to the covering material <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The method also preferably includes applying the rubber to surfaces of the covering material <b>36</b> which will contact the ground, for example to the bottom surface of the lower edge <b>40</b> of the covering material <b>36</b> around the periphery of the lower opening. In the exemplary embodiment, this step includes dipping the covering material <b>36</b> in the rubber when the rubber is in a liquid state, and allowing the rubber to solidify on the covering material <b>36</b>. The method can also include dipping the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> in the rubber when the rubber is in a liquid state and allowing the rubber to solidify on the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>. The last step of the method typically includes applying a protective coating of polyurethane to the outer surface of the covering material <b>36</b>. This protective coating can be applied, for example, by spraying or brushing.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 5-7</figref> illustrate the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> according to another exemplary embodiment, wherein like numbers illustrate elements corresponding to those of <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> of the second exemplary embodiment includes the covering material <b>136</b>, protective sheet <b>142</b>, adhesives, protective coating, and optional decorative elements <b>150</b>, just like the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. However, in this embodiment, instead of the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> includes a supporting sole portion <b>152</b> formed of neoprene disposed on the covering material <b>136</b> opposite the upper opening for aligning with and covering the entire sole <b>126</b> of the shoe <b>122</b>. Neoprene is also referred to as polychloroprene, and is a family of synthetic rubbers produced by polymerization of chloroprene. Any type of neoprene can be used to form the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> of the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b>. The supporting sole portion <b>152</b> extends continuously along the lower edge <b>140</b> of the covering material <b>136</b> and continuously along the entire length l<sub>2 </sub>of the covering material <b>136</b>. The supporting sole portion <b>152</b> includes an interior surface facing toward the upper opening of the covering material <b>136</b> and an exterior surface facing opposite the interior surface. The interior surface of the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> is attached to the covering material <b>136</b> with the second adhesive, which can be the same as or different from the first adhesive used to attach the covering material <b>136</b> to the protective sheet <b>142</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The invention also provides the method of manufacturing the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> of the second embodiment. Like the first embodiment, the method of the second embodiment includes providing the shoe <b>122</b>, such as a basic flat shoe, covering the shoe <b>120</b> with the protective sheet <b>142</b>, conforming the protective sheet <b>142</b> to the contour of the shoe <b>122</b>, securing the covering material <b>136</b> to the protective sheet <b>142</b>, conforming the covering material <b>136</b> to the contour of the shoe <b>122</b>, and forming the upper opening in the covering material <b>136</b> aligned with the foot opening of the shoe <b>122</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">However, in this embodiment, the method first includes stuffing the base portion <b>124</b> of the shoe <b>122</b> with a forming material, which can be any type of stuffing or material capable of retaining the shape of the shoe <b>122</b> during the manufacturing process. In addition, the step of conforming the protective sheet <b>142</b> to the contour of the shoe <b>122</b> includes stapling the protective sheet <b>142</b> to the base portion <b>124</b> of the shoe <b>122</b>, and then heating the protective sheet <b>142</b>. After the protective sheet <b>142</b> is conformed to the shoe <b>122</b>, the staples can be removed, and the covering material <b>136</b> is attached to the protective sheet <b>142</b>. Preferably, the method includes first conforming the covering material <b>136</b> to the toe region of the shoe <b>122</b>, and working toward the heel region. In addition, when cutting out the upper opening aligned with the foot opening of the shoe <b>122</b>, approximately Â¼ inch of the covering material <b>136</b> extending past the foot opening should be left around and along the foot opening. This excess material can optionally be cut with decorative scissors, or decorative trim can be attached to the excess material. When trimming excess material of the covering material <b>136</b>, standard scissors are typically used for the circular areas in the toe region, but the decorative scissors, such as scissors which cut a non-linear pattern, can be used to trim the other edges.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Furthermore, as discussed above, instead of attaching the supporting strips <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> to the covering material <b>136</b>, the method includes disposing the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> formed of neoprene on the covering material <b>136</b> opposite the upper opening. This process first includes cutting the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> having a shape equal to or greater than the sole of the shoe from a sheet of neoprene. Next, the second adhesive is applied to an interior surface of the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> and/or the covering material <b>136</b> disposed along the sole <b>126</b> of the shoe <b>122</b>. The method then includes attaching the interior surface of the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> to the covering material <b>136</b> with the second adhesive such that the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> extends continuously along the lower edge <b>140</b> of the covering material <b>136</b> and continuously along the length l<sub>2 </sub>of the covering material <b>136</b>. The protective coating, preferably at least two coats, can be applied to the covering material <b>136</b> either before or after the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> is attached.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> of the second embodiment was also tested and found to be comfortable and durable when worn as a typical shoe and exposed to everyday conditions. A specific test was conducted wherein an individual wore the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> over a standard flat shoe for approximately 60 hours. During the 60 hours, the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> was exposed to various conditions, such as rain, mud, gravel, cement, and grass. At the end of the testing period, the supporting sole portion <b>152</b> remained attached to the covering material <b>136</b> and in good condition. The individual found the interchangeable shoe skin <b>120</b> to be comfortable, easy to place over their basic flat shoe, and easy to remove.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described while within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
