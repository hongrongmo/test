      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to coated ceramic cutting tools, and particularly, to Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based cutting tools having at least a layer of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating formed by PVD method.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">With high resistance high temperature, wear, superior hot hardness and chemical stability, ceramic cutting tools can be used to machine extremely hard and wear-resistant materials. These unique mechanical properties can allow ceramic cutting tools to be used to machine metals at much higher cutting speeds than the carbide tools even in dry machining conditions. The most commonly used ceramic materials for cutting tools are alumina and silicon nitride. Alumina based materials are excellent candidates for cutting tools because of their good chemical stability and abrasion resistance at high temperature. However, intrinsic brittleness, low strength and low thermal shock resistance of the alumina based ceramic cutting tools limit their applications. Silicon nitride based cutting tools, which have good wear resistance, high hardness, excellent high-temperature properties, and most importantly, better fracture toughness than the alumina based cutting tools, are widely used in machining metals, more particularly for machining cast iron at high speeds.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, in high speed machining cast iron using Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> tools under dry cutting conditions, when the cutting speed exceeds 1500 surface feet per minute (sfm), the temperature at contact faces of the cutting inserts may be over 1000 Â°C due to the heat generated by dramatic friction between the cutting tools and the workpiece. The chemical reaction between silicon nitride and iron would reduce the stablity of the cutting tools. In addition, serious diffusion-related crater wear can be usually observed in this application. This crater wear is believed resulting from the chemical affinity between Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> elements and iron alloy components that promotes tribo-chemical reactions. During high speed machining, tipping failure may occur due to local chemical wear Therefore, chemical stablity of the cutting tool material is very important under high-speed, dry machining conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Covering the Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> based ceramic cutting tools with thin films is a feasible method to improve chemical stability. Until now, various coatings have been successfully applied on cutting tools and inserts where the tool materials are high speed steels or cemented carbide, from single, binary coatings to complex multi-component and multi-layer configurations. Among them, the most commonly used coating materials for cutting tools are transition metal nitrides, such as TiN and TiAlN. TiN coating is good for protecting cutting tools due to its high hardness and wear resistance. However, the application of TiN coating is limited to low temperatures since it tends to be oxidized at temperatures above 600Â°C. The oxidation resistance of TiAlN coating is much higher than that of TiN with the formation of a dense and strongly adhesive Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Although the oxidation temperature of TiAlN coating can be improved to 800Â°C, it is still not good enough for high-speed cutting with temperatures over 1000Â°C. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has excellent wear resistance, high hot hardness and chemical stability at elevated temperatures above 1000 Â°C . Having such various advantages, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a good candidate material for protective coating(s) on cutting tools to improve their productivity of machining operations, especially at high temperature under high-speed and dry machining conditions.</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The most commonly used methods for producing coating layers on cutting tools are chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD). So far, due to the requirement for high deposition temperature and insulating attribute of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the mostly used technique for producing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and their multi-layered coatings is chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> cutting tools which are also insulating, the main technique to produce Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating(s) is also CVD method. However, the CVD processes are normally operated at temperatures in excess of 1000Â°C, due to the high deposition temperatures, coatings produced by CVD technique have thermal cracks, due to thermal stresses caused by the thermal expansion mismatch between the coating and the substrate as the tool is cooled down from the processing temperature to the room temperature. During cutting process, the thermal crack may lead to breakage of the coating or chipping.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Over the last 30 years, the introduction of PVD coatings for cutting tools in the metal cutting industry is one of the main success stories in the industrial application of modern coating technology. The first PVD coating material for commercial application on cutting tools was TiN in the early 1980s. Since the 1990s most cutting tools have been PVD coated particularly in applications where sharp edges are required, e.g. threading, grooving, end-milling, etc. and in cutting applications that have a high demand for a tough cutting edge, e.g. drilling.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Several PVD techniques have been developed so far. For the application of coatings on cutting tools, the mainly used techniques are: cathodic arc deposition (or called arc ion plating), sputter deposition (or called magnetron sputtering), pulsed laser deposition and electron beam physical vapor deposition. One of the PVD methods to produce insulating films is radio frequency (RF) sputtering. This method can produce highly uniform films with good adherence to the substrate. However, extremely low deposition rate caused by the small DC-voltage which is generated at the target and ever growing technique problems for increasing substrate sizes have limited the use of these layers to a few applications because of the high coating costs.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another way, the DC sputtering, the which is used to grow oxides, nitrides and carbides due to the simplicity of the process, and it can forms aluminum flims in a reactive argon-oxygen gas mixture. But this method cannot be performed as a stable long-term mode. Because the insulating layers are deposited not only on the substrate but equally on the chamber walls and on regions of the sputter targets. Here electric charges will occur that, in turn, result in arcing and therefore in a damage of the layers.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The utilization of bipolar pulsed power on the cathode enables deposition of insulation coating without target poisoning and arcing. And the deposition rate can be enhanced as compared with RF sputtering. By utilizing the bipolar pulsed power (i.e., alternatively applying a positive and negative voltage), the surface is continuously discharged. The effect of the positive pulse is to draw electrons in the plasma toward the target where they can neutralize the accumulated Ar<sup>+</sup> ions. If the pulse duration (pulse width) and the height of the positive pulse are just enough to produce an electron current that can discharge all the accumulated Ar<sup>+</sup> ions on the target, the repelling effect on the incoming Ar<sup>+</sup> ions when the target voltage turns negative is eliminated. This keeps the sputtering process going and the discharge plasma can be self-maintaining. Furthermore, application of the positive pulse can lead to preferential sputtering of the poisoned spots on the target. This helps to eliminate target poisoning and arcing. Therefore, reactive magnetron sputtering deposition of oxide compounds or sputtering deposition of oxide compounds such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and ZnO, is enabled by the introduction of bipolar pulsed-dc power on the sputtering cathode.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">With the invention and development of the bipolar pulsed DMS (Dual Magnetron Sputtering) technique, it becomes possible to produce crystalline insulating layers such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by PVD methods. In the bipolar dual magnetron system, two magnetrons alternately act as anode and cathode and, hence, preserve a metallic anode over long process times. Bipolar pulsed dual magnetron sputtering enables high power input into the plasma during the pulsed, thus creating dense plasma with highly energetic particles. When the frequencies are high enough, possible electron charging on the insulating layers will be suppressed and the otherwise troublesome phenomenon of "arcing" will be limited.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The bipolar pulsed DMS technique provides wide opportunities for depositing and producing high-quality, well-adherent, Î±-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> thin hard films on cutting tools. In addition, the technique involves stable process conditions within a large process window as compared to other sputtering techniques, as well as high deposition rate for insulating coatings such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. According to <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="US6673430B2"><text>US 6,673,430 B2</text></patcit> and <patcit id="pcit-00002" dnum="US6423403B2"><text>US 6,423,403 B2</text></patcit>, a Î³-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer with grain size less than 0.1 Âµm and free of cracks and halogen impurities is deposited utilizing a DMS technique at substrate temperatures in the range 450Â°C to 700Â°C, preferably at 550Â°C to 650Â°C.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Another possible PVD method for depositing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings on cutting tools is by the present invention of dual magnetron sputtering metal-doped conductive Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic targets in an Ar gas or Ar+O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. In this technique, the nonconductive Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic is doped by metals such as Al, Ti, Cr, Nb, Pt or conductive ceramics such as SiC. The conductive doped Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> ceramic target is used as cathode applied with an asymmetrical bipolar pulsed power. Both of these two techniques had not been utilized previously for depositing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coating layers on Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>-based cutting tools.</p>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The present invention is Si3N4-based ceramic, which mainly consists of Si3N4, including toughening additives and sintering additives. The toughing additive(s) is (are) one or several compound(s) in TiN, TiC, MoSi2, SiC, TiCN, And TiB2 etc. and the sintering additives(s) is (are) one or several compound(s) in Si02, A1203, MgO, Y203, Zr02, and La203 etc.. The content of sintering additives is general about 1-25wt%, and the optimal content is 1-5wt%. It can improve the strength, fracture toughness, and the property of wear resistance of the substrate materials to a great extent by adding toughening additives and sintering additives. In addition, through adding conductive phase, the composite ceramic can conduct of electricity, so the hard coating can be deposited on them by the conventional PVD methods.</p>
    <heading id="h-00006-en">
      <b>Enfolded hard coating</b>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In the present invention, the coating includes one or more layers of which at least one layer is Al2O3 coating. The A1203 layer is mainly composed of Al and O. According to different depositing temperature, the phase structure can be amorphous or nanocrystalline Î±-, Î³-, or Îº- A1203, or the mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline. The other coatings are high temperature resistance hard nitride coatings (if exist), which may be binary nitride (TiN, CrN, etc.), ternary nitride (TiCN, TiAIN, etc.), or multi-components nitride (TiSiN, TiAISiN, TiAlCrYN, etc.), and it also may be their multi-layers or nano-composite layers. The whole thickness of the coating in the present invention is general about 1-20 Âµm, the optimal thickness is 2-10Âµm. This mainly because when the thickness of the coating falls below 1 Âµm, the coating may have poor wear resistance and may be easily worn out during cutting process. Thus, the cutting performance and tool life of the cutting tools cannot be improved. However, when the coating thickness is over 20 Âµm, the adhesion strength between the substrate and the coating material becomes weak due to high compressive residual stress and the coating may crack or spall off from the substrate or even be damaged. This may shorten the life of the cutting tools. The thickness of the coating layers can be adjusted by controlling the deposition time.</p>
    <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In the present invention the cutting tool coating is fabricated by PVD technique. Before coating deposition, the surfaces of the substrate are plasma cleaned and etched by plasma etching utilizing a high-frequency bipolar pulsed bias voltage or an ion source plasma etching equipment for 2-60 min, the optimal etching time of which is 5-30 min. The surface is smooth and then after wet/dry blasting and cleaned, moved into a vacuum chamber of the PVD coating equipment.</p>
    <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In the present invention, the Al2O3 coating is fabricated by bipolar pulsed DMS technique or dual magnetron sputtering conductive Al2O3 ceramic target. In bipolar pulsed DMS technique, a symmetrical bipolar pulsed power is applied on the cathode target. The material of the cathode is pure Al target. The Al2O3 layer is fabricated by reactive sputtering of Al target in 02 gas with process pressure of 0.1-2 Pa at substrate temperature of 300-700Â°C. In dual magnetron sputtering conductive Al2O3 ceramic targets technique, an asymmetrical bipolar pulsed power with reversed positive voltage is applied on the cathode target. The material of the cathode is a conductive A1203 ceramic target that is made by adding conductive materials. The conductive additives include metal, such as Al, Ti, Cr, Nb, Pt, etc., and conductive ceramic, such as SiC, TiC, TiN, TiCN, TiB2, etc., whose content is 0.1-20wt% in the ceramic target. During deposition, The pressure of Ar gas or a gas mixture of Ar and 02 is 0.1-2 Pa, the substrate temperature is 300-700Â°C. A bipolar pulsed power is applied, with positive and negative bias voltage in the range of 20-50V and 20-300V, respectively. According to different deposition temperature, the amorphous or nanocrystalline Al2O3 coating can be obtained. Generally, when the substrate temperature is 300-500Â°C, the coating phase is mainly amorphous phase, when the substrate temperature is 500-700 Â°C, the coating phase is main nanocrystalline. The thickness of the Al2O3 coatings can be adjusted by controlling the deposition time.</p>

    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
      <ol>
        <li>(1) The coating layer consisting of single Al2O3 coating layer with thickness of 1-10Âµm. The Al2O3 coating layer mainly serves as the thermal and chemical barriers, promising the stability of the strength of blades during turning process.</li>
        <li>(2) Multilayer coatings. The coating layer consists of at least two layers (i.e. a hard nitride layer and an A1203 coating layer). In this coating structure, the Al2O3 coating layer provides the thermal and chemical barrier, beneath which is a hard nitride interlayer adjacent to the substrate, which can provide the high hardness, excellent strength and adhension between the coating and the substrate in the temperature range of 600-1200 Â°C. Meanwhile the coating serves as the transition interlayer from the substrate to the A1203 coating layer, in order to adjust the distribution of internal stress and improve anti-fatigue performance.</li>
        <li>(3) Multilayer or nanomultilayer coatings. It is obtained by hard nitride layers and Al2O3 layers alternately deposition. There are 4 to tens of hundreds of alternative hard nitride layer and A1203 coating layer with thickness range of 5-20 nm to several Âµm. The A1203 coating layer mainly serves as the thermal and chemical barriers, promising the stability of the strength of blades during turning process. More frequently, there is a gold TiN top layer for identifying the wear of coated cutting tools by naked eyes during machining process. The thickness of the hard nitride layer, A1203 layer, and TiN layer is in the range of 1-10 Âµm, 1-10 Âµm, and 1-2 Âµm, respectively. The thickness of the Al2O3 layer and nitride layer is controlled by controlling the deposition time.</li>
