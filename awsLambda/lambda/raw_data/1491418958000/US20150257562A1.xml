      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application is related to Design Application No. 29/484,453, filed on Mar. 10, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">There are a number of circumstances where it may be desirable to carry a small set of utensils such as a knife, fork and spoon. The present invention relates generally to a utensil carrying case suitable for use in such circumstances and to specific utensils or a utensil set suitable for storage in such a case.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In one aspect, a clamshell style utensil carrying case is described. The carrying case includes a pair of complementary housing members (e.g. upper and lower housing members) that are coupled together by a double hinge on one side and a latch that releasably secures free sides of the housing members. Each housing member has a utensil support arranged to hold an associated utensil (e.g., a spoon or fork) in place. Additionally, a support stand projects from a spine (web) portion of the double hinge and is arranged to hold a third utensil (e.g., a knife) When the casing is in a closed position the housing members encase the utensils, while in an open position the utensils may be displayed substantially side by side. In some preferred embodiments, the support stand holds the third utensil (e.g., knife) in an elevated position relative to the first and second utensils when the case is in the open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The utensil supports are preferably arranged such that the heads of their associated utensils face in opposite direction. To help minimize the visual thickness of the case the interior surface of each housing member may include a depression in the region adjacent the head end of its held utensil. The depressions form corresponding bulges in the exterior surfaces of the housing members. Since the head end of many utensils (e.g., spoons and forks) have an effective height that can be significantly greater than the thickness of the handle, the bulgesâwhich are located on opposite ends and opposite sides of the caseâprovide additional room for the utensil heads without unduly impacting the visual height of the case.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In some embodiments, the hinges in the double hinge may take the form of living hinges and the case may be formed from a material conductive to the formation of living hinges such as polypropylene.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some embodiments the support stand carried by the hinge spine includes a pair of projecting side walls arranged to hold the third utensil in place. The stand may optionally include a registration nub located between the projecting side walls that is arranged to position the third utensil relative to the stand. In one particular implementation, the registration nub is arranged to mate with a bottle opener feature in a knife held by the stand.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A separate described invention relates to a plastic knife with a bottle opener feature. Plastic that integrally forms the knife bland and handle is molded around a metal bottle opener feature to hold the bottle opener in place. The plastic knife may be formed from a variety of different materials. By way of example, glass filled nylon works well.</p>

      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an open carrying case <b>100</b> that contains a knife <b>150</b>, a fork <b>153</b> and a spoon <b>156</b>. The knife <b>150</b> is supported on a utensil support stand <b>160</b>. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the open carrying case <b>100</b> without the utensils <b>150</b>, <b>153</b> and <b>156</b> and with the utensil support stand <b>160</b> removed. <figref>FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>3</b>(<i>d</i>) are side, end, top perspective and bottom perspective views respectively of the carrying case in a closed position illustrating its relatively thin visual appearance. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the carrying case in an open position.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The carrying case <b>100</b> includes a pair of housing members <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> that are pivotally coupled by a double hinge <b>108</b>. The double hinge <b>108</b> carries a stand pedestal <b>162</b> onto which the support stand <b>160</b> may be placed. The housing members each include a base or floor <b>130</b>, a sidewall <b>132</b>, and a depression <b>134</b> in the floor <b>130</b> in the region where the head of a utensil such as spoon <b>156</b> or fork <b>153</b> is expected to rest. The depressions <b>134</b> on the interior surface of the housing floor provide corresponding bulges <b>135</b> on the exterior surface of the housing members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> as seen in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Each housing member <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> also includes a number of utensil support features including handle guide <b>120</b>, snap catches <b>123</b> and positioning features <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> which in the illustrated embodiment take the form of small ridges or nubs.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">During use, a utensil such a fork <b>153</b> or spoon <b>156</b> is set in each housing member <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The head of utensil is placed in the region of depression <b>134</b> and the handle extends towards handle guide <b>132</b>. The longitudinal position of the spoon and fork is constrained by handle guide <b>120</b> on one end, and a utensil head stop <b>136</b> on the other. The utensil head stop <b>136</b> is formed as an integral extension of the sidewall <b>132</b> at one end of each housing member <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The spacing and positioning of the snap catches <b>123</b> is such that when the spoon or fork is properly placed in the housing member, the handle will snap into the snap catches <b>123</b> to thereby hold the utensil in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">It should be appreciated that the height of the head end of the spoon <b>156</b> and fork <b>153</b> relative to the longitudinal axes of the utensils is substantially greater than the thicknesses of their handles. The geometry of the spoon and fork is such that their head ends dip below the centerline of the handle near the junction of the handle and head, and then extend significantly above the centerline towards the distal tip, with the distal tips <b>154</b>, <b>157</b> having the greatest deviation from the centerline.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The carrying case <b>100</b> is designed to have a visually thin appearance and there are several features that contribute to the relatively thin appearance. Initially, it can be seen that the utensils <b>153</b>, <b>156</b> are oriented with their heads located at opposite ends of the case <b>100</b>. The spoon and fork are positioned such that their distal tips <b>154</b>, <b>157</b> extend beyond the ends of the knife <b>150</b>. Since the tips <b>154</b>, <b>157</b> don't overlap with either the knife <b>150</b> or each other, the case <b>100</b> can be made thinner than would be needed if there was such overlap. Furthermore, the depressions/bulges <b>134</b>, <b>135</b> are gently rounded in two dimensions to present pleasant visual lines with the apex of the depressions being located in the region where the lowest part of the utensil head is expected to rest. This allows a still thinner case over the vast majority of the case's surface area since the depressions/bulges are positioned only where the extra thickness is needed. The depressions /bulges are also positioned inwards from the periphery of the case so that from many angles (e.g. looking downwards on the case) the viewer only sees the primary sides of the housing members and not the bulges, which can further add to the perceived visual thinness. Minimizing the edge thickness of the case also helps the case easily slide into a container such as a backpack or pocket purse.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The shape of the budges may vary in accordance with the needs of a particular design. Preferably, the bulges are localized and do not extend to any of the edges of the case and do not extend significantly past the lengthwise centerline of the case so they only minimally overlap vertically. In other embodiments, the bulges may be arranged such that they do not extend past the lengthwise centerline such that there is no vertical overlap. These aspects help reduce the edge thickness, the overall thickness and the visual thicknesses of the case. For visual enhancement, the bulges may taper more slowly from the apex towards the casing centerline than they do towards the end and side edges as can be seen in <figref>FIGS. 3(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>3</b>(<i>c</i>) and <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The housing members <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> may also include various positioning features <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> to help position the utensils <b>153</b>, <b>156</b> relative to the housing members. In the illustrated embodiment, positioning ridge <b>126</b> is located adjacent the handle guide <b>120</b> to lift the proximal end of spoon/fork handle off of the floor <b>130</b>. Slightly raising the handle in this manner helps lower the distal tips <b>157</b>, <b>154</b> of the spoon and fork. The nubs also elevate the handles of the utensils slightly off the floors of the housing members so that a user is more easily able to grab the handles when removing the utensils. Positioning nubs <b>127</b> are arranged to serve as supports that cooperate with snap catches <b>123</b> to tightly hold the utensils in place. It should be appreciated that the geometry of the positioning features can be widely varied without diminishing their effectiveness.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In the illustrated embodiment, each utensil is held in place by two sets of opposing snaps. This was done so that if one snap were to be broken off, there would still be a second set to hold the utensil in place. Two sets of snaps also permits the use of snaps having a reduced holding force per individual snap. This means snap deflection is minimized and snap life maximized Although two sets of snaps are illustrated, it should be appreciated that in other embodiments, there could simply be one set of snap per utensil, or more than two.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The housing members <b>103</b> are coupled by a double hinge <b>108</b>. The double hinge includes a âspineâ or âwebâ <b>109</b> between a pair of hinges <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> that are coupled to the housing members <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> respectively. The hinges <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may take any suitable form. In the illustrated example, the hinges are living hinges that are integrally formed from plastic with the housing members and the hinge spine <b>109</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In the illustrated embodiment, a stand pedestal <b>162</b> is integrally formed on the hinge spine <b>162</b>. The stand pedestal <b>162</b> takes the form of a T-shaped rail and includes a stand locking feature <b>163</b>. Knife support stand <b>160</b> is mounted on stand pedestal <b>162</b> by sliding onto the T-shaped rail and has a complementary locking feature so that when positioned, the support stand <b>160</b> is securely (and preferably permanently) attached to stand pedestal <b>162</b>. Thus, the knife support stand is secured to and carried by the web of the double hinge <b>108</b>. Knife <b>150</b> can be attached to the support stand <b>160</b> in an orientation in which its height is substantially perpendicular to the major plane of the web as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>. Thus, when the case <b>100</b> is opened substantially flat as shown in those figures, the knife <b>150</b> is elevated relative to the spoon and fork and extends substantially perpendicularly relative to the spoon and fork. When the case is closed, the knife is interleaved between the spoon and fork in a generally parallel manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The actual geometries of the knife, spoon and fork may be widely varied and in other embodiments, other utensils may be stored in place of, or in addition to, one or more of the illustrated knife, spoon and fork. By way of example, particular spoon and fork geometries are described in concurrently filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/204,497, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A particular knife design <b>150</b> that is well suited for use with the carrying case <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, although again, a wide variety of other knife geometries may be used. Knife <b>150</b> includes a handle <b>205</b>, a blade <b>207</b> and a bottle opener <b>214</b> positioned at or near the junction of the handle and blade. The illustrated blade <b>207</b> has a spine <b>209</b> and a serrated cutting edge <b>210</b>, although that is not a requirement. The handle and blade portions of the knife may be integrally formed from a strong plastic materialâas for example, a glass reinforced thermoplastic such glass filled nylon etc . . . . The bottle opener <b>214</b> is formed from a metal insert <b>215</b> (shown in dotted lines) that is molded into the knife handle/blade during molding of the knife The insert <b>215</b> includes bottle opener feature <b>214</b> that is exposed and forms a recess <b>217</b> at a middle portion of the knife The insert <b>215</b> may also include a plurality of through-holes <b>218</b> that allow plastic to flow therethrough to better secure the insert to the plastic knife The bottle opener <b>214</b> serves dual purposes. In addition to the bottle opener functionality, the recess <b>217</b> provided by the bottle opener serves as a registration feature that can be used to align the knife on knife stand <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Referring next to <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, one particular knife support stand geometry will be described. The illustrated knife support stand <b>160</b> includes a pair of side walls <b>164</b>, <b>165</b> that extend upward from a base <b>166</b> forming a slot <b>167</b> therebetween. The walls longitudinally taper towards the top and have opposing projections <b>168</b> that extend inward to form a catch that cooperates with the base <b>166</b> and the side walls <b>164</b>, <b>165</b> to hold the knife in place. The elasticity of side walls <b>164</b>, <b>165</b> allows a knife shaft to be pushed downward into the stand past the projections <b>168</b> with the projections <b>168</b> springing back to catch the knife thereby holding it in place on the stand. The projections <b>168</b> are preferably rounded to facilitate easy insertion and removal of the knife onto/from the stand <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a side facing cut-away view of the stand. As seen therein, the slot <b>167</b> within base <b>166</b> has a floor surface <b>169</b> that may be contoured to roughly match the contours of the knife A registration hump <b>171</b> is provided on the floor surface <b>169</b>. The registration hump <b>171</b> is configured to mate with the recess <b>217</b> formed by bottle opener <b>214</b> to properly position the knife on the stand. This helps prevent the knife from being placed on the stand at a location that extends too far toward one end or the other such that it could interfere with the tips of the spoon or fork. In the orientation of <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the floor <b>169</b> is lower towards the left side of the base to accommodate the proximal part of blade <b>207</b>. The height of the floor <b>169</b> to the right side of the registration hump <b>171</b> is configured to support the handle <b>205</b>. When the knife is properly positioned, the recess <b>217</b> slides over registration hump <b>217</b> to position the knife on the stand. Thus, the registration hump <b>171</b> and floor topology of the stand <b>160</b> cooperate to properly position knife in the case <b>100</b> relative to the fork and spoon.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment, the knife support stand <b>160</b> is formed independently of the rest of the housing member for ease of manufacturing reasons. In other embodiments, the stand can be integrally formed with the housing members <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> or formed from multiple independent parts that are later assembled. In the illustrated embodiment, the base stand <b>166</b> includes a cross shaped channel <b>173</b> that is arranged to mate with T-shaped pedestal <b>162</b>. The channel and pedestal have complementary snap locking features <b>175</b>, <b>176</b> that are arranged to permanently secure the stand <b>160</b> to the pedestal <b>162</b> when assembled. The somewhat circular portion <b>178</b> at the top of the cross shaped channel <b>173</b> forms a substantially circular channel when the stand is assembled. This channel may be used as a toothpick holder to secure a toothpick (not shown) to the stand <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The side walls <b>132</b> of the housing members <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> have several noteworthy features as well. A best seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the sidewall <b>132</b> is cut away adjacent the double hinge and is arranged so that the hinge web/spine <b>109</b> forms an edge of the case <b>100</b> when the case is closed. The ends <b>112</b> of the spine may be thinned to a half thickness and match with complementary thinned recesses <b>138</b> in the side walls so that the web registers against the sidewall in a manner that forms a continuous flush side edge of the case when the case is closed. The sidewall <b>132</b> of each housing member has a utensil head stop <b>136</b> on one end and a head stop recess <b>137</b> on the inner surface of the other end. Both the head stops <b>136</b> and the head stop recesses <b>137</b> are substantially half thickness. The head stops and head stops recesses are complementary so that the head stop of each housing member will nest into the head stop recess of the other in a hidden manner when the case is closed. The head stops are sized to be higher than the tips of the spoon or the fork to thereby prevent the utensil from sliding âforwardsâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Housing member <b>103</b> has a tab <b>141</b> that extends downward into a corresponding cut-out <b>142</b> in the sidewall <b>132</b> in opposing housing member <b>104</b>. The tab <b>141</b> includes a latch bar <b>143</b> on its inner surface. Housing member <b>104</b> has a finger recess <b>144</b> behind the cut-out <b>142</b>. The latch bar <b>143</b> snaps over the top wall <b>145</b> of finger recess <b>144</b> when the case is closed to snap the case shut. The case can readily be opened by pulling the tab <b>141</b> outward and upward so that the latch bar moves free of the top wall <b>145</b> of finger recess <b>144</b>. This structure provides a latch mechanism for securing the case in the closed position. The tab <b>141</b> and cutout <b>142</b> cooperate with the sidewalls <b>132</b> of the housing member <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> to present a smooth and flush side edge for the case in the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The case <b>100</b> may be formed from a wide variety of materials. By way of example, a variety of thermoplastic materials such as polypropylene work well and permit the use of low cost, injection or transfer molding manufacturing processes that can produce durable and attractive looking cases. Of course a wide variety of other materials can be used as well. When living hinges are used, it is particularly desirable to utilize a material that is durable and otherwise well suited for use as the hinge material. Again, polypropylene works well although other materials can readily be used as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Although only a few embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it should be appreciated that the invention may be implemented in many other forms without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> includes a knife, a spoon and a fork. Although this combination is expected to be most common, it should be appreciated that the described case can be used to hold a variety of different utensils and combinations of utensils.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Specific structures have been shown for various components such as the double hinge, the utensil supports, the support stand, the latch, the utensil head stops, etc. Although these structures work well, it should be appreciated that a wide variety of alternative or equivalent structures can readily be used in their place. Therefore, the present embodiments should be considered illustrative and not restrictive and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope and equivalents of the appended claims.</p>
