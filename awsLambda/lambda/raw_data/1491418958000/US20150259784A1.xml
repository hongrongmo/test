      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Devices such as an organic light emitting device and a thin-film transistor (TFT) board have a functional layer formed on a substrate. The functional layer has a specific function. Examples of the functional layer includes an organic light emitting layer of an organic light emitting device and an organic semiconductor layer of a TFT board. In recent years, such devices have grown in size. To efficiently form a functional layer on a large sized substrate, a technique called âwet processâ has been developed. The term âwet processâ refers to a technique for applying liquid solution containing a functional material (hereinafter also referred to as âinkâ) to a substrate using, for example, an inkjet technique. For example, according to the inkjet technique, an ejection target is placed on a work table of an ink droplet ejection apparatus first. Subsequently, an inkjet head is scanned over the ejection target and, simultaneously, liquid droplets are ejected from a plurality of ejection ports. Thereafter, the liquid droplets deposited on the surface of the ejection target are dried. In this manner, the functional layer is formed (refer to, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-318556). In addition, according to an inkjet technique, inspection of ejection ports is performed as needed. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-120237 describes a technique in which liquid droplets are continuously ejected under a drive condition that is severer than a normal drive condition. Immediately after the ejection, liquid droplets are ejected under a normal drive condition. Thereafter, it is determined whether each of the ejection ports normally functions by determining whether a liquid droplet is ejected from the ejection port.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Underlying Knowledge Forming Basis of the Present Disclosure</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">To form a functional layer with high positional accuracy using an inkjet technique, the drop landing accuracy of a liquid droplet ejection apparatus needs to meet a predetermined standard. That is, it is necessary to deposit a desired volume of a liquid droplet at a desired position. However, among a plurality of ejection ports of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus, there may be ejection ports that do not meet the predetermined standard of drop landing accuracy due to fixing of ink or dirt on the ejection ports and their vicinity, that is, ejection ports that cause drop landing error. If such an ejection port is included in the liquid droplet ejection apparatus, a produced device may malfunction. For example, if the ejection port that causes drop landing error is continuously used to form an organic light emitting layer of an organic electroluminescence (EL) device, an ink droplet may land on a sub-pixel adjacent to a target sub-pixel. If such a situation occurs, the ink that forms a light emitting layer may have a mixed color and, thus, the color of the emitted light may be undesired color.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Accordingly, periodical maintenance of the nozzles of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is required to remove the factors that cause nozzle clogging. In general, inspection of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is performed before, for example, manufacturing of a device is started.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">However, if devices are continuously manufactured, even an ejection port that is inspected as being normal may happen to have defective ejection of ink. If such defective ejection occurs, the manufacturing line needs to be stopped in order to perform a maintenance operation of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus, which results in a decrease in the yield ratio. Accordingly, the present inventors studied a method for detecting an ejection port that is likely to have defective ejection in advance and found that by causing an ejection port to eject liquid droplets at a drive frequency that is higher than that in a normal operation and measuring the characteristics of the ejected liquid droplets, an ejection port having defective ejection or non-ejection can be detected.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Outline of Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method for inspecting a liquid droplet ejection apparatus that ejects a liquid droplet from an ejection port includes: (a) ejecting the liquid droplet toward an ejection target at an inspection drive frequency that is higher than an operation drive frequency set during a normal operation; (b) measuring a characteristic of the liquid droplet deposited on a surface of the ejection target; and (c) determining that the ejection port the characteristic of which is outside a predetermined range is defective.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">According to the method for inspecting a liquid droplet ejection apparatus, an ejection port that is likely to have accidental defective ejection in a manufacturing process can be detected and selected out in a pre-stage of a device manufacturing process. Thus, the liquid solution can be continuously applied in the manufacturing process. As a result, a decrease in the yield ratio can be prevented and, thus, the production efficiency can be increased.</p>

The main body <b>121</b> is fixed to the mounting base <b>116</b>. The inkjet head <b>122</b> and the image capturing unit <b>123</b> are mounted on the main body <b>121</b>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a schematic configuration of an inkjet head. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the inkjet head <b>122</b> is an elongated member including a plurality of ink ejection mechanism units <b>124</b> (for example, several thousands). The ink ejection mechanism units <b>124</b> are arranged in a line in a long direction of the inkjet head <b>122</b> at equal intervals.

The nozzle <b>124</b><i>d </i>has an ejection ports <b>124</b><i>d</i><b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">For example, the piezoelectric element <b>124</b><i>a </i>is a laminated body formed by sandwiching a plate-like piezoelectric body <b>124</b><i>e </i>made of, for example, lead zirconate titanate by two electrodes <b>124</b><i>f </i>and <b>124</b><i>g</i>. By applying a waveform voltage at a several hundred Hz frequency between the two electrodes, the piezoelectric element <b>124</b><i>a </i>deforms.

When the ejection ports <b>124</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> are arranged in a plurality of lines, the ejection ports <b>124</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> may be arranged in a staggered arrangement.

More specifically, for example, the image of the inspection region having the liquid droplet deposited therein is captured using a CCD camera. Thereafter, the image of the liquid droplet is extracted from the captured image using, for example, pattern matching, and the drop landing position and the area of the liquid droplet are read. Thus, deviation of the drop landing point and the amount of deposited liquid droplet are measured. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> is a process chart illustrating a method for inspecting a liquid droplet ejection apparatus according to the present exemplary embodiment. <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> is a process chart illustrating a method for determining pass or fail in the determination process (step S<b>5</b>) in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of a liquid droplet deposited in an inspection region which is a target of pass/fail determination. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a data table according to the exemplary embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The method for inspecting a liquid droplet ejection apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment is used to inspect the drop landing accuracy of a liquid droplet ejection apparatus. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, the inspection method includes a preparation process (step S<b>1</b>), an ejection process (step S<b>2</b>), an image capturing process (step S<b>3</b>), a reading process (step S<b>4</b>), and a determination process (step S<b>5</b>). In the preparation process (step S<b>1</b>), the ejection target <b>200</b> is placed on the supporting base <b>111</b> of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus <b>100</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, a surface <b>210</b> of the ejection target <b>200</b> has an inspection region <b>211</b> having an alignment mark <b>220</b> displayed therein. The ejection target <b>200</b> may be a test substrate used for inspecting the drop landing accuracy or a half-finished product without a functional layer formed therein.

Alternatively, the half-finished product may have the alignment mark <b>220</b> in the peripheral region (the frame region) thereof, which is a non-light emitting region of a product.</p>

The images of the image capturing regions I<sub>1 </sub>to I<sub>n </sub>are sequentially captured at different points in time. In this manner, the image of a liquid droplet deposited into each of the image capturing regions is obtained. The inspection region <b>211</b> represents the entire image capturing regions I<sub>1 </sub>to I<sub>n</sub>.

The term âpositional deviationâ refers to a distance between the target position <b>223</b> and the central point of the liquid droplet. For example, a positional deviation can be obtained by determining the center position of each of the liquid droplets using the outline of the liquid droplet and reading the distance from the central point to the target position.</p>

As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the determination process (step S<b>5</b>) includes a defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>) and a defective ejection apparatus determination process (step S<b>52</b>). In the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>), if, for example, the area of each of the liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>is outside a predetermined range, it is determined that the ejection port corresponding to the liquid droplet is defective. That is, if the area of a deposited liquid droplet is greater than the upper limit of the predetermined range or if the area of a deposited liquid droplet is less than the lower limit of the predetermined range, it is determined that the corresponding ejection port is defective. Note that only if the area of a deposited liquid droplet is greater than the upper limit of the predetermined range or only if the area of a deposited liquid droplet is less than the lower limit of the predetermined range, it may be determined that the corresponding ejection port is defective. While the above-described exemplary embodiment has been described with reference to determination as to whether the drop landing accuracy is acceptable using the area of a deposited liquid droplet, the characteristic used for determining the pass/fail of the ejection port is not limited to the area of the liquid droplet. For example, pass/fail determination for the ejection port may be made on the basis of deviation of the drop landing position, a variation of the drop landing position, the frequency of the occurrence of non-ejection, the frequency of the occurrence of a satellite phenomenon, or the frequency of the occurrence of a double drop phenomenon.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a data table according to the present exemplary embodiment.

The field âimage capturing regionâ contains a number corresponding to each of the image capturing regions I<sub>1 </sub>to I<sub>n</sub>. The field âareaâ contains a measurement value of the area of the liquid droplet. The predetermined range of the area of the liquid droplet used for determining pass/fail of an ejection port is defined by, for example, an upper limit of 35 Î¼m<sup>2 </sup>and a lower limit of 20 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>. If the area of a liquid droplet is greater than or equal to the lower limit and less than or equal to the upper limit, it is determined that the area is within the predetermined range. In the example illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, it is determined that the droplets A<sub>3 </sub>and A<sub>4 </sub>in the image capturing regions I<sub>3 </sub>and I<sub>4</sub>, respectively, are outside the predetermined range. Thus, it is determined that the ejection ports <b>124</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> corresponding to the droplets A<sub>3 </sub>and A<sub>4 </sub>are defective. The results of determination of the ejection ports corresponding to the liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>are stored in the fields âpass/fail determinationâ in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In the defective ejection apparatus determination process (step S<b>52</b>), it is determined whether the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is continuously usable. More specifically, the ratio of the number of ejection ports determined to be defective in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>) to the total number of ejection ports included in the inkjet head <b>122</b> is calculated. Thereafter, it is determined whether the ratio is lower than or equal to a predetermined reference value. If the ratio is lower than or equal to the reference value, it is determined that the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is continuously usable. This is because if the ratio is lower than or equal to the reference value, the liquid solution can be applied to the target by ejecting liquid droplets from only the ejection ports other than the defective ejection ports among all the ejection ports included in the inkjet head <b>122</b>. Note that if the ratio of the number of defective ejection ports is too high, the number of the ejection ports assigned to a sub-pixel when the liquid solution is applied during a device manufacturing process decreases. Accordingly, the number of liquid droplets assigned to a sub-pixel decreases. Therefore, it may be difficult to provide the amount of dropping liquid required for achieving the designed thickness of the layer. In this regard, the reference value may be set to 8% or less. Note that the reference value described above is only an example. Any appropriate reference value may be set on the basis of, for example, the capacity of a sub-pixel, the number of ejection ports assigned to a sub-pixel, and the amount of liquid to be ejected from each of the ejection ports.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a relationship between the inspection drive frequency used in the ejection process (step S<b>2</b>) and the ratio of the ejection ports that are determined to be defective in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>) to the total number of the ejection ports (a defective ejection port detection ratio). <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the viscosity of ink used in the evaluation in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, liquid solution is applied to a target, such as a device substrate, during a device manufacturing process. The drive frequency used during a normal operation is about 0.3 to about 5.5 kHz. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the inspection drive frequency is about 10 to 11 kHz.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, when ink <b>1</b> and ink <b>2</b> are used, the defective ejection port detection ratio does not vary and is maintained at about 0% even if the drive frequency is increased. In contrast, if ink <b>3</b> having the highest ink viscosity is used, the defective ejection port detection ratio does not vary and is maintained at about 0% if the drive frequency is lower than or equal to about 5.5 kHz. However, in the range of the drive frequency higher than about 5.5 kHz, the defective ejection port detection ratio increases with increasing drive frequency. It is considered that this is because a supply of the ink to a liquid chamber easily becomes unstable at a high drive frequency when a viscosity of the ink is high. By inspecting an ejection port at a drive frequency higher than about 5.5 kHz in this manner, a potentially defective ejection port that cannot be detected at a drive frequency lower than a drive frequency during a normal operation (e.g., 5.5 kHz) can be detected. Thus, in the device manufacturing process, an ejection port that is likely to accidentally have defective ejection can be detected in advance. And as described above the defective ejection port detection ratio does not vary when ink <b>1</b> and ink <b>2</b> are used. However when a determination criterion is fixed appropriately, an ejection port that is likely to accidentally have defective ejection can be detected in advance even if such inks are used.</p>

However, if it is determined that the liquid droplet ejection apparatus failed the inspection, the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is tuned.</p>

To tune the liquid droplet ejection apparatus, the position of the ejection port <b>124</b><i>d</i><b>1</b> at a time of ejection is adjusted if the drop landing position is deviated.

      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">As described above, according to the method for inspecting an ejection port of the liquid droplet ejection apparatus of the present exemplary embodiment, the ejection port is inspected in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>). In this inspection, liquid droplets are ejected to the ejection target <b>200</b> at an inspection drive frequency that is higher than a drive frequency usually used in a device manufacturing process. If the area of each of the liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>deposited onto the ejection target <b>200</b> is outside a predetermined range, it is determined that the ejection port corresponding to the one of the liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>is defective.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In this manner, a potentially defective ejection port that cannot be detected at a drive frequency used during a normal operation in a device manufacturing process can be detected. In addition, according to the method for inspecting a liquid droplet ejection apparatus of the present exemplary embodiment, in the defective ejection apparatus determination process (step S<b>52</b>), it is determined whether the liquid droplet ejection apparatus is continuously usable. More specifically, it is determined whether the ratio of the number of ejection ports determined to be defective in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>) to the total number of ejection ports included in the inkjet head <b>122</b> is lower than or equal to a reference value. If the ratio is lower than or equal to the reference value, it is determined that the device manufacturing operation can be continuously performed by ejecting liquid droplets from only the ejection ports other than the ejection ports that are determined to be defective.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In this manner, ejection ports that are likely to have accidental defective ejection in the manufacturing process can be detected and selected out. Thus, the liquid solution can be applied to a target without using the defective ejection ports. As a result, a decrease in the yield ratio can be prevented and, thus, the production efficiency can be increased.</p>
      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="2">Modifications</heading>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">(1) According to the above-described exemplary embodiment, if the area of each of the liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>is outside a predetermined range, it is determined that the corresponding ejection port is defective in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>). However, the pass/fail determination may be made using other characteristics of a deposited liquid droplet. For example, pass/fail determination for the ejection port may be made on the basis of at least one of the area of the liquid droplet, deviation of the drop landing position, a variation of the drop landing position, the frequency of the occurrence of non-ejection, the frequency of the occurrence of a satellite phenomenon, or the frequency of the occurrence of a double drop phenomenon. More specifically, in the defective ejection port determination process (step S<b>51</b>), liquid droplets are ejected to the ejection target <b>200</b> at an inspection drive frequency that is higher than a drive frequency usually used in a device manufacturing process. Thereafter, at least one of the above-described characteristics is measured. If each of the results of measurement is outside a predetermined range set for the corresponding characteristic, it may be determined that the ejection port is defective.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">As used herein, the term âdeviation of the drop landing positionâ refers to a distance between the center position of each of the deposited liquid droplets A<sub>1 </sub>to A<sub>n </sub>and the target position <b>223</b>. The term âvariation of the drop landing positionâ refers to a value obtained by measuring the deviation of the drop landing position for each of the ejection ports a plurality of times and quantifying the level of the variation. The term âfrequency of the occurrence of non-ejectionâ refers to the frequency of the occurrence of a situation in which a liquid droplet is not ejected when each of the ejection ports ejects a liquid droplet a plurality of times. The term âfrequency of the occurrence of a satellite phenomenonâ refers to the frequency of the occurrence of a phenomenon in which small satellite drops appears in the vicinity of the liquid droplet. The term âfrequency of the occurrence of a double drop phenomenonâ refers to the frequency of the occurrence of a phenomenon in which when a drop landing inspection pattern is formed by two droplets ejected from the same ejection port, the distance between the landing position of the first droplet and the landing position of the second droplet is large and, thus, the two droplets do not form one pattern.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">At least one of these characteristics may be selected as an inspection item. Like the example of the exemplary embodiment, even when such an inspection item is used, a potentially defective ejection port that cannot be detected at a normal drive frequency can be detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">(2) While the above exemplary embodiment has been described with reference to sequential application of ink of three colors to a plurality of substrates one color by one color, the above-described inspection method is applicable even when three colors of ink are simultaneously applied. For example, the above-described series of processes may be performed for the heads corresponding to the three colors in parallel. In this manner, an effect that is the same as the effect described in the above-described exemplary embodiment can be provided.</p>

In addition to a light emitting layer, the manufacturing method of the present disclosure is applicable to formation of another functional layer, such as a hole injection layer or an electron injection layer, using a wet process and formation of an organic semiconductor layer of a TFT substrate using a wet process.
