      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This invention is directed a beverage brewing system capable of brewing one cup of beverage or multiple cups of bever into a carafe.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Brewing coffee through a single-serve cartridge has become popular for its convenience and a variety of coffee flavors that are offered. Single-serve cartridges are packed with pre-measured coffee grind that can be inserted into a brewer to inject heated water into the cartridge to brew a cup of coffee. While single-serve cartridges are convenient to brew one cup of coffee quickly, it can be inconvenient and time consuming to brew multiple cups of coffee one after another during those occasions when there is a family gathering or with multiple house guests desiring a cup of coffee. In such occasions, brewing a pot of coffee or multiple cups of coffee into a carafe would be more convenient, but to do so, a separate traditional drip brewer may be needed. Having a single-serve brewing system and a traditional drip coffee brewer can take up extra kitchen counter space, which may be undesirable for some homeowners. Accordingly, there is a need to brew a one cup as well as several cups of coffee with one brewing system.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">INVENTION SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">A brewing system is adapted to brew a beverage utilizing a cartridge packed with beverage grind such as coffee, tea, milk, and the like to make one cup of beverage, and multiple cups of beverage utilizing a refillable cup with the same brewer. The brewing system includes a brewer having a well adapted to receive a holder and a refillable cup. The holder is adapted to pierce a hole through a single-serve beverage cartridge packed with premeasured amount of beverage grind to brew one cup of beverage. The holder can be removed for cleaning</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The refillable cup includes a cap and a container. With the cap removed, the container can be packed with substantially more beverage grind, such as at least 200% more, than the beverage grind packed into a single-serve beverage cartridge to brew multiple cups of beverage. The holder can be removed, and the refillable cup can be inserted into the well. The refillable cup is configured to substantially fill the well to maximize the internal spacing to pack as much beverage grind as possible. The cap may have a guard to prevent outer debris from entering the container once the cap is closed to the container. The cap may also have an elongated porous cone to provide a path for heated water to pass deep into the beverage grind inside the container to evenly extract the beverage from the grind in the bottom.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of an internal main frame <b>10</b> of a brewer adapted to receive a holder <b>12</b>. The holder <b>12</b> may be adapted to receive different size single-serve cups in a manner generally described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/925,595 and Ser. No. 13/925,604, both of which were filed on Jun. 24, 2014, which are both hereby incorporated by references. The different size single-serve cups may be adapted to pack up to about 20 grams of grind coffee depending the roast. By way of background, as coffee beans are roasted or backed for a longer period of time, the coffee beans loose more moisture and becomes darker and weigh less, and vice versa. With about 20 grams of coffee, it may be enough to brew 14 oz to 18 oz cup of coffee but not much more without making the coffee taste too weak.</p>

Heated water as indicated by the direction arrow <b>68</b> may be injected through the inlet needle <b>70</b> such that the heated water passes through the guard <b>56</b> and the elongated cone <b>60</b> through the porous holes <b>64</b>. As the heated water passes through the beverage grind <b>72</b> as represented as dark dots, the beverage is formed, as represented by the direction arrows <b>74</b>, and passes through the mesh and drains down the gap <b>66</b> and further down through the opening <b>18</b>. With the refillable cup <b>22</b> substantially filling the well <b>14</b>, the amount of beverage grind that can be packed into the refillable cup <b>22</b> may be maximized to brew stronger and bigger pot of coffee. With the refillable cup <b>22</b>, a coffee drinker may grind his or her favorite coffee and brew enough coffee to fill a carafe capable of holding 24 to 35 oz of coffee, for example, utilizing the same brewer capable of brewing single-serve capsules by removing the holder <b>12</b> and inserting the refillable cup <b>22</b> in its place.</p>
