    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A hose storage system and method for an electric hose for use in a central vacuum system comprising a hose storage area and a vacuum inlet valve. The system has a manual switch which can independently activate the vacuum system to create suction in the hose storage area to retract the hose and is covered when the hose is stored. The hose comprises a first end with a hose cuff for connection to the vacuum connection opening of the inlet valve, and, a second end with a wand connection for connection to a wand or other electric device. During storage, the switch is operated to activate the vacuum system generating a vacuum in the storage area and retracting the second end of the hose into the hose storage area while the hose cuff is connected to the vacuum inlet opening. Once fully retracted, except for the hose cuff, the hose cuff is removed from the vacuum inlet connection opening and the vacuum system is again manually activated by the switch to retract the remainder of hose until the hose cuff abuts a hose storage abutment surface. The inlet valve has a hose access door with a seal providing access to the hose storage area which may be separate from a waste conveying portion to provide more hygienic storage of the hose.</p>

    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention relates generally to central vacuum systems. In particular, the present invention relates to a system for storing a hose and a method of doing same.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Central vacuum systems have been known for a number of years. In general, central vacuum systems have a central vacuum source which is connected through a piping system to inlets. Each of the inlets can then be connected to an accessory in general, such as a hose. The inlets generally have a sealing means for sealing the inlet when another inlet connected to the system is in use. In this way, the vacuum will not be overly degraded at the inlet that is being used.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The central vacuum system can be activated to generate a vacuum in a number of ways. For instance, the central vacuum system can be activated automatically when an accessory is connected to an inlet. The central vacuum system can also be activated, for instance, by a low voltage switch.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">One of the disadvantages of prior central vacuum systems has been that generally a hose must be carried to a particular inlet that is to be used. The hose can then be used to vacuum an area associated with the inlet. Generally, this area can be large in order to decrease the number of inlets required thereby decreasing the cost of installing the central vacuum system.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, as the area associated with an inlet increases the hose used to vacuum the area associated with the inlet must also increase. Having larger hoses to connect to the inlet decreases the convenience of using the central vacuum system. While there is some advantage to using a larger hose to clean a large area around an inlet, there is some inconvenience in storing and moving the hose from one inlet associated with an area to another inlet associated with another area.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Furthermore, several rooms or areas associated with a particular inlet may, by their geography, be small. Nevertheless, rather than having hoses of different lengths, the user may need to use a larger hose simply because that is the only type of hose the user may have for the entire central vacuum system.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Several systems have been proposed in the past whereby hoses can be permanently stored in the wall so as to be easily accessible. The disadvantage of at least some of these systems is that the hose, because of its length, is difficult to store and recover, involving complicated and expensive installation processes and mechanisms for extracting and retracting the hose from the storage space. Sometimes the hose is also retracted too far into the wall and is difficult to remove.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Moreover, the cost of maintaining these systems is high because it is difficult to access the hose, for use in cleaning, or, to replace the hose if it becomes damaged. Also, hoses may become dirty by their use and may occasionally need to be cleaned which can be difficult if permanently stored in the wall. More frequently, hoses, over time, will degrade and will require replacement. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for hoses to be stepped on or otherwise damaged during use which can create ruptures decreasing the vacuum through the hose thereby decreasing the efficiency of the vacuuming system.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Also, existing hoses that are stored in the wall generally do not have a high voltage [such as 110V or 220V] connection. As such they cannot be used to power electric cleaning heads. This limits the effectiveness and versatility of many hoses that are currently stored in the wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Accordingly, while the prior art has proposed certain solutions to the central vacuum systems, the prior art devices continue to suffer from several disadvantages. These disadvantages include the high maintenance involved in replacing hoses in such systems, the difficulty with storing larger hoses to clean large areas, and the fact that they cannot be used with electric cleaning heads because they do not provide a high current electrical connection.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to at least partially overcome some of the disadvantages of the prior art. Also, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved type of central vacuum system inlet which is less complicated to install, use or maintain than the prior art systems, and may provide for high voltage or current carrying hoses to power an electric attachment, such as an electric cleaning head.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Accordingly, in one of its aspects, this invention provides a vacuum inlet valve for a central vacuum cleaning system comprising: a vacuum inlet connection opening in vacuum communication with a hose storage area, and, associated with a high voltage connection; a hose access opening providing access to the hose storage area; a hose access door having a seal to substantially provide a vacuum seal around the hose access opening when closed; and a manually operated switch to activate the central vacuum cleaning system; wherein a current carrying vacuum hose having a hose cuff for connection to the vacuum inlet connection opening and high voltage connection at a first end and a wand connection at the second end may be stored in the hose storage area and completely removed therefrom through the hose access opening when the hose access door is open, and, the hose access opening is vacuum sealed when the hose access door is closed to decrease vacuum degradation in the central vacuum cleaning system.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In a further aspect, the present invention provides a system for storing a hose of a central vacuum cleaning system, said system comprising: a hose storage area; a vacuum inlet valve having a vacuum inlet connection opening and an associated inlet high voltage connection, and, a hose access door having a seal and providing access to the hose storage area, and a manually operated switch to activate the central vacuum cleaning system and generate a vacuum in the hose storage area and vacuum inlet connection opening; a current carrying hose having a first end with a hose cuff for connection to the vacuum inlet connection opening, and, a second end with a wand connection; and wherein, when the hose access door is open, the hose may be stored in the hose storage area by manually operating the switch to activate the central vacuum system and generate a vacuum in the hose storage area to retract the hose, and, when the hose access door is closed, the seal substantially provides a vacuum seal decreasing vacuum degradation.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Preferred embodiments of the invention and its advantages can be understood by referring to the present drawings. In the present drawings, like numerals are used for like and corresponding parts of the accompanying drawings and common elements between embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention relates to a vacuum inlet valve as shown generally by reference numeral <b>300</b>. The vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> has a standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> and a hose access door <b>330</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In <figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i>, which show the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> behind the wall <b>8</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a hose storage area <b>200</b> is shown in vacuum communication with the hose access door <b>330</b>. The hose storage area <b>200</b> has a diameter sufficient to contain a current carrying vacuum hose shown generally by reference numeral <b>100</b>, in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. In one preferred embodiment, as seen in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the hose storage area <b>200</b> comprises a hose storage pipe <b>230</b> which can also be used to communicate waste to the vacuum system canister <b>9</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows the first end <b>101</b> of the hose <b>100</b> having a hose cuff <b>110</b>. The hose cuff <b>110</b> may be a standard dual-volt direct connect wall-end hose cuff <b>110</b> as is known in the art, or other types of hose cuffs <b>110</b> for connecting the hose <b>100</b> to the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> of the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the hose <b>100</b> is shown in the stored position with all of the hose <b>100</b> stored in the hose storage area <b>200</b> and only the hose cuff <b>110</b> visible when the access door <b>330</b> is open. The hose storage area <b>200</b> comprises an abutment surface <b>210</b> at an opening <b>202</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>) to the hose storage area <b>200</b> which abuts against a rear surface <b>111</b> of the hose cuff <b>110</b> when the hose <b>100</b> is completely stored in the hose storage area <b>200</b>. Behind the hose access door <b>330</b> is preferably a hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> for storing the hose cuff <b>110</b> when the hose <b>100</b> is in the retracted or stored position. The hose access door <b>330</b> provides access to the hose cuff <b>110</b> in the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> through a hose access opening <b>332</b>. The combination of the hose access opening <b>332</b>, the hose access door <b>330</b> and the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> may be referred to as the hose access chamber <b>370</b> through which the hose <b>100</b> is stored to, and accessed from, the hose storage area <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As also shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> has a vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> and a high voltage connection <b>320</b> which connect to the hose cuff <b>110</b> and provides power, if required, to an attachment (not shown) as well as communicating suction or vacuum from the vacuum source <b>3</b>. The standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b> also has a low voltage connection <b>322</b> which also connects to the hose cuff <b>110</b> and is used to operate the central vacuum system (usually on and off) from the attachment through the hose <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The pipe <b>230</b> may be connected to the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> by a T-connection or other component, as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. The vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> has a first vacuum opening <b>351</b>, which is connected to the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b>, and a second vacuum outlet opening <b>352</b>, which is connected to the hose storage area <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, the first and second vacuum outlet openings <b>351</b>, <b>352</b> are proximate each other such that fluid flow through each would combine near the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b>. In particular, fluid flow through each of the vacuum outlet openings <b>351</b>, <b>352</b> would combine within the length of the hose <b>100</b> stored in the vacuum storage area <b>200</b> such that there would be overlap between the hose storage area <b>200</b> and the portion of the pipe <b>230</b> conveying vacuum waste during use of the hose <b>100</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the hose <b>100</b> is about 20 to 30 feet long, but could be about 50 feet long.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> also comprises a manually operated switch <b>340</b> which can be operated by the user to manually activate the vacuum V of the central vacuum system <b>10</b> independent of the current carrying hose <b>100</b>. The switch <b>340</b> may be a push button switch, as preferably shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, but any switch which can be operated by the user independent of the current carrying hose <b>100</b> may be used. Preferably, the switch <b>340</b> is associated with the hose access door <b>330</b>. In particular, it is preferred if the switch <b>340</b> is located behind a portion <b>331</b> of the hose access door <b>330</b> when the hose access door <b>330</b> is in the closed portion (as shown for instance in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> where the switch <b>340</b> is not visible behind the closed hose access door <b>330</b>). In this way, the switch <b>340</b> will be protected when the hose access door <b>330</b> is in the closed position to prevent accidental activation of the vacuum source <b>3</b> of the central vacuum system <b>10</b>. More preferably, the switch <b>340</b> is a push-button switch with âOFFâ or ânon-activeâ corresponding to the âpushed-inâ position and âONâ or âactiveâ corresponding to the âpushed-outâ position. In this way, the switch <b>340</b> is automatically pushed to the âOFFâ or ânon-activeâ setting when the hose access door <b>330</b> is closed to de-activate the vacuum source <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> shows a further embodiment of the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> with the wall portion <b>8</b> removed. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the hose <b>100</b> is stored in the hose storage area <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in one embodiment, where the hose storage area <b>200</b> also communicates waste, such as dust and dirt, when the system <b>10</b> is in use, the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> is preferably substantially perpendicular to the hose storage area <b>200</b>. In this way, in a preferred embodiment, the hose <b>100</b> may be seen through the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> when the vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> of the connection opening <b>310</b> is open. This can be useful to determine if the hose <b>100</b> is stored in the vacuum storage area <b>200</b> as the same hose <b>100</b> could be used, and stored, at different vacuum inlet valves <b>300</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As also illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, seals <b>510</b>, <b>530</b> are present at the vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> for the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> and the hose access door <b>330</b>, respectively, to substantially provide a vacuum seal when the doors <b>313</b>, <b>330</b> are closed. The doors <b>313</b>, <b>330</b> may preferably have a spring, or other biasing means, to press or bias the seals <b>510</b>, <b>530</b> against the openings <b>310</b>, <b>332</b>, respectively, to assist in preventing degradation of the vacuum when other inlets (not shown) are used. This also assists in preventing vacuum degradation when one of the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> or hose access door <b>330</b> are in use and the other <b>330</b>, <b>310</b>, is not.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">When the hose <b>100</b> is to be removed from the stored position, the hose access door <b>330</b> is opened, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, and the hose <b>100</b> is removed by hand through the hose access opening <b>332</b> off the hose access chamber <b>370</b>. All the while, if desired, the user can see the hose <b>100</b> moving out of the hose storage area <b>200</b> by opening the vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> and looking through the vacuum connection opening <b>310</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Once the hose <b>100</b> has been removed from the hose storage area <b>200</b>, the hose cuff <b>110</b> may be connected to the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> and the high voltage connection <b>320</b>. The second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> preferably has a wand connection <b>120</b> that can connect to a wand <b>800</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The wand <b>800</b> preferably has a power connection <b>820</b> to receive the wand connection <b>120</b> at the second end of the hose <b>100</b>. In this way, power can be supplied from the vacuum inlet high voltage connection <b>320</b> through the current carrying hose <b>100</b> to the wand <b>800</b> and, ultimately, to an electric cleaning head or other power device (not shown) connected to the wand <b>800</b>. To facilitate this, the wand connection <b>120</b> preferably has 2 high voltage pin sockets <b>121</b> to provide high voltage power to the wand <b>800</b>. The wand connection <b>820</b> preferably also has 2 low voltage pin sockets <b>122</b> to facilitate turning the vacuum cleaning system on-and-off through a switch <b>802</b> on the wand <b>800</b>. When the vacuum cleaning system <b>10</b> is on, a vacuum V can be supplied from the vacuum source <b>3</b> through the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b>, the hose <b>100</b> and the wand <b>800</b> ultimately to the cleaning head or other device (not shown) connected to the wand <b>800</b> for cleaning. When in the stored or retracted position, the wand connection <b>120</b> is stored in the storage area <b>200</b>. In this way, the wand connection <b>820</b>, including the high voltage pin sockets <b>121</b> and the low voltage pin sockets <b>122</b> are protected from damage. Accordingly, the hose storage area <b>200</b> should preferably have a diameter sufficient to accommodate the hose <b>100</b> and the wand connection <b>120</b>, but not the hose cuff <b>110</b> which remains in the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> when the hose <b>100</b> is in the completely stored or retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">After use, as shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, the wand <b>800</b> can then be detached from the wand connection <b>120</b> at the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b>. The hose cuff <b>110</b> at the first end <b>101</b> may remain connected to the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> and high voltage connection <b>320</b> while the second end <b>102</b> is retracted into the hose storage area <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As shown in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> having the wand connection <b>120</b> is then initially inserted into the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> and/or inserted into or placed near the hose storage area <b>200</b> through the hose access opening <b>332</b> of the hose access chamber <b>370</b>. While the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> is initially inserted in the opening <b>202</b> of the storage area <b>200</b>, or, is at least in the proximity thereof, such as in the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b>, the user manually operates the switch <b>340</b> to activate the vacuum source <b>3</b> of the central vacuum system <b>10</b> and create a vacuum V in the hose storage area <b>200</b> which retracts the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> into the hose storage area <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The user then continues to activate the switch <b>340</b> until the hose <b>100</b> has been completely retracted into the hose storage area <b>200</b>, except for the hose cuff <b>110</b> which remains connected to the standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, the hose cuff <b>110</b> remains connected to the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> and in particular the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> and the high voltage connection <b>320</b>, while the switch <b>340</b> is activated and the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> is retracted into the hose storage chamber <b>200</b>. One advantage of securing the hose cuff <b>110</b> to the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> while the hose <b>100</b> is being retracted into the hose storage chamber <b>200</b> by the vacuum of the vacuum source <b>3</b> is to have the first end <b>101</b> of the hose <b>100</b> secured thereby avoiding the first end <b>101</b> and the hose cuff <b>110</b> hitting the wall <b>8</b>, the user or the hose access chamber <b>370</b>. This is particularly important in situations where the vacuum source <b>3</b> is particularly strong and the hose <b>100</b> may be retracted quickly into the hose storage chamber <b>200</b> which could cause a âwhip lashâ effect if the first end <b>101</b> and the hose cuff <b>110</b> are not secured to the dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b>. Another advantage of securing the hose cuff <b>110</b> to the dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b> while the hose <b>100</b> is being retracted into the hose storage area <b>200</b>, is to avoid damaging the hose cuff <b>110</b>, and hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> such as by the âwhip lashâ effect referred to above, and also to avoid over insertion of the rear surface <b>111</b> of the hose cuff <b>110</b> beyond the abutment surface <b>210</b> which could result in the hose cuff <b>110</b> becoming stuck in the hose storage area <b>200</b> and/or damage the abutment surface <b>210</b>, the hose storage area opening <b>202</b>, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Once the hose <b>100</b> is fully retracted into the hose storage area <b>200</b>, except for the hose cuff <b>110</b>, the hose cuff <b>110</b> may be removed from the standard inlet valve <b>301</b> and the hose cuff <b>110</b> and remainder of the first end <b>101</b> of the hose <b>100</b> may be retracted into the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b>. This can be done manually if desired, or, by further operation of the switch <b>340</b> to activate the vacuum system thereby generating a vacuum in the hose storage area <b>200</b>. It is noted that when the hose cuff <b>110</b> is removed from the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b>, and stored in the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> at the opening <b>202</b> of the hose storage area <b>200</b>, the vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> will be closed. Generally, a spring, or other means will bias the seal <b>510</b> on the vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> against a perimeter of the vacuum connection opening <b>310</b> thereby facilitating creation of a vacuum seal to avoid degradation of the vacuum at other vacuum inlets (not shown). The vacuum inlet door <b>313</b> also covers the high voltage connection <b>320</b> to prevent damage thereto, as well as protect users from exposed high voltage electrical connections.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Once the hose <b>100</b> is fully retracted in the hose storage area <b>200</b>, the rear surface <b>111</b> of the hose cuff <b>110</b> will abut against the abutment surface <b>210</b> of the storage area <b>200</b> restricting further insertion of the hose <b>100</b> into the storage area <b>200</b>. At this point, the hose cuff is completely contained within the hose cuff compartment <b>220</b> and the hose access door <b>330</b> can be closed. The seal <b>530</b> upon the hose access door <b>330</b>, as well as the rear surface <b>111</b> of the hose cuff <b>110</b> resting against the abutment surface <b>210</b>, will facilitate creation of a vacuum seal to prevent degradation of the vacuum at other vacuum inlets (not shown) of the vacuum system <b>10</b> during operation. In the closed position, the hose access door <b>330</b> will also cover or overlap the switch <b>340</b> to prevent accidental activation.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 14 to 20</figref> illustrate a vacuum inlet valve, shown generally by reference numeral <b>1300</b>, according to a further embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, for example, the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b> has two separate outlet openings <b>1301</b> and <b>1302</b>. These are illustrated also in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>. The first outlet opening <b>1301</b> is connected to a waste conveying pipe, shown generally by reference <b>1012</b>. The second outlet opening <b>1302</b> is connected to a hose storage area <b>1200</b>. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the hose storage area <b>1200</b>, represented by the hose storage pipe <b>1202</b>, is separate from the waste conveying pipe <b>1012</b> connected to the first opening <b>1301</b>. Similarly, the first outlet opening <b>1301</b>, and the second outlet opening <b>1302</b> are not proximate, but remote to each other at least because fluid flow through each outlet openings <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>, would not combine near the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b>, though fluid flow may combine at a location remote from the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b>, such as near the canister <b>9</b>, depending on the design of the central vacuum system <b>10</b>, and in any event, may combine at a distance greater than the length of the hose <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The hose access door <b>330</b>, in this embodiment of the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b>, functions similarly to the embodiment <b>300</b> discussed above. However, the hose <b>100</b> is stored in the hose storage area <b>1200</b> which is separate from the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>. Also, the hose cuff <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 15</figref> where the hose access door <b>330</b> is shown in the open position, is in the opposite orientation to that shown in the first embodiment <b>300</b> such as in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. This is apparent because the hose <b>100</b> is now stored in a hose storage area <b>1200</b> which is separate from the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> may constitute a waste conveying pipe <b>1012</b> and similarly, the hose storage area <b>1200</b> may constitute a hose storage pipe <b>1202</b>, however, it is understood that other types of arrangements are possible. Furthermore, while the hose storage pipe <b>1202</b> is shown as being substantially parallel to the waste conveying pipe <b>1012</b>, other orientations are also possible. For instance, depending on the arrangement of the vacuum system <b>10</b>, the hose storage pipe <b>1202</b> may be perpendicular to the waste conveying pipe <b>1012</b>, either going vertically upwards or vertically downwards (not shown), but in either case the hose storage area <b>1200</b> would be separate from the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> and the first outlet opening <b>1301</b> would be remote from the second outlet opening <b>1302</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">
        <figref>FIG. 17</figref> shows a simplified schematic drawing of the vacuum system <b>10</b> with the hose storage pipe <b>1202</b> constituting the hose storage area <b>1200</b>. The waste conveying pipe <b>1012</b> constituting the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> is shown being separate from the hose storage area <b>1200</b>. The vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b> is shown behind the wall <b>8</b> and intermediate the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> and hose storage area <b>1200</b>. As also illustrated in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, the system <b>10</b> comprises a vacuum source <b>3</b> which may have a standard canister <b>9</b> having a bag or other receptacle to receive the waste that is entrained in the vacuum during cleaning. As also illustrated in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, the hose storage portion <b>1200</b> and waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> are in vacuum communication with the vacuum source <b>3</b> through the sweep tee <b>4</b> which is remote from the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b> such as at a distance greater than the length of the hose <b>100</b>. In this way, the same vacuum source <b>3</b> can provide a vacuum V for the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>, to entrain waste during cleaning, as well as the hose storage area <b>1200</b>, to retract the hose during storage, such that the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> and the hose storage area <b>1200</b> are separate from each other but still in vacuum communication.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">
        <figref>FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> illustrate how the vacuum V generated by the vacuum source <b>3</b> is separated by the sweep tee <b>4</b> between the hose access area <b>1200</b> and the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>. In particular, <figref>FIG. 18</figref> shows the hose <b>100</b> removed from the hose storage area <b>1200</b> and the hose access door <b>330</b> closed so that the system <b>10</b> may be operated as before utilizing the wand <b>800</b> connected to the wand connection <b>120</b> at the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b>. The hose cuff <b>110</b> at the first end <b>101</b> of the hose <b>100</b> is connected to the vacuum connection opening <b>310</b> of the standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b>. In this embodiment, the hose <b>100</b> is a current carrying hose and therefore the hose cuff <b>110</b> and the wand <b>800</b> will have a high voltage electrical connection <b>121</b> as outlined above to carry high voltage current from the high voltage connection <b>320</b> of the standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b> and a low voltage electrical connection <b>122</b> as discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Because of the hose access door <b>330</b> and seal <b>530</b>, there is no air flow in the hose storage pipe <b>1202</b>, which constitutes the hose storage area <b>1200</b> in this embodiment, while the standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b> is in use. Therefore, the seal <b>530</b> in the hose access door <b>330</b> causes a vacuum seal on the hose storage area <b>1200</b>, which is represented by the âXâ in <figref>FIG. 18</figref> preventing fluid flow in the hose storage area <b>1200</b> even when the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> is in use. This is to be contrasted with the storage area <b>200</b> in the embodiment of the vacuum inlet valve <b>300</b> shown above, where there is fluid flow, and also entrained waste in the hose storage area <b>200</b>, when the standard dual-volt inlet valve <b>301</b> is in use.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 18</figref>, during cleaning, dirt and dust will become entrained in the vacuum V created by the vacuum source <b>3</b> and will be sucked through the hose <b>100</b>, the hose cuff <b>110</b>, the vacuum inlet connection opening <b>310</b> of the standard dual volt inlet valve <b>301</b> and then through the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b> for collection in the canister <b>9</b> of the vacuum source <b>3</b>. As such, no waste, such as dust and dirt, will pass through the hose storage area <b>1200</b> in this embodiment. In this way, the hose storage area <b>1200</b> will be maintained somewhat cleaner than the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>, and thus avoiding waste, such as dust and dirt, coming into contact with the hose <b>100</b> during storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">
        <figref>FIG. 19</figref> illustrates storage of the hose <b>100</b> with the vacuum inlet valve <b>1300</b>. Similar to the above, the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> is initially manually inserted into the hose access chamber <b>370</b> and through the hose access opening <b>332</b>. The second end <b>102</b> is placed near, including possibly into, the hose storage area <b>1200</b>. The vacuum system <b>10</b> is then activated using the manual switch <b>340</b> to create a vacuum V in the hose storage area <b>1200</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, a suction will also be created in the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>, but because the hose cuff <b>110</b> is connected to the vacuum inlet <b>301</b>, no air will pass through the waste conveying portion <b>1010</b>, which is represented by the âXâ in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, because the second end <b>102</b> is experiencing a similar vacuum V in the hose storage area <b>1200</b>. Rather, the vacuum V generated by the system <b>10</b> will retract the second end <b>102</b> of the hose <b>100</b> into the hose storage area <b>1200</b>. The rear surface <b>111</b> of the hose cuff <b>110</b> is abutting against the abutment surface <b>210</b> to avoid further retraction of the hose <b>100</b> into the hose storage area <b>1200</b> as discussed above. The door <b>330</b> will then be closed creating a vacuum seal so that other vacuum inlet valves (not shown) in the system <b>10</b> can be used without degradation of the vacuum. When the hose access door <b>330</b> is closed, the manual switch <b>340</b> will also be covered to avoid accidental operation of the switch <b>340</b> and any unintended activation of the vacuum source <b>3</b> of the central vacuum system <b>10</b>.</p>
