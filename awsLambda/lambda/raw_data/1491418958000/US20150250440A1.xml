      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a radiographic image capturing system (imaging system) and a radiographic image capturing method (imaging method), which perform a radiographic image capturing process by applying radiation from a radiation source to a subject according to image capturing conditions, and by converting radiation that has passed through the subject into a radiographic image by a radiation detector. The present invention also relates to a non-transitory recording medium storing a program therein for performing such a radiographic image capturing process.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Heretofore, it has been customary to capture a radiographic image of a breast of a subject, for example, in the following manner. First, the breast is compressed and then image capturing conditions are set, which represent a tube voltage of a radiation source, an mAs value (the product of the tube current and an irradiation time for the radiation), the thickness of the compressed breast, and the types of a target and a filter that make up the radiation source. Then, the radiation source applies radiation to the compressed breast according to the set image capturing conditions. Radiation that has passed through the breast is converted into a radiographic image by a radiation detector. Thereafter, the image capturing conditions that were used during capturing of the radiographic image are displayed as an exposure dose record of the subject on a display device.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In a case where the doctor or radiological technician manually sets image capturing conditions and performs a radiographic image capturing process (manual radiographic image capturing process) according to the set image capturing conditions, without enabling an AEC (automatic exposure control) function, the doctor or radiological technician may set image capturing conditions in terms of image quality (contrast) of a radiographic image to be captured, without regard to the exposure dose applied to the subject. As a result, the subject may undergo a meaningless exposure to radiation.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">According to the radiographic image capturing process of the conventional technique, value has been placed only on the image quality of radiographic images to be captured, and there has been a lack of interest in the exposure dose applied to the subject. In recent years, radiographic image capturing techniques for reducing the exposure dose applied to the subject have been disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-263097, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-173924, and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2010-167165.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, even with the techniques disclosed in the above publications, a radiographic image capturing process is carried out on the subject before the image capturing conditions are set, in order to determine image capturing conditions. More specifically, according to the techniques disclosed in the above publications, two radiographic image capturing processes are performed in order to acquire a desired radiographic image (i.e., a first radiographic image capturing process for determining image capturing conditions, and a second radiographic image capturing process for acquiring a radiographic image). Consequently, since the first radiographic image capturing process is added, the accumulated exposure dose applied to the subject can be expected to increase, despite the fact that the techniques disclosed in the above publications are aimed at reducing the exposure dose applied to the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Further, the above publications do not disclose that, in a case where a doctor or radiological technician manually sets image capturing conditions, the doctor or radiological technician is prompted to recognize, prior to performing a radiographic image capturing process on a subject, the exposure dose applied to the subject at the time that radiation is applied to the subject under the manually-set image capturing conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The present invention has been devised in order to solve the aforementioned problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a radiographic image capturing system, a radiographic image capturing method, and a non-transitory recording medium, which are capable of prompting a doctor or radiological technician to recognize beforehand an exposure dose applied to a subject in a radiographic image capturing process (manual radiographic image capturing process), which is carried out on the subject under image capturing conditions that are manually set by the doctor or radiological technician.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A further object of the present invention is to provide a radiographic image capturing system, a radiographic image capturing method, and a non-transitory recording medium, which are capable of prompting a doctor or radiological technician to set proper image capturing conditions, so as to avoid a meaningless exposure dose by having the doctor or radiological technician recognize the exposure dose applied to the subject before a manual radiographic image capturing process is carried out on the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention is concerned with a radiographic image capturing system for carrying out a radiographic image capturing process by setting a tube voltage of a radiation source, an mAs value, types of a target and a filter that make up the radiation source, and information concerning a subject, as image capturing conditions, by an image capturing condition setting section, thereafter applying radiation from the radiation source to the subject according to the image capturing conditions, and converting the radiation that has passed through the subject into a radiographic image by a radiation detector.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The radiographic image capturing system includes an estimated exposure dose calculator configured to calculate an estimated exposure dose representing an estimated value of a dose to which the subject will be exposed by applying radiation to the subject, on the basis of the image capturing conditions after the image capturing conditions have been set and before the radiographic image capturing process is carried out, and an exposure dose output unit configured to output, to outside, the estimated exposure dose that has been calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The present invention also is concerned with a radiographic image capturing method for carrying out a radiographic image capturing process by setting a tube voltage of a radiation source, an mAs value, types of a target and a filter that make up the radiation source, and information concerning a subject, as image capturing conditions, thereafter applying radiation from the radiation source to the subject according to the image capturing conditions, and converting the radiation that has passed through the subject into a radiographic image by a radiation detector.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The radiographic image capturing method includes a first step of calculating an estimated exposure dose representing an estimated value of a dose to which the subject will be exposed by applying radiation to the subject, on the basis of the image capturing conditions after the image capturing conditions have been set and before the radiographic image capturing process is carried out, and a second step of outputting, to outside, the estimated exposure dose that has been calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention is further concerned with a non-transitory recording medium storing a program therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The program that is stored in the non-transitory recording medium enables a computer to function as:</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">an image capturing condition setting section configured to set a tube voltage of a radiation source, an mAs value, types of a target and a filter that make up the radiation source, and information concerning a subject, as image capturing conditions;</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">an estimated exposure dose calculator configured to calculate an estimated exposure dose representing an estimated value of a dose to which the subject will be exposed by applying radiation to the subject, on the basis of the image capturing conditions before a radiographic image capturing process is carried out for applying radiation from the radiation source to the subject according to the image capturing conditions after the image capturing conditions have been set, and converting radiation that has passed through the subject into a radiographic image by a radiation detector; and</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">an exposure dose output unit configured to output, to outside, the estimated exposure dose that has been calculated.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to the present invention, after the image capturing conditions have been set and before the radiographic image capturing process is carried out, the estimated exposure dose is calculated, and the estimated exposure dose that has been calculated is output to outside. On the basis of the output results, the doctor or radiological technician can recognize in advance how much of an exposure dose the subject will be subjected to during the radiographic image capturing process (manual radiographic image capturing process) performed according to the image capturing conditions. Thus, the doctor or radiological technician can appropriately set image capturing conditions even manually, so as to prevent the subject from being subjected to a meaningless exposure dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">As a result, it is possible to set image capturing conditions in order to maintain the image quality (contrast) of a radiographic image while avoiding a meaningless exposure dose with respect to the subject. Since the estimated exposure dose is output prior to a radiographic image capturing process, it is not necessary to carry out a radiographic image capturing process for determining image capturing conditions, thereby reducing the accumulated exposure dose applied to the subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The present invention may include the following additional features [1] through [7]:</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">[1] The radiographic image capturing system may further include an estimated exposure dose adjuster configured to adjust the estimated exposure dose. In a case where the estimated exposure dose, which is calculated by the estimated exposure dose calculator, is relatively large, for example, it is possible for the estimated exposure dose adjuster to adjust the estimated exposure dose to a lower value. Further, it is possible to reset image capturing conditions by referring to the estimated exposure dose that has been adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">[2] The radiographic image capturing system may further include an image capturing condition adjuster configured to adjust the image capturing conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In this case, in a case where the estimated exposure dose adjuster adjusts the estimated exposure dose, the image capturing condition adjuster automatically adjusts the image capturing conditions on the basis of the estimated exposure dose that has been adjusted. Alternatively, in a case where the image capturing condition adjuster adjusts the image capturing conditions, the estimated exposure dose adjuster automatically adjusts the estimated exposure dose on the basis of the image capturing conditions that have been adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In either case, since the image capturing conditions or the estimated exposure dose is automatically adjusted in terms of the exposure dose applied to the subject, the exposure dose applied to the subject can be reduced efficiently, and at the same time, the image quality of the radiographic image can be maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">[3] The image capturing condition adjuster preferably adjusts the image capturing conditions by changing the mAs value in a state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value. The tube voltage is a factor that determines the image quality (contrast) of the radiographic image. Therefore, assuming that the image capturing conditions are adjusted by changing the mAs value in a state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value, the exposure dose applied to the subject can be reduced without causing a reduction in the image quality of the radiographic image.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">[4] The radiographic image capturing system may further include a table representing a relationship between estimated exposure doses, tube voltages, and mAs values. In this case, by referring to the table, the image capturing condition adjuster may specify an mAs value depending on the estimated exposure dose calculated by the estimated exposure dose calculator, or may specify an mAs value depending on the estimated exposure dose adjusted by the estimated exposure dose adjuster. Consequently, the image capturing conditions (mAs value) can be adjusted efficiently.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">[5] The exposure dose output unit may output the estimated exposure dose that has been adjusted by the estimated exposure dose adjuster, so that the doctor or radiological technician can recognize the estimated exposure dose that has been adjusted, prior to the radiographic image capturing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">[6] In a case where the exposure dose output unit includes a display unit configured to display the estimated exposure dose and the image capturing conditions, by viewing the content displayed on the display unit, the doctor or radiological technician can easily recognize the estimated exposure dose and the image capturing conditions prior to the radiographic image capturing process.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">[7] The radiographic image capturing system further includes a radiographic image capturing apparatus including the radiation source and the radiation detector, and a control apparatus configured to control the radiographic image capturing apparatus, the control apparatus including the image capturing condition setting section, the estimated exposure dose calculator, and the exposure dose output unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In this case, the radiographic image capturing apparatus further includes an image capturing table on which a breast of the subject is placed, the image capturing table housing the radiation detector therein, a compression member configured to compress the breast by displacement of the compression member toward the image capturing table, and a compressed thickness measurement unit configured to measure the thickness of the breast that is compressed by the compression member.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Further, the radiation source applies radiation to the breast that has been compressed, and the radiation detector converts the radiation that has passed through the breast into the radiographic image. Among the image capturing conditions, the information concerning the subject represents the thickness of the breast of the subject, and the estimated exposure dose represents an estimated value of an average mammary gland dose applied to the breast.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The present invention, as applied to a mammographic apparatus, is effective both at reducing an exposure dose applied to the breast, and maintaining the image quality of a radiographic image of the breast.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The aforementioned objects and other objects, characteristics, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following descriptions of preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">A radiographic image capturing system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in relation to a radiographic image capturing method and a non-transitory recording medium.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">[Configuration of Radiographic Image Capturing System]</heading>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the radiographic image capturing system <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment comprises a mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> as a radiographic image capturing apparatus, and a console <b>14</b> as a control apparatus (computer) for controlling the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> acquires a radiographic image of a breast <b>18</b> of a subject <b>16</b> by applying radiation <b>20</b> to the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">More specifically, the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> includes a radiation source <b>22</b> for emitting radiation <b>20</b>, an image capturing table <b>26</b> on which a breast <b>18</b> of the subject is placed, and a compression plate (compression member) <b>24</b> disposed between the radiation source <b>22</b> and the image capturing table <b>26</b>, and which is displaceable toward the image capturing table <b>26</b> for compressing and holding the breast <b>18</b> in cooperation with the image capturing table <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The image capturing table <b>26</b> houses therein a solid-state detector (radiation detector) <b>28</b> for converting radiation <b>20</b> that has passed through the breast <b>18</b> into a radiographic image, and an AEC sensor <b>30</b> disposed behind the solid-state detector <b>28</b> with respect to the direction in which radiation <b>20</b> is applied.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The radiation source <b>22</b> comprises a thermionic-emission-type X-ray source that is controlled by a radiation source controller <b>32</b>. More specifically, in the radiation source <b>22</b>, there are accommodated a cathode <b>34</b> for emitting thermions, a target <b>38</b> serving as an anode for emitting radiation such as X-rays or the like from a focus <b>36</b> as a result of collision of thermions, which are emitted from the cathode <b>34</b>, with the target <b>38</b>, and a filter <b>40</b> through which radiation of a desired quality is passed, which serves as radiation <b>20</b>, from among the radiation that is emitted from the target <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">According to the present embodiment, a combination of the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b> may be represented by Mo/Mo, Mo/Rh, Rh/Rh, Rh/Al, W/Rh, or W/Al, for example, which indicates the âtype of target <b>38</b>â/âtype of filter <b>40</b>â.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> also includes a compression plate actuator <b>42</b>, a compressed thickness measurement unit <b>44</b>, a detector controller <b>46</b>, an image memory <b>48</b>, an exposure time calculator <b>50</b>, an exposure switch <b>52</b>, an input operating unit <b>54</b>, and a communication unit <b>56</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The compression plate actuator <b>42</b> moves the compression plate <b>24</b>, which is disposed between the radiation source <b>22</b> and the image capturing table <b>26</b>, toward and away from the image capturing table <b>26</b>. Upon compression of the breast <b>18</b> between the compression plate <b>24</b> and the image capturing table <b>26</b>, the compressed thickness measurement unit <b>44</b> measures the position of the compression plate <b>24</b>, which represents the thickness (compressed thickness d) of the compressed breast <b>18</b>. The compressed thickness measurement unit <b>44</b> also measures the pressure (compressing pressure P) that is applied from the compression plate <b>24</b> to the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The detector controller <b>46</b> controls the solid-state detector <b>28</b> to acquire a radiographic image from the solid-state detector <b>28</b>, and stores the acquired radiographic image in the image memory <b>48</b>. The detector controller <b>46</b> also is capable of controlling the AEC sensor <b>30</b> and the exposure time calculator <b>50</b> in order to perform an AEC function, which is of a known nature.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">More specifically, a pre-exposure process is performed to apply radiation <b>20</b> of a relatively low dose from the radiation source <b>22</b> to the breast <b>18</b>, with the object of setting image capturing conditions for a radiographic image capturing process to be carried out on the breast <b>18</b>, whereupon the AEC sensor <b>30</b> detects the exposure dose of radiation <b>20</b> that has passed through the breast <b>18</b> and the solid-state detector <b>28</b>. Based on the detected radiation dose per unit time at a position of a mammary gland of the breast <b>18</b>, the exposure time calculator <b>50</b> calculates an appropriate exposure time for the radiation <b>20</b> from the radiation source <b>22</b>. Thereafter, the calculated exposure time is output to the radiation source controller <b>32</b> as an irradiation time for the radiation <b>20</b> in a main exposure process for acquiring a radiographic image of the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">According to the present embodiment, the AEC function is disabled so that the pre-exposure process is not carried out. More specifically, according to the present embodiment, image capturing conditions are set on the basis of an instruction from the doctor or radiological technician. Further, a manual image capturing process (radiographic image capturing process) for applying radiation <b>20</b> to the breast <b>18</b> is carried out according to the set image capturing conditions. The manual image capturing process according to the present embodiment corresponds to the above-described main image capturing process. In the present embodiment, therefore, detailed description of the AEC function is omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The exposure switch <b>52</b> is operated by the doctor or radiological technician. In a case where the doctor or radiological technician presses the exposure switch <b>52</b>, the radiation source controller <b>32</b> energizes the radiation source <b>22</b> in order to enable the radiation source <b>22</b> to initiate emission of radiation <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The input operating unit <b>54</b> is an input operating unit such as an operating button or a touch panel provided on the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b>. In response to an operation carried out on the input operating unit <b>54</b> by the doctor or radiological technician, the detector controller <b>46</b> controls the AEC sensor <b>30</b> and the exposure time calculator <b>50</b>, so as to enable (turn on) or disable (turn off) the AEC function. In response to an operation carried out on the input operating unit <b>54</b> by the doctor or radiological technician, the compression plate actuator <b>42</b> moves the compression plate <b>24</b> in order to compress the breast <b>18</b> that has been placed on the image capturing table <b>26</b>, or to release the breast <b>18</b> from a compressed state.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The communication unit <b>56</b> sends various signals and information to or receives various signals and information from the console <b>14</b> through a communication line <b>58</b>. For example, the communication unit <b>56</b> may send a radiographic image, which the detector controller <b>46</b> has read from the image memory <b>48</b>, to the console <b>14</b> through a communication line <b>58</b>. The communication unit <b>56</b> may also send the compressed thickness d of the breast <b>18</b> and the compressing pressure P applied to the breast <b>18</b>, which have been measured by the thickness measurement unit <b>44</b>, to the console <b>14</b> through the communication line <b>58</b>. The communication unit <b>56</b> receives image capturing conditions for a radiographic image capturing process, which is to be performed on the breast <b>18</b>, from the console <b>14</b> through the communication line <b>58</b>, and outputs the received image capturing conditions to the radiation source controller <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> and the console <b>14</b> communicate with each other over a wired communication link provided by the communication line <b>58</b>. However, the present embodiment is not limited to such illustrated details, insofar as signals and information may be exchanged between the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> and the console <b>14</b> according to a known communication method such as a wireless communication link, an infrared communication link, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">The console <b>14</b> includes a communication unit <b>60</b>, a controller <b>62</b>, an input operating unit <b>64</b>, a display unit (exposure dose output unit) <b>66</b>, an image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, an estimated AGD calculator (estimated exposure dose calculator) <b>70</b>, an estimated AGD adjuster (estimated exposure dose adjuster) <b>72</b>, an automatic mAs value calculator (image capturing condition adjuster) <b>74</b>, a table <b>76</b>, an image processor <b>78</b>, an image memory <b>80</b>, and a memory (non-transitory recording medium) <b>82</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The controller <b>62</b> controls various components of the console <b>14</b> by reading and executing programs stored in the memory <b>82</b>, which comprises a non-transitory recording medium such as a ROM, a hard disk, a CD-ROM, or the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> sets image capturing conditions in relation to a radiographic image capturing process for applying radiation <b>20</b> from the radiation source <b>22</b> to the breast <b>18</b>, converting radiation <b>20</b> that has passed through the breast <b>18</b> into a radiographic image with the solid-state detector <b>28</b>, and acquiring a radiographic image. The image capturing conditions include a tube voltage of the radiation source <b>22</b>, an mAs value (a product of a tube current and an irradiation time for the radiation <b>20</b>), types of the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b> that make up the radiation source <b>22</b>, and the compressed thickness d of the breast <b>18</b>, which represents information concerning the subject <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The image capturing conditions are set in response to an operation carried out by the doctor or radiological technician on the input operating unit <b>64</b>, which may be an operating button or an input operating unit of a touch panel, for example. In other words, the image capturing conditions are entered manually by the doctor or radiological technician, whereby the image capturing conditions are set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">After the image capturing conditions have been set, the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> calculates an estimated exposure dose representing an estimated value of the dose to which (the breast <b>18</b> of) the subject <b>16</b> will be exposed by applying radiation <b>20</b> to the breast <b>18</b> according to the image capturing conditions, on the basis of the image capturing conditions set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and before a radiographic image capturing process actually is carried out on the breast <b>18</b>. More specifically, the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> estimates an average mammary gland dose (AGD) based on the image capturing conditions, and calculates the estimated level of the AGD (hereinafter referred to as an âestimated AGDâ) as an estimated exposure dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The estimated AGD represents an average value, which is estimated according to the image capturing conditions, of the radiation dose that is absorbed by the mammary gland of the breast <b>18</b> while the breast <b>18</b> is uniformly compressed between the compression plate <b>24</b> and the image capturing table <b>26</b>. The estimated AGD is expressed by the following equation (1):</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae](Estimated AGD)=<i>KÃgÃcÃs</i>ââ(1)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0000">where K [mGy] represents a skin surface dose (dose of radiation <b>20</b> applied to the breast <b>18</b>), âgâ represents a conversion coefficient for a mammary gland content rate of 50%, âcâ represents a corrective coefficient for a mammary gland content rate that deviates from 50%, and âsâ represents a corrective coefficient for the materials that constitute the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b>. Thus, according to equation (1), the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> can calculate an estimated AGD based on the image capturing conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0061">The estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> adjusts the estimated AGD that was calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>. For example, in a case where the estimated AGD is higher than a desired dose (i.e., in a case where the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b> is high due to the image capturing conditions), the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> adjusts the estimated AGD to a lower value.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0062">The automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> automatically adjusts the mAs value in a state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value from among the image capturing conditions set by the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and updates the image capturing conditions contained in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> into changed image capturing conditions. More specifically, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> automatically adjusts the mAs value based on the estimated AGD that was calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>, or automatically adjusts the mAs value based on the estimated AGD that was adjusted by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>. Using the input operating unit <b>64</b>, in a case where the doctor or radiological technician enters an instruction indicating a change in the image capturing conditions, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> also is capable of adjusting the mAs value depending on such an instruction.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0063">The table <b>76</b> stores a table representing a relationship between estimated AGDs, tube voltages, and mAs values. Therefore, by referring to the table <b>76</b>, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> can read image capturing conditions from the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, extract the tube voltages and the mAs values from the read image capturing conditions, and specify an mAs value corresponding to the estimated AGD that was calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>, or the estimated AGD that was adjusted by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>, and the tube voltage.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0064">The display unit <b>66</b> displays the image capturing conditions and the estimated AGD. More specifically, (1) in a case where image capturing conditions are set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, (2) in a case where the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> calculates an estimated AGD, (3) in a case where the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> adjusts an estimated AGD, or (4) in a case where image capturing conditions are updated by the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b>, the display unit <b>66</b> displays the image capturing conditions, which have been set or updated, and the estimated AGD, which has been calculated or adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0065">Under the control of the controller <b>62</b>, the communication unit <b>60</b> sends the image capturing conditions, which are set or updated in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, through the communication line <b>58</b> to the communication unit <b>56</b> of the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b>. The communication unit <b>60</b> also outputs the compressed thickness d, the compressing pressure P, and the radiographic image, which have been received from the communication unit <b>56</b> through the communication line <b>58</b>, to the controller <b>62</b>. The controller <b>62</b> outputs the compressed thickness d and the compressing pressure P as image capturing conditions to the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>. In addition, the controller <b>62</b> stores the radiographic image in the image memory <b>80</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0066">The image processor <b>78</b> performs a prescribed image processing routine on the radiographic image that is stored in the image memory <b>80</b>, stores the processed radiographic image in the image memory <b>80</b>, and displays the processed radiographic image on the display unit <b>66</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0068">A case will be described in which, after the AEC function has been turned off, image capturing conditions are set manually by the doctor or radiological technician, the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> calculates an estimated AGD using the set image capturing conditions, the estimated AGD is displayed on the display unit <b>66</b>, and thereafter, a radiographic image capturing process (manual radiographic image capturing process) is carried out on the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0069">In step S<b>1</b> of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the doctor or radiological technician places the breast <b>18</b> on the image capturing table <b>26</b>. Next, in response to an operation carried out on the input operating unit <b>54</b> by the doctor or radiological technician, the compression plate actuator <b>42</b> moves the compression plate <b>24</b> toward the image capturing table <b>26</b>, thereby causing the compression plate <b>24</b> and the image capturing table <b>26</b> to compress the breast <b>18</b>. The compressed thickness measurement unit <b>44</b> measures a compressed thickness d and a compressing pressure P, and outputs information representing the compressed thickness d and the compressing pressure P, which have been measured, to the communication unit <b>56</b>. The communication unit <b>56</b> sends the information through the communication line <b>58</b> to the communication unit <b>60</b>. Among the information received through the communication unit <b>60</b>, the controller <b>62</b> sets the compressed thickness d in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0070">In the next step S<b>2</b>, the doctor or radiological technician operates the input operating unit <b>54</b> in order to disable the AEC function. Consequently, in accordance with a signal from the input operating unit <b>54</b>, the detector controller <b>46</b> controls the AEC sensor <b>30</b> and the exposure time calculator <b>50</b> so as not to operate.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0071">In step S<b>3</b>, the doctor or radiological technician operates the input operating unit <b>64</b> in order to enter a tube voltage, a tube current, and an irradiation time (mAs value). At this time, the compressed thickness d already is set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>. Further, assuming that the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b> have been placed in the radiation source <b>22</b>, the types of the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b> are preset in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0072">Therefore, the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> sets the tube voltage and the mAs value that have been entered, the compressed thickness d, which has already been set, and the types of the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b>, as image capturing conditions for a radiographic image capturing process to be performed with respect to the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0073">In step S<b>4</b> (first step), the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> reads the image capturing conditions that were set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and calculates an estimated AGD based on the read image capturing conditions according to equation (1). In step S<b>5</b> (second step), the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> displays the calculated AGD on the display unit <b>66</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0074">In step S<b>6</b>, the doctor or radiological technician views the estimated AGD that is displayed on the display unit <b>66</b>, and considers whether or not to adjust the estimated AGD.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0075">For example, in a case where the estimated AGD represents a large dose on the breast <b>18</b>, the doctor or radiological technician determines that the estimated AGD is too high (step S<b>6</b>: YES), and operates the input operating unit <b>64</b> to set the estimated AGD to a lower value. In this case, the doctor or radiological technician may operate the input operating unit <b>64</b> in order to enter a dose value that is lower than the estimated AGD, or to enter an instruction for reducing the high estimated AGD to a lower value.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0076">In the next step S<b>7</b>, according to an instruction from the input operating unit <b>64</b>, the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> adjusts (recalculates) the value of the estimated AGD. In the following step S<b>8</b>, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> reads the image capturing conditions from the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and by referring to the table <b>76</b>, specifies an mAs value that corresponds with the tube voltage from among the read image capturing conditions and the estimated AGD adjusted by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>. At this time, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> specifies an mAs value that corresponds with the tube voltage and the estimated AGD in a state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value. In addition, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> updates the image capturing conditions, which are set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, into new image capturing conditions including the specified mAs value.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0077">In a case where, in step S<b>6</b>, the doctor or radiological technician determines that the estimated AGD does not need to be adjusted (step S<b>6</b>: NO) but that the image capturing conditions should be adjusted (step S<b>9</b>: YES), the doctor or radiological technician operates the input operating unit <b>64</b> in order to enter desired image capturing conditions. At this time as well, with respect to the entered image capturing conditions, by referring to the table <b>76</b>, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> specifies an mAs value depending on the tube voltage, which is set to a fixed value, and the estimated AGD that was calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> (step S<b>10</b>). As a result, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> updates the image capturing conditions that are set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> into new image capturing conditions including the specified mAs value. Further, since the image capturing conditions have been updated, in step S<b>11</b>, the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b> recalculates an estimated AGD based on the updated image capturing conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0078">In a case where the doctor or radiological technician, having viewed the estimated AGD displayed on the display unit <b>66</b>, judges that both the estimated AGD and the image capturing conditions do not need to be adjusted (step S<b>6</b>: NO, step S<b>9</b>: NO), using the input operating unit <b>64</b>, the doctor or radiological technician enters an instruction indicating that there is no need for adjustment. Based on the entered instruction, the controller <b>62</b> controls the various components of the console <b>14</b> so as not to execute steps S<b>7</b>, S<b>8</b>, S<b>10</b>, and S<b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0079">As a consequence, in step S<b>12</b>, the controller <b>62</b> controls the display unit <b>66</b> in order to display the image capturing conditions and the estimated AGD that have finally been determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0080">More specifically, in a case where the estimated AGD and the image capturing conditions do not need to be adjusted (step S<b>6</b>: NO, step S<b>9</b>: NO), the controller <b>62</b> controls the display unit <b>66</b> to display the image capturing conditions, which were initially set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> in step S<b>3</b>, and the estimated AGD, which was calculated in step S<b>4</b> by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0081">In a case where the estimated AGD is adjusted in steps S<b>6</b> and S<b>7</b>, the controller <b>62</b> controls the display unit <b>66</b> to display the estimated AGD that was recalculated by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> in step S<b>7</b>, and the image capturing conditions that were updated by the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b> in step S<b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0082">In a case where the image capturing conditions are adjusted in steps S<b>10</b> and S<b>11</b>, the controller <b>62</b> controls the display unit <b>66</b> to display the image capturing conditions that were updated in step S<b>10</b> by the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and the estimated AGD that was recalculated in step S<b>11</b> by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0084">The radiation source controller <b>32</b> issues a request through the communication unit <b>56</b> for the console <b>14</b> to transmit image capturing conditions. Based on the transmission request sent from the radiation source controller <b>32</b> through the communication line <b>58</b> and the communication unit <b>60</b>, the controller <b>62</b> reads the image capturing conditions (i.e., the initially set image capturing conditions or the updated image capturing conditions) that are set in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, and sends the read image capturing conditions to the mammographic apparatus <b>12</b> through the communication unit <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0085">Upon receiving the image capturing conditions through the communication line <b>58</b> and the communication unit <b>56</b>, the radiation source controller <b>32</b> energizes the radiation source <b>22</b> according to the received image capturing conditions, thereby causing the radiation source <b>22</b> to emit radiation <b>20</b>. Radiation <b>20</b> emitted from the radiation source <b>22</b> is applied through the compression plate <b>24</b> to the breast <b>18</b>. The emitted radiation <b>20</b> passes through the breast <b>18</b>, and is converted into a radiographic image by the solid-state detector <b>28</b> in the image capturing table <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0086">The detector controller <b>46</b> reads the radiographic image from the solid-state detector <b>28</b>, and temporarily stores the radiographic image in the image memory <b>48</b>.

      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0087">The controller <b>62</b> receives the radiographic image through the communication line <b>58</b> and the communication unit <b>60</b>, and stores the radiographic image in the image memory <b>80</b>.

The image processor <b>78</b> also displays the processed radiographic image on the display unit <b>66</b>, and stores the processed radiographic image in the image memory <b>80</b> (step S<b>14</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0088">The doctor or radiological technician views the radiographic image displayed on the display unit <b>66</b>, and confirms that the desired radiographic image has been acquired.

        <figref>FIG. 3A</figref> shows the content that is displayed on the screen of the display unit after the radiographic image capturing process on the breast <b>18</b> has been completed according to the background art.</p>

According to the background art, therefore, the doctor or radiological technician is not able to recognize an exposure dose (AGD) applied to the breast <b>18</b> in advance of the radiographic image capturing process. In the displayed content shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, âAEC Manuâ indicates that the AEC function is disabled and that a manual radiographic image capturing process is carried out, âTarget/Filter Mo/Moâ indicates that both the target <b>38</b> and the filter <b>40</b> are made of Mo, âkVâ and âmAsâ represent a tube voltage and an mAs value, respectively, and âCompâ indicates a compressing pressure P and a compressed thickness d.</p>

In a case where the display unit <b>66</b> displays the content shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref> on the screen thereof in step S<b>12</b>, by viewing the estimated AGD and the image capturing conditions, the doctor or radiological technician can recognize that the radiographic image capturing process in step S<b>13</b> will be performed on the breast <b>18</b> under such conditions.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0093">According to the present embodiment, as described above, after the image capturing conditions have been set and before a radiographic image capturing process is carried out, an estimated AGD is calculated, and the estimated AGD that has been calculated is displayed on the display unit <b>66</b>. Based on the displayed content, the doctor or radiological technician is capable of recognizing, in advance of the radiographic image capturing process, how much of an exposure dose the breast <b>18</b> of the subject <b>16</b> will be subjected to during the radiographic image capturing process (manual radiographic image capturing process) performed according to the image capturing conditions. Thus, the doctor or radiological technician can appropriately set the image capturing conditions even manually, so as to prevent the subject <b>16</b> from being subjected to a meaningless exposure dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0094">As a result, it is possible to set image capturing conditions in order to maintain the image quality (contrast) of a radiographic image while avoiding a meaningless exposure dose with respect to the breast <b>18</b>. Since the estimated AGD is displayed on the display unit <b>66</b> prior to the radiographic image capturing process, it is not necessary to carry out a radiographic image capturing process (pre-exposure process) for determining image capturing conditions, thereby reducing the accumulated exposure dose applied to the subject <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0095">Since the console <b>14</b> includes the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>, in a case where the estimated AGD, which is calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>, is relatively large, for example, it is possible to adjust the estimated AGD to a lower value. As a result, it is possible to reset the image capturing conditions by referring to the estimated AGD that has been adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0096">Inasmuch as the console <b>14</b> includes the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b>, in a case where the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> adjusts the estimated AGD, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> automatically adjusts the image capturing conditions on the basis of the estimated AGD that has been adjusted. Alternatively, in a case where the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> adjusts the image capturing conditions, the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> automatically adjusts the estimated AGD on the basis of the image capturing conditions that have been adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0097">In either case, since the image capturing conditions or the estimated AGD is automatically adjusted in terms of the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b>, the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b> can be reduced efficiently, and at the same time, the image quality of the radiographic image can be maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0098">More specifically, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> adjusts the image capturing conditions by changing the mAs value in a state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value. The tube voltage is a factor that determines the image quality (contrast) of the radiographic image. Therefore, assuming that the image capturing conditions are adjusted by changing the mAs value in state where the tube voltage is set to a fixed value, the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b> can be reduced without causing a reduction in the image quality of the radiographic image. In other words, the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b> is reduced efficiently, while at the same time, the image quality of the radiographic image is maintained by adjusting the image capturing conditions in terms of the exposure dose applied to the breast <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0099">Further, the automatic mAs value calculator <b>74</b> specifies an mAs value depending on the estimated AGD that was calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>, or specifies an mAs value depending on the estimated AGD that was adjusted by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b> with reference to the table <b>76</b>. Thus, the mAs value can be adjusted efficiently.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0100">Furthermore, the display unit <b>66</b> displays the image capturing conditions, which have been set or updated in the image capturing condition setting section <b>68</b>, the estimated AGD, which has been calculated by the estimated AGD calculator <b>70</b>, and the estimated AGD, which has been adjusted by the estimated AGD adjuster <b>72</b>. Therefore, by viewing the displayed content before the radiographic image capturing process is carried out, the doctor or radiological technician can easily recognize the image capturing conditions that have been set or updated, and the estimated AGD that has been calculated or adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0101">In the above description, the console <b>14</b> is capable of adjusting the mAs value and the estimated AGD. However, the present embodiment is not limited to this description, and it is possible to adjust the tube voltage insofar as the image quality of the radiographic image is not lowered. Furthermore, since the mAs value represents the product of the tube current and the irradiation time of the radiation <b>20</b>, it is possible to adjust the mAs value by adjusting only one of the tube current or the irradiation time. Consequently, according to the present embodiment, the console <b>14</b> is capable of adjusting each of the tube voltage, the tube current, the irradiation time for the radiation <b>20</b>, and the estimated AGD.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0102">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above. Various changes and modifications can freely be made to the invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
