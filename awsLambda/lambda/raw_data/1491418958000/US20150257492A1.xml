    <summary>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to ski boots and other shoes or footwear (for example, work shoes, sneakers, roller blades, and ice skates) as well as the attachment of ski boots to skis. More particularly, the present invention relates to the sizing of the footwear to achieve improved balance and/or mobility and/or flexion as well as the attachment of ski boots to skis to achieve improved balance.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Typical ski equipment set-ups leave many people in very poor fore/aft positions, i.e., leaving many people inclined too far backward. This makes it difficult to balance with the result that it is harder to learn to ski, with more tiring and an increased risk of injury. To achieve better balance, the skier's feet should often be inclined relative to the skis so that the heel portion of a ski boot is raised relative to the height of the toe portion thereof. The correct fore and aft position will vary depending on the skier's body type. It is thus considered desirable for a skier to be able to adjust his or her fore and aft position (i.e., adjust the height of the heel end portion of the ski boot) to achieve the correct balance for him or her. Such an adjustment may be characterized as an adjustment of the angle of the leg relative to the ski or ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Various devices of interest relative to adjusting the heel portion height are disclosed in my aforesaid patent as well as in the art cited therein.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Additional art which may be of interest (generally relative to foot contour, as discussed hereinafter) to the present invention includes U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,821,420; 5,941,835; 5,979,067; 6,205,230; 6,219,929; 6,334,257; 2004/0193075; 6,829,377; 2006/0030793; 7,125,509; 2006/0225297; and 7,335,167. The hoof angles of horses have been modified by trimming the hoofs.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">As discussed at pages 10 to 14 of the booklet <i>Masterfit University the Bootfitters BibleâThe Master's Course</i>, Master Fit Enterprises, Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., 1994-2003, the foot has a very intricate network of 26 bones which slip and slide relative to each other. When performing properly, these bones allow very intricate movements easily of the foot. However, if not suitably positioned relative to each other, these bones may also collide with each other or jam together, resulting in trauma such as callus formation and may result in loss of optimum mobility and/or flexion and/or balance. This booklet recommends orthotics and custom footpads for callus formations and, in severe cases, a metatarsal pad and/or a depression. Other suggested solutions include adjusting for pronation with custom footbeds or varus wedges and to use thicker insole and/or eliminator to compensate for a low volume foot. Motions in a group of bones known as the subtalar-transverse tarsal joint complex are said to allow the foot to absorb impacts, accommodate for uneven surfaces, and act as a rigid lever, and it is in this complex where locking and unlocking of the foot may commonly occur. It is thus important that the foot bones be properly positioned relative to each other to achieve optimum movements while skiing or otherwise. While adjustment of the relationship of the leg relative to the ski or ground for improved balance is important, as discussed above, it is also considered important that optimum positioning of the foot bones relative to each other be achieved. Optimum positioning of the foot bones relative to each other is generally related to the contour of the footboard or footbed or bootboard, i.e., the upper surface of the sole or built-up sole within a piece of footwear upon which the foot or an insole rests, an insole being a removable piece (on which the foot rests) which is placed to lie over the sole generally for comfort.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In W. Witherell et al, <i>The Athletic Skier</i>, The Athletic Skier, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah, 1993, at pages 24 to 44, it is discussed that the desired heel lift (the difference between the heel and forefoot levels) significantly affects fore and aft balance, that some feet are best balanced and aligned when the heel and forefoot are on the same plane while others are best balanced and aligned when the heel is higher than the forefoot. Also discussed therein is a way of measuring a person's heel to forefoot differential by having the person stand on various thicknesses of stacks of paper and then the person sensing their balance, i.e., when the right balance is achieved, âyour body will know (the human body senses balance very precisely).â A heel lift under the heel is shown on page 26 thereof. On page 33 thereof, a photo of feet with the left foot supinated and the right foot pronated is shown and another photo is shown with the feet well aligned with proper orthotics. An adjustable cuff is discussed on pages 42 to 44 wherein, after the footbeds or orthotics are put into the boots, the cuff is adjusted so that the space between the leg and shell is equal on both sides.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">
        <i>The Athletic Skier </i>fails to disclose or suggest suitable methods or measuring devices to accurately determine the needs of a person's foot and determine accurately what suitable angles/contours should be on the surface (footboard or footpad) in the footwear that the foot rests upon. For example, one thing this reference fails to take into consideration is that, as the heel to forefoot differential changes, so too does the contour of the foot's arch.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Heel lifts of varying thicknesses and tapers are marketed by Aetrex Worldwide, Inc. of Teaneck, N.J. (www.aetrex.com) and Ski-Kare of Golden, Colo. Aetrex Worldwide, Inc. claims to have patented what it calls the âiStep Evolution-RXâ digital foot scanning technology, which it says on its website is in order to help consumers identify their arch type, shoe size, and pressure points and to custom select/order the ideal footwear and orthotics, including insoles, for their feet. The footwear is custom made from the digital information.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A lift to accommodate leg length discrepancy up to â inch (it has 3 layers with instructions to peel away one layer for Â¼ inch or two layers for â inch), finished with a leather cover, is marketed, under the name Adjust-a-Lift, and under the trade name Treadeasy by Prime Materials Corporation of Batavia, N.Y. See their Treadeasy Catalog 08-09 at page 19 (or see their web page at www.treadeasy.comâunder Product Catalog, Materials, Metatarsal Supports, Adjust-a-Lift).</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The heel lifts are typically placed between the heel and the insole. The thicker part of a wedge-shaped or tapered heel lift is typically placed toward the rear. Typically, a person is instructed to put a heel lift in, go skiing, and leave the heel lift in if the skiing is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The cuff is typically attached to the shell of a ski boot with cammed fasteners or knobs or studs, such as in the Vento ski boot marketed by the Italian company Technica, having a web site of www.technica.it, which are advertised (Technica, Vento Instruction Manual) to allow longitudinal flex of the boot to be adjusted and to allow the cuff to be adjusted from a neutral position to an inwards or outwards tilt. The boot is further advertised (in the above instruction manual) as having an upper liner construction to ensure perfect adaptation to the female calf and to have a patented ratchet system that may be adjusted to 3 different positions to adapt to any type of leg. The boot is further advertised (in the above instruction manual) as providing a specific insert to be applied onto a wedge inside the shell so that the fit in the heel area may be customized more to the female anatomy. Such flex and tilt adjustments may have the incidental consequence merely as a result of their functioning of effecting a small movement of the cuff <b>710</b> vertically relative to the shell <b>702</b> of typically less than about Â¼ inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">If a foot orthotic insole is made flat and then placed in footwear with a raised footboard in the heel area, the insole may no longer follow the foot's contour correctly and may accordingly still result in jammed foot bones, thus not suitably correcting the balance and/or mobility and/or flexion.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">An insole may typically be custom made to fit the impression of the foot from a custom insole blank, which is a flat flexible or cushion sheet of uniform thickness which may have an underlying more rigid thin sheet for the heel and arch to hold the form in these areas (or the more rigid sheet may extend all the way to the toe area). In order to custom form the sheet, the foot is first placed into a beaded bladder (or other form) to form an impression of the foot lower surface. Then the sheet is suitable heated such as by placing in hot water or in an oven at a recommended temperature (for example, about 180 degrees F.) so that it may be conformable, and the conformable blank is then put into the impression and allowed to cool, thus taking on the shape of the foot lower surface. Undesirably, such a custom made insole for a orthotically lifted heel still may not conform properly with the thusly altered sole and may accordingly still result in jammed foot bones, thus not suitably correcting the balance and/or mobility and/or flexion.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">It is accordingly an object of the present invention to accurately determine the foot's optimum position and to provide an insert or inserts or otherwise adjust the footboard so that it receives the foot in that optimum position.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">It is another object of the present invention to prepare or adjust the footboard so that it follow's the foot's contour correctly.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">It is a further object of the present invention to conform an insole to the altered footboard to properly correct balance and/or mobility and/or flexion.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">It is yet another object of the present invention to optimize mobility and flexion and balance in skiers as well as other persons.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">It is still another object to more easily determine heel to forefoot height differential and heel angle in footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">It is another object of the present invention to mass market a higher quality of shoes.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The above and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof when read in conjunction with the appended drawings in which the same reference numerals depict the same or similar parts throughout the several views.</p>

      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Height adjustment on a ski of the heel end portion of a ski boot relative to the toe end portion thereof is discussed hereinafter with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1 to 26</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>20</b> a mechanism attaching a boot, illustrated at <b>25</b>, to a ski <b>22</b>, the toe and heel binding being conventional and illustrated at <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> respectively and corresponding to the toe and heel portions respectively of the boot <b>25</b>. It is of course to be understood that the attachment of a boot to a ski, in accordance with the present invention, is via the use conventionally of bindings, as discussed hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The mechanism <b>20</b> includes an elongate plate <b>28</b> to which the bindings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are suitably and conventionally attached in accordance with principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains, the plate <b>28</b> having a toe end portion <b>30</b> to which the toe binding <b>24</b> is attached and a heel end portion <b>32</b> to which the heel binding <b>26</b> is attached. The plate <b>28</b> has a width and length equal generally to the width and length of the bindings for the boot <b>25</b> to be bound thereto (which is generally equal to the width and length of the boot).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">For purposes of providing a means for attachment of the elongate plate end portions <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to the ski <b>22</b>, as hereinafter discussed, corresponding plates <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> respectively are fixedly attached to the ski <b>22</b> such as by screws <b>38</b> or other suitable means. The width of each of the plates <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> is generally equal to the width of the elongate plate <b>28</b>, and the length of each of the plates <b>34</b> may, for example, be generally equal to the width thereof, or otherwise as suitable. Each plate <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> may, for example, have 4 of the screws <b>38</b>, one at each corner, or other suitable number of screws.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The toe end portion <b>30</b> is pivotly connected to the plate <b>34</b> by a conventional pivot or hinged connection, illustrated at <b>40</b>, including a hinge pin <b>41</b>, to allow the elongate plate <b>28</b> to be adjusted through the angle illustrated at <b>42</b> so that the height of the skier's heel relative to the skier's toes may be adjusted to achieve the optimum balance for the particular skier. The hinged connection <b>40</b> may, for example, be similar to the hinged connection illustrated in the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 4,353,575 and discussed at column <b>3</b>, lines <b>1</b> to <b>5</b>, thereof, which patent is hereby incorporated herein by reference. For another example, the hinged connection may be similar to a conventional door hinge, such as shown at <b>86</b> in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In order to accommodate most skiers, the angle <b>42</b> is preferably adjustable up to at least about 10 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In order to provide an easy to use, stable, uncomplicated, reliable means for adjustment of the height of the heel end portion <b>32</b> relative to the toe end portion <b>30</b> through the angle <b>42</b>, in accordance with the present invention, a height adjustment assembly, illustrated generally at <b>43</b>, is provided wherein the heel end portion <b>32</b> is attached to the ski plate <b>36</b> by upper and lower members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> respectively having complementary teeth or serrations, illustrated at <b>48</b>, on facing sides for interlockingly engaging each other. The lower serrated member <b>46</b> is pivotly attached to ski plate <b>36</b> by a conventional pivot or hinged connection, illustrated at <b>50</b>, which may be similar to hinged connection or otherwise as suitable. The upper serrated member <b>44</b> is attached to the elongate plate heel end portion <b>32</b> as hereinafter discussed. The members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> are fixedly attached at an adjusted position by at least one but preferably a pair of bolts <b>52</b> and corresponding nuts <b>54</b> or other suitable fasteners, the shanks of the bolts <b>52</b> received in apertures (not shown) in member <b>44</b> and in vertically elongated adjustment slots, illustrated at <b>56</b>, in the other member <b>46</b>. It should be evident that the adjustment slots <b>56</b> may be provided in either of the members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> and that the bolts <b>52</b> and nuts <b>54</b> may be interchanged. It should also be understood that either the bolt heads or the nuts may desirably be conventionally fixed to the respective member so as to be free from turning thereby making height adjustment easier for the skier. The width, illustrated at <b>58</b>, of each of the members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> is generally equal to the width of the elongate member <b>28</b> to thereby provide stability. Thus, it can be seen that the members may be attached by the bolts <b>52</b> and nuts <b>54</b> at any of various heights to which the heel portion <b>32</b> is to be desirably adjusted, with the serrations <b>48</b> on the upper member <b>44</b> bearingly and interlockingly engaging the complementary serrations <b>48</b> on the lower member <b>46</b> to stably provide the needed support. The serrations <b>48</b> are desirably sized, in accordance with principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains, to provide height adjustments of, for example, as little as â degree.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">It is important that the ski <b>22</b> be able to flex as much as possible to make turning easier, and modern skies are typically constructed to maximize their flexing ability. During flexing of the ski, the distance between the plates <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> varies. In order to compensate for this variance in distance so that the ski <b>22</b> may be enabled to sufficiently flex as well as to evenly flex, the upper serrated member <b>44</b> is slidably attached to the heel portion <b>32</b> by an overhanging upper portion <b>60</b> of upper member <b>44</b> which is slidably received in a track, illustrated at <b>62</b>, on the lower surface of heel portion <b>32</b>. The track <b>62</b> comprises a pair of underhang portions <b>64</b> which are spaced apart a distance which is less than the width of the member overhanging portion <b>60</b> so that the portion <b>60</b> is retained slidably within the track <b>62</b>. The track <b>62</b> may be open-ended at one or both ends to allow the member portion <b>60</b> to be inserted into the track <b>62</b> and is desirably long enough so that the member portion <b>60</b> does not come out of the track <b>62</b> during skiing.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In order to adjust the angle <b>42</b> so as to adjust the height of the skier's heel relative to the toes for improved balance as well as to achieve increased leverage, even while on the ski slopes, the skier may easily and quickly loosen the nuts <b>54</b>, incrementally raise or lower the upper member <b>44</b> relative to the lower member <b>46</b>, tighten the nuts <b>54</b> on the bolts <b>52</b> to firmly secure the members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> in the newly adjusted position, and then go about enjoying skiing even more at the improved balance and leverage and with the upper member portion <b>60</b> sliding within the track <b>62</b> so that flexing of the ski for better turning is not unduly hampered.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">It should be understood that the boot and ski plates <b>28</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>36</b> are not essential to the present invention and that the toe binding <b>24</b> may be directly or otherwise pivotly connected to the ski <b>22</b> and the serrated members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> directly or otherwise connected to the heel binding <b>26</b> and ski <b>22</b> respectively. The device of the present invention need not be a separate device but may instead be built into the ski and/or binding. Thus, a reference to the toe or heel end portion or to a ski in the claims is meant to also refer to plates attached or attachable thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>70</b> an alternative embodiment of the height adjustment assembly. The assembly <b>70</b>, like the assembly <b>43</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, comprises upper and lower serrated members <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> respectively attached by fasteners <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> and with the lower serrated member <b>46</b> pivotly mounted to the ski plate <b>36</b>. In accordance with this alternative embodiment, the upper serrated member <b>44</b> is slidably attached to the heel end portion <b>32</b> of the boot plate <b>28</b> by a pair of tubular portions <b>72</b> suitably formed or otherwise attached on opposite sides respectively of the upper serrated member <b>44</b> and a pair of round rods <b>74</b> suitably formed or otherwise attached in cut-outs <b>76</b> respectively on opposite sides respectively of the heel end portion <b>32</b> of the boot plate <b>28</b> and which are slidably received in the tubular portions <b>72</b> respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>6</b>A, there is shown generally at <b>80</b> an alternative embodiment of the height adjustment assembly. The assembly <b>80</b> comprises a pair of channel members <b>82</b> having side flanges <b>83</b> and the lower end portions <b>84</b> of which are pivotly attached to the ski plate by a suitable conventional pivot or hinge assembly <b>86</b>, which is shown to be similar to a conventional door hinge. Thus, a hinge pin or pivot rod <b>96</b>, providing a common pivot axis, is suitably received in apertures, illustrated at <b>95</b>, in the side flanges <b>83</b> of each of the members <b>82</b> and in apertures, illustrated at <b>97</b>, in alternate eyelet or tubular portions <b>99</b> on the bottom edges of the members <b>82</b>, and at each end the hinge pin <b>96</b> is received in apertures, illustrated at <b>101</b>, in eyelet members <b>103</b> which are welded or otherwise suitably attached to plate <b>36</b>. The pin <b>96</b> is desirably (but not required to be) secured against removal from the hinge by suitable means such as, for example, a head <b>111</b> and washer <b>113</b> on one end and a nut (not shown) and washer (not shown) at the other end. Thus, the structural members <b>82</b> may be pivotly spread apart or contracted, as illustrated at <b>105</b> in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, by pivotal movement on the hinge pin <b>96</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The upper end portions <b>88</b> of the members <b>82</b> are attached to the heel end portion <b>32</b> of plate <b>28</b>, as hereinafter discussed. Intermediate the height of the members <b>82</b>, elongate members <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> such as bars or tubular members are mounted to extend between the respective flanges <b>83</b> of the members <b>82</b> respectively and are suitably attached to the respective flanges <b>83</b> such as by screws (not shown) so that they can pivot (i.e., are rotatable about the longitudinal axis). The head end portion <b>107</b> of an adjustment bolt or screw <b>90</b> is received in an unthreaded aperture in member <b>92</b> and a nut <b>94</b>, similar to nut <b>134</b> in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, placed thereon so that the screw <b>90</b> rotates in place with the member <b>92</b> sandwiched between the bolt head and the nut <b>94</b>. The screw <b>90</b> is threadedly received in a threaded aperture centrally located in rotatable member <b>91</b> to draw the members together or apart, as illustrated at <b>105</b>) to increase or decrease respectively the distance between the plates <b>28</b> and <b>36</b> and thereby adjust the heel height, the members <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> being rotatable (pivotal) to allow alignment of the apertures therein during adjustment. Suitable openings, illustrated at <b>109</b> for one of the channel members, are provided in the channel members <b>82</b> for unfettered passage of the screw <b>90</b>. The upper portion <b>88</b> of each of the members <b>82</b> is pivotably attached to an overhanging member <b>98</b> by means of a pin <b>104</b> or other suitable pivoting device. In order to allow the ski <b>22</b> to be able to sufficiently flex, these upper portions <b>88</b>, similarly as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, are slidably attached to the heel portion <b>32</b> by the pivotly-connected overhanging members <b>98</b> being slidably received in a track, illustrated at <b>100</b>, on the lower surface of heel portion <b>32</b>. The track <b>100</b> comprises a pair of underhang or rail portions <b>102</b> which are spaced apart a distance which is less than the width of each of the overhanging members <b>98</b> so that the overhanging members <b>98</b> are retained slidably within the track <b>100</b>. The track <b>100</b> may be open-ended at one or both ends to allow the members <b>98</b> to be inserted into the track <b>100</b> and is desirably long enough so that the members <b>98</b> do not come out of the track <b>100</b> during skiing.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">The placement of an adjustment screw so that it is rigidly attached to the ski at the ski end of the âscissorsâ members, as in the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 4,007,946, detracts from the ability of the ski to flex as needed. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the hinge <b>86</b> is instead placed at the ski plate <b>36</b>. In order to provide increased stability, the âscissorsâ members <b>82</b> have a width which is generally equal to the width of each of plates <b>28</b> and <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The present invention is not limited to the particular components for the height adjustment assembly, which components are disclosed for exemplary purposes only. Thus, the present invention may be otherwise embodied for providing the desired height adjustment while allowing the ski to suitably flex. For example, the member <b>82</b> on the right side in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may be removed, its corresponding elongate member <b>92</b> suitably mounted to the track <b>100</b> (or plate <b>32</b>) so that it can pivot (i.e., rotate about its longitudinal axis), and elongate member <b>91</b> positioned to also serve as pin <b>104</b>. This alternative assembly would thus allow pivoting at <b>104</b> and at the hinge <b>86</b> for height adjustment while also still allowing the ski to suitably flex.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>110</b> an alternative embodiment of the height adjustment assembly. The assembly <b>110</b> comprises a member <b>112</b> pivotly mounted at pivot assembly <b>114</b> to the boot plate end portion <b>32</b> and another member <b>116</b> pivotly mounted at pivot assembly <b>118</b> to the ski plate <b>36</b>. The pivot assemblies <b>114</b> and <b>118</b> may each be similar to hinge <b>50</b>. Member <b>116</b> has a portion <b>120</b> which extends upwardly from hinge <b>116</b> to a point midway between the plates <b>28</b> and <b>36</b> and a portion <b>122</b> extends therefrom generally normal thereto. Member <b>112</b> is similarly shaped; a portion <b>124</b> terminates at a point midway between the plates <b>28</b> and <b>36</b> and has a track (not shown) on each side (similar to track <b>100</b> in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) in which is slidably received member <b>116</b> to act as a backing or support for member <b>116</b> to thereby provide increased stability, and another portion <b>126</b> extends from the hinge <b>114</b> and generally normal to portion <b>124</b>. Thus, as seen in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, the portions <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> are generally parallel to each other and spaced vertically so that by drawing them together or apart the heel height may be adjusted. Adjustment is provided by a pair of bolts or screws <b>128</b> (one on each side, only one shown) having a head <b>130</b> and the shank <b>132</b> of which is received in an aperture in portion <b>126</b> and a nut <b>134</b> applied thereto so that the portion <b>126</b> is disposed between the bolt head <b>130</b> and the nut <b>134</b>. The nut <b>134</b>, as seen in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, has a roll pin <b>136</b> which passes centrally through the nut (normal to the nut axis) and is received in an aperture in the shank <b>132</b> whereby the bolt <b>128</b> cannot be moved axially but can be turned for providing height adjustment. The shank <b>132</b> is threadedly received in a threaded aperture in the portion <b>122</b>. A locknut <b>138</b> is provided on the shank <b>132</b> to lockingly bear against the underside of the portion <b>122</b>. Thus, by turning the bolt head <b>130</b>, the vertical distance between the portions <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> may easily, even while on the ski slopes, be increased or decreased to adjust the heel height. Each of the members <b>112</b> and <b>116</b> has a width generally equal to that of plates <b>28</b> and <b>36</b> to provide good stability. Since it is envisioned that the assembly <b>110</b> may be difficult to mount as shown, it is believed that it may be more easily mounted at the rear edge of plate <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> shows a conventional ski brake <b>150</b> applied to the ski <b>22</b>. When the heel height is adjusted as described herein, the ground engaging portion <b>152</b> of the brake <b>150</b> may be too high. In order to accommodate for the increased height, in accordance with the present invention, the portion <b>152</b> is cut off, as illustrated at <b>154</b>, and an adaptive ground engaging portion, illustrated generally at <b>156</b> in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, applied to the shank <b>158</b> of the brake <b>150</b>. The adaptive portion <b>156</b> comprises a tubular portion <b>159</b> in which the shank <b>158</b> is received, a ground engaging portion <b>160</b>, which is similar to the cut-off portion <b>152</b>, and a shank portion <b>162</b> for increasing the overall shank length to thereby position the ground engaging portion <b>160</b> lower to compensate for the increased heel height. The tubular portion <b>159</b> is suitably attached to the shank portion <b>158</b> by a pair of axially spaced screws <b>164</b> received in apertures <b>166</b> in the tubular portion <b>159</b> and screwed into the shank portion <b>158</b> or by other suitable means. The length of the shank portion <b>162</b> may, for example, be about 2 inches.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Referring to <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, in order to provide for adjustment of the length of the shank portion <b>162</b> to allow more precise brake height adjustment, an adapter member <b>200</b> having a ground engaging portion <b>202</b> and a shank portion <b>204</b> is attached to the shank portion <b>158</b> by a separate tubular portion <b>206</b>. The term âground,â as used herein and in the claims, is meant to include âsnow.â One end of the tubular portion <b>206</b> is slipped over the remaining shank portion <b>158</b> and attached thereto by a pair of axially spaced screws <b>208</b> received in apertures <b>210</b> respectively in the separate tubular portion <b>206</b> and screwed into the shank portion <b>158</b> or by other suitable means. The shank portion <b>204</b> is cut, as illustrated at <b>212</b>, to achieve the desired brake length, and the remainder of the shank portion <b>204</b> is then received in the other end of the tubular portion <b>206</b> and attached thereto by another pair of axially spaced screws <b>214</b> received in apertures <b>216</b> respectively in the separate tubular portion <b>206</b> and screwed into the shank portion <b>204</b> or by other suitable means.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, there is shown generally at <b>171</b> a lateral adjustment assembly for plate <b>190</b>, which plate serves the same function (attachment of bindings) as plate <b>28</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The lateral adjustment assembly <b>171</b> includes a housing <b>191</b> having side walls <b>193</b> joined by end walls <b>195</b> and a floor <b>197</b>, the plate <b>190</b> being received over and spaced from the floor <b>197</b> and within the boundaries of the walls <b>193</b> and <b>195</b>. For increased structural integrity, the floor <b>197</b> extends entirely over the length of the assembly <b>171</b>, but it is not required that it do so. For example, floor portions may be provided at each end of the assembly <b>171</b> for purposes which will become apparent. An elongate rod <b>172</b> extends length-wise of the assembly <b>171</b> centrally of the width thereof, and the plate <b>190</b> rests thereon. The rod <b>172</b> is suitably fixedly received in and non-rotatably attached in a pair of apertures, illustrated at <b>170</b>, in the end walls <b>195</b> respectively to allow the plate <b>190</b> to tilt laterally about the rod <b>172</b>. Alternatively, the rod <b>172</b> may be mounted so as to be rotatable within the apertures <b>170</b>, and the plate <b>190</b> may be attached fixedly to the rotatable rod. The lateral adjustment assembly <b>171</b> is provided to allow the plate <b>190</b> to be adjusted, for example, plus or minus about 3 degrees laterally to adjust the position laterally of the skier on the ski. A bolt or screw <b>174</b> is received in an unthreaded aperture <b>176</b> in each corner of the plate <b>190</b>, and a nut <b>178</b> is screwed onto the bolt <b>174</b> so that the plate <b>190</b> is sandwiched between the bolt head <b>180</b> and the nut <b>178</b>, and a roll pin (similarly as shown for roll pin <b>136</b> in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>) is inserted through the nut <b>178</b> and bolt shank <b>182</b> whereby the bolt <b>174</b> is prevented from vertical movement but can be turned to provide lateral adjustment. The bolt <b>174</b> is threadedly received in a threaded aperture, illustrated at <b>175</b>, in the floor <b>197</b>, whereby, by manipulation of the bolts <b>174</b> (i.e., by screwing inwardly on the bolts on one side of the plate <b>190</b> and by screwing outwardly a corresponding amount the bolts on the other side thereof), the lateral orientation of the plate <b>190</b> may be adjusted. The housing <b>191</b> is formed to have a track <b>199</b>, similar to tracks <b>62</b> and <b>100</b>, depending downwardly from the rear end portion thereof for rear height adjustment, and apertures <b>188</b> for receiving the pivot pin <b>41</b> (with the eyelet members <b>187</b> of plate <b>34</b> being disposed outwardly of the side walls <b>193</b> respectively) for pivotal movement of the assembly <b>171</b> at the forward end thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>200</b> a height adjustment mechanism in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the toe end portion having a hinged connection similar to that shown at <b>40</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. Height adjustment is provided by a pair of members <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> having the complementary teeth or serrations <b>48</b>, similarly as shown for the assembly <b>43</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, on facing sides for interlockingly engaging each other. The member <b>202</b> is pivotly attached to the boot plate <b>28</b> as hereinafter described. The member <b>204</b> is pivotly attached to ski plate <b>36</b> by a hinged connection <b>50</b> similarly as shown for <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, including a hinge pin <b>206</b> which is received in an aperture, illustrated at <b>208</b>, extending through a lower portion of the member <b>204</b> and through apertures, illustrated at <b>210</b>, in eyelet members <b>212</b> protruding from opposite sides of the plate <b>36</b>. Similarly as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the members <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> are adjustably connected by a pair of screws <b>216</b> receivable in laterally spaced countersunk apertures, illustrated at <b>218</b>, in member <b>202</b> and in laterally spaced vertically elongate apertures, illustrated at <b>220</b>, in member <b>204</b>, the head of one of the screws <b>216</b> illustrated at <b>222</b>, and nuts and washers therefor illustrated at <b>224</b> and <b>226</b> respectively. Thus, the member <b>204</b> may be moved upwardly or downwardly relative to member <b>202</b> then fixed at an adjusted position by the interlocking serrations <b>48</b> engaging and by tightening of the nuts <b>224</b> on the screws <b>216</b> with the serrations interlocking with each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in order to be able to adjust the angle <b>42</b> to a very small angle approaching zero degrees, the member <b>202</b> is pivotly attached to the rear end of the plate <b>28</b>. Thus, the rear end of the plate <b>28</b> has a cut out, illustrated at <b>228</b>, therein providing a pair of laterally spaced rearwardly extending protrusions <b>230</b>. The member <b>202</b> is received in the cut out <b>228</b>, and a pivot rod <b>232</b> is received in apertures, illustrated at <b>234</b>, in the protrusions <b>230</b> and in an aperture, illustrated at <b>236</b>, in the member <b>202</b>. It should of course be understood that variations may be made in the assembly <b>200</b> as well as the other assemblies discussed herein. For example, instead of a single pin <b>232</b> or a single pin <b>206</b>, a pair of short pins may be provided, each received on one side or the other of the respective member <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Referring to <figref>FIG. 26</figref>, there is illustrated a ski <b>22</b> having a built-in track <b>240</b> extending over a portion of its length, it being understood that the track <b>240</b> could alternatively be a separate piece or pieces attached to the ski <b>22</b> and may be otherwise suitably shaped. The track <b>240</b> comprises a pair of laterally spaced portions <b>242</b> each having a vertical portion <b>244</b> and a portion <b>246</b> extending inwardly from the upper end of the vertical portion <b>244</b>, thereby defining slots <b>248</b> in which the plate <b>36</b> is slidably received to allow suitable flexing of the ski <b>22</b> during skiing. As seen wherein an end of the track is shown, the track <b>240</b> is open-ended to allow the plate <b>36</b> to be inserted into the track <b>240</b> and is desirably long enough so that the plate <b>36</b> does not come out of the track <b>240</b> during skiing. In this embodiment the plate <b>36</b> is not pivotally connected to serrated member <b>204</b> but may be otherwise suitably attached thereto. It should be understood that the serrated plate <b>204</b> is otherwise attached to the plate <b>28</b> similarly as shown and discussed hereinbefore with respect to <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. It should also be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention that other embodiments in this specification may also utilize tracks on the skis <b>22</b> instead of on or in connection with the heel binding in order to allow suitable flexing of the ski <b>22</b> during skiing.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Referring to <figref>FIG. 16</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>300</b> a plate to which toe and heel bindings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> (not shown in <figref>FIG. 16</figref>) are attached and which is height adjustably attachable to a ski <b>22</b> as discussed hereinbefore. The plate <b>300</b> has a toe end portion <b>302</b> and a heel end portion <b>304</b> which are similar to the toe and heel end portions <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> respectively of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The plate <b>300</b> includes a generally flat portion <b>314</b> upon which the bindings are attached and a pair of flange portions <b>316</b> extending downwardly from the lateral edges of the flat portion <b>314</b>. The toe end portion <b>302</b> is pivotly attached to a plate <b>306</b> which is in turn attached to the ski <b>22</b> by screws such as screws <b>38</b> in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> received in apertures, illustrated at <b>308</b>, in the plate <b>306</b> and threadedly received in apertures in the ski <b>22</b>. The plate <b>306</b> is formed to have an upstanding tubular hinge portion <b>310</b>, i.e., having a bore, illustrated at <b>318</b>, extending laterally of the plates <b>300</b> and <b>306</b> therethrough. Forward of the hinge portion <b>310</b> is an increased width portion <b>312</b> of the plate <b>306</b>, i.e., a portion which generally extends to the lateral edges of the ski <b>22</b>. While shown to be integrally formed with the plate <b>306</b>, it should be understood that the hinge portion <b>310</b> may be a separate member which is welded or otherwise suitably secured to the plate <b>306</b>. In order to pivotly attach the forward end of the bindings or boot plate <b>300</b> to the ski plate <b>306</b>, a hinge pin <b>320</b> is received in the bore <b>318</b> and in apertures, illustrated at <b>322</b> in the forward ends of the flange portions <b>316</b>. The flange portions <b>316</b> have rounded lower forward end corners, illustrated at <b>324</b>, in order to provide clearance with plate portion <b>312</b> during pivoting movement thereof. The plate <b>306</b> is of reduced width relative to the portion <b>312</b> thereof so as to be able to fit between the flange portions <b>316</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Race plates have been provided to raise the boots and bindings above the skis for greater leverage. In order to accommodate almost any size boot, these race plates are often made long, for example, 24 inches. Thus, if plate <b>300</b> were 24 inches long, it would accommodate the boots of all or almost all skiers. However, since the plate <b>300</b> must be of sufficient thickness to suitably accommodate forces acting thereon, such a length undesirably increases the weight thus undesirably increasing the burden of carrying the skis, especially for smaller people who have boot sizes which do not require such long plates. In order to reduce the carrying burden on smaller (as well as larger) persons while also accommodating larger boot sizes of larger persons, in accordance with the present invention, the bindings plate <b>300</b> is made to a relatively smaller length of, for example, 18 inches, and a decreased thickness extension <b>330</b> is attached to the top surface of flat plate portion <b>314</b> at the forward end portion <b>332</b> thereof to increase the length thereof by, for example, about 2 inches, to 20 inches overall. If desired, the extension may be provided to increase the length thereof by, for example, about 4 inches or longer, to 22 or more inches overall. The extension <b>330</b> is attached to the plate <b>300</b> by screws <b>334</b>, for example, 4 no. 10-32 flat head screws, received in counterbored (to accommodate the flat heads) apertures, illustrated at <b>336</b>, in the rearward end portion of the extension <b>330</b> and threadedly received in threaded apertures, illustrated at <b>338</b>, in the forward end portion <b>332</b> of the flat plate portion <b>314</b>. The forward end portion <b>331</b> of the lighter (less thickness) extension thus extends forwardly beyond the plate <b>300</b> to increase the overall plate length by as much as 2 or more inches.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Snow may tend to build up and cake between the plate <b>300</b> and the ski <b>22</b>. This is a type of problem which used to be encountered under boots with the solution in recent years being that the soles of boots have been conventionally contoured to allow the escape of the snow. In order to allow snow to escape from between the plate <b>300</b> and the ski <b>22</b> as well as to reduce the carrying burden even more for both small and large people, a lightening cutout, illustrated at <b>340</b>, is provided centrally of the length of the plate <b>300</b> (between the attachments of the bindings). While the cutout <b>340</b> is shown to be rectangular in shape, it should be understood that it may otherwise be suitably shaped or provided in other ways such as a series of apertures.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">The following dimensions of the plate <b>300</b> and extension <b>330</b> as well as other dimensions and examples contained herein (unless the context clearly indicates otherwise) are for exemplary purposes only and not for purposes of limitation. The overall length and width of plate portion <b>314</b> may, for example, be about 18 inches and about 2Â¼ inches respectively. The flange portion height, illustrated at <b>342</b>, may, for example, be about Â½ inch. The thickness of each of the plate and flange portions <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> respectively may, for example, be about Â¼ inch. The extension <b>330</b> may have a length, width, and thickness of about 4 inches, about 2Â¼ inches, and about 3/16 inch respectively and is attached to the plate <b>300</b> so as to extend, for example, about 2 inches forwardly thereof. The cutout <b>340</b> begins, for example, about 4Â½ inches from the forward edge of the plate <b>300</b>, extends lengthwise of the plate <b>300</b> a distance of, for example, about 4 inches, and extends widthwise, for example, over the entire distance between the flange portions <b>316</b>. The plates <b>300</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>330</b> are made of aluminum or other suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">It should be understood that, while tracks such as at <b>62</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> or <b>74</b> in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> are shown on the boot plate (and of course may alternately be directly on the boot), they may alternatively be on the ski plate or directly on the ski.</p>

In order to allow the heel portion to slide relative to the ski <b>22</b> to enable sufficient and even ski flexion similarly as discussed with respect to the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, an elongate track member <b>402</b> is suitably mounted on, such as by bolts or screws (not shown), or may alternatively be integral with or built into, the upper surface of the ski <b>22</b>. The track <b>402</b> has an increased width upper portion or lip <b>404</b> defining a pair of elongate lateral protrusions or rails <b>405</b> extending generally over the length of the track member <b>402</b> (but need only extend enough over the track member length as needed for its purpose as described hereinafter). For example, the track <b>402</b> and ski <b>22</b> may be provided/sold pre-assembled (or integral) from a factory with the track <b>402</b> in a standard shape for receiving similarly standard-shaped toe and heel piece bindings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> respectively to allow adjustment thereof longitudinally along the length of the ski <b>22</b>, as is commonly known in the art. The track <b>402</b> is typically composed of molded plastic but may be composed of metal or other suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">A suitable member <b>406</b>, which may be composed of molded plastic or metal or other suitable material, is fixedly attached or locked in place, such as by one or more screws, bolts, pins, or other suitable fasteners or locking devices, illustrated at <b>409</b>, to the toe end portion <b>408</b> of the track <b>402</b>, but alternatively the member <b>406</b> may be formed integral with the track <b>402</b>. The lower portion of the member <b>406</b> is suitably shaped so that it can be slid onto and along the track <b>402</b>. The member <b>406</b> has a pair of laterally spaced upper ears <b>410</b> (one shown) between which the toe end portion <b>30</b> of the plate <b>28</b> (for receiving the bindings) is received and pivotly attached by a pin <b>412</b> suitably received in apertures in the end portion <b>30</b> (adjacent the end of the plate <b>28</b>) and ears <b>410</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">A block <b>414</b>, which may be composed of molded plastic or metal or other suitable material, has a pair of laterally spaced upper forward ears <b>416</b> (one shown). The heel end portion <b>32</b> of the plate <b>28</b> is received between the ears <b>416</b> and pivotly attached to the block <b>414</b> by suitable means such as a pin <b>418</b> suitably received in apertures in the end portion <b>32</b> (adjacent the end of the plate <b>28</b>) and ears <b>416</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">A block <b>420</b>, which may be composed of molded plastic, metal, or other suitable material, is formed to have a lower portion <b>421</b> suitably shaped to slide onto the rear end of and engage rail <b>402</b> for sliding of the block <b>420</b> longitudinally of the ski <b>22</b> along the rail <b>402</b>, as illustrated at <b>422</b>. Thus, the lower surface of the block <b>420</b> has a longitudinal recess, illustrated at <b>424</b> in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, the inner portion <b>426</b> of which is widened to slidably receive the lateral rails <b>405</b>. The block <b>420</b> has a surface <b>426</b> which has a series of serrations <b>428</b> which interlockingly engage complementary serrations <b>430</b> on a lower surface <b>432</b> of the member <b>414</b> for height adjustably attaching the heel binding <b>26</b> to the ski <b>22</b> as described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Two vertically oriented members with interlocking serrations connecting a heel binding with a ski, such as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 of the aforesaid U.S. Pat. No. 4,135,736, may be considered to not provide as much stability as may be desired. In order to distribute the pressure better on the serrated surfaces so as to provide improved stability, the block <b>420</b> is suitably formed so that the serrated surface <b>426</b> thereof is inclined. Thus, for example, as illustrated, it has a vertical rear wall <b>434</b>, an inclined wall <b>436</b> extending from the upper edge of the rear wall <b>434</b> downwardly and forwardly to the forward edge of the bottom wall <b>438</b> in which the recess <b>424</b> is contained, and a pair of generally triangular side walls <b>440</b>, leaving a generally hollow space, illustrated at <b>442</b>, which will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter. As a result of the inclined surface <b>426</b>, it can be seen in <figref>FIG. 17</figref> that forces are applied in a direction generally perpendicular or normal to the inclined wall <b>436</b> of the block <b>420</b>, as illustrated at <b>444</b>, as well as generally perpendicular or normal to the block <b>414</b>, as illustrated at <b>446</b>, which can better withstand the applied forces from the boot (i.e., forces applied when one is standing normally in the boot on the ski and during normal skiing) than if the forces were applied in a direction generally parallel to the serrated surfaces to hereby achieve a more stable interlocking attachment. By âgenerally perpendicularâ or âgenerally normalâ of an applied force relative to a block surface or wall, as used herein and in the claims, is meant that the force vector or component of the applied force in a direction normal or perpendicular to the surface or wall is greater than the force vector or component of the applied force in a direction parallel to the surface or wall. Preferably, the applied forces from the boot are substantially normal or perpendicular (i.e., within about 10 degrees of being normal or perpendicular) to the block surface or wall. Preferably, the surface <b>426</b> or wall <b>436</b> is inclined at an angle, illustrated at <b>454</b>, between about 1 and 50 degrees, for example, about 15 degrees. It may be as low as 1 degree because racers may already be well adjusted but may wish to fine tune their balance. The inclined surface <b>426</b> allows the height of the heel binding <b>26</b> to be adjusted by adjusting the position of the inclined block <b>420</b> relative to the block <b>414</b> by adjustable movement thereof longitudinally, as illustrated at <b>422</b>, along the length of the track <b>402</b>. As seen in <figref>FIG. 17</figref>, movement of the inclined block <b>420</b> forwardly (toward the toe end <b>408</b>) causes a higher portion of the block <b>420</b> to engage the block <b>414</b> so that the height of the heel binding <b>26</b> is adjusted higher.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">In order to lock the inclined block <b>420</b> at a desired heel binding height, the inclined wall <b>436</b> has a pair of longitudinally extending spaced parallel grooves, illustrated at <b>448</b>, therein extending therethrough substantially over the length thereof. The block <b>414</b> has a pair of similarly spaced apertures, illustrated at <b>450</b>, extending therethrough. Bolts <b>452</b> or other suitable fasteners are received in grooves <b>448</b> and apertures <b>450</b> respectively, as illustrated at <b>458</b>, and nuts <b>456</b> applied and tightened to fix or lock the serrations <b>428</b> and <b>430</b> together to lock the inclined block <b>420</b> in the position for the desired heel binding height, illustrated at <b>458</b>. The hollow space <b>442</b> is provided to allow the bolts <b>452</b> to be placed in position. Preferably, the bolts <b>452</b> (or studs) are threadedly received tightly in threaded spaced (equal to the spacing between grooves <b>448</b>) apertures, illustrated at <b>460</b>, in a suitable plate <b>462</b> and their heads <b>464</b> (or stud ends) may be welded to the plate <b>462</b>. In order to adjust the position of the inclined block <b>420</b> for height adjustment, the nuts <b>456</b> are suitably loosened and the inclined block <b>420</b> moved along the track <b>402</b> to the desired new position, then the nuts <b>456</b> tightened at the new position. It is unnecessary that the nuts <b>456</b> be removed from the bolts <b>452</b> during such adjustment. However, a stop member <b>466</b> may be applied to the end of each bolt <b>452</b> to prevent the respective nut <b>456</b> from becoming inadvertently removed. The stop member <b>466</b> may, for example, be a nut or washer or a pin welded or otherwise suitably fixed thereto. It should of course be understood that the locking of the serrated surfaces in a desired position may be achieved by other suitable means such as, for example, by the use of a single slot <b>448</b> and/or by the use of another suitable fastening mechanism such as, for example, a cam locking device used with the slot or slots <b>448</b>. For another example, the plate <b>462</b> may be dispensed with and the pair of bolts <b>452</b> may have heads large enough so as not to pass through the slots <b>448</b>. For another example, the inclined block <b>420</b> may be formed not to have the hollow space but instead have a slot underneath the inclined wall <b>436</b> which allows movement of the plate <b>462</b> along the length of the inclined wall <b>436</b> (which might require the inclined block <b>420</b> to be composed of two pieces which are then welded or otherwise suitably attached together and the plate <b>462</b> and bolts <b>452</b> placed in position before such attachment). For another example, the inclined block <b>420</b> may be formed to have two or more narrow slots underneath the inclined wall <b>436</b> which allow movement of the heads of bolts (without a plate) along the length of the inclined wall <b>436</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">As previously discussed, the pre-assembled rail and ski may come in different configurations. For example, referring to <figref>FIG. 20</figref>, there is illustrated generally at <b>500</b> a combination of a ski <b>502</b> with an inclined block <b>420</b>, with a track <b>504</b> formed or built into the ski <b>502</b>. Thus, the track <b>504</b> is formed by a longitudinal recess, illustrated at <b>506</b>, in the ski <b>502</b>, the inner or lower part <b>508</b> of the recess <b>506</b> being widened to provide a track. In order to conform the inclined block <b>420</b> to be complementarily received in the track <b>508</b>, the lower part of the inclined block <b>420</b> is suitably formed to have a narrowed neck portion <b>510</b> terminating there below in a widened head portion <b>512</b> which is slidable received in the track <b>508</b>. It should of course be understood that a pre-assembled ski/track or other track or ski with built-in track may have various track shapes, and the inclined block <b>420</b> is suitably constructed to accommodate whatever the shape of the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">It should be understood that an inclined block may be moved along a track for height adjustment and held in an adjusted position by other means than interlocking serrations. Referring to <figref>FIGS. 21 to 24</figref>, there is illustrated generally at <b>600</b> structure attached to ski <b>22</b> and to the rear end of plate <b>28</b> (as an alternative to the blocks <b>414</b> and <b>420</b> in <figref>FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>). The structure <b>600</b> includes an inclined block <b>602</b> having a lower portion formed to slidably receive track <b>402</b>, similarly as in <figref>FIG. 19</figref>, and it should be understood that the track may be otherwise suitably shaped such as shown in <figref>FIG. 20</figref> and the block <b>602</b> suitably shaped to be complementary thereto for sliding along the track.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">The inclined block <b>602</b>, which may be composed of molded plastic, metal, or other suitable material, has a longitudinal (along the length of the ski <b>22</b>) recess, illustrated at <b>604</b>, in its upper surface, the recess <b>604</b> having an inner laterally increased width portion, illustrated at <b>606</b>, which defines laterally spaced tracks <b>608</b> having inclined upper surfaces <b>610</b> on the laterally opposite sides. The inclined surfaces <b>610</b> extend downwardly from the rear or heel end toward the front or toe end. The bottom surface <b>612</b> of the recess <b>604</b> has a plurality of longitudinally spaced indents or notches or recesses, illustrated at <b>614</b>, suitably formed therein generally laterally centrally thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">A block <b>616</b> has a generally cylindrical laterally extending portion <b>618</b> which is received in a cutout, illustrated at <b>620</b>, between a pair of lateral end portions <b>622</b> of the plate <b>28</b> (the end portions <b>622</b> defined by the cutout <b>620</b>). A pin <b>624</b> is suitably received in each of the apertures, illustrated at <b>626</b> (one shown), in the end portions <b>622</b> and in an aperture, illustrated at <b>628</b>, extending axially through the entire width of the generally cylindrical portion <b>618</b>, thereby pivotally connecting the block <b>616</b> to the ski binding plate <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">The block <b>616</b>, which may be composed of molded plastic, metal, or other suitable material, is formed to have a pair of upper portions <b>630</b> which are laterally projecting so as to be positioned to ride on the inclined surfaces <b>610</b> respectively and a pair of lower portions <b>631</b> (one shown) which are also laterally projecting so as to be positioned to fit within the increased width portion <b>606</b> and underneath the tracks <b>608</b> respectively so that the block <b>616</b> is lockingly but slidingly received on the tracks <b>608</b>. The block <b>616</b> is further formed to have front and rear laterally centrally disposed walls <b>632</b> and <b>634</b> respectively (<figref>FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>) extending downwardly from the generally cylindrical portion <b>618</b> and between which is suitably centrally mounted to turn in place a screw <b>636</b> having enlarged threads <b>638</b>. For example, <figref>FIGS. 22 and 23</figref> show the thread <b>638</b> (i.e., two thread portions whose spacing is the same as the spacing of the notches <b>614</b>) engaging two of the notches <b>614</b>. The screw <b>636</b> terminates at its ends in a pair respectively of reduced diameter axle portions <b>640</b> which are rotatably received in vertical slots, illustrated at <b>646</b>, in the walls <b>632</b> and <b>634</b> respectively, the slots <b>646</b> being recessed into the bottom surfaces <b>648</b> thereof, as best seen in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>. The axle portions <b>640</b> are held in place (i.e., without falling downwardly in or out of the slots <b>646</b>) when the blocks <b>602</b> and <b>616</b> are assembled with the relative position of the block <b>616</b> fixed since it engages the tracks <b>608</b>. The blocks <b>602</b> and <b>616</b> are assembled by holding the screw <b>636</b> in the slots <b>646</b> and, engaging the block <b>616</b> on the tracks <b>608</b> from the end thereof while at the same time effecting engagement of the screw thread <b>638</b> with the first of the indents <b>614</b> and continuing to turn the screw <b>636</b> to advance the block <b>616</b> further onto the tracks <b>608</b>. As the screw <b>636</b> is turned (such as by a screwdriver received in slot <b>648</b> in the end surface of an axle portion <b>640</b>), the thread <b>638</b> continues to successively engage notches <b>614</b> thus effecting movement of the inclined block <b>602</b> longitudinally. Preferably, the surface <b>610</b> is inclined at an angle, illustrated at <b>642</b> (which is the same as previously discussed for the angle <b>454</b>), relative to the lower surface <b>643</b> of the block <b>602</b>. The inclined surface <b>610</b> allows the height of the heel binding <b>26</b> to be adjusted by adjusting the position of the inclined block <b>602</b> relative to the block <b>616</b> by adjustable movement thereof longitudinally, as illustrated at <b>644</b>, along the length of the tracks <b>608</b>. As seen in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>, movement of the inclined block <b>602</b> forwardly (toward the toe end <b>408</b>) causes a higher portion of the block <b>602</b> to engage the block <b>616</b> so that the height of the heel binding <b>26</b> is adjusted higher.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">The screw <b>636</b> may be otherwise suitably embodied. For example, referring to <figref>FIG. 25</figref>, there is shown a screw <b>650</b> comprising a rotatable cylindrical body <b>652</b> which has thread <b>638</b>. The body <b>652</b> is disposed between and connected to the walls <b>632</b> and <b>634</b> by a cylindrical axle <b>654</b> which is rotatably received in apertures, illustrated at <b>656</b>, in the walls <b>632</b> and <b>634</b> and in a bore, illustrated at <b>658</b>, which extends axially through the screw <b>650</b>, as illustrated at <b>660</b>. The axle <b>654</b> is fixedly connected to the screw <b>636</b> by a pin <b>662</b> which is suitably received in aligned radially extending apertures, illustrated at <b>664</b>, in the screw body <b>652</b> and in a radially extending aperture, illustrated at <b>666</b>, in the axle <b>654</b>, as illustrated at <b>668</b>, or otherwise suitably connected.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">It should be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention that other suitable means may be provided for advancing block <b>616</b> or other suitable block along the inclined surface of block <b>602</b> or other suitable block. For example, the indents <b>614</b> may instead be raised bumps or projections, with the screw thread engaging between the bumps for advancing the block <b>616</b> along the inclined surface of block <b>602</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">It should be understood that it is within the scope of the present invention that either of the blocks <b>414</b> or <b>616</b> be attached directly to heel binding rather than the plate <b>28</b>. Thus, a recitation herein or in the claims that a member engages or is attached to a boot or a heel or toe portion thereof or to a ski is intended to mean that it is engaged or attached directly thereto or to a plate or track or other member which is attached thereto. Likewise, a recitation that a member engages such a plate or track or other member is intended to include that it is engaged or attached to the boot or a heel or toe portion thereof or to the ski.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>, the boot <b>25</b> includes a lower shell <b>702</b> which is made of rigid plastic or other suitably rigid material and which encases the skier's foot, illustrated at <b>700</b>, for transferring movement from the skier to the shell <b>702</b> then to the ski <b>22</b>. The shell <b>702</b> has a sole portion <b>704</b> the toe and heel end portions <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> respectively of which are suitably and conventionally received in bindings <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> respectively. As is typical, the skier's foot and lower leg portion <b>700</b> are snugly received in a liner <b>710</b> composed of a suitably soft waterproof material providing warmth, and the liner <b>710</b> is snugly received in the shell <b>702</b>. An upper rigid cuff or upper shell <b>712</b>, made of similar material as shell <b>702</b> is made, wraps around upper portions of the shell <b>702</b> and liner <b>710</b>, and upper and lower buckles <b>714</b> or other suitable means attach front edges of the cuff <b>712</b> to secure the parts of the boot <b>25</b> tightly together to tightly encase the foot and lower leg portion <b>710</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Good balance as well as mobility and flexion while skiing not only depends on the adjustment of the boot heel portion height, as discussed above, but also on the contour of the footboard to match the optimum positioning of the bottom of the foot itself as it fits within the boot <b>25</b>. Moreover, good balance as well as mobility and flexion in any footwear also depends on the contour of the footboard to match the optimum positioning of the bottom of the foot itself as it fits within the footwear, including the heel to forefoot height differential, illustrated at <b>716</b>. As used herein and in the claims, the heel to forefoot height differential is the difference in height of the footboard or bootboard, illustrated at <b>718</b>, between where the forefoot rests, illustrated at <b>720</b>, and where the heel rests, illustrated at <b>722</b>, the footboard or bootboard <b>718</b> being the upper surface of the sole (or built-up sole as described hereinafter with respect to <figref>FIG. 27</figref>) upon which a foot (or insole or liner such as liner <b>710</b> rests) within the boot <b>25</b> or other footwear. However, the desired footboard contour may be provided by varying the thickness of the lower portion or bottom of the liner <b>710</b>, whereby the liner <b>710</b> may be said to contribute to the built-up sole, as described hereinafter, or by other suitable means. When the liner lower portion is thusly built-up, the footboard is alternately defined as the coutour of the surface of the bottom or lower portion of the liner on which the foot rests.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Conventional ski boots which are not adjusted for this differential <b>716</b> and other footboard contour may leave the numerous bones in the foot in a jammed or misaligned condition, which makes balancing and athletic movement difficult for many skiers, especially women. In order to provide better balance and athletic movement for a skier, the desired or optimum differential <b>716</b> as well as other footboard contour, after it is determined as discussed hereinafter based on what is optimum for the individual as perceived by the individual, is shown to be achieved by positioning one or more inserts <b>724</b> of plastic or other suitable material and of the same or varying thicknesses between the liner <b>710</b> and the sole <b>704</b>, thereby providing a âbuilt-up sole.â These inserts <b>724</b> are shown to be held in place by, for example, one or more protruding portions <b>726</b> on one insert <b>724</b> which are interlockingly received in indents <b>728</b> in an adjacent insert <b>724</b>, it being understood that they may be held in place by other suitable means such as screws. For example, the lower insert <b>724</b> may have a thickness (at the heel end) of about Â½ inch, and the upper inserts <b>724</b> may have a thickness (at the heel end) of about â inch, and all the inserts <b>724</b> suitably taper towards the toe portion to provide the arch, illustrated at <b>730</b>, to suitably provide for the resting of the arch of the foot thereon. Thus, the heel to forefoot height differential <b>716</b> in the boot <b>25</b> may, for example, be about â inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">The liner <b>710</b> may be a single piece with a cushionary bottom or it may have a cushionary member (insole) in the bottom which receives the foot. If the inserts <b>724</b> are suitably sized and shaped to provide the optimum foot position, as discussed hereinafter, then it is unnecessary to alter the conformable liner, which, being flexible, should suitably conform thereto.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">The determination of the contour of the footboard <b>718</b> will be discussed hereinafter with respect to various footwear, it being understood that the discussion thereof will apply to the boot <b>25</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">As seen at <b>732</b>, the insertion of the inserts <b>724</b> results in a narrowed passage for the foot. In order to accommodate for such a narrowing, the upper front of the shell <b>702</b> has a cut-out, illustrated at <b>734</b>, which provides an opening over the foot instep to allow the liner <b>710</b> and the foot received therein to protrude through the cut-out. To secure the forefoot, the liner <b>710</b> is provided with laces, illustrated at <b>736</b>, or with other suitable means such as, for example, Velcro material or straps.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">Unlike in a typical ski boot, the cut-out <b>734</b> does not allow the liner <b>710</b> to be secured by the shell <b>702</b> extending over the forward portion thereof. In order to suitably secure the liner <b>710</b> so that, for example, the foot does not come out of the boot <b>25</b> if the skier leans back, the toe portion of the liner <b>710</b> is suitably affixed to the toe portion of the sole <b>704</b> such as, for example, by one or more screws <b>738</b> each received in an aperture, illustrated at <b>740</b>, and threadedly received in a small rigid plate <b>742</b> suitably built into the liner <b>710</b> or by other suitable fasteners or interlocking arrangements such as, for example, bolts or pins.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">The cuff is typically attached to the shell of a ski boot with cammed fasteners or knobs or studs, such as in the above discussed Vento ski boot, which are advertised to allow longitudinal flex of the boot to be adjusted and to allow the cuff to be adjusted from a neutral position to an inwards or outwards tilt. Except as discussed herein, the boot <b>25</b> may as applicable be similar to the Vento ski boot. Such flex and tilt adjustments may have the incidental consequence merely as a result of their functioning of effecting a small movement of the cuff <b>710</b> vertically relative to the shell <b>702</b> of typically less than about Â¼ inch.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">As the heel height is increased within the boot <b>25</b>, the lower leg <b>700</b> may extend higher above the cuff <b>710</b> than is comfortable or suitable, and, especially for a woman, her calf muscle, illustrated at <b>744</b>, may undesirably get moved forward. In order to provide for suitable placement of the cuff <b>710</b> as the heel height is increased within the boot <b>25</b>, in accordance with the present invention, the cuff <b>710</b> is height adjustable relative to the shell <b>702</b>. Such height adjustment may be provided, for example, by one or more circumferentially spaced vertical slots, illustrated at <b>744</b>, in the shell <b>702</b> (for example, 3 such slots, one on either side of the boot and one in the back thereof). Referring to <figref>FIG. 28</figref>, for example, a screw <b>746</b> with a large head <b>748</b> passes through a suitably sized bushing <b>750</b> that is suitably fitted in a suitably sized hole, illustrated at <b>752</b>, in the cuff <b>710</b> then through the slot <b>744</b> then secured with a suitable nut <b>754</b>. Nut <b>754</b> may, for example, be a t-lock nut to grip the shell <b>702</b> around the slot <b>744</b> so that the cuff <b>710</b> is secure and unable to move up and down. Alternatively, vertical adjustment may be made, for example, by, instead of the slot <b>744</b>, a series of vertically evenly spaced holes in each of the sides and back of the shell <b>702</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">In order to provide adequate vertical adjustment to suitably accommodate the various heel height changes that may be made, in accordance with the present invention, the height adjustability of the cuff <b>710</b> relative to the shell <b>702</b> is at least about 1 inch (for example, about 2 inches) and accordingly the length, illustrated at <b>756</b>, of the slot <b>744</b> is preferably at least about 1 inch (for example, about 2 inches). Preferably, the height adjustability of the cuff <b>710</b> relative to the shell <b>702</b> is at least equal to the maximum heel height change that may occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, in order to build up the sole of ski boot <b>25</b> (<figref>FIG. 27</figref>) or of other footwear such as shoe <b>800</b> (<figref>FIG. 34</figref>) to an optimum contour/height, the contour of the bottom of the foot <b>802</b> is first measured/determined by use of a suitable apparatus such as the apparatus illustrated generally at <b>804</b>. As used herein and in the claims, the terms âshoeâ and âfootwearâ are intended to include boots, sandals, slippers, and any other form of footwear as well as shoes. Apparatus <b>804</b> includes a toe end assembly, illustrated generally at <b>806</b>, and a heel end assembly, illustrated generally at <b>808</b>, which rest on a generally horizontal surface such as provided by flat support member <b>810</b>. The assemblies <b>806</b> and <b>808</b> may be made of wood or other suitable material, for example, flat members discussed hereinafter may be boards.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">The heel end assembly <b>808</b> includes a lower flat member <b>812</b> hingedly connected as by hinge, illustrated at <b>814</b>, at its upper inner corner to the lower inner corner of an upper flat member <b>816</b> providing an upper surface <b>818</b>. An elongate member (square of rectangular in cross-section) <b>820</b> extends cross-wise of the assembly <b>808</b> and is suitably attached, as by gluing, to the lower surface of member <b>812</b> adjacent the inner end thereof, thus resulting in the member <b>812</b>, with its outward end resting on the support member <b>810</b>, being inclined upwardly as it extends inwardly to the hinge <b>814</b>. A wedge member <b>822</b>, which may be similarly shaped as member <b>820</b>, is removably receivable between the flat members <b>812</b> and <b>816</b> for reasons which will be discussed hereinafter.</p>

A plurality of flat members <b>828</b>, which may be of varying thickness but need not be so, are removably receivable between the flat member <b>824</b> and the support member <b>810</b> for reasons which will be discussed hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">An assembly, illustrated generally at <b>830</b>, interconnects the the upper inner ends of the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b>. The assembly <b>830</b>, whose parts may be composed of a suitable metal, includes a hinge <b>832</b> one leaf <b>834</b> of which is suitably connected to flat member <b>816</b> as by spaced screws <b>836</b> and the other leaf <b>838</b> of which is connected to plate <b>840</b> as by rivets <b>842</b>. The assembly <b>830</b> similarly includes a hinge <b>844</b> one leaf <b>846</b> of which is suitably connected to flat member <b>824</b> as by spaced screws <b>848</b> and the other leaf <b>850</b> of which is connected to plate <b>852</b> as by rivets <b>854</b>.

Plate <b>852</b> similarly has a pair of laterally spaced elongate slots, illustrated at <b>858</b>, which also extend in a direction toward and away from the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b>. The plates <b>840</b> and <b>852</b> vertically overlap each other so that their respective slots <b>856</b> and <b>858</b> are alignable, and a screw <b>860</b> is receivable in each respective pair of aligned slots <b>856</b> and <b>858</b> and secured by a wing nut <b>862</b> to connect the plates <b>840</b> and <b>852</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">In order to use the apparatus <b>804</b>, a mark, illustrated at <b>864</b>, is placed on the foot <b>802</b> at the forward end of the heel <b>866</b>. The length, illustrated at <b>868</b>, of the foot arch is measured, the foot arch being from mark <b>864</b> forward to the fifth metatarsal joint (near the rear of the ball of the foot). The distance, illustrated at <b>870</b>, between the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b> is adjusted so that it is equal to the distance <b>868</b>. The foot <b>802</b> is then placed on the surfaces <b>818</b> and <b>826</b> with the mark <b>864</b> (or forward end of the heel <b>866</b>) aligned with the hinge <b>832</b> so that the foot arch extends between the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b>, with the heel of the foot <b>802</b> resting on the flat member <b>816</b> and the ball of the foot <b>802</b> resting on the flat member <b>824</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">The difference in height, illustrated at <b>872</b>, between the surfaces <b>818</b> and <b>826</b> when the foot <b>802</b> is in the optimum position (determined as discussed hereinafter) is the desired heel to forefoot height differential <b>716</b> for the footwear <b>800</b> as well as for boot <b>25</b>. To test the foot <b>802</b> in different positions, one may start with the surface <b>818</b> level by moving the wedge <b>822</b> back and forth, as illustrated at <b>874</b>, until surface <b>818</b> becomes level. One may also start by adjusting the height of flat member <b>824</b>, by suitable addition of shims <b>828</b>, until surface <b>826</b> is at the same height as surface <b>818</b>. However, one may start at different positions. Then, as shims <b>828</b> are added or subtracted, balance and mobility and flexion are tested at each of different heights <b>872</b> by having the person roll the feet/ankles, forward flex, and the like, until he reports a height at which he feels that he has the best balance and mobility and flexion. In most cases, it is expected that this optimal height <b>872</b> is with the forefoot lower, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, but it could be with the forefoot higher. The angle at this optimum height <b>872</b> is measured with the angle measuring device <b>876</b>, which is a different way of measuring the heel to forefoot height differential <b>716</b> (<figref>FIG. 43</figref>), as discussed hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Not only is it considered important to provide the optimum heel to forefoot height differential in the footwear <b>800</b>, but it is also considered important for optimal balance and mobility and flexion that the heel angle, illustrated at <b>878</b>, be optimal. In accordance with the present invention, in order to determine the optimal heel angle (the angle of the heel portion of the footboard), the wedge <b>822</b> is moved back and forth, as illustrated at <b>874</b>, thereby changing the heel angle <b>878</b>, the balance and mobility and flexion are tested at each of different heel angles <b>878</b> by having the person roll, forward flex, and the like, until he reports a heel angle <b>878</b> at which he feels that he has the best balance and mobility and flexion. This optimum heel angle <b>878</b> is also measured with the angle measuring device <b>876</b>, as discussed hereinafter. The apparatus <b>804</b> is retained in the optimal position for heel to forefoot height differential and heel angle for use at that optimal position as discussed hereinafter. It should be understood that apparatus <b>804</b> may be embodied differently to provide a determination of optimal heel to forefoot height differential and heel angle, and such other embodiments of the apparatus <b>804</b> are meant to come within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Referring to <figref>FIG. 32</figref>, the angle measuring device <b>876</b> comprises a pair of flat parallel bars <b>880</b> and <b>882</b> which will extend generally vertically during normal use and a pair of flat upper and lower parallel bars <b>884</b> and <b>886</b> respectively pivotly connecting the upper ends and lower ends respectively of bars <b>880</b> and <b>882</b> as by screws <b>888</b> or other suitable fasteners which allow the bars to pivot or rotate relative to each other. The screws <b>888</b> define pivot points. The distance between the upper pivot points is equal to the distance between the lower pivot points <b>888</b>, and the distance between the left-side pivot points <b>888</b> is equal to the distance between the right-side pivot points <b>888</b>. Each of the bars <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>, <b>884</b>, and <b>886</b> may have, for example, a width of about Â½ inch and a thickness of about 1/16 inch and be made of aluminum, steel, stainless steel, or other suitable material. The bars <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>, <b>884</b>, and <b>886</b> are thus seen to form the shape of a parallelogram no matter in what position they are pivoted to. The vertical bars <b>880</b> and <b>882</b> do not extend beyond the bar <b>884</b> for reasons to be discussed hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">The vertical bar <b>880</b> extends downwardly beyond the lower bar <b>886</b> a short distance, illustrated at <b>891</b> (<figref>FIG. 29</figref>) of, for example, about â inch to define a portion <b>890</b> providing a first contact point, illustrated at <b>892</b>, to engage one end of a surface whose angle is to be measured. The lower bar <b>886</b> extends beyond the other vertical bar <b>882</b> a distance, illustrated at <b>901</b> (<figref>FIG. 33</figref>), of, for example, about 3Â½ inches, thereby providing a portion <b>900</b> which supports a short vertically extending structure <b>896</b> which extends below the lower bar <b>886</b> a distance, illustrated at <b>894</b> (<figref>FIG. 29</figref>), which is substantially the same distance as distance <b>891</b> (<figref>FIG. 29</figref>), to provide a second contact point, illustrated at <b>898</b>, to engage the other end of the surface whose angle is to be measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">The structure <b>896</b> is adjustably movable along the length of bar portion <b>900</b> to adjust to the distance (between points <b>892</b> and <b>898</b>) over which the angle of surface slope or incline (defined for the purposes of this specification and the claims as the angle of the differential between the heights of the surface at points <b>892</b> and <b>898</b>) is to be measured.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">As seen in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, structure <b>896</b> comprises a flat bar which is bent to wrap around the top edge of portion <b>900</b> and to extend below the bottom edge of portion <b>900</b>, and the resulting forward and rear portions are connected just below the bottom edge of portion <b>900</b> by screw or other suitable fastener <b>902</b> so that the structure <b>896</b> is adjustably movable along the length of portion <b>900</b> but tightly held in an adjusted position so that it does not inadvertently move from that position while making measurements. A cut-out (not shown) is provided in an end of the structure flat bar and the resulting tabs <b>904</b> on the lateral sides thereof are bent forwardly to engage the lateral sides of the structure flat bar to further secure it on portion <b>900</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">Referring to <figref>FIG. 37</figref>, there is shown generally at <b>906</b> an alternative form of the structure <b>896</b>, wherein the end edge of bar <b>886</b> is illustrated at <b>908</b>. Alternative structure <b>906</b> includes a pair of flat bars <b>910</b> which sandwich bar <b>886</b> and upper and lower shims <b>912</b> therebetween, the bars <b>910</b> and shims <b>912</b> held tightly together by upper and lower rivets <b>914</b> respectively so that, like structure <b>896</b>, the structure <b>906</b> is adjustably movable along the length of portion <b>900</b> but tightly held in an adjusted position so that it does not inadvertently move from that position while making measurements. It should be understood that the angle measuring device <b>876</b> and the structures <b>896</b> and <b>906</b> may be otherwise suitably embodied, and such other embodiments are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">In order to determine the optimum heel to forefoot height differential for the foot <b>802</b> as determined by use of the apparatus <b>804</b> of <figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>, the angle measurement device <b>876</b> is placed as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 29</figref> with the points <b>892</b> and <b>898</b> engaging the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b> respectively. Since the device flat bars <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>, <b>884</b>, and <b>886</b> form the shape of a parallelogram no matter in what position they are pivoted to, the angle at which lower bar <b>886</b> extends is the same as the angle at which upper bar <b>884</b> extends, which means that the heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> can be determined by engaging a conventional inclinometer <b>916</b> along the length of bar <b>884</b> and reading from the inclinometer the angle of the slope or incline thereof. This of course requires that the member <b>810</b> provide a level surface, and to the extent that it doesn't, it may affect the accuracy of the measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">The angle determined to be optimum for the heel to forefoot height differential with reference to <figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> is the angle which it is desired to provide for the heel to forefoot height differential in the footwear <b>800</b> for the foot <b>802</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 33</figref>, there is illustrated the use of the angle measurement device <b>876</b> for determining the angle of the heel to forefoot height differential <b>873</b> in the footwear <b>800</b>. Thus, the point <b>898</b> engages the point illustrated at <b>918</b> on the shoe footboard, illustrated at <b>920</b>, that the metatarsal heads of the foot <b>802</b> rest upon, and the point <b>892</b> engages the point illustrated at <b>922</b> on the shoe footboard <b>920</b> that the heel of the foot <b>802</b> rests upon, it being important that the length between the points <b>892</b> and <b>898</b> be the same for the measurement in <figref>FIG. 33</figref> as for the corresponding measurement in <figref>FIG. 29</figref> and that the shoe <b>800</b> rest on a level surface to insure an accurate measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">Referring to <figref>FIG. 34</figref>, in order to determine the optimum heel angle <b>878</b> as determined by the apparatus <b>804</b> of <figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> and the heel angle <b>878</b> of the corresponding shoe <b>800</b>, the angle measurement device <b>876</b> is turned upside down so that the upper bar engages over the length of the heel portion <b>924</b> of the shoe footboard <b>920</b> (the shoe <b>800</b> being shown in <figref>FIGS. 33 and 34</figref> with the insole removed therefrom). Again, since the bars <b>880</b>, <b>882</b>, <b>884</b>, and <b>886</b> define a parallelogram no matter in what position they are in and since bar <b>886</b> is thus parallel to bar <b>884</b>, the angle <b>878</b> can be measured by engaging the inclinometer or angle indicator <b>916</b> along the length of bar <b>886</b> and read therefrom the angle, it again being important that the shoe <b>800</b> rest on a level surface to insure an accurate measurement.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">It should of course be understood that the measurements for the apparatus <b>804</b> and corresponding measurements in the shoe <b>800</b> can be accurately compared as long as each measurement is obtained while the apparatus <b>804</b> and the shoe <b>800</b> are on the same or similarly inclined surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">In order to unobstructively and conveniently make measurements inside typical shoes/boots, as illustrated in FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, the vertical bars <b>880</b> and <b>882</b> are desirably long enough to extend above the top of the shoes/boots, and the upper bar is desirably short enough to fit within the shoe opening, illustrated at <b>926</b>. In addition, the length of the lower bar <b>886</b> is desirably short enough that it can fit easily into the shoe/boot <b>800</b> while allowing sufficient adjustment of the distance between points <b>892</b> and <b>898</b>. Accordingly, the length, illustrated at <b>928</b>, of bar <b>882</b> is preferably at least about 9 inches, more preferably at least about 12 inches, with the bar <b>880</b> extending an added distance equal to the length <b>891</b> (in the range of about Â¼ inch to Â½ inch) of portion <b>890</b>. The length, illustrated at <b>930</b>, of bar <b>884</b> is preferably less than about 3 inches, for example, about 2Â½ inches. The length, illustrated at <b>932</b>, of the lower bar <b>886</b> is preferably about 6 inches or less. While these dimensions are considered preferred for a typical shoe/boot, they may of course vary depending on shoe type/size.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 35 and 36</figref>, there is shown at <b>934</b> an attachment to the angle measuring device <b>876</b> for determining the difference, illustrated at <b>936</b>, between the determined (at <b>872</b> in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>) optimum heel to forefoot height differential and the determined (at <b>873</b> in <figref>FIG. 33</figref>) actual heel to forefoot height differential in a shoe <b>800</b> being or to be tailored for the optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b>. The attachment <b>934</b> comprises an elongate bar <b>938</b> which extends vertically along side the lower portion of the vertical bar <b>880</b> and may be similarly sized in width and thickness. A pair of vertically spaced upper and lower sleeves <b>940</b> and <b>942</b> respectively are integral with or welded or otherwise suitably attached to the bar <b>938</b> and each being sized to tightly grasp the bar <b>938</b> but allowing the attachment <b>934</b> to be movable along the length thereof. The upper sleeve <b>940</b> is preferably attached to the upper end of bar <b>938</b>. The lower sleeve <b>942</b> is spaced from the lower end of bar <b>938</b> which lower end defines a measuring point illustrated at <b>944</b>. The attachment <b>934</b> may be suitably molded of plastic or suitably made of cast steel or other metal with the sleeves <b>940</b> and <b>942</b> suitably welded to the bar <b>938</b>. The attachment <b>934</b> is mounted on the bar <b>880</b> before the bar <b>886</b> is attached to the bar <b>880</b> by screw <b>888</b>. The spacing between the sleeves <b>940</b> and <b>942</b>, for example, about 1 inch, is selected to allow the attachment <b>934</b> to be slid upwardly so that point <b>944</b> is even with (at the same height as) point <b>892</b> and to be slid from that position downwardly sufficiently to make the hereinafter described measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">To determine the amount of added thickness <b>936</b> needed in the shoe <b>800</b> (if such added thickness is needed) to achieve the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b>, the attachment <b>934</b> is slid upwardly until the points <b>934</b> and <b>892</b> are even with each other. While using inclinometer <b>916</b>, the bar <b>886</b> is moved to the angle corresponding to the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> (the point <b>892</b> being above the heel), and the attachment <b>934</b> is slid downwardly until point <b>944</b> contacts the heel surface of the shoe <b>800</b>. The distance <b>936</b> is then a measure of the added heel lift thickness needed in the shoe <b>800</b> to achieve the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">Once the optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b> are determined, heel lifts of various thicknesses and tapers, as needed, as illustrated at <b>724</b> in <figref>FIG. 27</figref> and as illustrated compositely at <b>946</b> in <figref>FIG. 43</figref>, are mounted in the shoe <b>800</b> to tailor the shoe to that optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b>, utilizing the angle measurement device <b>876</b>, as hereinbefore discussed, and utilizing principles commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">After the heel is built up to the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b>, an insole, illustrated at <b>948</b> in <figref>FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>, is custom formed to fit the impression of the foot and suitably placed over the built-up heel <b>946</b> and forefoot, in a manner in accordance with the present invention, as discussed hereinafter, so that its upper surface conforms to the footboard <b>718</b>. A custom insole is typically formed by forming an impression of the foot lower surface by placing the foot in a beaded bladder or other form such as casting foam and heating a custom insole blank and conforming it to the foot surface impression, then putting the cooled custom insole into the built-up shoe for the foot. Undesirably, the bottom surface of such a custom insole may not suitably correspond to the upper surface of the built-up sole. This is because, when the heel height and angle that the custom insole is placed upon is changed, unless the corresponding bottom surface of the insole is changed in the same way, the foot may undesirably be taken out of the desired subtalar neutral position, resulting in an unbalanced locked-up footâthe same type of condition which it is desired to avoid by the building up of the heel. In addition, the arch may no longer conform properly with the arch of such a custom insole, resulting undesirably in the arch of the person's foot being forced to change, again undesirably resulting in jammed foot bones.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">In order to provide a footboard <b>718</b> suitably to prevent or reduce such misalignment or jamming of foot bones, in accordance with the present invention, the bottom surface of the custom insole <b>948</b> is conformed to the upper surface of the built-up sole <b>946</b> as described hereinafter.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">Referring to <figref>FIG. 38</figref>, there is shown at <b>950</b> a rectangular (or otherwise suitably shaped) piece of casting foam in which, after it is altered to the form illustrated at <b>951</b> in <figref>FIGS. 40 and 41</figref>, the foot <b>802</b> is placed to form an impression, illustrated at <b>952</b>, of the foot bottom, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 40</figref>. A suitable casting foam is marketed as Treadeasy professional casting foam by Prime Materials Corporation of Batavia, N.Y. (see the earlier reference to the Treadway web site). In order to conform the upper surface <b>718</b> of the custom insole <b>948</b> to the upper surface <b>954</b> of the built-up sole <b>946</b>, the lower surface of the casting block <b>950</b> must first be formed to the shape <b>951</b> of the built-up sole <b>946</b>, i.e., formed to have the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b> as well as arch length <b>870</b>. If the foam block <b>950</b> is bent or mushed to attempt to form the shape <b>951</b>, the impression may be distorted. Therefore, in order to suitably form the block <b>950</b> to achieve an undistorted shape <b>951</b> of the built-up sole <b>946</b>, the shape is cut or severed from the block <b>950</b> as illustrated at <b>958</b>. In order to do so, the lower surface <b>956</b> of the foam block <b>950</b> is suitably cut with a knife or other blade, illustrated at <b>963</b>, to sever the portion illustrated at <b>961</b> and thereby form the lower surface <b>956</b> to have the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b> as well as arch length <b>870</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">Alternatively, the bottom surface <b>956</b> may be shaped by use of the apparatus illustrated generally at <b>960</b>. The casting block <b>950</b> is received on a platform <b>962</b> one end portion of which is received within a frame <b>964</b> which has a bottom wall <b>966</b> and a pair of side walls <b>968</b> which extend above the platform <b>962</b>. On each wall <b>968</b> are provided a pair of longitudinally spaced vertical slots, illustrated at <b>970</b>, which allow the frame <b>964</b> to be height-adjustably attached to the platform <b>962</b> by wing screws <b>971</b> (or other suitable fasteners) received in the slots <b>970</b> and in corresponding threaded apertures (not shown) in the platform <b>962</b>. This allows height adjustment of the frame <b>964</b> relative to the upper surface of the platform <b>962</b> (for example, from flush with the platform upper surface to about 1 inch above the platform upper surface) thereby vertically positioning a blade <b>972</b> received in tracks or grooves <b>974</b> in the inner surfaces of the side walls <b>968</b> for pushing longitudinally, as illustrated at <b>976</b>, to make the cut in the foam block <b>950</b> which is illustrated at <b>978</b>, to correspond to the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b>. The longitudinal spacing of the slots <b>970</b> allows the corresponding longitudinal spaced portions of the frame <b>964</b> to be adjusted to different heights to thereby tilt or incline the tracks <b>974</b> so that the cut <b>978</b> can be made at an angle corresponding to the determined heel angle <b>878</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">In order to form the cut illustrated at <b>980</b> in the foam block <b>950</b>, a fixture <b>982</b> is mounted on one side of the platform <b>962</b>. A portion <b>984</b> of the fixture <b>982</b> is mounted to the platform <b>962</b> by a wing screw <b>986</b> (or other suitable fastener) received in an aperture, illustrated at <b>988</b>, in the portion <b>984</b> and threadedly received in a nut (not shown) which is held in a longitudinally extending T-slot, illustrated at <b>990</b>, which allows the fixture <b>982</b> to be adjustably positioned along the length of T-slot <b>990</b> as needed for the determined length <b>870</b> of the arch. The fixture <b>982</b> has a portion <b>992</b> normal to portion <b>984</b> which supports a pair of lips <b>994</b> between which a blade or cutter <b>996</b> is receivable thereby providing a track for holding and guiding the blade <b>996</b> for its movement cross-wise of the platform <b>962</b>, as illustrated at <b>998</b>, for making the cut <b>980</b> of the desired length <b>870</b>. It should be noted that the fixture <b>982</b> is rotatable about wing screw <b>986</b> so that the track <b>994</b> is adjustably inclined to conform to the desired angle of the cut <b>980</b>. During the making of the cut <b>980</b>, an edge portion <b>1000</b> (opposite from the edge portion received in the track <b>994</b>) of the blade <b>996</b> may rest on the end portion of the blade <b>972</b> when blade <b>972</b> is pushed all the way in. It should of course be understood that the present invention is not limited to the apparatus and process for making the cuts <b>958</b> and <b>980</b> as disclosed herein, and other embodiments thereof are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">Referring to <figref>FIG. 40</figref>, the formed block <b>951</b> is placed on the measuring device <b>804</b> (shown in <figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref> and illustrated schematically in <figref>FIG. 40</figref>). If not already placed as discussed with reference to <figref>FIG. 31</figref>, the mark <b>864</b> is placed on the foot <b>802</b> at the forward end of the heel, and the foot <b>802</b> is pressed or caused to sink into the altered casting foam <b>951</b> with the mark <b>864</b> lined up with the hinge <b>832</b>, so that the foot arch extends between the flat members <b>816</b> and <b>824</b>, and with the foot <b>802</b> in a subtalar position well known to podiatrists and others of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains. The forward end of the impression is illustrated at <b>953</b>. Alternatively, a measuring device could be used while using apparatus <b>804</b> (<figref>FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>) to indicate the forward end of the heel and this mark location used for aligning the altered foam block <b>951</b> and the foot <b>802</b>. The foot <b>802</b> may be aligned with the apparatus <b>804</b> in other suitable ways. In this way, the forefoot is pressed further into the foam <b>951</b> than the heel is pressed (since member <b>824</b> offers resistance at a lower height than member <b>816</b> does) thus to thereby re-create the determined optimum heel to forefoot height differential <b>872</b> and heel angle <b>878</b> as well as arch length <b>870</b>, as seen in <figref>FIG. 40</figref>, whereby the impression <b>952</b> of the foot bottom may be made at the optimum heights and angles.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">Referring to <figref>FIG. 41</figref>, the altered foam block <b>951</b> carrying the foot bottom impression <b>952</b> may now have the severed portion <b>961</b> matched therewith and put back in the box the foam block <b>950</b> came in (or the altered foam block <b>951</b> otherwise suitably leveled as desired) and plaster of paris or other suitable casting material poured into the space containing the foot bottom impression <b>952</b> and allowed to harden. The resulting cast block, shown at <b>1002</b> in <figref>FIG. 42</figref>, containing the foot bottom impression <b>952</b> is suitably removed from the foam block <b>951</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">It should of course be understood that other suitable means such as, for example, a beaded bladder, may be used to form the foot bottom impression, and such other means are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">A suitable insole blank <b>948</b> (which may typically be a generally flat sheet having a generally uniform thickness and which may have a softer or more flexible or cushion-like upper portion <b>1004</b> over its length and a more rigid lower portion <b>1006</b> over generally the heel and arch areas to hold the form thereof, although the lower portion <b>1006</b> may extend all the way to the toes) is suitably heated (placed in hot water or otherwise as suitable) to a suitable temperature as may be recommended by the manufacturer (for example, about 180 degrees F.). The heated blank <b>948</b> is then placed on the foot bottom impression surface <b>952</b> of the cast block <b>1002</b> and allowed to conform thereto and cool, thereby to desirably conform the thusly tailored insole <b>948</b> to the upper surface of the built-up sole as well as to the foot. The tailored insole <b>948</b> is then placed in the shoe <b>800</b> over the built-up sole <b>946</b> to thereby achieve an insole surface which conforms to the surface of the built-up sole so that the built-up sole and conforming insole are both contoured to optimize balance and/or mobility and/or flexion.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">As previously discussed, the heel height of a ski boot is adjusted along with providing a optimum bootboard contour in the boot in order to optimize balance and/or mobility and/or flexion while skiing.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">In accordance with the present invention, a line of shoes or other footwear is marketed wherein each shoe size (currently sized in length and width) is also sized in various increments of heel to forefoot height differentials <b>872</b> and may be further sized in various increments of heel angle <b>878</b> and/or arch length <b>870</b>. The customers would be sized utilizing the principles disclosed herein. In order to reduce shopkeeper inventory, the manufacturer may sell to the shopkeeper as the orders are received and may wait to make a particular sized shoe until the order is received.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">It should be understood that, while the present invention has been described in detail herein, the invention can be embodied otherwise without departing from the principles thereof, and such other embodiments are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
