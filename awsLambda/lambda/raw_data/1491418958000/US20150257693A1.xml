      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO THE RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority from Indian Patent Application No. 1225/KOU2012 dated Oct. 23, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a needle safety assembly, in particular for a disposable medical device, comprising a needle and a protective cover for the needle, wherein the needle is attached to a needle hub which can be moved relative to the protective cover between a position of use in which at least the tip of the needle is outside of the protective cover, and a retracted position in which the needle is fully received in the protective cover.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Healthcare workers are increasingly at risk of disease transmission, and nurses perform the majority of invasive hypodermic procedures, such as injecting medicine, collecting blood and inserting indwelling intravenous (I.V.) catheters. Nurses and other healthcare personnel are routinely injured by the exposed, sharp lancet of the needle after use on a patient. The critical time where a percutaneous injury can occur is from the moment the needle is withdrawn from the patient, or I.V. port, to the time the contaminated needle is safely discarded.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Prior to the proliferation of HIV and serum hepatitis, a needle stick injury was considered a routine part of providing patient care. A needle stick injury now carries a life-threatening consequence and healthcare workers must live with this terror on a daily basis. Hence, there is a requirement for a low-cost safety needle protector apparatus with a universal application which shall prevent accidental contact of a medical professional or any other person with the sharp tip of the needle after use of the disposable medical device and thus prevent possible transmission of an infectious disease such as hepatitis, HIV, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a needle safety assembly which provides reliable protection against accidental pricking by a hypodermic needle and which is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">This object is satisfied by a needle safety assembly comprising a needle and a protective cover for the needle, wherein the needle is attached to a needle hub which has wings provided on opposite sides of the needle hub and which can be moved relative to the protective cover from a position of use in which at least the tip of the needle is outside of the protective cover into a retracted position in which the needle is fully received in the protective cover, wherein the protective cover is of generally tubular shape and defines two opposite axial slots which extend from a distal end of the protective cover towards a tubular base portion of the protective cover, wherein the slots are adapted to receive the wings when the needle hub moves into the protective cover, and wherein the needle safety assembly further comprises a locking mechanism adapted to secure the needle hub inside the protective cover when the needle hub is in the retracted position.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A needle safety assembly of the invention comprises a needle and a protective cover for the needle, wherein the needle is attached to a needle hub which has wings provided on opposite sides of the needle huh and which can be moved relative to the protective cover from a position of use in which at least the tip of the needle is outside of the protective cover into a retracted position in which the needle is fully received in the protective cover. The protective cover is of generally tubular shape and defines two opposite axial slots which extend from a distal end of the protective cover towards a tubular base portion of the protective cover, wherein the axial slots are adapted to receive the wings when the needle hub moves into the protective cover, and wherein the needle safety assembly further comprises a locking mechanism adapted to secure the needle hub inside the protective cover when the needle hub is in the retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In other words, the invention proposes a needle safety assembly which locks the needle safely in the protective cover by an interlocking arrangement. The locking mechanism effectively prevents the needle from inadvertently protruding out of the protective cover. Thereby protection against accidental pricking by the needle is greatly increased. Consequently, the needle safety assembly of the invention ensures a safe disposal of the needle after its use.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">It is to be noted that in the context of this invention the term âneedleâ comprises any object having a sharp tip which can cause a percutaneous injury. Specifically, in this context the term âneedleâ is understood to not only refer to a needle in the literal sense but also to a blade which has a sharp tip.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Disposable medical devices in which the needle safety assembly can be used include, for example, devices which are used to collect blood from a patient or a donor or to give fluids to a patient, such as blood collection sets (e.g. PSV sets with Luer adapters), blood collection bag needles, scalp vein sets, and fistula needles.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">According to a preferred embodiment, the locking mechanism comprises at least one pair of first and second locking means engaging with each other when the needle hub is in the retracted position, wherein the first locking means is provided on the needle hub and the second locking means is provided on the protective cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In the case of more than one pair of first and second locking means, at least one pair of first and second locking means may be arranged on a first side of the needle safety assembly, while at least another pair of first and second locking means may be arranged on a second side of the needle safety assembly opposite from the first side, when the needle hub is in the retracted position. Alternatively, it is also possible to have only one first locking means and more than one second locking means, e.g. two opposite second locking means, or vice versa.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The needle safety assembly is particularly inexpensive to manufacture, if the first locking means is formed integrally with the needle hub and/or the second locking means is formed integrally with the protective cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Preferably, the first locking means defines a surface facing the needle tip, wherein at least a portion of the surface extends in a plane generally perpendicular to the needle. This makes a particularly effective interaction between the first and second locking means possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment, the first locking means comprises a protrusion protruding from the needle hub.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">For example, the first locking means may have a generally nose-like or ramp-like shape, with its radial dimension increasing towards the tip of the needle.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In order to facilitate the movement of the needle hub into an interior passage of the protective cover, the first locking means may be formed such that a radial dimension of the locking means can be reduced against a restoring force. For example, the first locking means may comprise a material having elastic properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The first locking means may be arranged in the region of a proximal end of the needle hub. This arrangement is particularly advantageous in the case of winged needle hub.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">According to a further embodiment, the second locking means is provided on the tubular base portion of the protective cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The second locking means may comprise an opening in the protective cover, which is adapted to receive the first locking means, e.g. a protrusion protruding from the needle huh, when the needle hub is in the retracted position, thereby interlocking the needle hub and the protective cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Additionally or alternatively, the second locking means may comprise a locking tongue extending towards a proximal end of the protective cover and adapted to engage with the first locking means, when the needle hub is in the retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Preferably, the locking tongue extends towards the interior of the protective cover. It may have resilient properties such that it can be pushed outwards by the first locking means as the needle hub is moved towards its retracted position, and snap back behind the first locking means once the needle hub has adopted its retracted position. This is particularly advantageous if the first locking means does not have elastic properties. Alternatively, the locking tongue may be rigid if the first locking means comprises an elastic material.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a disposable medical device, for example a blood collection kit or a fistula needle kit, comprising a hypodermic needle <b>12</b> and a needle safety assembly <b>10</b> to prevent accidental contact of a medical professional or any other person with the sharp tip <b>14</b> of the needle <b>12</b> after use of the disposable medical device.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In this context, the end of the needle <b>12</b> having the sharp tip <b>14</b> is denoted the distal end, whereas the opposite end of the needle is denoted the proximal end. Likewise the orientation of parts of other structural elements facing towards the needle tip <b>14</b> will be referred to as distal, whereas the orientation of parts of these structural elements facing in the opposite direction will be referred to as proximal.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The needle <b>12</b> extends in an axial direction, thereby defining an axial direction for the needle safety assembly <b>10</b>. A direction perpendicular to the axial direction is denoted as radial.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the region of its proximal end the needle <b>12</b> is connected, for example glued, to a needle hub <b>16</b>. The needle hub <b>16</b> is a so-called winged needle hub <b>16</b> having a tubular main body <b>18</b> and two wings <b>20</b> which extend in opposite radial directions from the main body <b>18</b>. The wings <b>20</b> can either be formed integrally with the main body <b>18</b>, or they can be separate elements that are attached to the main body <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">One end of a PVC tube <b>22</b> is attached, for example glued, to a proximal end portion of the needle hub <b>16</b>. The other end of the PVC tube <b>22</b> may, for example, be connected to a blood collection bag (not shown) or any other component to facilitate flow of fluid, such as medicine or blood, to or from a patient or donor. A clamp <b>23</b> is slidably arranged on the PVC tube <b>22</b> and can be used to close off the PVC tube <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a locking protrusion <b>24</b> is arranged on a top side of the main body <b>18</b> of the needle hub <b>16</b> in a proximal region thereof. The locking protrusion <b>24</b> is integrally formed with the main body <b>18</b> and has a generally nose-like or ramp-like shape, with its radial dimension increasing towards the tip <b>14</b> of the needle <b>12</b>. A distal face <b>25</b> of the locking protrusion <b>24</b> extends in a plane generally perpendicular to the axial direction, i.e. in a radial plane.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The position of the locking protrusion <b>24</b> is rotated by an angle of generally 90Â° about the needle axis with respect to the position of the wings <b>20</b>, i.e. while the wings <b>20</b> extend in a first plane, e.g. a horizontal plane, the locking protrusion <b>24</b> extends in a second plane that is oriented generally perpendicular to the first plane, e.g. vertical.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the needle safety assembly <b>10</b> further comprises a protective cover <b>26</b> which is slidably arranged on the PVC tube <b>22</b> and which can be pushed over the needle hub <b>16</b> and the needle <b>12</b> after the medical device has been used.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The protective cover <b>26</b>, shown in more detail in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, is of generally tubular shape, i.e. it has generally circular inner and outer cross-sections.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Two opposite axial slots <b>28</b> are formed in a wall of the protective cover <b>26</b> thereby defining first and second opposite part tubular axial sections <b>30</b> of the protective cover <b>26</b>. The slots <b>28</b> extend from a distal end of the protective cover <b>26</b> towards a tubular base portion <b>32</b> of the protective cover <b>26</b> which is formed in a proximal end region of the protective cover <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The slots <b>28</b> are adapted to receive the wings <b>20</b> when the needle hub <b>16</b> moves into the protective cover <b>26</b> thereby ensuring a correct rotational position of the protective cover <b>26</b> relative to the needle hub <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The axial length of the slots <b>28</b> is greater than an axial distance between a proximal face of the wings <b>20</b> and the needle tip <b>14</b>. In other words, the axial length of the slots <b>28</b> is selected such that the needle hub <b>16</b> and the needle <b>12</b> can be fully received inside the protective cover <b>26</b>, in particular, with the needle tip <b>14</b> being inside the protective cover <b>26</b> and thereby effectively precluded from accidentally pricking someone.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Across a certain length, in the illustrated embodiment across almost half the axial length of the protective cover <b>26</b>, the slots <b>28</b> have a minimum width which can be even smaller than the thickness of the wings <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Towards the distal end of the protective cover <b>26</b> the slots widen in order to facilitate the insertion of the wings <b>20</b> when the protective cover <b>26</b> is pushed over the needle hub <b>16</b>. The slots <b>28</b> also widen towards the tubular base portion <b>32</b> and each comprise a significantly enlarged proximal region <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The enlarged proximal regions <b>34</b> of the slots <b>28</b> are defined by cut-outs in the tubular wall of the protective cover <b>26</b> and result in tapered proximal end portions <b>36</b> of the axial sections <b>80</b>, which pass into the tubular base portion <b>32</b> and which have a thickness generally corresponding to the thickness of the tube wall. The proximal end portions <b>36</b> have opposite flat inner surfaces <b>38</b> which pass into corresponding flat surfaces inside the tubular base portion <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Elevated structures <b>40</b> are provided on the outer surfaces of the axial sections <b>30</b>. More specifically, the elevated structures <b>40</b> are in the form of arrows indicating the direction in which the protective cover <b>26</b> is to be moved along the PVC tube <b>22</b> in order to cover the needle <b>14</b>. Furthermore, the elevated structures <b>40</b> serve to strengthen the axial sections <b>30</b> in the region of their tapered proximal end portions <b>36</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The maximum inner diameter of the tubular protective cover <b>26</b> is smaller than the maximum radial dimension of the needle hub <b>16</b> in the region of the peak of the locking protrusion <b>24</b>. Consequently, the axial sections <b>30</b> are spread apart when the needle hub <b>16</b> moves into the protective cover <b>26</b>, with the tapered proximal end portions <b>36</b> providing a certain amount of flexibility and thereby facilitating the spreading apart of the axial sections <b>30</b> and thus making the movement of the needle hub <b>16</b> into the protective cover <b>26</b> easier.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">It is to be noted that the transition from the minimum width regions of the slots <b>28</b> towards the enlarged proximal regions <b>34</b> of the slots <b>28</b> is continuous, more specifically follows a gentle curve. As such, this transition does not serve to lock the needle hub <b>16</b> in its retracted position inside the protective cover <b>26</b> and would not prevent undesirable re-emerging of the covered needle tip <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Instead, two locking openings <b>42</b> are provided in the tubular wall of the base portion <b>32</b> on opposite sides thereof. The position of the locking openings <b>42</b> is rotated by generally 90Â° about the needle axis with respect to the slots. As such at least one of the locking openings <b>42</b> is aligned with the locking protrusion <b>24</b> when the wings <b>20</b> move along the slots <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The axial position of the locking openings <b>42</b> is adapted such that the locking protrusion <b>24</b> engages one of the locking openings <b>42</b> when the needle <b>12</b> is fully received in the protective cover <b>26</b> and the wings <b>20</b> abut against the base portion <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">An arrangement of two locking openings <b>42</b> simplifies a correct locking of the needle hub <b>16</b> inside the protective cover <b>26</b>, since the protective cover <b>26</b> can be rotated by 180Â° about the PVC tube <b>22</b> and still be correctly locked with the needle hub <b>16</b>. However, it is to he understood that a base portion <b>32</b> having only one locking opening <b>42</b> would work as well, only in this case the person handling the device would have to make sure that the single locking opening <b>42</b> is rotated to the side of the locking protrusion <b>24</b> when the protective cover <b>26</b> is pushed over the needle hub <b>16</b> in order to ensure a locking between the protective cover <b>26</b> and the needle hub <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In order to improve the desired locking function each locking opening <b>42</b> is provided with a locking tongue <b>44</b> which protrudes from a distal side of the locking opening <b>42</b> into the opening <b>42</b> and also into the interior of the base portion <b>32</b>. More specifically, the locking tongues <b>44</b> have a ramp-like shape with its radial dimension increasing in a proximal direction and defining a proximal face <b>46</b> which extends in a plane generally perpendicular to the axial direction. In the locked state the distal face <b>25</b> of the locking protrusion <b>24</b> engages with the proximal face <b>46</b> of the locking tongue <b>44</b>, thereby improving the locking effect and thus the safety of the needle safety assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In order to make it easier for the locking protrusion <b>24</b> to move past the locking tongue <b>44</b> upon entering its locked position, the locking protrusion <b>24</b> may comprise or be made of a material having certain elastic properties, such as a plastic or silicon material. In fact, the entire needle hub <b>16</b> may be made of such a material.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In comparison, the protective cover <b>26</b> may be made of a rather stiff plastic material. Alternatively, the protective cover <b>26</b> may comprise or consist of a metal material.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The function of the needle safety assembly <b>10</b> is as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In the initial state of the medical device, e.g. prior to use of the medical device, the needle hub <b>16</b> is outside the protective cover <b>26</b>, with the protective cover <b>26</b> being moved along the PVC tube <b>22</b> away from the needle hub <b>16</b> as far as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">A medical professional holds the wings <b>20</b> attached to the needle hub <b>16</b> and punctures the skin of a patient with the needle <b>12</b> such that the needle <b>12</b> enters a vein of patient. As the needle <b>12</b> enters the vein blood rushes into the needle <b>12</b> and through the main body <b>18</b> of the needle hub <b>16</b> into the PVC tube <b>22</b>. The blood is collected in a blood collection bag or a vacuum tube through a connection to the other end of the PVC tube <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the device may be used to give fluids or medications to a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">After a required quantity of blood has been collected, the needle <b>12</b> is withdrawn from the vein and the protective cover <b>26</b> is pushed over the needle hub <b>16</b> with the wings <b>20</b> moving along the slots <b>28</b> until the locking protrusion <b>24</b> of the needle hub <b>16</b> engages with the locking opening <b>42</b> and the locking tongue <b>44</b> of the protective cover <b>26</b>. The needle <b>12</b> is now fully received and locked inside the protective cover <b>26</b> and the blood collection set can be safely disposed of.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Although this invention has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention can be constructed and utilized in a plethora of different ways. It should be understood that many changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications will become apparent to those persons skilled in this particular area of technology and to others after having been exposed to the present specification and accompanying drawings. Any and all such change, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention are therefore covered by and embraced within the present invention and the patent claims set forth herein-below.</p>
