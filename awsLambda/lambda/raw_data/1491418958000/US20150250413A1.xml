      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Patients diagnosed with diabetes are typically required by their doctors to test their blood glucose levels. Oftentimes, such tests must be performed multiple times throughout the day. To do so, patients typically prick a finger or other part of their anatomy to obtain a blood sample, which is then analyzed by a blood glucose meter. This process is then repeated throughout the day. Non-compliance with a testing regimen may occur due to the pain and apprehension of performing a finger prick with a lancing device. This is especially true in pediatric patients.</p>

Furthermore, the particular features, structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Described herein are example embodiments of apparatuses, systems, and methods for pain management of needle-penetration devices. In one example embodiment, the pain management can be provided through an assistive integrated pain management system. The assistive integrated pain management system can use stimuli such as, for example, temperature, auditory, psychological, tactile, or combinations of the forgoing to reduce, or eliminate, the perception of needle-penetration pain. As will be appreciated, the stimuli useful to the assistive integrated pain management system is not limited to the foregoing and can additionally include visual, taste, and/or electric stimuli. Stimuli can be provided through various mechanisms, including, for example, chemical reactions, substrates, gels, conductive substances, pain-relieving ointments, and nerve receptor agents such as Icy-HotÂ®. In some embodiments, the assistive integrated pain management can include an encasement apparatus to provide the stimuli. Additionally, in some embodiments, the encasement apparatus can represent identifiable objects, organisms, or characters.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The examples discussed herein are examples only and are provided to assist in the explanation of the apparatuses, devices, systems and methods described herein. None of the features or components shown in the drawings or discussed below should be taken as mandatory for any specific implementation of any of these the apparatuses, devices, systems or methods unless specifically designated as mandatory. For ease of reading and clarity, certain components, modules, or methods may be described solely in connection with a specific figure. Any failure to specifically describe a combination or sub-combination of components should not be understood as an indication that any combination or sub-combination is not possible. Also, for any methods described, regardless of whether the method is described in conjunction with a flow diagram, it should be understood that unless otherwise specified or required by context, any explicit or implicit ordering of steps performed in the execution of a method does not imply that those steps must be performed in the order presented but instead may be performed in a different order or in parallel.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Example embodiments described herein can mitigate and distract the pain and discomfort of needle-penetration devices. Without being bound to the theory, the embodiments can utilize principles derived from the Gates Theory of Pain to minimize the perception of pain. The Gates Theory of Pain suggests the stimulation of nerves adjacent to a needle penetration point can be used to eliminate, mask, or distract the associated pain because the stimulation activates similar parts of the brain as the pain and overshadows the perception of pain. Increasing the quantity and quality of sensory nerves stimulated simultaneous to, and adjacent with, the painful nerve stimulation, can further lessen the pain perceived. Example embodiments disclosed can provide a plurality of stimuli to reduce the perceived sensation of pain from a needle penetration device.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the pain management system can be an assistive integrated pain management system that includes an encasement apparatus <b>100</b>. Generally, the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b>, one or more stimulation generators <b>104</b>, and an actuator <b>106</b>. The housing <b>102</b> can define an interior chamber <b>110</b> configured to receive a needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the housing <b>102</b> and/or the interior chamber <b>110</b> can be adjustable to facilitate secure attachment of a multitude of needle-penetration assemblies <b>150</b> having different shapes, sizes, materials, mechanisms, components, applications and/or configurations. In some embodiments, a front wall <b>130</b> of the housing <b>102</b> can include an aperture <b>132</b> in communication with the interior chamber <b>110</b>. Additionally, the front wall <b>130</b> of the housing <b>102</b> can further include recessed portions <b>134</b> or compartments. In such embodiments, the aperture <b>132</b> and/or the recessed portions <b>134</b> can be configured to provide access to the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> without disrupting the psychological stimulus provided by the exterior shape of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In some embodiments, the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> includes a base <b>120</b> for supporting the housing <b>102</b> and/or assisting an operator in correctly aligning and placing the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> on a patient or user. The base <b>120</b> may be separately attached to the housing <b>102</b> or it may form an integral part thereof. Additionally, the base <b>120</b> can include a textured surface <b>124</b> as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, the base <b>120</b> can define or partially define an aperture <b>122</b> in communication with the interior chamber <b>110</b>. In such embodiments, the aperture <b>122</b> can be configured to facilitate mounting or installation of needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> into the interior chamber <b>110</b> of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Additionally, in some embodiments, the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can further include attachment mechanisms to assist in the use of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>. Example attachment mechanisms can include harnesses, straps, adhesives, or the use of pressure such as in a vacuum or suction-type system. The attachment mechanisms can assist an operator in correctly aligning and placing the apparatus <b>100</b> on the patient or user.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can be constructed out of any suitable material. In some embodiments, this material can be selected to present a soft feel to users (e.g., operators, patients, etc.) to eliminate irritation or itching in users. It should also be appreciated that materials that provide a suitable level of resistance, or that have a textured surface can also be used independently or in combination with other materials. Additionally or alternatively, the material can also be selected for antiseptic qualities, the ability of the material to be sterilized, and the biocompatibility of the material. For example, nitrile materials can be selected to avoid latex allergies. In some embodiments, the material can be a reprocessed material. Additionally, in some embodiments, materials capable of autoclave sterilization may be selected. It should be appreciated that the components (e.g., the housing <b>102</b>, actuator <b>106</b>, base <b>120</b>, etc.) of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> may each be constructed out of substantially similar materials. In some embodiments, however, one or more of the components of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> may be constructed out of different materials than the remaining components.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The stimulation generators <b>104</b> can be integrated into the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> and can be configured to produce various forms of auditory, visual, somatosensory, gustatory, and electric stimuli to reduce, or eliminate, the perception of needle-penetration pain. For example, in some embodiments, one or more of the simulation generators <b>104</b> can include, or may otherwise be embodied as, a speaker (e.g., the speakers <b>160</b> illustratively shown in <figref>FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>) configured to generate or reproduce various sounds as audible stimuli. Such sounds may be embodied as one or more beeps, buzzes, rings, tones, notes, chords, music, and any other type of sound capable of being generate and/or reproduced by a speaker. The speaker can generate and/or reproduce the sounds in a variety of customizable pitches and tones at different volumes and for variable durations and frequencies. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may be embodied as a mechanical stimulation generator <b>104</b>. For example, in such embodiments, a stimulation generator <b>104</b> may be embodied as a mechanical rattler, clicker, and/or shutter configured to generate corresponding sounds as the audible stimuli.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> can include, or otherwise may be embodied as, a light source or a display configured to emit light or render content as visible stimuli. In such embodiments, the light source or display can emit light in a variety of customizable colors at varying intensities, durations, and frequencies. In some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may be embodied as a light-emitting diode (LED). Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may be embodied as chemical stimulation generator <b>104</b>. For example, in such embodiments, a stimulation generator <b>104</b> may include temperature sensitive liquid crystals configured to convey the visual stimuli. In another example, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may be embodied as a display (e.g., the display <b>162</b> illustratively shown in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>) configured to convey visual stimuli to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> can generate somatosensory and/or gustatory stimuli. For example, a stimulation generator <b>104</b> may include, or otherwise may be embodied as, symmetrical or asymmetrical motors configured to generate vibrations or provide tactile feedback to a patient or an operator of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b>. One or more stimulation generators <b>104</b> may also include a textured surface. For example, in some embodiments such as the one illustratively shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the base <b>120</b> may include a textured surface <b>124</b> configured to be sensed by a patient or user when the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> is placed on the patient or user. In other examples, the base <b>120</b> may include, or otherwise may be embodied as a heat generator configured to provide temperature stimulation directly adjacent to the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> when the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> is placed on the patient and/or in response to actuation of, or interaction with, the actuator <b>106</b>. In such examples, the base <b>120</b> can be considered to be a stimulation generator <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">It should be appreciated that the stimulation generator(s) <b>104</b> may include, or otherwise may be embodied as, any other type of stimulation generator <b>104</b> configured to generate auditory, visual, somatosensory, gustatory, or other stimuli. For example, one or more of the stimulation generator(s) <b>104</b> may include, or may otherwise be embodied as, one or more chemicals, substrates, gels, conductive substances or materials, pain-relieving ointments, and nerve receptor agents such as Icy-HotÂ® capable of producing stimuli. Additionally, in some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may generate corresponding stimuli responsive to use of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> and/or the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>. For example, in some embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may generate corresponding stimuli in response to actuation of, or interaction with, the actuator <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, one or more of the stimulation generators <b>104</b> may generate corresponding stimuli independent of use of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> and/or needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>. In either case, it should be appreciated that the stimulation generators <b>104</b> can provide a distracting stimulus effect that can further mask or override the pain perception of a needle of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can cooperate, incorporate, integrate, or attach with the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> to control operation of a needle of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the actuator <b>106</b> can actuate or cause the needle of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> to puncture the skin of a user. In such embodiments, the actuator <b>106</b> can be mechanically or electrically coupled to the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> such that interaction with the actuator <b>106</b> (e.g., movement of the actuator <b>106</b>, depressing the actuator <b>106</b>, etc.) by a user causes the needle of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> to puncture the skin of the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Additionally, in some embodiments, components of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can allow control and adjustment of operational parameters of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> such as the needle penetration depth and penetration velocity of the needle. Such components may be mounted on and/or incorporated into the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> to facilitate such control and adjustment. Suitable components to control and adjust the operational parameters of the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> can include, among others, springs, clamps, gears, adhesives, levers, wedges, hinges, swings, locks, tape, snaps, screws, grooves, slides, knobs, pulleys, straps, and VelcroÂ®. It should be appreciated that such components can also be used to secure and/or mount the needle-penetration assembly <b>150</b> into the interior chamber <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can itself provide visual and psychological stimuli through an exterior shape of the housing <b>102</b>. To do so, the exterior shape of the housing <b>102</b> of the encasement apparatus <b>100</b> can resemble or represent identifiable objects, organisms, or characters.
