  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150917" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A physiological function detecting earphone includes an earphone body, an earplug mounted at one side of the earphone body and defining a window, a light processing module including a light sensing module towards the window, and a signal processing module. A detecting method includes steps: the participant inserts the earplug in the ear canal thereof; the light sensing module senses the changes of light emitted through the window and then reflected by the wall of the ear canal; the light processing module processes the reflected light of changes to get PPG signals; the signal processing module receives and processes the PPG signals to get physiological information of the participant. The window opened in the earplug can gather the light in a narrow area of the ear canal so that reduces effect of manufacturing material on transmittance of light and improves accuracy of the PPG signals and the physiological information.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to an earphone, and more particularly to a physiological function detecting earphone and a detecting method thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. The Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is the part of the peripheral nervous system that acts as a control system, functioning largely below the level of consciousness, and controls visceral functions. The ANS affects heart rate, blood pressure, mood changes, life stress and so on. Therefore, if a person can early detect his autonomic nervous variation, personal health can be paid attention as early as possible to prevent individual physiological or psychological disease. Heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly used to show the ANS of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. Methods used to detect beats include: ECG, blood pressure, ballistocardiograms and the pulse wave signal derived from the photoplethysmography (PPG).</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A traditional physiological function detecting earphone for detecting the HRV includes an earphone body, a light source and a light sensor. The earphone body has an earplug made of pervious to light material. In use, the earplug of the earphone body is inserted into the ear canal of a participant, then light emitted by the light source penetrates through the earplug and is reflected by the wall of the ear canal, and last the light sensor senses the reflected light of changes in a period of time to get PPG signals so as to detect the HRV.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, manufacturing material of the earplug has an effect on transmittance of light through the earplug. Furthermore, the earphone is apt to move in the ear canal along with the shaking of the participant, so that will easily cause an interspace between the earplug and the wall of the ear canal. As a result, the light outside the ear canal can go into the ear canal through the interspace so that will affect the PPG signals got by the light sensor and ultimately affect the accuracy of the HRV.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Therefore, a physiological function detecting earphone capable of overcoming the abovementioned problems is required.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a physiological function detecting earphone which includes an earphone body, an earplug mounted at one side of the earphone body, a light processing module and a signal processing module. At least one window is opened through the earplug. The light processing module includes an inner ring spacer, at least one light sensing module disposed on one end face of the inner ring spacer and facing to the window of the earplug, a signal amplifier and an A/D converter which are disposed on the inner ring spacer and coupled with the light sensing module. The light sensing module includes a visible light source for emitting at least one wavelength of light through the window of the earplug, and a light sensor for sensing reflected light of changes by the wall of the ear canal of a participant. The signal amplifier and the A/D converter process the reflected light of changes to get PPG signals. The signal processing module is coupled with the signal amplifier and the A/D converter via the inner ring spacer for receiving and processing the PPG signals to get physiological information of the participant.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a detecting method of the physiological function detecting earphone. The detecting method includes the steps: the participant inserts the earplug of the physiological function detecting earphone in the ear canal thereof; the light sensor senses the changes of light which is emitted by the visible light source through the window and then reflected by the wall of the ear canal of the participant; the signal amplifier and the A/D converter process the reflected light of changes to get the PPG signals; and the signal processing module receives and processes the PPG signals to get physiological information of the participant.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">As described above, the physiological function detecting earphone utilizes the window opened in the earplug to gather the light in a narrow area of the ear canal of the participant so as to reduce the effect of the manufacturing material on the transmittance of light. So the physiological function detecting earphone can effectively improve the accuracy of the PPG signals and the physiological information of the participant.</p>

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">One side of the earphone body <b>10</b> defines a first sound hole <b>11</b>. The inserting body <b>20</b> is mounted at the one side of the earphone body <b>10</b> and is used to be inserted into the ear canal of a participant. The inserting body <b>20</b> includes a holder <b>21</b>, a holding frame <b>22</b> and an earplug <b>23</b>. The holder <b>21</b> is substantially of cylindric shape and is formed by the circumferentia of the first sound hole <b>11</b> perpendicularly extending sideward. At least one opening <b>211</b> is opened through the inside, the outside and the free edge of the holder <b>21</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The holding frame <b>22</b> has a discoid cover board <b>221</b> covering the end mouth of the holder <b>21</b>.

In practice, the cover board <b>221</b> can be made of lightproof material.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the earplug <b>23</b> is made of lightproof material and has a cylindric sleeve <b>231</b> worn around the holder <b>21</b> and the holding frame <b>22</b>. The outer edge of the sleeve <b>231</b> extends towards the earphone body <b>10</b> to form a substantial bowl-shaped guiding portion <b>232</b>.

The earplug <b>23</b> is mounted outside the holder <b>21</b> and the holding frame <b>22</b> with the inserting board <b>223</b> being exposed through the window <b>234</b>. The outside of the guiding portion <b>232</b> is partly concaved inward to form a groove <b>235</b> around the second window <b>2342</b> for deforming the guiding portion <b>232</b> easily. The free edge of the guiding portion <b>232</b> perpendicularly protrudes inward to form a light blocking eave <b>236</b>. The sleeve <b>231</b> and the light blocking eave <b>236</b> abut against the one side of the earphone body <b>10</b> for blocking the light outside the ear canal of the participant.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the light processing module <b>40</b> includes an inner ring spacer <b>41</b>, at least one light sensing module <b>42</b> disposed on one end face of the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> and facing to the window <b>234</b> of the earplug <b>23</b>, a signal amplifier <b>43</b> and an A/D converter <b>44</b> which are disposed on the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> and coupled with the light sensing module <b>42</b>. In detail, the light sensing module <b>42</b> together with a part of the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> are located in the holder <b>21</b> and face to the inserting board <b>223</b> of the holding frame <b>22</b>. The light sensing module <b>42</b> includes a visible light source <b>421</b> for emitting at least one wavelength of light through the inserting board <b>223</b> of the holding frame <b>22</b> and the window <b>234</b> of the earplug <b>23</b>, and a light sensor <b>423</b> for sensing reflected light of changes by the wall of the ear canal of the participant. The signal amplifier <b>43</b> and the A/D converter <b>44</b> process the reflected light of changes to get PPG signals.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In detail, the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> includes a FPC board <b>411</b> and a connecting frame <b>412</b> connected with one end of the FPC board <b>411</b>. The FPC board <b>411</b> is positioned in the earphone body <b>10</b> and the connecting frame <b>412</b> is positioned in the holder <b>21</b> of the inserting body <b>20</b>.

The light sensing module <b>42</b> is disposed on the fitting surface <b>4121</b>, and the signal amplifier <b>43</b> and the AID converter <b>44</b> are disposed on the FPC board <b>411</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the signal processing module <b>60</b> is coupled with the signal amplifier <b>43</b> and the AID converter <b>44</b> via the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> for receiving and processing the PPG signals to get physiological information of the participant. In detail, the signal processing module <b>60</b> includes a processor <b>61</b> and a wireless transmission module <b>63</b>. The processor <b>61</b> receives the PPG signals and change cycle of the PPG signals and further works out the time interval of each change cycle. Then the processor <b>61</b> describes a continuous variation of waveform and records physiological status of the participant by the HRV analytical method. The wireless transmission module <b>63</b> transmits the continuous variation of waveform and the physiological status of the participant to a display interface <b>70</b>. The physiological status includes PPG curve chart, heart rate, HRV, degree of blood oxygen saturation and so on. The signal processing module <b>60</b> further includes at least one connector <b>62</b> capable of transmitting the continuous variation of waveform and the physiological status of the participant to the display interface <b>70</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The display interface <b>70</b> can be a portable electronic product, such as a smart phone and a smart watch. According to the physiological information provided by the physiological function detecting earphone <b>1</b>, the display interface <b>70</b> can instantly change the types of music to make the music change along with the physiological status of the participant.</p>

According to the characteristics of the invisible light source <b>422</b>, degree of blood oxygen saturation can be worked out by comparing reflected signals from the invisible light source <b>422</b> with the reflected light from the visible light source <b>421</b>. It is worth mentioning that the invisible light source <b>422</b> can be omitted when monitoring the heart rate and the HRV.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> again, the physiological function detecting earphone <b>1</b> further includes an accelerometer <b>50</b> disposed on another end face of the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> and facing to another window <b>234</b> of the earplug <b>23</b>. In detail, the accelerometer <b>50</b> is disposed on another fitting surface <b>4121</b> of the connecting frame <b>412</b> of the inner ring spacer <b>41</b> and faces to the inserting board <b>223</b> of the holding frame <b>22</b> and the window <b>234</b> of the earplug <b>23</b>. The accelerometer <b>50</b> is coupled with the signal processing module <b>60</b> for continuously transmitting displacement information to the signal processing module <b>60</b> in use. Then the signal processing module <b>60</b> judges work start point of the light sensing module <b>42</b> and controls on-off states of the light sensing module <b>42</b> according to the displacement information so as to capture appropriate ranges from the PPG signals and further get the physiological information of the participant.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In this invention, the window <b>234</b> of the earplug <b>23</b> and the accelerometer <b>50</b> can effectively eliminate transmittance of light error caused by the manufacturing material of the earplug <b>23</b> and the shaking of the participant. Furthermore, the physiological function detecting earphone <b>1</b> can monitor sleep states of the participant by means of the accelerometer <b>50</b> and the light sensing module <b>42</b>. So, the physiological function detecting earphone <b>1</b> can be further used in patients with sleep apnea so as to send an alarm in case of symptoms.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the cover board <b>221</b> of the holding frame <b>22</b> defines a second sound hole <b>222</b> penetrating through a middle part thereof.

The first sound hole <b>11</b>, the second sound hole <b>222</b>, the third sound hole <b>233</b> and the fourth sound hole <b>4122</b> are in alignment with one another to form a sound track, and the fourth sound hole <b>4122</b> is aligned between the first sound hole <b>11</b> and the second sound hole <b>222</b>. The loudspeaker <b>30</b> is positioned in the earphone body <b>10</b> and faces to the first, fourth, second and third sound holes <b>11</b>, <b>4122</b>, <b>222</b> and <b>233</b>.</p>
