    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a slow cooker and, in particular, to a slow cooker with at least one lid latching arrangement to secure the lid to the cooking vessel and the housing so the slow cooker can be easily transported with little to no spillage of contents therein.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Slow cooker appliances have been broadly used in households since at least the 1970's and are commonly used for a variety of purposes. Slow cookers are convenient ways to cook a wide variety of foods including, but not limited to, soups, stews, dips, chilis, roasts, and other large cuts of meat at a lower temperature for extended periods of time, One benefit of slow cookers is that a user may add all the ingredients for a meal, namely, the meat, starches, vegetables, and so forth, together into one appliance and it will “slow cook” during the day and be ready for consumption at dinner time.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Typically, slow cookers include a ceramic or stoneware cooking vessel received in a metal housing. A transparent glass or plastic lid may be removably mounted on the cooking vessel, The housing may include electronic controls and heating element(s) for heating food stuffs placed within the cooking vessel. The housing generally has handles extending therefrom to allow a user to relatively easily grasp and move the slow cooker. Often, the user may want to move the slow cooker after it is loaded with the food stuffs to be cooked.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">One drawback commonly associated with slow cookers is that the lids are not securely engaged to the cooking vessel and the housing. As such, the lid may slide off the cooking vessel when the slow cooker is being transported allowing foodstuffs to spill from the cooking vessel. Accordingly, there is a need to secure the lid to cooking vessel and housing to prevent spillage during transport.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In an embodiment, there is provided a cooking appliance including a housing, a cooking vessel having a rim, the cooking vessel being configured to be removably nestable within the housing. A lid is configured to removably cover the cooking vessel when seated on the rim. A heating element powered by a power source for heating a food product is positioned within an interior of the cooking vessel. At least one latch is disposed on the lid and a complementary engagement member disposed on a sidewall of the housing configured to selectively retain the lid lid in sealing engagement with the rim and the housing to inhibit leakage of the food stuffs from the interior of the cooking vessel. The at least one latch includes a base attached to the lid, a rotating arm having a cammed head at one end that engages the base, a rod pivotally connected to the cammed head on one end and having a foot disposed at an opposite end, the rod passing through an aperture in the base, an engagement member attached to the sidewall of the housing. The cammed head engages the pivoting arm as the pivoting arm is rotated to cause an axial displacement of the rod, and in a latched configuration the rod is pulled in a first direction causing the foot of the rod to engage the engagement member, and in an unlatched configuration the rod is urged in a second direction causing the foot of the rod to be released from the engagement member.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In an embodiment, there is provided a slow cooking appliance including a housing, a cooking vessel having a rim, the cooking vessel being configured to be removably nestable within the housing, and a lid configured to removably cover the cooking vessel when seated on the rim. A heating element is powered by a power source for heating a food product positioned within an interior of the cooking vessel. A pair of latches are disposed on opposing sides of the lid and each having a complementary engagement member disposed on opposing sides of a sidewall of the housing configured to selectively retain the lid in sealing engagement with the rim and the housing to inhibit leakage of the food stuffs from the interior of the cooking vessel. Each of the latches includes a base attached to the lid, a rotating arm having a cammed head at one end that engages the base, and a rod pivotally connected to the cammed head on one end and having a stop member disposed at an opposite end. The rod passes through an aperture in the base, and a u-shaped bracket is attached to the sidewall of the housing. The cammed head engages the rotating arm as the rotating arm is rotated to cause an axial displacement of the rod, and in a latched configuration the rod is pulled in a first direction causing the stop member of the rod to be urged against an underside of the u-shaped bracket securing the lid to the rim, and in an unlatched configuration the rod is urged in a second direction releasing the stop member from the underside of the u-shaped bracket releasing the lid from the rim.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The following detailed description of the present invention references the accompanying drawing figures that illustrate specific embodiments in which the invention can be practiced. The embodiments are intended to describe aspects of the present invention in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments can be utilized and changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The present invention is defined by the appended claims and, therefore, the description is not to be taken in a limiting sense and shall not limit the scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Slow cooker appliances such as that disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, the slow cookers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,740,855, 6,587,739 and 7,312,425, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The slow cooker of the present invention includes at least one but preferably two opposing lid latching arrangements connected to the lid for securing the lid to the slow cooker cooking vessel and housing during transport to prevent spillage.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>, there is illustrated a slow cooker <b>10</b> including, but not limited to, a housing <b>12</b>, a cooking vessel <b>16</b> seated within the housing <b>12</b>, and a lid <b>18</b> configured to removably seat on and cover cooking vessel <b>16</b>. As best shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> includes a sidewall <b>20</b> and a bottom wall <b>22</b>. The housing <b>12</b> further includes at least one heating element <b>38</b> positioned between the cooking vessel <b>16</b> and the bottom wall <b>22</b> and/or the sidewall <b>20</b>. The housing <b>12</b> may be comprised of a wide variety of materials including aluminum, stainless steel, copper, or any other known commercial alloy or other suitable material. The sidewall <b>20</b> and the bottom wall <b>22</b> are beneficial in transferring heat from housing <b>12</b> to the cooking vessel <b>16</b>. Other similar and functionally equivalent materials now known or hereafter developed may be used for both the sidewall <b>20</b> and the bottom wall <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In an embodiment, a control panel <b>44</b> may be coupled to the sidewall <b>20</b> as shown. In the illustrated embodiment, the control panel <b>44</b> includes a plurality of electronic controls including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: an on/off switch, a timer, a cooking mode indicator, and a cooking mode switch. Slow cooker <b>10</b> is generally a standard plug-in type electrical cooking device which includes a power cord (not shown). It is however also recognized and anticipated that slow cooker <b>10</b> could be configured to be alternatively powered by some other power source. The On/Off switch turns slow cooker <b>10</b> on and off. The timer <b>48</b> may display the current time, the remaining cooking time, the actual cooking time, and/or other timer or clock features now known or hereafter developed. The cooking mode indicator displays which cooking mode or temperature range has been selected by a user through the cooking mode switch. Common examples are: low, medium, high, or warm. One embodiment includes indicators which are designated as “HI,” “LO,” and “WM.”</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Alternatively, the cooking mode indicator may display an actual cooking temperature and/or time duration to be selected by the user. The cooking mode indicator may also include an indication of cooking time ranges associated with each cooking temperature range. For example, the control panel <b>44</b> may include a cooking mode indicator that displays several operating times for each of the HI and LO settings such as preset times of 4 hours and 6 hours for the HI setting, and 8 hours and 10 hours for the LO setting. In one embodiment, slow cooker <b>10</b> may operate at a high temperature for about four (4) hours and then switch to a warming mode. One embodiment may also include a warming mode that is either (1) activated after the completion of the selected cooking mode and time duration, or (2) a separate setting chosen by the user. Still further, the mode indicator may be an LED or other light positioned next to the written description of the cooking mode, time or temperature. It is recognized and anticipated that still other settings may be used and any configuration of preset times and cooking temperatures may be incorporated into control panel <b>44</b> and slow cooker <b>10</b> and all such variations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Referring in particular now to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in an embodiment the housing <b>12</b> may include u-shaped brackets <b>60</b> or other engagement members <b>60</b> that are configured to engage one or more of the latching arrangements <b>152</b> associated with the lid <b>18</b> for securing the lid <b>18</b> to the housing <b>12</b> as will be further described below. As further illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the lid <b>18</b> includes an outer surface <b>134</b>, an inner surface <b>136</b>, an annular rim <b>138</b>, and a handle <b>140</b>. The annular rim <b>138</b> of the lid <b>18</b> is configured to rest upon a rim <b>17</b> of the cooking vessel <b>16</b>. When the annular rim <b>138</b> of the lid <b>18</b> rests upon the rim <b>17</b>, the cooking vessel <b>16</b> is substantially enclosed thereby capturing neat and moisture which assists the cooking process. The handle <b>140</b> may be coupled to or otherwise attached to the outer surface <b>134</b> of lid <b>18</b> through the use of a fastener (not shown). Another embodiment (not shown) may include a lid <b>18</b> having the handle <b>140</b> integrally formed therewith.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The lid <b>18</b> may further include at least one latching arrangement <b>152</b> and preferably two latching arrangements <b>152</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> on diametrically opposing sides of the lid <b>18</b> proximate the annular rim <b>17</b> of the cooking vessel <b>16</b>. Each lid latching arrangement <b>152</b> may include a base <b>154</b> secured to the lid <b>18</b> with a fastener which may be any type of fastener such as a rivet, screw, adhesive, etc., as is known to one of ordinary skill. The base <b>154</b> may include an angled cantilever portion <b>155</b> extending over the rim <b>17</b> of the cooking vessel <b>16</b>. The base <b>154</b> may also include an annular portion <b>156</b> formed in the cantilever portion <b>155</b> for receiving and allowing a. tie down rod <b>160</b> to pass therethrough. The tie down rod <b>160</b> is preferably formed from a food grade material including but not limited to plastic, metal, or an elastomer. A first end <b>162</b> of the tie down rod <b>160</b> may be pivotally secured to a lever <b>157</b> with a pin <b>159</b> inserted into a bore formed in the lever <b>157</b>. Another bore in the first end <b>162</b> of tie down <b>160</b> receives the pin <b>157</b> for pivotally securing the tie down rod <b>160</b> to the lever <b>157</b> and the tie down rode <b>160</b>. The lever <b>157</b> includes a cammed portion <b>158</b> which facilitates securing the lid <b>18</b> to the housing <b>12</b> as described in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">A foot or stop member <b>165</b> is connected to an opposite end or second end <b>163</b> of the tie down rod <b>160</b>. The foot <b>165</b> of the tie down rod <b>160</b> engages a cutout portion <b>63</b> of a u-shaped bracket <b>60</b> attached to the housing <b>12</b>. The foot <b>165</b> may be square or annular shaped or any other shape. The u-shaped bracket <b>60</b> may be attached to the sidewall <b>20</b> of the housing <b>12</b> by a fastener such as rivet or other means such as welding as is known to one of ordinary skill in the art. When the lever <b>157</b> is moved in the direction of arrow <b>400</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>), the rammed portion <b>158</b> engages the cantilever portion <b>155</b> of the base <b>154</b> to cause an upward axial force to be applied to the tie down rod <b>160</b>. When the lever <b>157</b> is moved to the position shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the movement of the lever <b>157</b> causes the foot <b>165</b> of the tie down rod <b>160</b> to be urged against the underside of the u-shaped bracket <b>60</b> which tightly pulls one side of the lid <b>18</b> against the cooking vessel <b>16</b> and the housing <b>12</b>. Moving the lever <b>157</b> to this position on the latching arrangement <b>152</b> disposed on the opposite side of the lid <b>18</b> similarly causes the lid <b>18</b> to be tightly pulled against the cooking vessel <b>16</b> and the housing <b>12</b> causing a fluid tight seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Oppositely, when the lever <b>157</b> is moved in the opposite direction of arrow <b>400</b> the foot <b>165</b> of the tie down rod <b>160</b> is released from the underside of the u-shaped bracket <b>60</b> releasing the lid <b>18</b> from the cooking vessel <b>16</b> and the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Thus, there has been shown and described several embodiments of a novel slow cooker with a latching arrangement for securing the lid to the cooking vessel and housing. Many changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications of the present invention will, however, become apparent to those skilled in the art after considering this specification and the accompanying drawings. All such drawings, modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention are deemed to be covered by the present invention which is limited only by the claims which follow.</p>
