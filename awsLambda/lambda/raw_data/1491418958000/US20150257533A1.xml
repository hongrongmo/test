In some embodiments, the shelf <b>16</b> can be adjusted both in the horizontal and vertical directions. This provides advantages in that the shelves can be positioned to accommodate other devices or appliances that may be in a user's shower, as well as various sizes of items, such as toiletries, that may be oversized.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The clamping mechanism <b>14</b> can be slidably mounted on the support member <b>12</b> in the vertical or longitudinal direction. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> can have a hook <b>15</b> on both lateral sides that is configured to fit around and engage the outer flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³ of the column <b>12</b>. As described in more detail below, the shelf <b>16</b> can be adjusted, in both the horizontal and vertical directions, when the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> is loosened. When the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> is tightened, the shelf <b>16</b> is secured to the support member <b>12</b> in a fixed position. Thus, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> can be configured to hold the shelf <b>16</b> in place when the shelf <b>16</b> is loaded with the maximum design weight, and in wet environments, such as a shower.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> can include a clamp body <b>20</b>, clamp plate <b>22</b>, and clamp lever <b>24</b>. The clamp body <b>20</b> can have hooks <b>15</b> on both sides, as noted above, that are configured to hook around and engage the outer flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³ of the support member <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The clamp body <b>20</b> can include a slot <b>21</b> configured to receive the clamp plate <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the slot <b>21</b> can be configured to support the clamp plate <b>22</b> within the slot, as described in greater detail below with reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The clamp plate <b>22</b> can be a generally flat member that is configured to fit through the slot <b>21</b> in the clamp body <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 3-5</figref><i>c</i>, the clamp plate <b>22</b> can be configured to engage at least one cross member <b>30</b> of the shelf <b>16</b>. For example, the clamp plate <b>22</b> can have upper and lower shoulders <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>or rounded portions that are shaped to engage cross members <b>30</b> of the shelf <b>16</b> when the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> is in the âclosedâ position (as explained in more detail below).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In some embodiments, the clamp plate <b>22</b> can be configured to engage the slot <b>21</b> so as to prevent the clamp plate <b>22</b> from falling through the slot <b>21</b>, for example, when the clamp mechanism <b>14</b> is open. For example, with reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, the clamp plate <b>22</b> can include at least one shoulder configured to rest against a corresponding shoulder in or around the slot <b>21</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">In some embodiments, the plate <b>22</b> can include shoulders <b>23</b>. The shoulders <b>23</b> can be arranged to protrude outwardly from the main portion of the clamp plate <b>22</b>. The clamp body <b>20</b> can include shoulders <b>25</b> configured to rest against the shoulders <b>23</b> so as to prevent the clamp plate <b>22</b> from falling through the clamp body <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 3 and 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c</i>, a lever <b>24</b> can be rotatably mounted relative to the clamp body <b>20</b>. The lever <b>24</b> can be configured to move between open (or unlocked) and closed (or locked) positions. For example, the lever <b>24</b> can be configured to secure the shelf <b>16</b> to the support member <b>12</b> when the lever <b>24</b> is in the closed position and to allow the shelf <b>16</b> to be moved when the lever <b>24</b> is in the open position. In some embodiments, the clamp lever <b>24</b> can be formed of a translucent polycarbonate. The lever <b>24</b> may be formed of other suitable materials, such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum, plastics, or any other material</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In some embodiments, the lever <b>24</b> can include a cam <b>26</b> configured to convert the pivotal movement of the lever <b>24</b> into a translational movement of the clamp plate <b>22</b>. For example, the lever <b>24</b> can be hinged or otherwise pivotally mounted relative to the clamp body <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the cam <b>26</b> can include at least a first portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>having a radius R<b>1</b> and a second portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>with a radius R<b>2</b>, R<b>2</b> being larger than R<b>1</b>. As such, when the lever <b>24</b> is rotated such that the first portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>, the clamp device <b>14</b> is in the open position. When the lever <b>24</b> is rotated such that the second portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>, the clamp device <b>14</b> is in the closed position. These movements are described below in greater detail with reference to <figref>FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>c. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">In some embodiments, the cam <b>26</b> can include a third portion <b>26</b><i>c </i>having a radius R<b>3</b> which is larger than radius R<b>2</b>. As such, the cam <b>26</b> can be configured to provide an âover-centerâ operation. For example, with the radius R<b>3</b> being larger than both the radiuses R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, the cam <b>26</b> will generate a maximum pressing force against the clamp plate <b>22</b> when the third portion <b>26</b><i>c </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>. However, as is described below in greater detail, this pressing force is reduced as the lever <b>24</b> is further pivoted until the second portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>. This provides an advantage in that the user is provided with a tactile signal that the lever <b>24</b> has been moved to the fully closed position. The lever <b>24</b> can move quickly from the intermediate position in which the third portion <b>26</b><i>c </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b> to the fully closed position in which the second portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref>
        <i>a </i>shows the lever <b>24</b> in the closed position, which is when the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> is tightened to hold the shelf <b>16</b> in place. In this closed position, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b> is secured to the support member <b>12</b> by the pressing force caused by the second portion <b>26</b><i>b </i>of the cam <b>26</b> pushing against the clamp plate <b>22</b>, which, in turn, pushes the clamp plate <b>22</b> against an outer surface of the support member <b>12</b>. This pressing force also causes the hooks <b>15</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) of the clamp body <b>20</b> to press against and tighten around the flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³ (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) of the support member <b>12</b>. In the âclosedâ position, the shoulders of the clamp plate <b>22</b> engage the cross members <b>30</b> of the shelf <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, and thus press the cross members <b>30</b> against the outer face of the support member <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">The pressure between the shoulders <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the clamp plate <b>22</b> and the cross members <b>30</b> as well as the pressure between the hooks <b>15</b> of the clamp body <b>20</b> and the outer flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³ of the support member <b>12</b> secure the shelf <b>16</b> in place in both the horizontal and vertical directions. As such, the magnitude of the radius R<b>2</b> can be determined so as to provide a sufficient pressing force against the clamp plate <b>22</b> such that the friction between at least one of the cross members <b>30</b>, the outer surface of the support member <b>12</b>, the inner surface of the flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³, and the hooks <b>15</b> is sufficient to support the shelf <b>16</b> at the desired location under a maximum load. However, other devices can also be used to secure the shelves <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">When the lever <b>24</b> is in the open position, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>, the first portion <b>26</b><i>a</i>, having the radius R<b>1</b>, is juxtaposed to the clamp plate <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the magnitude of the radius R<b>1</b> is sufficiently small that the shelf <b>16</b> can be adjusted, both vertically and horizontally, when the lever <b>24</b> is in this position.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">A user may âopenâ the lever <b>24</b> by pulling it generally in the direction of arrow A, away from the clamp plate <b>22</b> and the column <b>12</b>. When the lever <b>24</b> is pulled in this direction, the cam <b>26</b> rotates in a clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>) and thus pulls away from the clamp plate <b>22</b> as the first portion <b>26</b><i>a </i>is moved into juxtaposition with the clamp plate <b>22</b>. When the cam <b>26</b> is pulled away from the clamp plate <b>22</b>, the tension is reduced and the shelf <b>16</b> may be adjusted by a user, both vertically and horizontally.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">This arrangement provides various advantages. For example, with reference to <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>, the upper most shelf <b>16</b> is illustrated in its centered position (where the geometric center of the shelf <b>16</b> is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the support member <b>12</b>). By configuring the shelving system to allow the shelves to be adjusted laterally, the shelves can be rearranged to accommodate differing sizes of articles. For example, with continued reference to <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>, the shelf below the upper most shelf <b>16</b>, identified generally as shelf <b>16</b><i>a</i>, has been laterally adjusted towards the right hand side of the figure (in the direction of arrow R). In this configuration, a tall item I can be placed on shelf <b>16</b><i>a </i>without impacting the upper most shelf <b>16</b>. For example, such tall items can be large shampoo bottles of the type that are commonly sold in discount warehouse retail stores. When adjacent shelves are shifted in opposite directions, an even larger space can be provided. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>d</i>, the shelf <b>16</b><i>b </i>which is below the shelf <b>16</b><i>a</i>, has been adjusted toward the left hand side of the figure (in the direction of arrow L). In such a configuration, an even larger tall item J can be supported on the shelf <b>16</b><i>b </i>without impacting the shelf <b>16</b><i>a </i>above the shelf <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">In operation, to adjust a shelf <b>16</b> in the lateral direction, a user can pivot the lever <b>24</b> toward the open position (<figref>FIG. 5</figref><i>c</i>), thereby reducing pressure on the clamp plate <b>22</b>, which in turn, reduces the pressure between the cross wires <b>30</b> and the outer face of the support member <b>12</b> and as well as the pressure between the hooks <b>15</b> and the flanges <b>12</b>â², <b>12</b>â³ (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>). With the lever <b>24</b> positioned as such, a user can slide the shelves <b>16</b> relative to the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the shower caddy <b>10</b> can be fitted with an openable loop mechanism <b>18</b> at the top of the support member <b>12</b>. The openable loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be configured to support the weight of the shower caddy <b>10</b> from a shower head (not shown) or a pipe <b>50</b> leading to a shower head. For example, the openable loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be fitted onto the pipe <b>50</b> when it is in an open position (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>), then closed to secure it in place, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In various embodiments, the loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be attached to the upper end of the support member <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be hinged. For example, in some embodiments, the loop mechanism can include a first portion <b>18</b>A pivotally connected to a second portion <b>18</b>B. In some embodiments, the pivotal connection between the first and second portions can be provided by a hinge <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">The hinge <b>40</b> can be configured to allow the loop mechanism <b>18</b> to open, as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be secured by closing the first portion <b>18</b>A over the shower head pipe <b>50</b> and by tightening a threaded screw <b>42</b> in the corresponding threaded opening (not shown). However, other fasteners, devices, or mechanisms can also be used to secure the first portion <b>18</b>A in the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">With reference to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, some embodiments have a resilient member on at least a portion of an inner periphery of the loop mechanism <b>18</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the loop mechanism <b>18</b> can be fitted with a resilient member, such as deformable members <b>46</b> on the inner periphery of the loop mechanism <b>18</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The deformable member <b>46</b> can be made from one or a plurality of pieces. The deformable members <b>46</b> can be made from any resilient material. In some embodiments, the deformable member <b>46</b> is made from rubber. These deformable members <b>46</b> can be shaped and tapered such that it fits snugly around a standard shower head pipe <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">In some embodiments, a lower portion of the member <b>46</b> is tapered. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a bottom of the deformable member <b>46</b> is tapered. Such a taper can provide better contact with a surface of a generally vertically or laterally curved or slanted attachment point of the shower caddy <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">In some embodiments, the tapered shape of the lower portion <b>46</b>A can be configured to compliment the typical downwardly curved contour of a shower head pipe that emerges from a shower wall <b>52</b>, such as the shower head pipe <b>50</b>. Such tapering of the lower portion <b>46</b>A can allow the shower caddy <b>10</b> to hang more straightly. For example, without the taper in the lower portion <b>46</b>A, the lower surface of the pipe <b>50</b> would generate more pressure on a forward portion <b>46</b>B of the lower portion <b>46</b>A. This would generate a torque on the shower caddy <b>10</b>, tending to pivot the shower caddy <b>10</b> in the direction of arrow P inwardly toward the shower wall <b>52</b>. The contact patch between such an untapered member <b>46</b> would be smaller thereby weakening the grip between the member <b>46</b> and the pipe <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the member <b>46</b> can be thinner at the top of the loop mechanism <b>18</b> as compared to the lower portion <b>46</b>A. This can help to reduce bouncing of the shower caddy <b>10</b> when it is hung from the loop mechanism <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">A typical shower head pipe <b>50</b> has an outer diameter of about 0.8 inch. In some embodiments, the loop mechanism <b>18</b> has a minimum inner diameter D of about 0.74 inch when the member <b>46</b> is in a relaxed state, e.g., when the shower caddy <b>10</b> is not installed on a shower pipe <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. Because the inner diameter D of the loop mechanism <b>18</b> is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of a typical shower pipe <b>50</b>, the rubber inserts <b>46</b> will deform slightly and fit snugly around the shower pipe <b>50</b> when the loop mechanism <b>18</b> is fitted around the shower pipe <b>50</b>. Friction between the rubber inserts <b>46</b> and the shower head pipe <b>50</b> can help to keep the shower caddy <b>10</b> in place by resisting relative movement between the two, thereby preventing the shower caddy <b>10</b> from sliding down the pipe <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">This snug fit is particularly useful for stabilizing the shower caddy <b>10</b> on a shower pipe <b>50</b> when the weight of items (e.g., shampoo, soap, etc.) kept on the shelves <b>16</b> is not distributed evenly. It has been found that conventional shower caddies do not adequately resist sliding off a shower pipe. Conventional shower caddies configured to hang on a shower pipe are typically hung over the shower head pipe with a portion of a wire frame of the caddy and thus may be easily knocked off, either by a user or uneven weight distribution of articles stored on the shower caddy. By providing a hinged loop mechanism <b>18</b> at the top of the shower caddy <b>10</b>, the shower caddy <b>10</b> can be more securely and stably attached to a shower head pipe.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">In the illustrated embodiment, the shelves <b>16</b> are formed with cross-members <b>30</b> extending horizontally across and curved at the ends of the shelves <b>16</b> in a substantially semi-circular or generally âUâ shape, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 9</figref>. As shown in the drawings, the shelves <b>16</b> can have different configurations. For example, the shelves <b>16</b> can be simple shelves having drainage holes or may be additionally fitted with a soap tray <b>60</b>, towel rack <b>70</b>, openings <b>80</b> for toiletries, and other accessories (e.g., hooks, etc.). Embodiments of a soap tray <b>60</b>, towel rack <b>70</b>, and openings <b>80</b> for toiletries are shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In the illustrated embodiment, the shelves <b>16</b> are configured as a wire basket, as shown in the drawings, to allow for drainage. However, the shelves may have different configurations other than those illustrated.</p>

There may be alternative embodiments for the soap tray <b>60</b>, towel rack <b>70</b>, and openings <b>80</b> for toiletries and that the embodiments shown in the drawings are merely example embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">In some embodiments, the baskets of each shelf <b>16</b>, <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, can be formed of polished stainless steel wire. In certain embodiments, the frame of the basket, including the cross members <b>30</b>, can be formed of 6 mm polished stainless steel wire. The remainder of the baskets can be formed of 3 mm polished stainless steel wire.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">In some embodiments, other accessories <b>100</b> (e.g., in the form of disks) can be attached to the shower caddy <b>10</b>. The accessories <b>100</b> can be formed in the shape of disks having a groove <b>110</b> on the peripheral edge. The width of the groove <b>110</b> can be about the same or slightly larger than the outer diameter of the wire forming the substantially semi-circular or U-shaped portions on the ends of the shelves <b>16</b> so that the wire of the substantially semi-circular portion fits within the groove <b>110</b>. The accessories <b>100</b> are sized and shaped to fit in the substantially semi-circular portion, as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The grooves <b>110</b> can be configured to âsnapâ into place in the substantially semi-circular portion of the shelves <b>16</b> by engaging the wire of the substantially semi-circular portion. The cross-members <b>30</b> of the shelves <b>16</b> may be pulled apart slightly by the user to snap the accessories <b>100</b> in place. The substantially semi-circular portion of the shelves <b>16</b> are preferably greater than or equal to 180 degrees to facilitate insertion of the accessories disks <b>100</b>. The accessories <b>100</b> can be formed of a strong, rigid material, such as polycarbonate. However, the accessories <b>100</b> can be made from a variety of other suitable materials and in a variety of known manners.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">In some embodiments, the shower caddy <b>10</b> can be secured to the shower wall <b>52</b> with an attachment mechanism <b>92</b>. As shown, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b> can be positioned at a bottom end of the shower caddy <b>10</b>. This can inhibit or prevent movement (e.g., tilting) of the shower caddy <b>10</b>, such as if a user accidentally bumps the caddy <b>10</b> or if the weight of items stored on the caddy <b>10</b> is shifted to one lateral side.</p>

      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, the shelves <b>16</b>A can have a wedge or pie-shaped configuration. This provides a more compact arrangement when the shower caddy <b>10</b>A is mounted in a bathtub or shower corner that has walls that meet at a 90Â° angle. In such an environment, the wedge or pie-shaped configuration of the shelves <b>16</b>A allows the shower caddy <b>10</b>A to be tucked compactly into such a 90Â° corner. The shelves <b>16</b>A can include accessories that are similar to or the same as various other accessories described above with reference to the shower caddy <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">As noted above, the shelves <b>16</b>A can be secured to the support member <b>12</b>A with clamping mechanisms <b>14</b>A. The clamping mechanisms <b>14</b>A can be the same or similar to the clamping mechanisms <b>14</b> described above in detail with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>. In various embodiments, the shelves <b>16</b>A can be moved vertically along the vertical length of the support member <b>12</b>A. The shelves <b>16</b>A can be adjusted in a lateral direction relative to the vertical direction of the support member <b>12</b>A.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 18-21</figref>, the wash towel drying racks <b>140</b> can be configured, as noted above, to be engageable with the support member <b>12</b>A. In various embodiments, the drying racks <b>140</b> can be connected to and easily removed from the support members <b>12</b> or <b>12</b>A. As such, a user can quickly and conveniently change the configuration of the shower caddies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A to include or exclude such drying racks <b>140</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">In the illustrated embodiment, the drying rack <b>140</b> comprises a clamping mechanism <b>142</b> and one or a plurality of rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. The rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> can have any configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are configured to support a hanging article, such as a wet wash cloth. In the illustrated embodiment, the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are made from rod shaped material with enlarged end portions <b>164</b>, <b>166</b> to prevent the hanging article from inadvertently sliding off of the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. In certain embodiments, the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> can be made from a metal material, such as stainless steel.</p>

The main body member can support one or a plurality of pivot pins <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>. The pivot pins <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> can be used to pivotally support the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>. In some embodiments, the pivot pins <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> support clamp members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b>. As such, the pivot pins <b>172</b>, <b>174</b> can provide pivotal support for both the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> and the clamp members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">With reference to <figref>FIG. 20</figref>, the clamp members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> can include control ends <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and engagement ends <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, respectively. The control ends <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> can be configured to allow a user to control the movement of the engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>. For example, the control portions <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> can be shaped such that a user can comfortably grasp these portions <b>180</b>, <b>182</b>, optionally with one hand, and squeeze them toward each other in the direction of arrows A in <figref>FIG. 20</figref> thereby causing the engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> to move away from the support member <b>12</b>A in the direction of arrows B. In some embodiments, the control ends <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> are connected with the engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>, respectively with pivot portions <b>190</b>, <b>192</b>. The pivot portions <b>190</b>, <b>192</b> can comprise an opening configured to receive the pins <b>172</b>, <b>174</b>. In some embodiments, the pivot portions <b>190</b>, <b>192</b> are made integrally or monolithically with the corresponding control portions <b>180</b>, <b>182</b> and engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">In some embodiments, the members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> can be biased toward the closed position, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>. For example, springs, such as torsional springs (not shown) can be provided in or adjacent to the pivot portions <b>190</b>, <b>192</b> to bias the members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> toward the closing direction. More specifically, such springs can bias the members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> such that the engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> are biased toward a position in which the engaging portions <b>184</b>, <b>186</b> extend into the channels by the outer flanges <b>12</b>Aa, <b>12</b>Ab. Further, the springs (not shown) can be configured to bias the members <b>176</b>, <b>178</b> at such with sufficient force to maintain the drying rack <b>140</b> in its vertical position along the support member <b>12</b>A even when one or a plurality of wet articles, such as wet wash clothes, are hanging from the rack members <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 22-33</figref>
        <i>a </i>illustrate embodiments of another shower caddy <b>10</b>B. In many respects, the shower caddy <b>10</b>B resembles or is identical to either or both of the shower caddies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A discussed above. As such, components of the shower caddy <b>10</b>B that are the same or similar to the corresponding components of the shower caddy <b>10</b> and/or <b>10</b>A are identified below with the same reference numerals except that a letter âBâ has been added thereto. The shower caddy <b>10</b>B can include one, some, or all of the features of the shower caddy <b>10</b> and/or <b>10</b>A, including all combinations and sub-combinations. Any component or step disclosed in any embodiment in this specification can be used in any other embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">With reference to <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, the shower caddy <b>10</b>B can include an elongated support member <b>12</b>B and at least one shelf <b>16</b>B. As shown, the shower caddy <b>10</b>B can include an openable loop mechanism <b>18</b>B configured to support the weight of the shower caddy <b>10</b>B from a shower head (not shown) or a pipe leading to a shower head. In some implementations, the caddy <b>10</b>B includes a soap tray <b>60</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">In various embodiments, the support member <b>12</b>B and/or the shelf <b>16</b>B are adjustable. For example, in certain implementations, an elongate length of the support member <b>12</b>B is configured to be selectable and/or variable, such as by telescoping. For example, the support member <b>12</b>B can include an outer portion <b>12</b>Bâ² and an inner portion <b>12</b>Bâ³ that can be received in, and slide relative to, the outer portion <b>12</b>Bâ². In some variants, the length of the support member <b>12</b>B is fixed (e.g., does not include a telescoping feature).</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In some embodiments, the shelf <b>16</b>B can move along the support member <b>12</b>B. For example, in some variants, the shelf <b>16</b>B can slide generally parallel with a longitudinal axis of the support member <b>12</b>B (e.g., generally vertically in the embodiment illustrated). In certain implementations, the shelf <b>16</b>B can move generally perpendicular to the support member <b>12</b>B (e.g., generally horizontally in the embodiment illustrated). In some embodiments, the shelf <b>16</b>B can be selectively secured with the support member <b>12</b>B, such as with the clamping mechanism described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">As shown in <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, the shelf <b>16</b>B can include at least one accessory <b>100</b>B. In certain embodiments, the accessory <b>100</b>B is configured to secure to one end of the shelf <b>16</b>B, such as a lateral end of the shelf <b>16</b>B. For example, the accessory <b>100</b>B can be secured with an interference fit between the accessory <b>100</b>B and the frame of the shelf <b>16</b>B. The illustrated accessory <b>100</b>B is generally rectangular, though various shapes are contemplated as well, such as circular (see <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In some embodiments, the accessory <b>100</b>B includes one or more supports <b>190</b>, such as hooks, loops, ledges, partial openings, cups, cavities, containers, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 22</figref><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the shower caddy <b>10</b>B can include one or more clamping mechanisms <b>14</b>B. The clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B can secure the shelf <b>16</b>D with the support member <b>12</b>B. For example, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B can include one or more fasteners (e.g., screws, bolts, nuts, toggles, cotter pins, etc.) that engage the support member <b>12</b>B. As discussed in more detail below, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B can include a rail with flanges that engage a corresponding track <b>12</b>Ba with flanges on the support member <b>12</b>B. In various embodiments, tightening the fasteners secures the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>B. In some variants, loosening the fasteners loosens the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>B, thereby allowing the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>B and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to move relative to the support member <b>12</b>B (e.g., to allow adjustment of the vertical and horizontal position of the shelf <b>16</b>D).</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 23-26</figref>, the accessory <b>100</b>B can include a divider <b>194</b> configured to selectively divide a portion of the shelf <b>16</b>B. This can facilitate securing and/or sequestering certain articles in a space at least partially divided from the rest of the shelf <b>16</b>B. In some embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> can aid in maintaining certain elongate articles in a generally vertical orientation, rather than a horizontal orientation, which can provide additional space for further articles. For example, in certain embodiments, an elongate article (e.g., an electric razor) stowed in the divided portion can be maintained an angle relative to a horizontal plane of at least about: 45Â°, 60Â°, 75Â°, 80Â°, 85Â°, values between the aforementioned values, or otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">The divider <b>194</b> can move between first and second positions relative to the accessory <b>100</b>B and/or with respect to the frame of the shelf <b>16</b>B. For example, the divider <b>194</b> can rotate between retracted and extended positions. In the retracted position, such as is shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, the divider <b>194</b> is generally nested with the accessory <b>100</b>B and/or substantially does not extend into the volume of the shelf <b>16</b>B for holding articles. In some variants, the divider <b>194</b> is substantially flush with a surface of accessory <b>100</b>B in the retracted position. In some embodiments, the retracted position occurs when rotatable divider <b>194</b> is brought into contact with at least one surface of accessory <b>100</b>B. When in the retracted position, divider <b>194</b> generally does not obstruct the open space of shelf <b>16</b>B. In some embodiments, the surface of accessory <b>100</b>B includes a groove or recessed area designed to correspond to and receive at least a portion of divider <b>194</b> when the divider <b>194</b> is in the retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">In certain embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> comprises a bar or wire. In some implementations, the divider <b>194</b> has a generally U-shaped configuration. In some embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> is shaped substantially as a rectangle. In some embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> may be shaped as a semicircle or at least a portion of its length may be shaped as a semicircle. In some embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> is shaped to accommodate any number of suitable accessories that may be stored on the shelf <b>16</b>B, such as an electric razor, travel-size bottles (e.g., of shampoo), or otherwise. In various embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> includes at least one end <b>196</b> that is configured to be secured to the accessory <b>100</b>B. For example, the end <b>196</b> can be shaped as a prong that is configured to be inserted into a corresponding opening or recess in the accessory <b>100</b>B, as is discussed in greater detail below. In some embodiments, the divider <b>194</b> is shaped so as to be flush with the accessory <b>100</b>B or so as to conform to the shape of the shelf <b>16</b>B, such that it occupies no more space than necessary, or at least a reduced amount of space, when in a retracted position. As shown in <figref>FIG. 24</figref>, in the retracted position, the divider <b>194</b> does not protrude into the available shelving space on the shelf <b>16</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">As shown in <figref>FIG. 25</figref>, the divider <b>194</b> has at least three sections. In some embodiments, each of the sections can be characterized as occupying a different plane. In some embodiments, section <b>194</b><i>a </i>occupies a first plane, section <b>194</b><i>b </i>occupies a second plane (e.g., a plane generally orthogonal to the first plane), and section <b>194</b><i>c </i>occupies a third plane (e.g., a plane generally orthogonal to the second plane and/or generally parallel to the first plane). In some embodiments, during movement of the divider <b>194</b> between the extended and retracted positions, each plane rotates about a pivot located on the accessory <b>100</b>B. In certain variants, each end of the divider <b>194</b> includes the first, second and third sections <b>194</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In some implementations, the divider <b>194</b> includes a cross-member <b>195</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">When the divider <b>194</b> is in the retracted position (see <figref>FIG. 24</figref>), the first plane may be substantially parallel with a surface of the accessory <b>100</b>B. In some embodiments, the first plane is near, adjacent, or coexistent with a surface of accessory <b>100</b>B. In some embodiments, section <b>194</b><i>b </i>is long enough to allow section <b>194</b><i>a </i>to be substantially flush with a surface of the accessory <b>100</b>B while also providing rotatable divider <b>194</b> with adequate support from the accessory <b>100</b>B. When the divider <b>194</b> is in an extended position, the first plane extends from the accessory <b>100</b>B at a substantially right angle (see <figref>FIG. 26</figref>) and/or is generally horizontal. In this position, section <b>194</b><i>a </i>is able to enclose or support one or more items, such as a razor, an electric razor, a mechanical facial cleanser, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">In various embodiments, the portions of the divider <b>194</b> interact with and/or are received in the accessory <b>100</b>B. For example, the accessory <b>100</b>B can include a support structure <b>197</b> configured to interact with section <b>194</b><i>b </i>and/or to receive section <b>194</b><i>c </i>of the divider <b>194</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, the support structure <b>197</b> can include a recess or hole <b>200</b>, a groove <b>202</b>, and a detent structure <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the accessory <b>100</b>B includes two corresponding support structures <b>198</b>. The shape and depth of the recess or hole <b>200</b> is configured to receive the end <b>196</b> of section <b>194</b><i>c</i>. This can allow the recess or hole <b>200</b> to act as a pivot location for the divider <b>194</b>. In some embodiments, the groove <b>202</b> is shaped so as to correspond or accommodate to section <b>194</b><i>b </i>and at least a portion of section <b>194</b><i>a </i>of divider <b>194</b> when the divider is in the extended position. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, in some implementations, at least a portion of the groove <b>202</b> is shaped substantially as an âL.â</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">In some embodiments, the accessory <b>100</b>B includes a securing structure, such as a detent structure <b>204</b>, that is configured to secure and/or support the divider <b>194</b> in the extended position. In certain implementations, the detent structure <b>204</b> is located at the intersection of the two segments of the L-shaped groove <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the detent structure <b>204</b> is located toward the end of one of the segments of the L-shaped groove <b>202</b>. The detent structure <b>204</b> is shown as including a ledge <b>206</b> and a slope <b>208</b>, though it will be understood that other configurations could be used to adequately support the divider <b>194</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">In some embodiments, when the divider <b>194</b> is moved between the retracted and expanded positions, the divider <b>194</b> engages components of the detent structure <b>204</b>. For example, when the divider <b>194</b> is moved from the retracted position, the segment <b>194</b><i>a </i>can slide along the slope <b>208</b>, can reach the ledge <b>206</b>, and/or can be received in the groove <b>202</b>. In some implementations, a user can grasp the cross-member <b>195</b> and apply a force to rotate the divider <b>194</b> (e.g., generally toward a midpoint of the shelf <b>16</b>B, in the clockwise direction from the position shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, or otherwise). In various embodiments, when the divider <b>194</b> is in the extended position, the ledge <b>206</b> can support the divider <b>194</b>. This can inhibit counter-rotation of the divider <b>194</b> (e.g., to the retracted position) and/or otherwise facilitate maintaining the divider <b>194</b> in the extended position.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">To move the divider <b>194</b> from the extended position to the retracted position, a force can be applied to the divider <b>194</b> to encourage counter-rotation of the divider <b>194</b>. For example, a user can apply force to the cross-member <b>195</b>. In some embodiments, when the divider <b>194</b> is moved from the extended position to the retracted position, the portion of the divider <b>194</b> that is engaged (e.g., abutted) with the ledge <b>206</b> can move over the ledge <b>206</b> and down the slope <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, a greater amount of force is needed to move the divider <b>194</b> from the extended position to the retracted position than to move the divider <b>194</b> from the retracted position to the extended position. In certain variants, a greater amount of initial of force is needed to begin rotating the divider <b>194</b> from the extended position to the retracted position than is needed to begin rotating the divider <b>194</b> from the retracted position to the extended position.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 28-30</figref>, some embodiments of the caddy <b>10</b>B include a container <b>210</b> secured to a shelf <b>16</b>Ba. For example, the container <b>210</b> can be part of a support structure <b>214</b> engaged with the shelf <b>16</b>Ba. In some embodiments, the support structure <b>214</b> is similar or identical to the accessory <b>100</b>B and may be secured to the shelf in a similar manner. In some embodiments, the support structure <b>214</b> includes the divider <b>194</b>. In certain variants, the accessory <b>100</b>B includes the container <b>210</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">As illustrated, in some implementations, the support structure <b>214</b> and the accessory <b>100</b>B are located on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the elongate member <b>12</b>B. This can facilitate balancing the caddy <b>10</b>B. For example, from the vantage of a front elevation view, the accessory <b>100</b>B can be on a right portion of one of the shelves <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>Ba, and the support structure <b>214</b> can be on a left portion of the other of the shelves <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>Ba. In some embodiments, the shelves <b>16</b>B, <b>16</b>Ba each include the accessory <b>100</b>B and the support structure <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">The container <b>210</b> can include an expandable bottom portion <b>212</b>. The illustrated container <b>210</b> has four walls; however, the container <b>210</b> may include any number of walls, both exterior and interior, and may include no walls. In some embodiments, the container <b>210</b> includes a lip (e.g., a bar) around some or all of a top perimeter portion, so as to keep an item (e.g., a razor brush, toothbrush, etc.) contained within the container <b>210</b>. This can reduce or eliminate the need for the container <b>210</b> to have solid walls.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">In some implementations, the container <b>210</b> can have an expandable bottom portion <b>212</b>. In certain embodiments, the extendable bottom portion <b>212</b> can be extended generally downward (e.g., toward a floor of the shower) from the container <b>210</b>. For example, the extendable bottom portion <b>212</b> can include an accordion-like portion, telescoping portion, or other portion configured to facilitate movement of the bottom of the container <b>210</b> between extended and retracted positions. In various implementations, the expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> may be formed of a flexible material, such as silicone, rubber, plastic, or another suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">Certain variants are configured to allow a user to select the amount (e.g., length or volume) of extension of the bottom portion <b>212</b>. For example, the extendable bottom portion <b>212</b> can include discrete positions during the course of extension. In some variants, the expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> is formed of one or more extendable segments, such as multiple nested telescoping sections or multiple nested accordion-like sections.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0149">As shown in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, with the expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> retracted the container can have an overall depth of D<b>1</b>, and with the expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> extended the container can have an overall depth of D<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the ratio of D<b>1</b> to D<b>2</b> is at least about: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, values between the aforementioned values, or otherwise. In some implementations, the expanded bottom portion <b>212</b> provides at least about 12 mm of additional depth for the container <b>210</b>, compared to the depth of the container when the bottom portion <b>212</b> is retracted.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">The expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> can facilitate accommodating elongate items that, absent the extra depth, may more easily fall out of expandable container <b>210</b>, perhaps due to being top heavy. For example, some razors have an elongate portion (e.g., the handle) and a head portion (e.g., the razor portion) that weighs substantially more than the elongate portion. When items of that type are stored in a substantially upright configuration (e.g., in a cup) they tend to fall out if the cup has insufficient depth. The expandable bottom portion <b>212</b> can provide the container <b>210</b> with additional depth, thereby better supporting such elongate items and/or can reducing the likelihood of such items falling out of the container <b>210</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">As shown in <figref>FIG. 30</figref>, the bottom portion <b>212</b> can include slots <b>216</b>, such as openings. This can promote drainage from the container <b>210</b> and/or facilitate drying of the interior of the container <b>210</b> and items stored therein, which can reduce or avoid bacterial and mold growth within the container <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, at least some of slots <b>216</b> have a linear or curved (e.g., wavy) shape. In some variants, the slots <b>216</b> have a shape that is generally circular, ovoid, square, rectangular, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0152">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 31-33</figref>, the shower caddy <b>10</b>B can be secured to a shower wall with an attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B. As illustrated, in some embodiments, the attachment mechanism is located at a bottom of the shower caddy <b>10</b>B, which can promote stability (e.g., inhibit tilting). As shown, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B can include a bracket, which can have one or more arms <b>94</b>B. In some embodiments, attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes wall connection features, such as suction cups <b>90</b>B. As shown, the suction cups <b>90</b>B can be located at opposite ends of the bracket and/or on each of the arms <b>94</b>B.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0153">In various embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B is rotatable about a pivot point such that the suction cups <b>90</b>B can rotate about the pivot point. This can aid in positioning at least one of the suction cups <b>92</b>B relative to a surface to which they can be secured. For example, rotation of the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B can facilitate securing at least one (and preferably both) of the suction cups <b>90</b>B to a smooth surface and/or can aid in avoiding engaging at least one of the suction cups <b>90</b>B with tile edges and/or grout lines. In various embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B is fully rotatable around the pivot point (e.g., can rotate 360Â° around the pivot point).</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0154">In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes a hub <b>218</b> that is separable from the remainder of the caddy <b>10</b>B. According to some embodiments, the separability of the hub <b>218</b> aids in positioning and securing the hub <b>218</b>, as is discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, the caddy <b>10</b>B is configured such that the hub <b>218</b> is installed on the wall of a shower prior to the remainder of the caddy <b>10</b>B being installed. Various embodiments of the hub <b>218</b> are configured to engage with a mating portion <b>223</b> of the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B. For example, at least a portion of the hub <b>218</b> and the mating portion <b>223</b> are magnetically attracted. In some embodiments, one of the hub <b>218</b> and the mating portion <b>223</b> can include a magnet and the other of the hub <b>218</b> and the mating portion <b>223</b> can include a material attracted to the magnet. In certain implementations, the hub <b>218</b> and/or the mating portion <b>223</b> can include a portion made of ferromagnetic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">As shown in <figref>FIG. 32</figref>, the hub <b>218</b> can include a mounting area <b>222</b>. In some embodiments, the mounting area <b>222</b> is configured to receive an adhesive, such as a double sided tape. This can allow a user to secure hub <b>218</b> to a surface, such as a shower wall. In various implementations, the hub <b>218</b> is secured to the surface when the hub <b>218</b> is separated from the remainder of the caddy <b>10</b>B. In some embodiments, the adhesive is water resistant.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">In some embodiments, the hub <b>218</b> includes a recess <b>220</b> that extends around some or all of the mounting area <b>222</b>. The recess <b>220</b> can receive a water-resistant material, such as caulking, silicone, or some other suitable sealant that substantially inhibits or prevents water passage. This can reduce or eliminate water from accessing the adhesive material located on mounting area <b>222</b>, which can increase the life of certain adhesives. In certain variants, the recess <b>220</b> allows the sealant to be hidden, thereby maintaining a cleaner appearance (e.g., compared to applying sealant around the exterior of hub <b>218</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">In certain implementations, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes only the suction cups <b>90</b>B. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes only the hub <b>218</b> and the mating portion <b>223</b>. In some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes both the hub <b>218</b> and the mating portion <b>223</b> as well as the suction cups <b>90</b>B. In embodiments where both are included, rotation of the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B allows for the positioning of the suction cups <b>90</b>B on smooth surfaces, while the adhesive material applied to the mounting area <b>222</b> to secure hub <b>218</b> to a wall may be able to function even if it is located at the edge of a tile, between tiles, or adjacent grout.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">According to some embodiments, the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B includes a distance adjustment unit, such as is shown in <figref>FIGS. 33 and 33</figref><i>a</i>. The distance adjustment unit can be configured to enable a user to adjust the distance between the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B and a shower wall. This can aid in making the distance between the shower caddy <b>10</b>B and the wall substantially uniform along the vertical length of shower caddy <b>10</b>B, which can aid in maintaining various surfaces (e.g., the shelves <b>16</b>B) in a substantially flat state. The distance adjustment unit can include an adjustment member <b>226</b>, such as a threaded element (e.g., a screw, pin, or otherwise). In some embodiments, the adjustment member <b>226</b> is configured such that actuation (e.g., rotation) of the adjustment member <b>226</b> increases or decreases the distance between the attachment mechanism <b>92</b>B and a wall (e.g., a shower wall). For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 33</figref><i>a</i>, the adjustment member <b>226</b> threadably connects with a mating portion <b>228</b> of the hub <b>218</b> and rotation of the adjustment member <b>226</b> drives the hub <b>218</b> nearer or farther from the support member <b>12</b>B. Thus, when the hub <b>218</b> is mounted to the wall, the adjustment member <b>226</b> can enable a user to vary the amount of distance between the support member <b>12</b>B and the hub <b>218</b>. In some implementations, the adjustment member <b>226</b> passes through a through-hole <b>224</b> in the support member <b>12</b>B and/or the bracket. In certain variants, the adjustment member <b>226</b> is connected with the support member <b>12</b>B such that the adjustment member <b>226</b> can rotate but not translate.</p>

Any component or step disclosed in any embodiment in this specification can be used in any other embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0164">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 36-39</figref>, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D can include an elongated support member <b>12</b>D and at least one shelf <b>16</b>D. For example, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D can have one, two, three, four, or more shelves. As shown, the shelf <b>16</b>D can include at least one cross member <b>30</b>D. Some embodiments of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D have an openable loop mechanism <b>18</b>D that is configured to support the weight of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D, such as from a shower head (not shown) or a pipe leading to a shower head. Certain embodiments have an attachment mechanism <b>92</b>D that is configured to secure the shower caddy <b>10</b>D to a shower wall.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">In some implementations, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D includes features to aid in organizing and/or accessing bathing implements. For example, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D can have a soap tray <b>60</b>D, which can be positioned below one or all of the shelves <b>16</b>D. Some embodiments have an accessory <b>100</b>D that includes one or more supports, such as hooks, loops, ledges, partial openings, cups, cavities, containers, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">In some embodiments, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D includes a handle and/or a divider <b>310</b>. As shown, in some embodiments, the divider <b>310</b> can engage with portions of the shelf <b>16</b>D, such as with a first end <b>312</b> that engages a first support member of the shelf <b>16</b>D and a second end <b>314</b> that engages a second support member of the shelf <b>16</b>D. In various embodiments, the divider <b>310</b> is readily disengagable from the shelf <b>16</b>D, such as to facilitate repositioning of the divider <b>310</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the front end <b>312</b> of the divider <b>310</b> can be rotated about the second end <b>314</b>, thereby allowing removal of the divider <b>310</b> from the shelf <b>16</b>D. As shown, in some embodiments, the front end <b>312</b> and the second end <b>314</b> each have recesses that receive the respective first and second support members of the shelf <b>16</b>D. The opening of these recesses can be oriented in generally perpendicular directions. For example, in <figref>FIG. 36</figref>, the recess in the front end <b>312</b> opens downward (e.g., in a generally vertical direction) and the recess in the second end <b>314</b> opens rearward (e.g., in a generally horizontal direction). In certain implementations, the divider <b>310</b> can be repositioned while remaining engaged with the shelf <b>16</b>D. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the divider <b>310</b> can slide relative to the shelf <b>16</b>D while remaining engaged with the shelf (e.g., not needing to be removed from the shelf <b>16</b>D).</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">In various embodiments, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D includes one or more clamping mechanisms <b>14</b>D, such as one clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D associated with each shelf <b>16</b>D. The clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can be configured to secure the shelf <b>16</b>D with the support member <b>12</b>D, as will be discussed in more detail below. In certain embodiments, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is positioned on the rear of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D and/or engages a rear wall of the support member <b>12</b>D. Rearward location of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can aid in obscuring the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D from view, protecting the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D from damage due to being impacted by bath implements (e.g., shampoo bottles), providing a streamlined (e.g., generally uninterrupted) front face of the support member <b>12</b>D, and/or increasing the amount of usable space in the shelf <b>16</b>D (e.g., by not taking-up space with the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D). In some embodiments, from a front elevation view of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is substantially obscured from view, such as by permitting only a user-actuatable portion (e.g., a lateral region of a dial or lever) to be exposed in the front view only as needed to contact a user's fingers. In some implementations, from a front elevation view of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D, a great majority (e.g., at least about: 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%, percentages between the aforementioned percentages, or other percentages) of the total surface area of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is obscured from view.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0168">In various embodiments, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is accessible from the front of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D and/or without needing to turn the shower caddy <b>10</b>D around. For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 38</figref>, <b>38</b><i>a</i>, and <b>39</b>, although the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is positioned on the rear of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can have an adjustment portion <b>320</b> (e.g., a dial or lever) with an outside diameter that is greater than the lateral width W of the support member <b>12</b>D. This can allow a user to grip and/or actuate (e.g., rotate) the adjustment portion <b>320</b> from the front of the shower caddy <b>10</b>D. For example, in some embodiments, the shower caddy <b>10</b>D is configured to allow a user to hook a thumb and finger around opposite lateral sides of the support member <b>12</b>D to actuate the adjustment portion <b>320</b> of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D. In some implementations, such as is shown in <figref>FIG. 38</figref><i>a</i>, the adjustment portion <b>320</b> protrudes laterally outward beyond one or both lateral sides of the support member <b>12</b>D. In certain variants, a majority of the surface area of the adjustment portion <b>320</b> can be obscured by the support member <b>12</b>D from a front elevation view. In some embodiments, the ratio of the maximum outside diameter MOD of the adjustment portion <b>320</b> to the lateral width W of the support member <b>12</b>D is at least about: 1.005, 1.01, 1.05, 1.07, 1.09, 1.10, 1.20, values between the aforementioned values, or other values. In some embodiments, the adjustment portion <b>320</b> can rotate about an axis that is generally parallel with an axis that passes through front and rear walls of the support member <b>12</b>D. In some variants, the adjustment portion <b>320</b> can rotate about an axis that is generally perpendicular with a longitudinal (e.g., vertical) axis of the support member <b>12</b>D and/or generally perpendicular with a lateral (e.g., side-to-side) axis of the support member <b>12</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 38</figref><i>a </i>and <b>39</b>, the adjustment portion <b>320</b> can include gripping features, such as ribs, ridges, knurling, etc. In some variants, only the gripping features extend outward of the lateral width of the support member <b>12</b>D. In certain implementations, the ratio of the nominal outside diameter NOD (e.g., not including the gripping features) of the adjustment portion <b>320</b> to the lateral width W of the support member <b>12</b>D is at least about: 1.01, 1.02, 1.04, 1.06, 1.10, 1.20, values between the aforementioned values, or other values.</p>

As shown, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can include securing members, such as a bolt <b>326</b> and nut <b>328</b>. In some implementations, the adjustment portion <b>320</b> is rigidly connected with the bolt <b>326</b> and/or the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is configured such that rotation of the adjustment portion <b>320</b> moves the bolt <b>326</b> relative to the nut <b>328</b>. As is also shown, some embodiments include indicia, such an indicator (e.g., a symbol and/or an arrow) of a direction to actuate the adjustment portion <b>320</b> to secure the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0172">Certain interactions between the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and the support member <b>12</b>D are shown in the cross-sectional views of <figref>FIGS. 41</figref>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, and <b>42</b>. As shown, the engaging portion <b>324</b> (e.g., rail) of the base portion <b>322</b> of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D is configured to engage with (e.g., be received in) the engaging portion <b>12</b>Da (e.g., track) of the support member <b>12</b>D. As also shown, the flange <b>324</b><i>a </i>of the engaging portion <b>324</b> can engage a corresponding flange <b>12</b>Db of the support member <b>12</b>D, which can inhibit or prevent the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D from disengaging from the track <b>12</b>Da. In some embodiments, the engaging portions <b>12</b>Da, <b>324</b> have corresponding cross-sectional shapes. For example, both can have a generally âTâ-shaped cross section (e.g., a shape with an outline comprising two generally perpendicular portions).</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0173">The shower caddy <b>10</b>D can be configured such that actuating (e.g., rotating) the adjustment portion <b>320</b> (e.g., dial) secures the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>D. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, rotation of the dial <b>320</b> tightens the bolt <b>326</b> in the nut <b>328</b>, which results in force being applied from the dial <b>320</b> to the base portion <b>322</b>. The force is applied through the flange <b>324</b><i>a </i>of base portion <b>322</b> and against the corresponding flange <b>12</b>Db of the support member <b>12</b>D, thereby clamping the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>D. In some implementations, a portion of the force is applied from the base portion <b>322</b>, through the support <b>30</b>D of the shelf <b>16</b>D, and against a rear wall of the support member <b>12</b>D. This can facilitate securing the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>D, such as by clamping the support <b>30</b>D of the shelf <b>16</b>D between the support member <b>12</b>D and the base portion <b>322</b> of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0174">The shower caddy <b>10</b>D can be configured such that the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can be loosened to allow adjustment. For example, actuation of the adjustment portion <b>320</b> (e.g., dial) can be reversed (e.g., rotated in the opposite direction) to decrease or remove the securement of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and/or the shelf <b>16</b>D to the support member <b>12</b>D. In some embodiments, in the loosened state, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and the shelf <b>16</b>D can move relative to the support member <b>12</b>D. For example, the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D can slide generally vertically along the track <b>12</b>Da. In certain implementations, in the loosened state, the shelf <b>16</b>D can move relative to the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D and the support member <b>12</b>D, such as by the supports <b>30</b>D sliding generally horizontally along the shoulders <b>22</b>Da, <b>22</b>Db.</p>

        <i>a </i>illustrate another embodiment of a shower caddy <b>10</b>E. In many respects, the shower caddy <b>10</b>E resembles or is identical to any of the shower caddies <b>10</b>-<b>10</b>D discussed above. Components of the shower caddy <b>10</b>E that are the same or similar to the corresponding components of the shower caddy <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C, and/or <b>10</b>D are identified below with the same reference numerals except that a letter âEâ has been added thereto. The shower caddy <b>10</b>E can include one, some, or all of the features of the shower caddy <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>10</b>C, and/or <b>10</b>D, including all combinations and sub-combinations. Any component or step disclosed in any embodiment in this specification can be used in any other embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">The shower caddy <b>10</b>E can include an elongated support member <b>12</b>E and at least one shelf <b>16</b>E. As shown, the support member <b>12</b>E can include an engaging portion <b>12</b>Ea, such as a groove or track. Some embodiments of the shower caddy <b>10</b>E have an openable loop mechanism <b>18</b>E that is configured to support the weight of the shower caddy <b>10</b>E, such as from a shower head (not shown) or a pipe leading to a shower head. Certain embodiments have an attachment mechanism <b>92</b>E that is configured to secure the shower caddy <b>10</b>E to a shower wall. Some embodiments include a container <b>210</b>E, which can be connected with a support structure <b>214</b>E that is engaged with the shelf <b>16</b>E. In certain embodiments, the support member <b>12</b>E can telescope. For example, support member <b>12</b>E can include a first (e.g., outer) portion <b>12</b>Eâ² and a second (e.g., inner) portion <b>12</b>Eâ³ that can be received in, and slide relative to, the outer portion <b>12</b>Eâ².</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0177">In some embodiments, the shower caddy <b>10</b>E includes a length adjustment assembly <b>330</b>. The length adjustment assembly <b>330</b> can be configured to adjust the length of the support member <b>12</b>E. As shown in <figref>FIG. 46</figref><i>a</i>, the length adjustment assembly <b>330</b> can include an actuation member <b>332</b>, such as a rocking and/or depressible element (e.g., a button). The actuation member <b>332</b> can include a first end <b>334</b>, a second end <b>336</b>, and a body <b>338</b>. The first end <b>334</b> can be biased by a biasing member (e.g., a spring) <b>340</b>. The second end <b>336</b> can connect with a projection or elongate member, such as a pin <b>342</b>. The body <b>338</b> can be pivotably connected with a pivot element <b>344</b> (e.g., a pin), which can be connected with the support member <b>12</b>E.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">As shown, in a non-actuated state, the pin <b>342</b> can be engaged with an opening <b>346</b> in the second portion <b>12</b>Eâ³ of the support member <b>12</b>E. This can provide an interference that secures the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³ of the support member <b>12</b>E relative to each other, which can inhibit or prevent the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³ from translating relative to each other and/or can aid in maintaining a desired length of the support member <b>12</b>E. In various embodiments, maintaining the pin <b>342</b> in the opening <b>346</b> is aided by the bias of the biasing member <b>340</b>. For example, the biasing member <b>340</b> can apply rearward force to the first end <b>334</b> of the actuation member <b>332</b>, which the pivot <b>344</b> translates into frontward force on the second end <b>336</b> and the pin <b>342</b>, thereby pressing the pin <b>342</b> toward the front of the caddy <b>10</b>E and/or further into the opening <b>346</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">In some embodiments, the length of the support member <b>12</b>E can be adjusted by actuating the actuating member <b>332</b>, such as by frontwardly depressing the first end <b>334</b> of the actuation member <b>332</b>. This can move the first end <b>334</b> against the bias of the biasing member <b>340</b> and/or can pivot the actuation member <b>332</b> about the pivot element <b>344</b>, which in turn can move the second end <b>336</b> and the pin <b>342</b> rearwardly. In some embodiments, such movement of the pin <b>342</b> disengages the pin <b>342</b> from the opening <b>346</b> in the second portion <b>12</b>Eâ³ of the support member <b>12</b>E. This can allow the second portion <b>12</b>Eâ³ to slide relative to the first portion <b>12</b>Eâ², thereby allowing a change in the length of the support member <b>12</b>E. In some embodiments, the second portion <b>12</b>Eâ³ includes a plurality of the openings <b>346</b> along its length. This can allow a user to select and set a variety of lengths for the support member <b>12</b>E. In various embodiments, after the actuating member <b>332</b> is released, the bias of the biasing member <b>340</b> pushes the pin <b>342</b> into the opening <b>346</b>, thereby resecuring the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³ of the support member <b>12</b>E relative to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">In some embodiments, the length adjustment assembly <b>330</b> is similar or identical in structure and/or operation to the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D discussed above. The length adjustment assembly <b>330</b> can include any one, or any combination, of the features of the clamping mechanism <b>14</b>D. In certain implementations, the actuation member <b>332</b> of the length adjustment assembly <b>330</b> includes a rotatable member, such as a dial. The dial can be configured to allow a user to vary the length of the support member <b>12</b>E and/or to maintain a desired length of the support member <b>12</b>E. For example, the dial can be configured to adjust the ability of the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³ to move (e.g., slide) relative to each other, such as by increasing or decreasing the amount of friction on one or both of the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³. In certain variants, the dial connects with a threaded member, such as a screw, that can be adjusted to increase or decrease the amount of friction on a flange or other surface of one or both of the portions <b>12</b>Eâ², <b>12</b>Eâ³. In various embodiments, the actuation member <b>332</b> is on the rear of the shower caddy <b>10</b>E and/or is generally obscured from the vantage of a front elevation view of the shower caddy <b>10</b>E. In some embodiments, the actuation member <b>332</b> extends laterally outward of one or both lateral sides of the support member <b>12</b>E. Certain Terminology</p>
