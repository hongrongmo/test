      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Articles of footwear generally include two primary elements, an upper and a sole structure. The upper is formed from a variety of material elements (e.g., textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather) that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form a void on the interior of the footwear for comfortably and securely receiving a foot. More particularly, the upper generally extends over the instep and toe areas of the foot, along the medial and lateral sides of the foot, under the foot, and around the heel area of the foot. In some articles of footwear, such as basketball footwear and boots, the upper may extend upward and around the ankle to provide support or protection for the ankle. Access to the void on the interior of the upper is generally provided by an ankle opening in a heel region of the footwear. A lacing system is often incorporated into the upper to adjust the fit of the upper, thereby permitting entry and removal of the foot from the void within the upper. The lacing system also permits the wearer to modify certain dimensions of the upper, particularly girth, to accommodate feet with varying dimensions. In addition, the upper may include a tongue that extends under the lacing system to enhance adjustability of the footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The sole structure is located adjacent to a lower portion of the upper and is generally positioned between the foot and the ground. In many articles of footwear, including athletic footwear, the sole structure conventionally incorporates an insole, a midsole, and an outsole. The insole is a thin compressible member located within the void and adjacent to a lower surface of the void to enhance footwear comfort. The midsole, which may be secured to a lower surface of the upper and extends downward from the upper, forms a middle layer of the sole structure. In addition to attenuating ground reaction forces (i.e., providing cushioning for the foot), the midsole may limit foot motions or impart stability, for example. The outsole, which may be secured to a lower surface of the midsole, forms the ground-contacting portion of the footwear and is usually fashioned from a durable and wear-resistant material that includes texturing to improve traction.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The conventional midsole is primarily formed from a foamed polymer material, such as polyurethane or ethylvinylacetate, that extends throughout a length and width of the footwear. In some articles of footwear, the midsole may include a variety of additional footwear elements that enhance the comfort or performance of the footwear, including plates, moderators, fluid-filled chambers, lasting elements, or motion control members. In some configurations, any of these additional footwear elements may be located between the midsole and either of the upper and outsole, embedded within the midsole, or encapsulated by the foamed polymer material of the midsole, for example. Although many conventional midsoles are primarily formed from a foamed polymer material, fluid-filled chambers or other non-foam structures may form a majority of some midsole configurations.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A chamber is disclosed below as including an outer barrier and a tensile member. The outer barrier is formed from a polymer material that is sealed to define an interior cavity for enclosing a pressurized fluid. The tensile member is located within the interior cavity and includes a plurality of I-shaped tether elements that extend across the cavity.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An article of footwear is disclosed below as having an upper and a sole structure secured to the upper. At least one of the upper and the sole structure incorporates a chamber with an outer barrier and a tensile member. The outer barrier is formed from a polymer material that defines an interior cavity, and the barrier includes (a) a first barrier portion that forms a first surface of the chamber and (b) a second barrier portion that forms an opposite second surface of the chamber. The tensile member is located within the interior cavity of the outer barrier and includes (a) a first layer element secured to the first barrier portion of the outer barrier, (b) a second layer element secured to the second barrier portion of the outer barrier, and (c) a plurality of I-shaped tether elements that extend through the first layer element and the second layer element.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some configurations the footwear, or the chamber, the tether elements may include (a) a first end member located between the first barrier portion and the first layer element, (b) a second end member located between the second barrier portion and the second layer element, and (c) a central member extending through the first layer element and the second layer element and secured to the first end member and the second end member.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The advantages and features of novelty characterizing aspects of the invention are pointed out with particularity in the appended claims. To gain an improved understanding of the advantages and features of novelty, however, reference may be made to the following descriptive matter and accompanying figures that describe and illustrate various configurations and concepts related to the invention.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The following discussion and accompanying figures disclose an article of footwear, as well as various fluid-filled chambers that may be incorporated into the footwear. Concepts related to the chambers are disclosed with reference to footwear that is suitable for running. The chambers are not limited to footwear designed for running, however, and may be utilized with a wide range of athletic footwear styles, including basketball shoes, cross-training shoes, cycling shoes, football shoes, soccer shoes, tennis shoes, and walking shoes, for example. The chambers may also be utilized with footwear styles that are generally considered to be non-athletic, including dress shoes, loafers, sandals, and boots. The concepts disclosed herein may, therefore, apply to a wide variety of footwear styles, in addition to the specific style discussed in the following material and depicted in the accompanying figures. The chambers may also be utilized with a variety of other products, including backpack straps, mats for yoga, seat cushions, and protective apparel, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">General Footwear Structure</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">An article of footwear <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref> as including an upper <b>20</b> and a sole structure <b>30</b>. For reference purposes, footwear <b>10</b> may be divided into three general regions: a forefoot region <b>11</b>, a midfoot region <b>12</b>, and a heel region <b>13</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Footwear <b>10</b> also includes a lateral side <b>14</b> and a medial side <b>15</b>. Forefoot region <b>11</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>10</b> corresponding with the toes and the joints connecting the metatarsals with the phalanges. Midfoot region <b>12</b> generally includes portions of footwear <b>10</b> corresponding with the arch area of the foot, and heel region <b>13</b> corresponds with rear portions of the foot, including the calcaneus bone. Lateral side <b>14</b> and medial side <b>15</b> extend through each of regions <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and correspond with opposite sides of footwear <b>10</b>. Regions <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and sides <b>14</b>-<b>15</b> are not intended to demarcate precise areas of footwear <b>10</b>. Rather, regions <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and sides <b>14</b>-<b>15</b> are intended to represent general areas of footwear <b>10</b> to aid in the following discussion. In addition to footwear <b>10</b>, regions <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and sides <b>14</b>-<b>15</b> may also be applied to upper <b>20</b>, sole structure <b>30</b>, and individual elements thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Upper <b>20</b> is depicted as having a substantially conventional configuration incorporating a plurality material elements (e.g., textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather) that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form an interior void for securely and comfortably receiving a foot. The material elements may be selected and located with respect to upper <b>20</b> in order to selectively impart properties of durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort, for example. An ankle opening <b>21</b> in heel region <b>13</b> provides access to the interior void. In addition, upper <b>20</b> may include a lace <b>22</b> that extends through apertures in upper <b>20</b> and is utilized in a conventional manner to modify the dimensions of the interior void, thereby securing the foot within the interior void and facilitating entry and removal of the foot from the interior void. A tongue <b>23</b> of upper <b>20</b> also extends along a throat area of upper <b>20</b> and between the interior void and lace <b>22</b>. Given that various aspects of the present discussion primarily relate to sole structure <b>30</b>, upper <b>20</b> may exhibit the general configuration discussed above or the general configuration of practically any other conventional or non-conventional upper. Accordingly, the structure of upper <b>20</b> may vary significantly within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Sole structure <b>30</b> is secured to upper <b>20</b> and has a configuration that extends between upper <b>20</b> and the ground. In addition to attenuating ground reaction forces (i.e., providing cushioning for the foot), sole structure <b>30</b> may provide traction, impart stability, and limit various foot motions, such as pronation. The primary elements of sole structure <b>30</b> are a midsole element <b>31</b>, an outsole <b>32</b>, and a chamber <b>33</b>. Midsole element <b>31</b> is secured to a lower area of upper <b>20</b> and may be formed from various polymer foam materials (e.g., polyurethane or ethylvinylacetate foam) that extend through each of regions <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and between sides <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. Additionally, midsole element <b>31</b> at least partially envelops or receives chamber <b>33</b>, which will be discussed in greater detail below. Outsole <b>32</b> is secured to a lower surface of midsole element <b>31</b> and may be formed from a textured, durable, and wear-resistant material (e.g., rubber) that forms the ground-contacting portion of footwear <b>10</b>. In addition to midsole element <b>31</b>, outsole <b>32</b>, and chamber <b>33</b>, sole structure <b>30</b> may incorporate one or more support members, moderators, or reinforcing structures, for example, that further enhance the ground reaction force attenuation characteristics of sole structure <b>30</b> or the performance properties of footwear <b>10</b>. Sole structure <b>30</b> may also incorporate a sockliner <b>34</b>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, that is located within a lower portion of the void in upper <b>20</b> and is positioned to contact a plantar (i.e., lower) surface of the foot to enhance the comfort of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">When incorporated into sole structure <b>30</b>, chamber <b>33</b> has a shape that fits within a perimeter of midsole element <b>31</b> and extends through heel region <b>13</b> and also extends from lateral side <b>14</b> to medial side <b>15</b>. Although chamber <b>33</b> is depicted as being exposed through the polymer foam material of midsole element <b>31</b>, chamber <b>33</b> may be entirely encapsulated within midsole element <b>31</b> in some configurations of footwear <b>10</b>. When the foot is located within upper <b>20</b>, chamber <b>33</b> extends under a heel area of the foot in order to attenuate ground reaction forces that are generated when sole structure <b>30</b> is compressed between the foot and the ground during various ambulatory activities, such as running and walking. In some configurations, chamber <b>33</b> may protrude outward from midsole element <b>31</b>, extend into midfoot region <b>12</b>, or extend forward to forefoot region <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the shape and dimensions of chamber <b>33</b> may vary significantly to extend through various areas of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Chamber Configuration</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Chamber <b>33</b> is depicted separate from a remainder of footwear <b>10</b> in <figref>FIGS. 4-8B</figref> and includes a barrier <b>40</b> and a tensile member <b>50</b>. In general, barrier <b>40</b> is formed from a polymer material that (a) forms an exterior surface of chamber <b>33</b>, (b) defines an interior cavity that receives both a pressurized fluid and tensile member <b>50</b>, and (c) provides a durable and sealed barrier for retaining the pressurized fluid within chamber <b>33</b>. Tensile member <b>50</b> is located within the interior cavity of barrier <b>40</b> and is secured to an interior surface of barrier <b>40</b> (i.e., the surface defining the interior cavity). The pressurized fluid within barrier <b>40</b> tends to place an outward force upon barrier <b>40</b>. Tensile member <b>50</b>, however, restrains the outward force of the pressurized fluid, thereby retaining an intended shape of chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Barrier <b>40</b> is formed from a polymer material that defines a first or upper barrier portion <b>41</b>, an opposite second or lower barrier portion <b>42</b>, and a sidewall barrier portion <b>43</b>. Upper barrier portion <b>41</b> forms a first or upper surface or chamber <b>33</b>, as well as a portion of the interior surface of barrier <b>40</b> to which tensile member <b>50</b> is secured. Similarly, lower barrier portion <b>42</b> forms a second or lower surface or chamber <b>33</b>, as well as another portion of the interior surface of barrier <b>40</b> to which tensile member <b>50</b> is secured. Sidewall barrier portion <b>43</b> extends between barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> around a periphery of chamber <b>33</b>. Accordingly, barrier <b>40</b> provides a sealed outer barrier for chamber <b>33</b> that defines an interior cavity for enclosing the pressurized fluid and receiving tensile member <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Although barrier <b>40</b> may be formed through a variety of processes, which each impart different characteristics to barrier <b>40</b>, a thermoforming process may be utilized to (a) form upper barrier portion <b>41</b> from a first sheet of thermoplastic polymer material, (b) form lower barrier portion <b>42</b> and sidewall barrier portion <b>43</b> from a second sheet of thermoplastic polymer material, and (c) form a peripheral bond <b>44</b> that extends around barrier <b>40</b> and joins the sheets of thermoplastic polymer material. Although peripheral bond <b>44</b> is depicted as being at an elevation of an upper surface of chamber <b>33</b>, peripheral bond <b>44</b> may be centered between the upper and lower surfaces, or peripheral bond may be at an elevation of the lower surface. When some blowmolding processes are utilized to form barrier <b>40</b>, a parting line may replace peripheral bond <b>44</b>, or peripheral bond <b>44</b> may be absent from chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">A wide range of polymer materials may be utilized for barrier <b>40</b>, both thermoplastic and thermoset. In selecting materials for barrier <b>40</b>, engineering properties of the material (e.g., tensile strength, stretch properties, flex properties, fatigue characteristics, dynamic modulus, and loss tangent) as well as the ability of the material to prevent the diffusion of the fluid contained by barrier <b>40</b> may be considered. Examples of polymer materials that may be suitable for barrier <b>40</b> include polyurethane, urethane, polyester, polyester polyurethane, and polyether polyurethane. Barrier <b>40</b> may also be formed from a material that includes alternating layers of thermoplastic polyurethane and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,713,141 and 5,952,065 to Mitchell, et al. Another suitable material for barrier <b>40</b> is a flexible microlayer membrane that includes alternating layers of a gas barrier material and an elastomeric material, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,082,025 and 6,127,026 to Bonk, et al. Additional suitable materials are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,183,156 and 4,219,945 to Rudy. Further suitable materials include thermoplastic films containing a crystalline material, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,936,029 and 5,042,176 to Rudy, and polyurethane including a polyester polyol, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,013,340; 6,203,868; and 6,321,465 to Bonk, et al.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The fluid within barrier <b>40</b> (i.e., within chamber <b>33</b>) may be pressurized between zero and three-hundred-fifty kilopascals (i.e., approximately fifty-one pounds per square inch) or more. In addition to air and nitrogen, the fluid may include any of the gasses disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,626 to Rudy. In some configurations, chamber <b>33</b> may incorporate a valve or other structure that permits the wearer or another individual to adjust the pressure of the fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Tensile member <b>50</b>, as discussed above, is located within the interior cavity formed by barrier <b>40</b> and is secured to the interior surface of barrier <b>40</b>. Moreover, tensile member <b>50</b> extends across the interior cavity to effectively join opposite sides of barrier <b>40</b>. Given that tensile member <b>50</b> is secured to barrier <b>50</b> and extends across the interior cavity, the pressurized fluid placing an outward force upon barrier <b>40</b> also places tensile member <b>50</b> in tension. Given that tensile member <b>50</b> has a non-stretch configuration or stretches to a relatively small degree, tensile member <b>50</b> effectively restrains the outward force of the pressurized fluid, thereby retaining the intended shape of chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The primary components of tensile member <b>50</b> are a first or upper layer element <b>51</b>, an opposite second or lower layer element <b>52</b>, and a plurality of tether elements <b>53</b> that extend between and join layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Whereas upper layer element <b>51</b> is secured to the inner surface formed by upper barrier portion <b>41</b>, lower layer element <b>52</b> is secured to the inner surface formed by lower barrier portion <b>42</b>. Either adhesive bonding or thermobonding, for example, may be utilized to secure tensile member <b>50</b> to barrier <b>40</b>. Tether elements <b>53</b> extend through each of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to form restraining members that extend across the interior cavity. That is, tether elements <b>53</b> space layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> apart from each other. Moreover, the outward force of the pressurized fluid places tether elements <b>53</b> in tension.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are formed, for example, from either a textile or a polymer sheet. In general, layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may be formed from any two-dimensional material, which encompasses generally flat materials exhibiting a length and a width that are substantially greater than a thickness. Accordingly, suitable materials for base layer <b>41</b> include various textiles, polymer sheets, combinations of textiles and polymer sheets, or plates, for example. Layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may also be formed from laminated or otherwise layered materials that include two or more layers of textiles, polymer sheets, or combinations of textiles and polymer sheets. Although layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may have smooth or generally untextured surfaces, some configurations may exhibit textures or other surface characteristics, such as dimpling, protrusions, ribs, or various patterns, for example. As noted above, thermobonding may be utilized to secure tensile member <b>50</b> to barrier <b>40</b>. In this scenario, layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may incorporate a thermoplastic polymer material (e.g., a thermoplastic polymer sheet or textile integrating a thermoplastic polymer sheet or material) that facilitates thermobonding.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">One of tether elements <b>53</b> is depicted in <figref>FIG. 9</figref> as having an I-shaped configuration that includes a pair of end members <b>54</b> and a central member <b>55</b> that is joined to end members <b>54</b> (e.g., joined to a central area of each of end members <b>54</b>). In general, tether elements <b>53</b> may have the configuration of a hang tag (i.e., clothing tags, security tags, tag pins, or fabric fasteners) that is utilized to join price tags and other information to apparel and other products in a retail environment. As such, end members <b>54</b> and central member <b>55</b> may be molded or otherwise formed of unitary (i.e., one-piece) construction from a polymer material, such as nylon, polypropylene, or polyethylene, for example. In some configurations, end members <b>54</b> and central member <b>55</b> may each have a cylindrical structure, but a variety of other structures may also be utilized. Some other fluid-filled chambers for footwear and other products (e.g., see U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2009/0288313 to Rapaport, et al.) incorporate a spacer textile material as a tensile member. In comparison with the spacer textile material, tensile member <b>50</b> may be more efficient to produce and may exhibit enhanced customizability (e.g., thickness, contouring, stability).</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Tether elements <b>53</b> are arranged in rows that extend longitudinally along the lengths of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, one of the rows includes eight tether elements <b>53</b>. Tether elements <b>53</b> are also arranged in columns that extend across layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>, one of the columns includes five tether elements <b>53</b>. Although tether elements <b>53</b> are each depicted as having the same lengths and a substantially vertical orientation, the lengths and orientation of tether elements <b>53</b> may vary, as discussed in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Within tensile member <b>50</b>, tether elements <b>53</b> extend through each of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. More particularly, (a) one of end members <b>54</b> is located between upper barrier portion <b>41</b> and first layer element <b>51</b>, (b) the other of end members <b>54</b> is located between lower barrier portion <b>42</b> and lower layer element <b>52</b>, and (c) central member <b>55</b> extends through upper layer element <b>51</b> and lower layer element <b>52</b>. In this configuration, end members <b>54</b> are restrained from pulling through or otherwise passing through layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> when central member <b>55</b> is placed in tension due to the outward force upon barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> from the pressurized fluid. Accordingly, the I-shaped configuration ensures that tether elements <b>53</b> remain positioned relative to layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> when the pressurized fluid places portions of tether elements <b>53</b> in tension.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As a summary, chamber <b>33</b> includes both barrier <b>40</b> and tensile member <b>50</b>. Barrier <b>40</b> is formed from a polymer material that defines an interior cavity, and the barrier includes (a) first or upper barrier portion <b>41</b>, which forms a first surface of chamber <b>33</b> and (b) second or lower barrier portion <b>42</b>, which forms an opposite second surface of chamber <b>33</b>. Tensile member <b>50</b> is located within the interior cavity of barrier <b>40</b> and includes (a) first or upper layer element <b>51</b>, which is secured to upper barrier portion <b>41</b>, (b) second or lower layer element <b>52</b>, which is secured to lower barrier portion <b>42</b>, and (c) the plurality of I-shaped tether elements <b>53</b>, which extend through layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Further Chamber Configurations</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The overall configuration of chamber <b>33</b>, including barrier <b>40</b> and tensile member <b>50</b>, discussed above is intended to provide an example of a suitable configuration for footwear <b>10</b> and other applications. In other configurations of footwear <b>10</b> or in other applications, various aspects of chamber <b>33</b> may vary considerably. For example, the overall shape of chamber <b>33</b> may vary depending upon the areas of footwear <b>10</b> in which chamber <b>33</b> is intended to be located. Referring to <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, chamber <b>33</b> has a generally round configuration that may be located within heel region <b>13</b> and entirely embedded within the polymer foam of midsole element <b>31</b>, for example. Another shape is depicted in <figref>FIG. 10B</figref>, wherein chamber <b>33</b> has a configuration that extends through both heel region <b>13</b> and midfoot region <b>12</b>. In this configuration chamber <b>33</b> may replace midsole element <b>31</b> such that chamber <b>33</b> extends from lateral side <b>14</b> to medial side <b>15</b> and from upper <b>20</b> to outsole <b>32</b>. A similar configuration is depicted in <figref>FIG. 100</figref>, wherein chamber <b>33</b> has a shape that fits within a perimeter of sole structure <b>30</b> and extends under substantially all of the foot, thereby corresponding with a general outline of the foot. In this configuration chamber <b>33</b> may also replace midsole element <b>31</b> such that chamber <b>33</b> extends from lateral side <b>14</b> to medial side <b>15</b>, from heel region <b>13</b> to forefoot region <b>11</b>, and from upper <b>20</b> to outsole <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Although the structure of chamber <b>33</b> discussed above and depicted in the figures provides a suitable example of a configuration that may be utilized in footwear <b>10</b>, a variety of other configurations may also be utilized. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11A</figref>, chamber <b>33</b> exhibits a tapered configuration. One manner of imparting the tapered configuration relates to the relative lengths of tether elements <b>53</b>. Whereas tether elements <b>53</b> are relatively long in the areas of chamber <b>33</b> exhibiting greater thicknesses, tether elements <b>53</b> are relatively short in the areas of chamber <b>33</b> exhibiting lesser thicknesses. More particularly, the tether elements <b>53</b> in <figref>FIG. 11A</figref> include a first tether element <b>56</b> and a second tether element <b>57</b>. First tether element <b>56</b> has a greater length than second tether element <b>57</b>. In general, the thickness of chamber <b>33</b> may be defined as the distance between the upper and lower surfaces of chamber <b>33</b> (i.e., the surfaces defined by barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>). In this configuration, chamber <b>33</b> has (a) a first thickness in an area of first tether element <b>56</b> and (b) a second thickness in an area of the second tether element <b>57</b>, the first thickness being greater than the second thickness due to the difference in length between tether elements <b>56</b> and <b>57</b>. By varying the lengths of tether elements <b>53</b>, therefore, tapers or other contour-type features may be incorporated into chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The taper in <figref>FIG. 11A</figref> extends from lateral side <b>14</b> to medial side <b>15</b>. A taper may also extend from heel region <b>13</b> to forefoot region <b>12</b>, as in the configuration of chamber <b>33</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 10C</figref>. Another configuration of chamber <b>33</b> is depicted in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> B, wherein a central area of chamber <b>33</b> is depressed relative to the peripheral areas. More particularly, tether elements <b>53</b> with greater length are positioned peripherally, and tether elements <b>53</b> with lesser length are positioned centrally, thereby forming a depression in the central area of chamber <b>33</b>. When incorporated into footwear <b>10</b>, the depression may correspond with the location of the heel of the wearer, thereby providing an area for securely-receiving the heel. A similar depression is also formed in the configuration of chamber <b>33</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 10C</figref>. In other configurations, upper layer element <b>51</b> may be contoured to form a protruding arch support area, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Various aspects relating to tether elements <b>53</b> may also vary. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11C</figref>, each of tether elements <b>53</b> exhibit a diagonal orientation. In some configurations, tether elements <b>53</b> may cross each other to form x-shaped structures with opposing diagonal orientations, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 11D</figref>. In both of these configurations, tether elements <b>53</b> are secured to offset areas of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> in order to induce the diagonal orientation. An advantage of the diagonal orientation of tether elements <b>53</b> relates to the stability of chamber <b>33</b> during cutting motions that induce shear stresses in chamber <b>33</b><b>10</b>. Cutting motions are often utilized in many athletic activities to move an individual side-to-side. Accordingly, the diagonal orientation of tether elements <b>53</b> may resist deformation in chamber <b>33</b> due to shear stresses (e.g., from cutting motions), thereby enhancing the overall stability of footwear <b>10</b> during walking, running, or other ambulatory activities.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The spacing between adjacent tether elements <b>53</b> may also vary significantly, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 11E</figref>, and tether elements <b>53</b> may be absent from some areas of chamber <b>33</b>. While tether elements <b>53</b> may be solely used within tensile member <b>50</b>, a variety of other materials or structures may be located between layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to prevent barrier <b>40</b> from expanding outward and retain the intended shape of chamber <b>33</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11F</figref>, for example, a variety of other tethers <b>58</b> are located between plates <b>51</b> and <b>51</b>. More particularly, tethers <b>58</b> may be a fluid-filled member, a foam member, a textile member, an x-shaped member, or a telescoping member. Accordingly, a variety of other materials or structures may be utilized with tether elements <b>53</b> or in place of tether elements <b>53</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">Although a single upper layer element <b>51</b> and a single lower layer element <b>52</b> may be utilized in chamber <b>33</b>, some configurations may incorporate multiple layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 11G</figref>, two upper layer elements <b>51</b> and two lower layer elements <b>52</b> are located within the interior cavity of barrier <b>40</b>. An advantage to this configuration is that each of layer elements <b>51</b> may deflect independently when compressed by the foot. A similar configuration is depicted in <figref>FIG. 11H</figref>, wherein a central bond <b>45</b> joins barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> in the central area of chamber <b>33</b>. Bond <b>45</b> may, for example, form separate subchambers within chamber <b>33</b>, which may be pressurized differently to affect the compressibility of different areas of chamber <b>33</b>. As an additional matter, each of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may be formed from different materials to impart different properties to various areas of chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The overall configuration of tether elements <b>53</b> may also vary considerably. Referring to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, one of tether elements <b>53</b> is depicted as having a generally flat or planar end member <b>54</b>. More particularly, one of end members <b>54</b> and central member <b>55</b> each have a cylindrical structure, but the other one of end members <b>54</b> has the generally flat or planar configuration. A variety of other shapes or configurations may also be utilized for tether elements <b>53</b>. In some configurations, tether elements <b>53</b> may be formed from a thermoplastic polymer material that bonds with barrier <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Manufacturing Process</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In manufacturing chamber <b>33</b>, a pair of polymer sheets may be molded and bonded during a thermoforming process to define barrier portions <b>41</b>-<b>43</b>. More particularly, the thermoforming process (a) imparts shape to one of the polymer sheets in order to form upper barrier portion <b>41</b>, (b) imparts shape to the other of the polymer sheets in order to form lower barrier portion <b>42</b> and sidewall barrier portion <b>43</b>, and (c) forms a peripheral bond <b>44</b> that joins a periphery of the polymer sheets and extends around an upper area of sidewall barrier portion <b>43</b>. The thermoforming process may also locate tensile member <b>50</b> within chamber <b>33</b> and bond tensile member <b>50</b> to each of barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. In general, therefore, a thermoforming process similar to a thermoforming process disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,837,951 to Rapaport, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference, may be utilized to manufacture chamber <b>33</b>. Although substantially all of the thermoforming process may be performed with a mold, each of the various parts of the process may be performed separately in forming chamber <b>33</b>. Other processes that utilize blowmolding, rotational molding, or the bonding of polymer sheets without thermoforming may also be utilized to manufacture chamber <b>33</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Following the thermoforming process, a fluid may be injected into the interior cavity and pressurized. The pressurized fluid exerts an outward force upon barrier <b>40</b> and layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, which tends to separate barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>. Tensile member <b>50</b>, however, is secured to each of barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> in order to retain the intended shape of chamber <b>33</b> when pressurized. More particularly, tether elements <b>53</b> extend across the interior cavity and are placed in tension by the outward force of the pressurized fluid upon barrier <b>40</b>, thereby preventing barrier <b>40</b> from expanding outward and retaining the intended shape of chamber <b>33</b>. Whereas peripheral bond <b>44</b> joins the polymer sheets to form a seal that prevents the fluid from escaping, tensile member <b>50</b> prevents chamber <b>33</b> from expanding outward or otherwise distending due to the pressure of the fluid. That is, tensile member <b>50</b> effectively limits the expansion of chamber <b>33</b> to retain an intended shape of surfaces of barrier portions <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">As noted above, tether elements <b>53</b> may have the configuration of a hang tag that is utilized to join price tags and other information to apparel and other products in a retail environment. An advantage of this configuration relates to the process that may be utilized to form tensile member <b>50</b>. In general, layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may be placed in contact with each other (i.e., in an overlapping configuration). A conventional hang tag securing device (i.e., clothing tag guns, label tag guns, or just tag guns) may then be utilized to pierce layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> with one of tether elements <b>53</b> such that (a) end members <b>54</b> are located on opposite sides of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> and (b) central member <b>55</b> extends through layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. This process may then be repeated until multiple tether elements <b>53</b> pierce layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>. Alternately, an array of hang tag securing devices may be utilized to simultaneously pierce layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> with multiple tether elements <b>53</b>, thereby quickly forming one of tensile members <b>50</b>. Moreover, the individual securing devices in the array of hang tag securing devices may each have different lengths of tether elements <b>53</b> to form a contoured aspect to chamber <b>33</b>. Layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> may then be separated such that end members <b>54</b> lay against outward facing surfaces of layer elements <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to effectively complete the manufacture of tensile member <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The invention is disclosed above and in the accompanying figures with reference to a variety of configurations. The purpose served by the disclosure, however, is to provide an example of the various features and concepts related to the invention, not to limit the scope of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that numerous variations and modifications may be made to the configurations described above without departing from the scope of the present invention, as defined by the appended claims.</p>
