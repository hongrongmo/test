      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The disclosure relates to a method of converting biomass to hydrocarbons using a multi-functional catalyst.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Renewable energy sources are a substitute for fossil fuels and provide a means of reducing dependence on petroleum oil. Renewable fuels include biofuels which may be produced by subjecting a biomass, such as a lignocellulosic biomass, to catalytic thermolysis processes, such as pyrolysis. This results in the conversion of the biomass into hydrocarbon containing feedstreams which are then used to produce biofuels. During catalytic pyrolysis, the lignocellulosic biomass is deoxygenated and depolymerized. Dehydration and dehydroxylation of the biomass are typically the principal reactions occurring during pyrolysis. In addition, carbonyl linkages within the biomass may be broken down into carbon monoxide by decarbonylation. Decarbonylation, which typically increases in catalytic pyrolysis, decreases the liquid yield by removing carbon bearing molecules with gaseous streams.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A water-gas shift (WGS) reaction might also occur during deoxygenation of the biomass wherein carbon dioxide and hydrogen are produced from the reaction of carbon monoxide and water, depending on catalyst and reaction conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In light of the complexity of lignocellulosic biomasses, other reactions need to be promoted within the biomass conversion unit in order to enhance the efficiency of pyrolysis. Such reactions include decarboxylation, oligomerization, condensation, and cyclization.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Typically, a mono-functional catalyst (e.g., an acid catalyst) is used for the multiple reactions which occur in the biomass conversion unit. Alternatively, different mono-functional catalysts have been used for various purposes, such as to modulate cracking and enhance decarboxylation to maximize carbon dioxide (e.g., bases). The use of a mono-functional catalyst to tackle the complexity of pyrolysis decreases the efficiency of conversion of the biomass to hydrocarbons and shortens the life cycle of any catalyst used within the biomass conversion unit. While bi-functional catalysts have been explored, a method which enhances the processability of biomass feedstocks with multi-functional catalysts has not been reported.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It should be understood that the above-described discussion is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to limit the scope or subject matter of the appended claims or those of any related patent application or patent. Thus, none of the appended claims or claims of any related application or patent should be limited by the above discussion or construed to address, include or exclude each or any of the above-cited features or disadvantages merely because of the mention thereof herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Accordingly, there exists a need for alternative methods for producing hydrocarbons by pyrolyzing a biomass feedstream in the presence of a multi-functional catalyst having one or more of the attributes or capabilities described or shown in, or as may be apparent from, the other portions of this patent.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In an embodiment, the disclosure relates to a process of converting solid biomass to hydrocarbons by feeding into a biomass conversion unit at least a portion of a regenerated multi-functional catalyst. The regenerated multi-functional catalyst contains an acidic component, a basic component and a metallic component. The biomass is treated within the biomass conversion unit in at least two stages wherein at least a fresh portion of one component of the regenerated multi-functional catalyst is fed into each of the stages.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In another embodiment, the disclosure relates to a process of converting solid biomass to hydrocarbons in a two stage process. The process is conducted in the presence of at least a portion of a first regenerated catalyst and at least a portion of a second regenerated catalyst wherein the first regenerated catalyst or the second regenerated catalyst is a monofunctional catalyst and the other is a bifunctional catalyst. The combination of the monofunctional catalyst and the bifunctional catalyst contains an acidic component, a basic component and a metallic component. The bifunctional catalyst contains two of the components and the monofunctional catalyst contains the remaining component.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure and additional features and benefits will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure and referring to the accompanying figures. It should be understood that the description herein and appended drawings, being of example embodiments, are not intended to limit the claims of this patent or any patent or patent application claiming priority hereto.

The figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features and certain views of the figures may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">As used herein and throughout various portions (and headings) of this patent application, the terms âdisclosureâ, âpresent disclosureâ and variations thereof are not intended to mean every possible embodiment encompassed by this disclosure or any particular claim(s). Thus, the subject matter of each such reference should not be considered as necessary for, or part of, every embodiment hereof or of any particular claim(s) merely because of such reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Certain terms are used herein and in the appended claims to refer to particular components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, different persons may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function. Also, the terms âincludingâ and âcomprisingâ are used herein and in the appended claims in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean âincluding, but not limited to . . . . â Further, reference herein and in the appended claims to components and aspects in a singular tense does not necessarily limit the present disclosure or appended claims to only one such component or aspect, but should be interpreted generally to mean one or more, as may be suitable and desirable in each particular instance.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Preferred embodiments of the present disclosure thus offer advantages over the prior art and are well adapted to carry out one or more of the objects of this disclosure. However, the present disclosure does not require each of the components and acts described above and is in no way limited to the above-described embodiments or methods of operation. Any one or more of the above components, features and processes may be employed in any suitable configuration without inclusion of other such components, features and processes. Moreover, the present disclosure includes additional features, capabilities, functions, methods, uses and applications that have not been specifically addressed herein but are, or will become, apparent from the description herein, the appended drawings and claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The method disclosed herein uses a multi-functional catalyst. Such catalysts provide greater versatility than those mono-functional catalysts typically used to convert biomass into renewable fuels. Multi-functional catalysts are further capable of maximizing liquid yield of produced hydrocarbons in a more cost effective manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The multi-functional catalyst used may have an acidic component, a basic component and a metallic component.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Prior to treatment of the biomass with the multi-functional catalyst, the biomass may be subjected to âthermal pyrolysisâ wherein the feedstock is heated in the substantial absence of a catalyst in an atmosphere that is substantially free of oxygen. The atmosphere may be an inert gas, such as nitrogen. Alternatively, the atmosphere can comprise a reactive gas, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, steam, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Treatment of the biomass with the multi-functional catalyst may occur in one or more stages. By the process disclosed herein, the multi-functional catalyst may be regenerated in one or more stages.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">When only a single stage is used, all of the components of the multi-functional catalyst may be simultaneously introduced into the biomass conversion unit. Regenerated multi-functional catalyst may thus be fed back into the biomass conversion unit. When a single stage is used, all of the components of the multi-functional catalyst may be combined in a single catalyst particle and fed into the reactor. Alternatively, different components of the catalyst system may be present in different particles.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">When a single reactor is used, the first stage and the second stage may correspond to the lower and the upper zone or section of the reactor. In such instances, the two zones of the reactor may have different geometries. For example, the lower zone of the reactor may have a frustrum geometry and the second zone a cylindrical geometry. In some embodiments, the two stages or zones of the reactor may have different diameters. In the first stage, the particulate solid biomass material is thermally pyrolyzed, to form primary reaction products and in the second stage primary reaction products may be catalytically converted to secondary reaction products. The first stage and second stage of the single reactor are typically in fluid communication.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">When multiple stages (i.e., more than one stage) are used to convert the biomass, different components of the catalyst may be introduced into different reactors. Thus, different regenerated components of the catalyst are fed back into different reactors. As an example, two or more of the components of the catalyst may be introduced into a first reactor (as one stage) and one or more other components of the catalyst may be introduced into a second reactor (as another stage). The components introduced into the first reactor may then be regenerated and fed back into the first reactor. The components introduced into the second reactor may be regenerated and fed back into the second reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Further, multiple stages may be used wherein each stage has a reactor for one or more of the components of the catalyst. In an embodiment, there may be as many stages as there are components of the multi-functional catalyst. For instance, each of the multiple stages may have a single reactor for a single component such that each component of the multi-functional catalyst is introduced in a separate reactor. Thus, when regenerated, the single component may be fed back into its respective reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">In a preferred embodiment, the process is conducted in at least two reactors. For example, the process employs two reactors wherein at least one of the components is introduced into one reactor (a first stage) and the remaining components are introduced into a second reactor (a second stage). Typically, solid particulate biomass material is converted thermally pyrolyzed in the first stage reactor to form primary reaction products and in the second stage reactor at least part of the primary reaction products are catalytically converted to secondary reaction products. The first stage and second stage reactors are in fluid communication. In a preferred embodiment, the second stage reactor is positioned above the first stage reactor.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The presence of the acidic component in the multi-functional catalyst preferred for use in the method disclosed herein accelerates deoxygenation of low molecular oxygenates which are produced in high amounts during the conversion of biomass. Exemplary oxygenates are alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, diols, ethers, esters, and the like. Those having an isolated carbonyl group include aldehydes and ketones like acetaldehyde, methyl vinyl ketone and ethyl vinyl ketone.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, the acidic component of the multi-functional catalyst is zeolite ZSM-5. The presence of zeolite ZSM-5 promotes oligocyclization and/or aromatization of the bio-oil and/or pyrolysis oil compounds. As such, zeolite enables production of higher molecular weight hydrocarbons versus the low molecular weight (generally less than C<sub>5</sub>) in bio-oil and/or pyrolysis oil produced during pyrolysis of a biomass in a biomass conversion unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Typically, amount of zeolite ZSM-5 in the multi-functional catalyst disclosed herein may be from about 5 to about 40 wt. %. (As used herein, the wt. % of a component of the multi-functional catalyst refers to the amount of the component based on all of the components in all of the stages.) Thus, for example, where different stages are used in the process, the amount of zeolite ZSM-5, based on the weight percent of all of the components of the multi-functional catalyst within the stages, is from about 5 to about 40 wt. %.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">The multi-functional catalyst disclosed herein may also include zeolite USY. Zeolite USY promotes cracking of the biomass monomers, dimers and/or small oligomers. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of zeolite USY in the multi-functional catalyst is from about 5 to about 40 wt. %. When present, the weight ratio of Si:Al in zeolite USY is from about 5 to about 200, more typically from about 20 to about 100.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In another embodiment, L-zeolite may also be included with zeolite ZSM-5 and zeolite USY in the preferred multi-functional catalyst. When present, the amount of L-zeolite in the multi-functional catalyst is less than about 20 wt. %. L-zeolite may be used to promote aromatization of hydrocarbons produced during pyrolysis.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The ZSM-5 zeolite, zeolite USY and, optional, L-zeolite in the preferred multi-functional catalyst are included in their acid form and thus provide an acidic functionality to the multi-functional catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The presence of the metallic component in the multi-functional catalyst promotes the WGS reaction producing hydrogen in-situ and consequently minimizing hydrogen transfer reaction from the organic solid to the vapors. Reactants for the WGS reaction may be produced during catalytic pyrolysis, deoxygenation and cracking of the biomass. For instance, deoxygenation via decarbonylation and dehydroxylation produces carbon monoxide and water, respectively. In addition, the metallic component enhances dry reforming (DR) reaction between hydrocarbon moieties and carbon dioxide to increase further the hydrogen content of the gas phase and suppress even more the hydrogen transfer from the organic solid to the vapors.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Suitable metallic components of the multi-functional catalyst include copper, nickel, chromium, tungsten, molybdenum, a metal carbide, a metal nitride, a metal sulfide or a mixture thereof. Suitable metal carbides include chromium carbide, molybdenum carbide and tungsten carbide as well as mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the metal carbide is molybdenum carbide.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In a preferred embodiment, the metallic component of the multi-functional catalyst is copper, nickel or a carbide of molybdenum and mixtures thereof. In another preferred embodiment, the metallic component is a blend of copper and molybdenum carbide or a blend of nickel and molybdenum carbide.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The basic component of the multi-functional catalyst typically enables decarboxylation of the biomass and thus assists in the removal of oxygen from the biomass. The material providing the basic functionality to the multi-functional catalyst is preferably an alkaline-exchanged zeolite, an alkaline earth-exchanged zeolite, basic zeolite, an alkaline earth metal oxide, cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium dioxide, mixed oxides of alkaline earth metal oxides and combinations thereof and mixed oxides selected from the group of magnesia-alumina, magnesia-silica, titania-alumina, titania-silica, ceria-alumina, ceria-silica, zirconia-alumina, zirconia-silica and mixtures thereof and wherein the exchanged zeolite has from about 40 to about 75% of exchanged cationic sites. In a preferred embodiment, the exchanged zeolite has 50% exchanged cationic sites.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Where the basic material is an alkaline earth metal oxide, cerium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium dioxide, mixed oxide of an alkaline earth metal oxide and combinations thereof or a mixed oxide selected from the group of magnesia-alumina, magnesia-silica, titania-alumina, titania-silica, ceria-alumina, ceria-silica, zirconia-alumina, zirconia-silica and mixtures thereof, the basic material may further serve to form a support or a matrix for the other components of the multi-functional catalyst. For instance, the basic material may be the support for the metallic component.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The multi-functional catalyst defined herein may also include a binder for agglomerating the different functional entities of the catalyst and facilitating molding and/or shaping of the components of the catalyst. When different stages are used in the process, the binder may present in one or more of the stages. Suitable binders include clay-based binders (such as kaolin-based binder), alumina based binders (such as aluminum chlorohydrol and aluminum nitrohydrol), silica based binders (such as silicic acid, polysilicic acid, silica gel and colloidal silica) as well as combinations of any of such binders. In a preferred embodiment, the binder is kaolin-based. When present, the amount of binder in the multi-functional catalyst is typically less than 50 wt. %, more typically less than 30 wt. %.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The multi-functional catalyst for use in the methods disclosed herein may also include a promoter. Suitable promoters include phosphates, silica, alumina and metallic promoters and mixtures thereof. In the multi-functional catalyst, phosphate is typically used to promote the catalytic effect of the acid component and to enhance the binding capabilities of the binding materials and is present in the stage where the acid component is present. Silica and/or alumina are typically used to promote the catalytic effect of the basic material and is present in the stage where the basic material is present. A metallic promoter is typically used to impart either a bi-metallic functionality or to stabilize the metallic component and thus enhance the performance of the metal component of the multi-functional catalyst. The metallic promoter is typically present in the stage where the metallic component is present.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In a preferred embodiment, the multi-functional catalyst for use in the methods defined herein may contain from about 5 to about 40 wt. % zeolite ZSM-5; from about 5 to about 30 wt. % zeolite USY; from about 3 to about 15 wt. % of metallic material; and from about 5 to about 40 wt. % of basic material; the balance being the binder.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The methods disclosed herein are especially suitable for the treatment of ligonocellulosic biomasses. Such biomasses contain carboxylic groups and ester-type bonds that can be decarboxylated, providing a suitable catalyst functionality is included. Said functionality is provided by the basic material component of the multi-functional catalyst. The enhanced formation of carbon dioxide from the decarboxylation reaction of biomass moieties further drives the dry reforming reactions promoted by the metallic component of the multifunctional catalyst.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In an embodiment, the biomass may be pre-treated with at least one component of the catalyst system. Such a pretreatment step can comprise impregnating a cellulosic biomass with a solution of a component of the catalyst system. For this embodiment of the process, it is desirable to use for the pretreatment one or more components of the multi-functional catalyst that is soluble in water and aqueous solvents, so that an inexpensive solvent system can be used in the pretreatment step. In an alternate embodiment of the process, pretreatment is carried out with one or more solid components of the multi-functional catalyst by mechanically treating the biomass in the presence of the catalyst component in particulate form. The mechanical treatment can comprise milling, grinding, kneading, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The biomass initially introduced into the reactor(s) may be in a solid or finely divided form or may be a liquid. In an embodiment, the water soluble content of the biomass is no greater than about 7 volume percent.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In an embodiment, the biomass particles can be fibrous biomass materials comprising cellulose. Examples of suitable cellulose-containing materials include algae, paper waste, and/or cotton linters. In one embodiment, the biomass particles can comprise a lignocellulosic material. Examples of suitable lignocellulosic materials include forestry waste such as wood chips, saw dust, pulping waste, and tree branches; agricultural waste such as corn stover, wheat straw, and bagasse; and/or energy crops such as eucalyptus, switch grass, miscanthus, coppice and fast-growing woods, such as willow and poplar.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In each of the reactors, the biomass may be subjected to any of a variety of conversion conditions. Such conversion conditions include those of fast pyrolysis, slow pyrolysis, liquefaction, catalytic gasification, thermocatalytic conversion, etc. Typically, the reactors are a fluidized bed reactor, a cyclone reactor, an ablative reactor, an auger reactor, a riser reactor, a trickle bed configuration, another bed regimen or a combination thereof. The reactors are typically fluid bed reactors wherein at least part of the thermocatalyst might be used as a heat carrier. When the reactor(s) are fluidized beds, the components of the catalyst should have a shape and size to be readily fluidized. Preferred are components in the form of microspheres having a particle size in the range of 20 Î¼m to 3000 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">A broad range of fluidization conditions might be used when more than one stage is desired. For instance, a two stage fluidized bed system might comprise two fluidized bed reactors coupled together with provisions for gas and/or materials transfer in between. Feasible combinations include circulating-circulating or bubbling-circulating or bubbling-bubbling type systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In the reactor, solid biomass particles may be agitated, for example, to reduce the size of particles. Agitation may be facilitated by a gas including one or more of steam, flue gas, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrocarbons such as methane. The agitator further be a mill (e.g., ball or hammer mill) or kneader or mixer.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Typically, the reactor(s) is operated at temperatures in excess of 250Â° C. In some conversion reactions, such as fast pyrolysis, where the biomass is exposed to short contact times and rapid heating, reaction temperatures may be as high as 1,000Â° C. Preferably, the reactor is maintained at a temperature in the range of from 250Â° C. to about 650Â° C., more typically preferably from 400Â° C. to 600Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a single stage process wherein multi-functional catalyst <b>110</b> is shown as being introduced into biomass conversion unit <b>114</b>. The biomass is thermocatalytically treated to render liquid products that spontaneously separate into an aqueous phase and an organic phase. Bio-oil (which is used to produce biofuel) consists of the organic phase. In addition to the removal of heavy materials and solids, water may be removed during the separation. The bio-oil, having the byproduct water, heavy materials and solids removed may then be introduced into a fractionator.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The multi-functional catalyst disclosed herein may be added as fresh catalyst to the biomass conversion unit. Alternatively, the multi-functional catalyst may be an equilibrium catalyst (âE-catâ), also referred to as regenerated catalyst. Such catalysts are produced by burning coke deposits and/or char from a spent catalyst in oxygen or an oxygen containing gas, such as air, in a catalyst regeneration unit or regenerator. All or a portion of the spent catalyst formed in the biomass conversion unit may be subjected to treatment in the regenerator.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Biomass conversion unit <b>114</b> may, for example, be a fluidized bed or a trickle bed configuration or another bed regimen. The biomass may be converted in a single stage to hydrocarbons (including bio-oil) in the biomass conversion unit. Undesirable heavy materials and solids may be separated from the pyrolyzed biomass in solids separator <b>124</b> and the solids, including spent catalyst <b>130</b>, are then allowed to proceed to catalyst regeneration unit <b>118</b>. (Suitable solid separators in the figures provided herein may be a cyclone, coalescer, gravity phase separator, liquid hydrocyclone, electrostatic desalter, etc.) The liquid portion <b>131</b> separated in solids separator <b>124</b> may then be further processed to render hydrocarbon distillates for use in renewable fuel production. In catalyst regeneration unit <b>118</b>, spent catalyst <b>130</b> is regenerated. Regenerated catalyst is then introduced into biomass conversion unit <b>114</b>. Solid biomass <b>112</b> may also be introduced with multi-functional regenerated catalyst <b>122</b> into biomass conversion unit <b>114</b> through line <b>120</b>. During the process, fresh multi-functional catalyst may optionally be added into biomass conversion unit <b>114</b> in order to attain the desired activity of the catalyst within the reactor. Similarly, lower activity regenerated catalyst may optionally be removed from the catalyst regeneration unit <b>118</b> in order to attain the desired activity of the catalyst within the reactor and keep solid hold-up in the unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment wherein biomass is treated in two stages. In the first stage of the process, biomass may be fed through line <b>211</b> into a first stage (pyrolysis) reactor <b>216</b>. As illustrated, undesirable heavy materials and solids may be separated from the pyrolyzed biomass in first solids separator <b>224</b>. Typically, from about 90 to 95 weight percent of the solids are removed from the biomass in separator <b>224</b>. In addition to the removal of heavy materials and solids, water may be removed during the separation. Remaining treated biomass, enriched with heavy materials and solids including the heat carrier separated from the pyrolyzed biomass in solids separator <b>224</b>, is then fed via line <b>226</b> back into first stage (pyrolysis) reactor <b>216</b>. Optionally and in order to keep solid hold-up in the unit, the treated biomass, enriched with heavy materials and produced biochar, may occasionally be removed from the separated solid stream prior to feeding the separated heat carrier via line <b>226</b> back into first stage (pyrolysis) reactor <b>216</b>. Untreated biomass may further be fed through line <b>212</b> into first stage reactor <b>216</b> and admixed with the solids stream from line <b>226</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In the second stage, the pyrolysis products are upgraded in the presence of a multi-functional catalyst. As illustrated, the separated vapors from the pyrolyzed biomass, substantially free of solids separated in first solids separator <b>224</b> is introduced into a second stage reactor <b>228</b> through line <b>240</b>. The vapor may include, in addition to liquid reaction products, the lift gas and gaseous reaction products such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and relatively minor amounts of hydrogen, methane, ethylene and other light hydrocarbons.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Multi-functional catalyst may be fed into second stage reactor <b>228</b> via line <b>210</b>. The treated biomass from second stage reactor <b>228</b> may then be introduced into the second solids separator <b>234</b>. Solids, including spent or contaminated catalyst <b>230</b>, separated in the second solids separator <b>234</b> may then be fed into the catalyst regeneration unit <b>218</b>.
