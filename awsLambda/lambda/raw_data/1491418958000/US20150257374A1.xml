      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Fishing is an activity predicated on patience and timing. When a fish snatches the bait offered on an unassuming hook or takes a bite of an attractive lure, the angler must be ready to set the fishing hook in the mouth of the fish to ensure the capture of the water faring beast, or else embrace the fate of being the losing party in another epic fishing saga. Setting a hook is generally accomplished by pulling back on the fishing rod in a quick jerking motion. If poorly timed, either too early or too late, the fish may escape as the hook has either not yet entered the fish's mouth or the fish has already taken the bait and swam away.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Accordingly, anglers would benefit from a device capable of more consistently setting a hook in a fish's mouth at a more advantageous time.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present invention relates to a hook setting device configured to set a hook in a fish's mouth with more consistency and with a greater rate of success. The present invention comprises an activation member assembly which, when triggered by a fish, will release an arm of a plunger assembly retained under pressure by a spring. The arm is attached to the fish hook via a fishing line and as the arm moves in a direction away from the fish, the hook is set in the fish's mouth.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">An embodiment of a fish hook system according to the present invention includes a sleeve extending between a sleeve first end and a sleeve second end, the sleeve second end including a base member. A plunger assembly is at least partially disposed and translatable within the sleeve. The plunger assembly includes a rod and an arm pivotally coupled to the rod within the sleeve. A trigger finger is rotatably attached to the base member and releasably engageable with the arm. A biasing member is arranged within the sleeve between the rod and the base member. The biasing member may be configured to bias the rod towards the sleeve first end.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to one aspect of a fish hook system according to the present invention, the rod has a rod first end and a rod second end, the rod second end supporting an annular collar surface, and the biasing member is arranged between the base member and the annular collar surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to another aspect of a fish hook system according to the present invention, the rod may further include a rod first end and a rod second end, and the arm comprises an arm proximal end (which is preferably pivotally coupled to the rod second end) and an arm distal end, the arm distal end having an offset bulb formed thereon. The trigger finger may include a pocket, which is configured to receive the offset bulb of the arm. The rod first end may protrude from the sleeve first end and the rod second end may be disposed within the sleeve.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">According to still another aspect of a fish hook system according to the present invention, the trigger finger may include a finger proximal end and a free finger distal end, the finger proximal end being rotatably attached to the base, the finger being rotatable from a first stationary position substantially perpendicular to the sleeve to a second stationary position disposed at an acute angle with respect to the first stationary position. The trigger finger is configured to secure the bulb within the pocket when the finger is in the first stationary position and to release the bulb from the pocket when the finger is in the second stationary position.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention which may be embodied in other specific structures. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A first embodiment <b>100</b> of a hook setting device is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The hook setting device <b>100</b> comprises a sleeve <b>110</b>, a plunger assembly <b>130</b> (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), an activation member assembly <b>180</b>, and a biasing member <b>240</b> (see also <figref>FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The sleeve <b>110</b> preferably comprises a tubular pipe <b>112</b> with a plurality of sleeve apertures <b>120</b>. The pipe <b>112</b> has a pipe first end <b>114</b> and a pipe second end <b>116</b> opposite the pipe first end <b>114</b>. The sleeve apertures <b>120</b> decrease the overall weight of the pipe <b>112</b> and allow fluid that may have entered the hook setting device <b>100</b> when submerged to exit upon activation of the hook setting device <b>100</b>. The sleeve apertures <b>120</b> also allow air that may be trapped within the hook setting device <b>100</b> when submerged, potentially making the hook setting device <b>100</b> buoyant, to exit the hook setting device <b>100</b>. The sleeve apertures <b>120</b> may take any shape including, but not limited to, circles and/or slots.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Turning now to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> in which the hook setting device <b>100</b> is shown in greater detail. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a cut-away view of the hook setting device <b>100</b> according to the present invention and illustrates the otherwise interrelationships of the sleeve <b>110</b>, the plunger assembly <b>130</b>, and the activation member assembly <b>180</b>. <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exploded view of the hook setting device <b>100</b> to better illustrate the specific elements of the hook setting device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The partial cut-away view of the sleeve <b>110</b> in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates pipe internal threads <b>118</b> extending inward from both the pipe first end <b>114</b> and the pipe second end <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The activation member assembly <b>180</b> comprises a base <b>182</b>, a finger <b>200</b>, a knuckle <b>214</b>, a pocket <b>220</b> defining a pocket surface <b>222</b>, and a stopper <b>230</b>. The base <b>182</b> comprises base external threads <b>184</b>, a base collar <b>186</b> having an inwardly facing surface <b>188</b> and an outwardly facing surface <b>190</b>, a base bore <b>192</b> defining a base bore surface <b>194</b> (see <figref>FIG. 5B</figref>), and a cantilever <b>196</b>. The base external threads <b>184</b> interface with the pipe internal threads <b>118</b> of the pipe second end <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The finger <b>200</b> preferably comprises a finger proximal end <b>202</b>, a finger medial portion <b>206</b>, and a finger distal end <b>208</b>. The finger proximal end <b>202</b> is rotatably attached to the base <b>182</b> at the knuckle <b>214</b>. The stopper <b>230</b> is rotatably attached to the finger medial portion <b>206</b> and may extend into the base bore <b>192</b> and positioned alongside the cantilever <b>196</b>. The finger <b>200</b> extends from the finger medial portion <b>206</b> to the finger distal end <b>208</b> forming a finger lever <b>210</b>. The finger lever <b>210</b> preferably comprises a plurality of holes <b>212</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The plunger assembly <b>130</b> as shown here preferably comprises a rod <b>132</b>, a fitting <b>150</b>, and an arm <b>160</b>. The rod <b>132</b> has a rod first end <b>134</b> with a rod first end collar <b>136</b> and a rod second end <b>138</b> with a rod second end collar <b>140</b>. The rod second end collar <b>140</b> has a rod second end collar first surface <b>142</b> and a rod second end collar second surface <b>144</b>. The arm <b>160</b> comprises an arm proximal end <b>162</b> and an arm distal end <b>164</b>. The arm proximal end <b>162</b> is pivotally attached to the rod second end <b>138</b>. Shown here, the arm proximal end <b>162</b> is pivotally affixed to the rod second end collar second surface <b>144</b> by pin <b>146</b>. The arm distal end <b>164</b> terminates in an offset bulb <b>166</b>. The offset bulb <b>166</b> comprises a catch surface <b>168</b> and a bulb aperture <b>170</b> extending through the offset bulb <b>166</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The fitting <b>150</b> comprises a fitting collar <b>152</b> with a collar through-hole <b>154</b>, fitting external threads <b>156</b> and a fitting bore <b>158</b>. The rod <b>132</b> is positioned through the fitting bore <b>158</b> and the fitting external threads <b>156</b> interface with the pipe internal threads <b>118</b> of the pipe first end <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Additionally or alternatively, a dampener <b>172</b>, shown here as a coil spring, may be included between the fitting <b>150</b> and the rod second end collar first surface <b>142</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows the hook setting device <b>100</b> in an engaged state with the offset bulb <b>166</b> of the arm <b>160</b> within the pocket <b>220</b> of the activation member assembly <b>180</b>. In the engaged state, the offset bulb <b>166</b> of the arm <b>160</b> is positioned within the pocket <b>220</b> and the stopper <b>230</b> is between the arm <b>160</b> and the base bore surface <b>194</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">To place the hook setting device <b>100</b> into the engaged state, the finger lever <b>210</b> is rotated away from the sleeve <b>110</b>, thus removing the stopper <b>230</b> from the base bore <b>192</b> (see <figref>FIG. 7B</figref>). Preferably, the periphery <b>204</b> of the finger proximal end <b>202</b> is shaped to provide an interference between the finger proximal end <b>202</b> and the outwardly facing surface <b>190</b> of the base collar <b>186</b>, thus limiting rotation of the finger <b>200</b> past a predetermined angle and preferably before the stopper <b>230</b> travels completely beyond the cantilever <b>196</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The bulb <b>166</b> of the arm <b>160</b> may then be passed through the base bore <b>192</b> and into the pocket <b>220</b>. The biasing member <b>240</b> is compressed during this transition as it is located between the base <b>182</b> and the rod second end collar second surface <b>144</b>, thus inducing a compression spring force opposing the movement of the rod second end collar <b>140</b> towards the second end <b>116</b> of the pipe <b>112</b>. In order to retain the bulb <b>166</b> within the pocket <b>220</b>, the finger lever <b>210</b> is rotated back towards the sleeve <b>110</b> and the stopper <b>230</b> guides the arm <b>160</b> into a position in which the catch surface <b>168</b> of the bulb <b>166</b> abuts the pocket surface <b>222</b>. Thus, the stopper <b>230</b> forces the arm <b>160</b> to interface the pocket surface <b>222</b> and the catch surface <b>168</b> to prevent the arm <b>160</b> from movement encouraged by the compressed biasing member <b>240</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> further illustrates the knuckle <b>214</b> and the cantilever as viewed from above the orientation of the hook setting device <b>100</b> in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">
        <figref>FIGS. 5A-9B</figref> illustrate the operation of the hook setting device <b>100</b> according to the present invention. <figref>FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show the hook setting device <b>100</b> in the engaged position as described earlier with respect to <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. It can be seen that the offset bulb <b>166</b> is positioned within the pocket <b>220</b> and the stopper <b>230</b> is between the arm <b>160</b> and the base bore surface <b>194</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">As shown in <figref>FIG. 5A</figref>, a first fishing line <b>10</b> extends from a fishing pole <b>40</b> to the pipe first end <b>114</b>, on which the first fishing line <b>10</b> is secured through the collar through-hole <b>154</b>. A second fishing line, or leader, <b>20</b> is secured on one end to one of the plurality of lever holes <b>212</b> and is secured to a fishing lure, here a hook <b>50</b>, on the other end. A third fishing line, or leader, <b>30</b> is secured to the bulb aperture <b>170</b> and is tied in with the second fishing line <b>20</b>, or lure <b>50</b>, in a manner known to one skilled in the art. It should be noted that the first fishing line <b>10</b> may be attached to a BEAVER DAM TIP-UP® or any other fishing device, and the hook <b>50</b> may be of any type including, but not limited to, an EAGLE CLAW hook and NORTHLAND FISHING TACKLE® jigging lures.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The third fishing line <b>30</b> is preferably longer than the second fishing line <b>20</b>. Briefly looking to <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, it is preferred that the third fishing line <b>30</b> have a minimum additional length approximately greater than the combined distance traveled D of the finger lever <b>210</b>, at the moment of activation of the hook setting device <b>100</b> and the length of the second fishing line <b>20</b> between the selected lever hole <b>212</b> and the connection point of the second fishing line <b>20</b> and the third fishing line <b>30</b>. The distance D will be variable as it depends on which of the plurality of lever holes <b>212</b> is chosen.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">It is also preferred that the third fishing line <b>30</b> have a maximum additional length longer than the second fishing line <b>20</b> approximately substantially less than the distance L (see <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) between the fitting <b>150</b> and the rod second end collar first surface <b>142</b> when the hook setting device <b>100</b> is in the engaged state.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">In <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, a fish <b>60</b> approaches and bites the hook <b>50</b>. The second fishing line <b>20</b> is pulled tight as the finger lever <b>210</b> rotates about the knuckle <b>214</b>. The plurality of lever holes <b>212</b> allow an angler to set the amount of force needed for a fish <b>60</b> to release the plunger assembly <b>130</b>. If less force is preferred, the angler may attach the second fishing line <b>20</b> in one of the plurality of lever holes <b>212</b> farther away from the knuckle <b>214</b>. If more force is preferred, the angler may attach the second fishing line <b>20</b> in one of the plurality of lever holes <b>212</b> closer to the knuckle <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Looking now to <figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the fish <b>60</b> has rotated the finger lever <b>210</b> farther thus pulling the stopper <b>230</b> out of the base bore <b>192</b> and allowing the offset bulb <b>166</b> to exit the pocket <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the offset bulb <b>166</b> is completely out of the pocket <b>220</b> and the spring force induced by the compressed biasing member <b>240</b> is released, pulling the third fishing line <b>30</b> tight and setting the hook <b>50</b> in the fish <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9A-9C</figref>, the rod <b>132</b> travels through the sleeve <b>110</b> until the rod second end collar first surface <b>142</b> makes contact with the fitting <b>150</b> or dampener <b>172</b>. In the embodiment shown, a dampener <b>172</b> is employed as alternatively described above with respect to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, allowing the rod <b>132</b> to be brought to a stop in a more controlled fashion.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">It is further contemplated by the present invention that the hook setting device <b>100</b> may comprise different sizes for various size fish <b>60</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">
        <figref>FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate a second embodiment <b>1000</b> of the hook setting device. Here, the arm distal end <b>164</b> abuts the cantilever <b>196</b> and the offset bulb catch surface <b>168</b> is in contact with the pocket surface <b>222</b>. The finger proximal end periphery <b>204</b> has a lobe-like profile <b>1002</b> with a flat spot <b>1004</b>. According to this embodiment, when a fish <b>60</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>) triggers the hook setting device <b>1000</b>, the finger <b>200</b> rotates relative to the arm offset bulb <b>166</b>, and due to the lobe-like profile <b>1002</b> of the proximal end periphery <b>204</b>, the flat spot <b>1004</b> will rotate to a position substantially alongside the offset bulb <b>166</b>, thus releasing the arm <b>160</b>. As the arm <b>160</b> would not necessarily need to pivot out of the pocket <b>220</b> according to this embodiment, the rod <b>132</b> and the arm <b>160</b> may be formed from one piece of material.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Furthermore, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention, which is defined by the claims.</p>
