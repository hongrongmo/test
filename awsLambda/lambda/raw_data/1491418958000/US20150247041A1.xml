      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to protective coatings, specifically to protective silicon-doped graphene coatings for use on metals, their production and uses. The invention also relates to a method of inhibiting corrosion comprising the formation of said coatings and the use of said coatings in the inhibition of corrosion, particularly in the reduction of oxidative corrosion.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The development of active corrosion protection systems for metallic substrates is an issue of prime importance for many industrial applications. The use of refined metals is widespread, but such metals can frequently be chemically reactive, limiting their use or requiring protective coatings. Protecting the surface of such metals has developed into a significant industry.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Corrosion of metals is a significant destructive process, resulting in huge economic losses, especially in the aerospace, automotive, and petroleum industries. An intense effort is underway to find coatings that inhibit the process of metal corrosion, a problem costing US industries more than $200 billion annually.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Conventional approaches to protecting metal surfaces can include organic coatings, paints, varnishes, polymer coatings, formation of oxide layers, anodisation, chemical modification, such as the formation of thiol and/or sulphate layers, and coating, for example via electroplating, with other metals or alloys. Such conventional approaches suffer from a variety of limitations, such as susceptibility to heat damage, necessity of thick coatings, cost, formation of waste products, etc. Thus, there is a need to address the aforementioned problems and other shortcomings associated with traditional metals and coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Corrosion can be inhibited or controlled by introducing a stable protective layer made of inert metals, conductive polymers, or even thiol-based monolayers between a metal and a corrosive environment. However, these protective coatings have their limitations.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Thiolated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) can only be assembled onto some metals (e.g., gold and copper) and do not withstand temperatures higher than â100Â° C. Polymeric coatings are relatively thick and may significantly change the physical properties of the underlying material. Polymer or sol-gel coatings are normally applied on the metal surface providing a barrier for permeation of corrosive species. However, when the barrier is damaged and the corrosive agents penetrate the metal surface the coating system cannot stop the corrosion process.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">At present the most effective anti-corrosion coatings for active protection of metals are chromate-containing systems. However, this product is well-known to be toxic and carcinogenic and is now prohibited on end products and highly regulated on industrial lines by European Community directives (VUH and RoHS).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Therefore, there has been an extensive search for green and human safe anti-corrosion treatments. These smart coatings must be able to deal with local pH changes in the corrosive area but also be able to prevent interactions of corrosive species such as water, chlorine ions and/or oxygen, with the metal surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Graphene, a single atomic monolayer of graphite, has properties which are well suited to corrosion-inhibiting coatings in applications such as microelectronic components (e.g. interconnects, aircraft components, and implantable devices). Graphene is chemically inert, stable in ambient atmosphere up to 400Â° C., and can be grown on the meter-scale and mechanically transferred onto arbitrary surfaces. Single-layer graphene films and films consisting of a few layers of graphene have good transparency, so thin graphene coatings, for example having up to 4 layers of graphene, do not significantly affect the optical properties of the underlying metal.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Recently, Bunch et al. [Bunch, J. S.; Verbridge, S. S.; Alden, J. S.; van der Zande, A. M.; Parpia, J. M.; Craighead, H. G.; McEuen, P. L Impermeable Atomic Membranes from Graphene Sheets, <i>Nano Lett. </i>2008, 8, 2458-2462] have shown that single-atomic graphene films are impermeable to gas molecules. Chen et al. [Chen, S.; Brown, L.; Levendorf, M.; Cai, W.; Ju, S. Y.; Edgeworth, J.; Li, X.; Magnuson, C. W.; Velamkanni, A.; Piner, R. D. âOxidation Resistance of Graphene-Coated Cu and Cu/Ni Alloyâ <i>ACS Nano </i>2011, 5, 1321-1327] have demonstrated that graphene can inhibit oxidation of the underlying copper metal. Prasai et al. [Prasai, D.; Tuberquia, J. C.; Harl, R. R.; Jennings J. K.; Bolotin, K. I.; âGraphene: Corrosion-Inhibiting Coatingâ <i>ACS Nano, </i>2012, 6, 1102-1108] have demonstrated that graphene films can serve as corrosion-inhibiting coatings. US 2011/0151278 discloses magnetic devices/media having a graphene overcoat, while US 2010/0203340 is directed to protective carbon coatings, namely protective graphene coatings.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">However, the existing graphene-coating technology has drawbacks. For example, the growth and/or transfer processes of graphene inevitably result in pinholes, defects or cracks in the film. This causes problems with corrosion, for example oxidative corrosion, at edges, defects and/or grain boundaries. For example, the metal substrate corrodes under the coating at points where there are pinholes in the graphene film. Efforts to solve these problems have so far concentrated on improvements in growth techniques and transfer techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In addition, there is a need for protective coatings which can be thicker than a few layers while maintaining excellent transparency.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">For applications in magnetic devices, there is a need to reduce the thickness of the current protective coatings to less than 1 nm thickness while maintaining the overall mechanical strength and its corrosion protection, in order to increase the magnetic recording density.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Silicon-doping has the potential to be used as an effective method for opening the band gap of graphene. Chemically silicon-doped graphene results in an energy gap as large as 2eV according to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. (Azadeh M. S. S.; Kokabi A.; Hosseini M.; Fardmanesh M.; âOpening in the Proposed Structure of Silicon Doped Grapheneâ, <i>Micro Nano Lett. </i>2011, 582-585).</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Modelling studies indicate that Si-doped graphene has the potential to detect or reduce harmful nitrogen oxides. While adsorption of the three nitrogen oxide molecules on pristine graphene is very weak, Si-doping enhances the interaction of these molecules with the graphene sheet (Chen Y.; Gao B.; Zhao J. X.; Cai Q. H.; Fu H. G; âSi-doped graphene: an ideal sensor for NO- or NO<sub>2</sub>-detection and metal-free catalyst for N<sub>2</sub>O-reductionâ <i>J. Mol. Model. </i>2012, 18, 2043-2054).</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Si doping has also the potential to increase the photoluminescence of graphene (Lounis S. D.; Siegel D. A.; Broesler R.; Hwang C. G.; Haller E. E.; Lanzara A. âResonant photoluminescent charging of epitaxial grapheneâ, <i>Appl. Phys. Lett. </i>2010, 96, 151913).</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The current invention provides a silicon-doped graphene coating with enhanced corrosion inhibition, transparency and/or gas barrier properties. The coatings of the current invention also exhibit self-healing properties. The formation of a passivation layer, which fills the pores present in the films leads to improvements in corrosion resistance. Doping with silicon also improves the transparency and therefore will allow the formation of thicker layers where protection with a transparent coating is important.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A further potential advantage of the Si doped graphene coating is an enhancement of the bio- and hemo-compatibility. This has not previously been demonstrated in graphene although an advantage has been observed for Si doped Diamond Like Carbon, DLC (Okpalugo T. I. T.; Ogwu A. A.; Maguire P. D.; McLaughlin J. A. D. âPlatelet adhesion on silicon modified hydrogenated amorphous carbon filmsâ. Biomaterials 2004;25, 239.)</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Silicon-doped graphene offers a unique combination of properties that are ideal for corrosion-inhibiting coating in applications such as microelectronic components. For example it could be used on the copper interconnects in computer chips, implantable medical devices, high-tech equipment (aerospace, super cars, and so on), or designer goods, where silicon-doped graphene's negligible size and weight, and improved transparency would be highly desirable.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The present invention relates to coatings, their uses, methods of formation and other aspects wherein a doped graphene is utilised. The term âgrapheneâ is used herein to refer to a single-atom-thick planar sheet of sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded carbon atoms which are positioned in a honeycomb crystal lattice.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Morphology of Nanostructures</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Graphene is an atomically thin single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice and lying parallel to a substrate. The current invention relates to doped graphene nanosheets. The term ânanosheetâ as used herein is defined to mean a two-dimensional structure lying parallel to a substrate. The graphene nanosheets of the invention differ from nanorods, nanotubes, nanoflakes and nanowalls by means of their morphology and/or orientation.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Nanorods are solid and elongated, having dimensions in the range of approximately 1-100 nm. Standard aspect ratios for nanorods (length divided by width) are 3-5. Nanotubes are generally hollow, cylindrical nanostructures having a length to diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Nanowalls and nanoflakes are two-dimensional nanostructures composed of self-aligned graphene sheets lying vertically on a substrate. They have a branching, i.e. network, morphology as shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The nanoflakes are like narrow belts or bent leaves. Nanoflakes are grown vertically with respect to the substrate as confirmed by the cross sectional SEM shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> (from Shang et al., <i>Adv Fun. Mat. </i>18 (2008) 3506-3514). Each nanoflake does not have uniform thickness along its height, but has a wedge-like structure with a thicker base, which progressively decreases along its altitude terminating finally on a few graphene layers, for example as shown in TEM image of <figref>FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The silicon-doped graphene coating of the current invention comprises or consists of graphene layers (nanosheets) having a planar morphology and which are horizontally orientated with respect to the substrate as opposed to graphene nanoflakes in a network morphology which are vertically oriented with respect to the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The planar morphology of the current invention is advantageous for corrosion protection because the nanosheet edges are more easily oxidised whereas the basal plane is inactive.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Silicon-Doping</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In the context of the present invention, the term âsilicon-doped grapheneâ is used to refer to graphene, onto which silicon atoms have been chemically bound. The silicon doping is preferably not solely in the form of adsorbed silicon or silicon held by non-bonded electrostatic interactions. Preferably the silicon dopant is incorporated into the crystal lattice of the graphene nanosheet.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The term âdopantâ is used to describe an impurity element which is inserted into a substance in order to alter the properties of the substance. Silicon doping of graphene is a crucial aspect of the present invention and silicon-doped graphene is intended herein in any instance where the dopant is not specified. However, the coatings of the invention may comprise additional doping materials. These include dopants such as nitrogen, sulphur, boron and phosphorous.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Silicon-Doped Graphene Coating</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The coating of the invention comprises, and optionally consists of, silicon-doped graphene layers where the graphene is in the form of graphene nanosheets (as defined herein). The silicon-doped graphene may optionally also be doped with other elements as indicated herein. The coating of the invention as indicated herein in all respects may be employed in any of the indicated forms in any aspect of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The graphene layers are positioned horizontally to a surface in a formation often termed âhorizontally alignedâ. This term is used in the art and herein to indicate the position of layers such that one surface of each layer is against a surface of the substrate. This may be the surface upon which the layers were formed. An example of a suitable surface is a metal surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The coatings of the invention may comprise or consist of multiple layers of single-atom-thick graphene nanosheets. A preferred number of layers is in the range 1 to 10, more preferably 1 to 5. A highly preferred number of layers is 1 to 3, for example 2 layers.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The silicon content of the silicon-doped graphene may be in the range 1 to 60 at. % (e.g. 2 to 60 at % or 5 to 60 at %), preferably in the range 5 to 50 at. %, more preferably 5 to 40 at. %, most preferably 10 to 30 at. %.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">If a second hetero-atom dopant is present, preferably the total content of Si and the second hetero-atom dopant will not exceed 50 at. %, for example it may be in the range 5-30 at. %. Thus the level of second dopant, where present, may be 1 to 30 at %, preferably 1 to 15 wt % (e.g. 5 to 15 wt %). In one embodiment, the level of Si dopant is greater than the level of any optional second dopant present.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In all aspects of the invention, it is possible for the coating of the invention to further comprise a second, preferably non-metallic, heteroatom dopant. Example second dopants include phosphorous and nitrogen. Nitrogen is particularly preferred as a second dopant. When nitrogen is present as an additional dopant, it is preferable that the nitrogen is covalently bound, such as by incorporation into the crystal lattice of the oxygen-doped graphene. Methods for the formation of nitrogen-doped graphenes are known in the art. The second dopant may optionally be used in any aspect of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In all aspects of the invention, it is especially preferred if the coating is metal-free.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Preferably the silicon-doped graphene nanosheets of the invention have a single layer thickness less than 1 nm. In one aspect of the invention it is preferred if the total thickness of the coating is less than 1 nm, for example the coating may be preferably made up of 2 layers with approximate total thickness of, for example, approximately 0.7 nm. In all aspects of the invention it is preferred if the total thickness of the coating is less than 2 nm, for example less than 5layers such as 2-4 layers, preferably 2 layers, for example 0.3-1.4 nm, preferably 0.33-0.67 nm. Preferably the single layer thickness is not less than 0.335 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">It is an aspect of the invention that the coatings as defined herein maintain excellent physical properties in comparison with un-doped graphene.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Preferably the coatings of the invention may have a hardness in the range of 50-150 GPa for a film of 1-10 nm thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">The value of Young's modulus for the coatings of the invention is preferably in the range 150-250 GPa for a film of 1-10 nm thickness.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">It is an aspect of the invention that the coatings as defined herein provide improved corrosion resistance in comparison with un-doped graphene. Preferably the charge transfer resistance of the coatings of the invention can be greater than 6Ã10<sup>6 </sup>Î© cm<sup>2</sup>, for example greater than 1Ã10<sup>8 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably greater than 4Ã10<sup>8 </sup>Î© cm<sup>2 </sup>or 5Ã10<sup>8 </sup>Î© cm<sup>2</sup>, more preferably greater than 8Ã10<sup>8 </sup>Î© cm<sup>2 </sup>as measured for a film of thickness 100 nm, preferably as measured for a film of thickness 3 nm. The silicon incorporation is expected to induce a lower corrosion current density and a more positive voltage (see for example, <figref>FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In an alternative embodiment, the charge transfer resistance is comparable to that of un-doped graphenes. In such an embodiment, the coating may have a charge transfer resistance of 2 to 3000 Î© cm<sup>2</sup>, e.g. 10 to 1000 Î© cm<sup>2 </sup>or 100 to 500 Î© cm<sup>2</sup>. A charge transfer resistance of around 100 Î© cm<sup>2</sup>, such as 50 to 200 Î© cm<sup>2 </sup>would be typical in one embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Preferably the coatings of the invention have a gas permeability of less than 0.01 Î¼m g/m<sup>2 </sup>day. Particularly the coatings of the invention have a gas permeability of less than 0.005 cc/(m<sup>2</sup>day) Preferably the Water Vapour Transfer Rate (WVTR) of the coatings of the invention can be less than 0.15 g/(m<sup>2 </sup>day) Particularly the coatings of the invention have a Water Vapour Transfer Rate (WVTR) of less than 10<sup>â6 </sup>g/(m<sup>2 </sup>day).</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Methods of Manufacture</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The process for the production of a silicon-doped graphene coating as defined herein, may comprise âone stepâ chemical vapour deposition (thermal CVD or microwave plasma enhanced CVD) or a âtwo stepâ process i.e. CVD growth of graphene followed by post-growth functionalisation of graphene with Si. In the âone stepâ process Si-doped graphene may be obtained through direct deposition. In the âtwo stepâ process a graphene layer may be grown as a first step, followed by doping with silicon by, for example, plasma treatment.</p>

      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">Graphene layers on a variety of polycrystalline metal substrates can be deposited by chemical vapour deposition using a range of experimental conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">The deposition of graphene layers has been demonstrated via thermally assisted chemical vapour deposition. A precursor such as trimethylsilane (TMS) may be used either as a sole precursor for direct growth of silicon-doped graphene or in combination with other hydrocarbons such as acetylene, methane etc. Suitable ratios of TMS to hydrocarbon (e.g. acetylene or methane) range from 1:99 to 99:1.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">Post deposition silicon-doping can be achieved with numerous techniques that dissociate the TMS precursor, for example RF plasma glow discharge, atmospheric plasma, electron, cyclotron resonance etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">Silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) gas can also be used as silicon precursor during deposition or post deposition plasma treatment at room temperature or at a higher temperature. The choice of precursor may affect the resulting bonding configurations on graphene.</p>

      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">In this work we have examined the behaviour of bare copper , annealed copper, graphene coated copper and Si incorporated copper in saline solution as well as after exposure to air at elevated temperature of 200Â° C. for 1 hour.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Sample Preparation</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">A SEKI Technotron ECR-MPCVD system (2.45 GHz, 1.5 KW), was used to deposit Si incorporated graphene films. Briefly the system was pumped down to base pressure of 2.8 10-5 Torr and was operated in ECR mode. Cu foils 25 Î¼m thick (99.999%, Alfa Aesar No. 10950) were initially etched for 3-4 minutes at room temperature in an Ar plasma using microwave power of 100W. Then the temperature was raised to approximately 900Â° C. and the samples are heated in a background pressure of 40 Torr of N<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Graphene and silicon incorporated graphene were synthesised in a gas mixture of methane and argon and TMS (tetramethylsilaneâSi(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>with gas flow rates of 6, 3 and 0 to 10 sccm (standard cubic centimetres per minute) respectively. Deposition was carried out on the pre-heated Cu foils at a gas composition pressure of 7.5 <b>10</b><sup>â4</sup>-17 10<sup>â4 </sup>Torr for a duration of 90 sec at a microwave power of 100 W.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Corrosion resistance is profoundly influenced by the microstructure of the metal as well the presence of native oxide. The native oxide of copper was mechanically removed with SiC paper and cleaned in ultrasonic bath of acetone and ethanol (termed âcleanedâ). Samples termed âannealedâ were subjected in all the steps required for graphene deposition, without been coated.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">Electrochemical Tests</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">Electrochemical measurements were carried out by using a self-made 10 mL cylinder cell with three electrodes (specimens with an exposed area of 0.196 cm<sup>2 </sup>acted as the working electrode, platinum wire as counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode). Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in 0.1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solution using an Autolab potentiostat.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">All the experiments were performed at room temperature. Open circuit potential was monitored for 1 h to confirm its stability with time. Any fluctuation of the open circuit potential less than 10 mV for a period of 1000 s was considered as a stable potential before carrying out the corrosion tests. Potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out at a scan rate of 0.5 mV/s. The impedance tests were carried out by applying a sinusoidal potential wave at Open Circuit Potential OPC with an amplitude of 10 mV Impedance response was measured over frequencies between 1 MHz and 10-2 Hz, at open circuit potential. We employ optical micrographs as one diagnostic for degree of oxidation; oxide films of increasing thickness lead to optical interference effects and pronounced color changes.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Results and Discussion</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">Polarization curve (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>) shows more positive Ecorr, corrosion potential value and lower current densities in both anodic and cathodic regions for the annealed copper, which implies a higher corrosion resistance. The role of graphene and silicon incorporating graphene coating in suppressing Cu corrosion is shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. It is clear that silicon incorporation (3 sccm TMS during deposition) causes a positive shift on the Ecorr and a marked decrease in the anodic current densities, compared to pure graphene, which is further enhanced at higher TMS flow rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows photograph images of Cu foil surface, graphene coating, and silicon incorporated graphene coatings after annealing in air at 200Â° C. for 1 hour. Before annealing, the surface colours of bare copper, graphene and silicon incorporated graphene coated Cu foils are almost similar as the graphene film is highly transparent. After annealing in atmospheric air, the uncoated Cu surface changes significantly to red due to significant oxidation of copper. The change of surface colour of Silicon incorporated graphene coated Cu foil is negligible whereas that of graphene rather more noticeable, which indicates that silicon incorporation creates a greater diffusion barrier to prevent oxidation. In addition no significant change was observed in the SEM images (<figref>FIG. 6</figref>) as well as Raman spectra of the graphene and silicon incorporated graphene before and after annealing in air as revealed in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> shows Nyquist plot (Zreal vs. âZimg) and Bode magnitude plot (|Z| vs. log of freuencency) and phase plots for a graphene and silicon incorporated graphene coated cupper. The figures demonstrate that Silicon incorporation increases the impendence of graphene. Therefore the improved corrosion resistance of Silicon incorporated graphene coating can be attributed to its enhanced charged transfer resistance.</p>
