      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and compounds for regulating or enhancing erthropoiesis and iron metabolism, and for treating or preventing iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Anemia generally refers to any abnormality in hemoglobin or erythrocytes that leads to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. Anemia can also develop in association with chronic diseases, e.g., chronic infection, neoplastic disorders, chronic inflammatory disorders, including disorders with consequent inflammatory suppression of marrow, etc. Anemia of chronic disease is one of the most common syndromes in medicine.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is often associated with iron deficiencies. ACD can develop from inadequate availability of iron (e.g., anemia of iron deficiency) or, in cases where total body iron is adequate but the requirements for hemoglobin production are defective (e.g., functional iron deficiency). Iron is required for production of red blood cell hemoglobin in erythropoietic precursor cells of the bone marrow.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Numerous physiologic deficiencies are observed in patients with anemia of chronic disease, including reduced erythropoietin (EPO) production, reduced EPO responsiveness of the bone marrow, and reduced iron metabolism, including reduced iron absorption from the gut, reduced iron trans-enterocyte transport, reduced iron oxidation to the ferric state by hephaestin or ceruloplasmin, reduced iron binding and uptake by transferrin and transferrin receptor, and reduced iron transport to the marrow where iron utilization occurs, including heme synthesis. Individually and together, these physiologic deficiencies contribute to ineffective or impaired erythropoiesis, which can lead to microcytic anemia and hypochromic red blood cells associated with reduced hemoglobin production and reduced oxygen transport.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Anemia of chronic disease is associated with increased production of inflammatory cytokines (Means (1995) Stem cells 13:32-37 and Means (1999) Int J Hematol 70:7-12.), including, for example, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), IL-6, and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³). In several in vitro and in vivo animal model systems, inflammatory cytokines negatively affected the ability to mediate EPO production, EPO responsiveness, and the coordinate regulation of iron metabolism (Roodman et al. (1989) Adv Exp Med Biol 271:185-196; Fuchs et al. (1991) Eur J Hematol 46:65-70; Jelkmann et al. (1994) Ann NY Acad Sci 718:300-311; Vannucchi et al. (1994) Br J Hematol 87:18-23; and Oldenburg et al. (2001) Aliment Pharmacol Ther 15:429-438.) Administration of erythropoietin failed to reverse anemia in mice continuously exposed to TNF-Î± (Clibon et al. (1990) Exp Hematol 18:438-441). Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and INF-Î³, contribute to defective EPO production and EPO resistance observed in patients with anemia of chronic disease (Jelkmann et al. (1991) Ann NY Acad Sci 718:300-311 and Macdougall and Cooper (2002) Neprol Dial Transplant 17(11):39-43.). Therefore, various cytokines, e.g., inflammatory cytokines and cytokines associated with inflammation, are involved in many aspects of the pathogenesis of anemia of chronic disease, including inhibition of erythroid progenitors, inhibition of EPO production, and impairment of iron release and iron availability for erythropoiesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">There is thus a need in the art for methods of treating or preventing anemia of chronic disease. There is a need in the art for methods of overcoming the deficiencies in current use of recombinant EPO to treat anemia of chronic disease. In particular, there remains a need for methods and compounds effective at overcoming suppressed EPO production and decreased EPO responsiveness associated with anemia of chronic disease, for methods and compounds effective at enhancing regulation of iron metabolism and overcoming deficiencies of altered or abnormal iron metabolism and utilization, and for methods and compounds effective at enhancing total or complete erythropoiesis by improving the metabolic pathways related to EPO production, EPO responsiveness and signaling, and iron availability, utilization, uptake, transport, processing, etc. There is a need in the art for methods of overcoming or of ameliorating the consequences of cytokine-induced effects in subjects having anemia of chronic disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide and is the leading cause of anemia on a global basis. Iron balance is fundamentally regulated by the rate of erythropoiesis and the size of iron stores. Iron deficiency can occur with or without anemia, and has been associated with impaired cognitive development.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Iron deficiency is defined as inadequate iron supply (levels or stores) or as inadequate availability or utilization of iron in the body. This can be due to nutritional deficiencies, e.g., lack of iron in the diet; to iron malabsorption, due, for example, to surgery (post-gastrectomy) or disease (Crohn's disease); or to a depletion in iron supply or increased iron loss due to chronic or acute blood loss resulting from injury or trauma, menses, blood donation, phlebotomy (such as due to various procedures, surgeries); from increased iron demand, e.g., due to rapid growth in infancy or adolescence, pregnancy, erythropoietin therapy, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Iron deficiency can also be functional iron deficiency, e.g., iron deficiency characterized by the subject's impaired ability to access and utilize iron stores. Iron is not available at a rate sufficient to allow normal hemoglobinization of erythrocytes, leading to reduced reticulocyte and erythrocyte cellular hemoglobin content. Functional iron deficiency is often seen in healthy individuals with apparently normal or even increased iron stores but with impaired iron availability, as measured, e.g., by low levels of percent transferrin saturation. This type of iron deficiency is frequently associated with acute or with chronic inflammation.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Iron deficiency of any kind can lead to iron-deficient or iron-restricted erythropoiesis, in which red blood cell numbers decrease and circulating red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic) and lack adequate hemoglobin, and as such are pale in color (hypochromic).</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Subjects with iron deficiency, including functional iron deficiency, can develop impaired hemoglobin synthesis, reduced % transferrin saturation, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, leading to iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia in the world. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin; without iron, the marrow is unable to produce hemoglobin effectively. Iron deficiency anemia may occur in subjects with depleted or impaired iron supply, or may occur in subjects having functional iron deficiency, when iron is present in storage but is unavailable, e.g., for hemoglobin production.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In view of the above, there is a need in the art for methods of treating or preventing disorders associated with iron metabolism, and a need in the art for methods of enhancing iron metabolism. There is a need for methods of treating or preventing iron deficiency, including functional iron deficiency, and for treating or preventing associated conditions such as microcytosis and iron deficiency anemia.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The present invention provides methods and compounds for enhancing the metabolic and physiologic pathways that contribute to complete and effective erythropoiesis, and in particular, for treating anemia of chronic disease. Methods and compounds for overcoming the suppressive/inhibitory effects of inflammatory cytokines on EPO production and responsiveness are also provided. Additionally the present invention provides methods and compounds for enhancing iron metabolism, and for treating or preventing conditions associated with impaired iron metabolism, such as iron deficiency, including functional iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, microcytosis, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, etc.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

It is to be understood that various parameters associated with clinical conditions vary according to age, gender, etc. In one aspect, the subject has a serum ferritin level below normal range, e.g., below 50-200 Î¼g/L; thus, a subject having serum ferritin levels below 200 ng/ml, below 150 ng/ml, below 100 ng/ml, below 75 ng/ml, and below 50 ng/ml could be a suitable subject for treatment with the methods or use of medicaments provided by the present invention. Alternatively, a suitable subject could be identified by demonstrating a total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) of less than normal range, e.g., less than TIBC 300-360 Î¼g/dL.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In another embodiment, the subject has a serum iron level below the normal range, e.g., below serum iron levels of 50-150 Î¼g/dL. Other appropriate parameters for identifying suitable subjects include transferrin saturation measurements of below 30-50%, marrow sideroblast measurements of below 40-60%, and hemoglobin levels of below about 10 to 11 g/dL. Any of the above parameters are measured, e.g., as in standard hematological tests, blood chemistry and complete blood count (CBC) analysis, typically presented as a measurement of several blood parameters, and obtained, e.g., by analysis of blood by an automated instrument which measures, for example, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, and red cell indices. Measurement may be by any standard means of measurement of hematological and/or biochemical blood analysis, including, e.g., automated systems such as the CELL DYN 4000 analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park Ill.), the Coulter GenS analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton Calif.), the Bayer ADVIA 120 analyzer (Bayer Healthcare AG, Leverkusen, Germany), etc.</p>

      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">A subject of the invention could be a subject with any clinically accepted standard measurement indicative of iron deficiency or of a risk for developing iron deficiency. For example, in certain embodiments, the subject has low serum ferritin levels (&lt;20 ng/ml), or reduced % transferrin saturation, e.g., less than 16% (in adults).

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">The term âanemia of chronic diseaseâ refers to any anemia that develops as a result of, e.g., extended infection, inflammation, neoplastic disorders, etc. The anemia which develops is often characterized by a shortened red blood cell life span and sequestration of iron in macrophages, which results in a decrease in the amount of iron available to make new red blood cells. Conditions associated with anemia of chronic disease include, but are not limited to, chronic bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis, rheumatic fever, ulcerative colitis, and neoplastic disorders. Further conditions include other diseases and disorders associated with infection, inflammation, and neoplasms, including, e.g., inflammatory infections (e.g., pulmonary abscess, tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, etc.), inflammatory noninfectious disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythrematosus, Crohn's disease, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.), and various cancers, tumors, and malignancies (e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">The terms âdisordersâ and âdiseasesâ and âconditionsâ are used inclusively and refer to any condition deviating from normal.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">The term âerythropoietinâ refers to any recombinant or naturally occurring erythropoietin including, e.g., human erythropoietin (GenBank Accession No. AAA52400; Lin et al. (1985) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 82:7580-7584), EPOETIN human recombinant erythropoietin (Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks Calif.), ARANESP human recombinant erythropoietin (Amgen), PROCRIT human recombinant erythropoietin (Ortho Biotech Products, L.P., Raritan N.J.), etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">The term âHIFÎ±â refers to the alpha subunit of hypoxia inducible factor protein. HIFÎ± may be any human or other mammalian protein, or fragment thereof, including human HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. Q16665), HIF-2Î± (Genbank Accession No. AAB41495), and HIF-3Î± (Genbank Accession No. AAD22668); murine HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. Q61221), HIF-2Î± (Genbank Accession No. BAA20130 and AAB41496), and HIF-3Î± (Genbank Accession No. AAC72734); rat HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. CAA70701), HIF-2Î± (Genbank Accession No. CAB96612), and HIF-3Î± (Genbank Accession No. CAB96611); and bovine HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. BAA78675). HIFÎ± may also be any non-mammalian protein or fragment thereof, including <i>Xenopus laevis </i>HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. CAB96628), <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. JC4851), and chicken HIF-1Î± (Genbank Accession No. BAA34234). HIFÎ± gene sequences may also be obtained by routine cloning techniques, for example by using all or part of a HIFÎ± gene sequence described above as a probe to recover and determine the sequence of a HIFÎ± gene in another species.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Fragments of HIFÎ± include the regions defined by human HIF-1Î± from amino acid 401 to 603 (Huang et al., supra), amino acid 531 to 575 (Jiang et al. (1997) J Biol Chem 272:19253-19260), amino acid 556 to 575 (Tanimoto et al., supra), amino acid 557 to 571 (Srinivas et al. (1999) Biochem Biophys Res Commun 260:557-561), and amino acid 556 to 575 (Ivan and Kaelin (2001) Science 292:464-468). Further, a fragment of HIFÎ± includes any fragment containing at least one occurrence of the motif LXXLAP, e.g., as occurs in the HIFÎ±native sequence at L<sub>397</sub>TLLAP and L<sub>559</sub>EMLAP. Additionally, a fragment of HIFÎ± includes any fragment retaining at least one functional or structural characteristic of HIFÎ±.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">The terms âHIF prolyl hydroxylaseâ and âHIF PHâ refer to any enzyme capable of hydroxylating a proline residue in the HIF protein. Preferably, the proline residue hydroxylated by HIF PH includes the proline found within the motif LXXLAP, e.g., as occurs in the human HIF-1Î± native sequence at L<sub>397</sub>TLLAP and L<sub>559</sub>EMLAP. HIF PH includes members of the Egl-Nine (EGLN) gene family described by Taylor (2001, Gene 275:125-132), and characterized by Aravind and Koonin (2001, Genome Biol 2:RESEARCH0007), Epstein et al. (2001, Cell 107:43-54), and Bruick and McKnight (2001, Science 294:1337-1340). Examples of HIF prolyl hydroxylase enzymes include human SM-20 (EGLN1) (GenBank Accession No. AAG33965; Dupuy et al. (2000) Genomics 69:348-54), EGLN2 isoform 1 (GenBank Accession No. CAC42510; Taylor, supra), EGLN2 isoform 2 (GenBank Accession No. NP<sub>â</sub>060025), and EGLN3 (GenBank Accession No. CAC42511; Taylor, supra); mouse EGLNI (GenBank Accession No. CAC42515), EGLN2 (GenBank Accession No. CAC42511), and EGLN3 (SM-20) (GenBank Accession No. CAC42517); and rat SM-20 (GenBank Accession No. AAA 19321). Additionally, HIF PH may include <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i>EGL-9 (GenBank Accession No. AAD56365) and <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>CG1114 gene product (GenBank Accession No. AAF52050). HIF prolyl hydroxylase also includes any fragment of the foregoing full-length proteins that retain at least one structural or functional characteristic.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">The term âprolyl hydroxylase inhibitorâ or âPHI,â as used herein, refers to any compound that reduces or otherwise modulates the activity of an enzyme that hydroxylates amino acid residues. Although enzymatic activity wherein proline residues are hydroxylated is preferred, hydroxylation of other amino acids including, but not limited to, arginine, is also contemplated. Compounds that can be used in the methods of the invention include, for example, iron chelators, 2-oxoglutarate mimetics, and modified amino acid, e.g., proline, analogs.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">In particular embodiments, the present invention provides for use of structural mimetics of 2-oxoglutarate. Such compounds may inhibit the target 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase enzyme family member competitively with respect to 2-oxoglutarate and noncompetitively with respect to iron. (Majamaa et al. (1984) Eur J Biochem 138:239-245; and Majamaa et al. (1985) Biochem J 229:127-133.) PHIs specifically contemplated for use in the present methods are described, e.g., in Majamaa et al., supra; Kivirikko and Myllyharju (1998) Matrix Biol 16:357-368; Bickel et al. (1998) Hepatology 28:404-411; Friedman et al. (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97:4736-4741; Franklin (1991) Biochem Soc Trans 19):812 815; Franklin et al. (2001) Biochem J 353:333-338; and International Publication Nos. WO 03/053977 and WO 03/049686, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Invention</heading>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">The present invention relates to methods and compounds for inducing enhanced or complete erythropoiesis in a subject. In particular, the methods comprise inducing enhanced or complete erythropoiesis by stabilizing HIFÎ± in a subject. Methods of inducing enhanced erythropoiesis by inhibiting HIF prolyl hydroxylase are specifically contemplated. In specific embodiments, the methods comprise administering to a subject a compound of the invention. In various embodiments, the subject can be a cell, tissue, organ, organ system, or whole organism.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Anemia of chronic disease is the most common form of anemia in hospitalized patients. Anemia of chronic disease occurs in patients having inflammatory or malignant disorders, including inflammatory infections (e.g., pulmonary abscess, tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, etc.), inflammatory noninfectious disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythrematosus, Crohn's disease, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.), and various cancers, tumors, and malignancies (e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, etc.), chronic bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis, rheumatic fever, ulcerative colitis, and neoplastic disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">In one aspect, the invention provides methods for inducing enhanced or complete erythropoiesis to treat anemia of chronic disease. Anemia of chronic disease is associated with numerous chronic disorders, including, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, neoplastic disorders, etc., as well as chronic infection and chronic inflammation. Reduced or ineffective erythropoiesis is a common pathology in patients with anemia of chronic disease. Reduced or ineffective erythropoiesis can result from various metabolic abnormalities in the erythropoietic pathway, including, for example, suppressed EPO production, decreased EPO responsiveness in the bone marrow, and abnormal iron processing, including, for example, abnormal or ineffective iron uptake, mobilization, storage, and absorption.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">A physiological feature of disorders associated with anemia of chronic disease is increased production of inflammatory cytokines (Means (1995) Stem Cells 13:32-37 and Means (1999) Int J Hematol 70:7-12.), including, for example, tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), and interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), which negatively affect the ability to mediate EPO production, EPO responsiveness, and the coordinate regulation of iron metabolism. (See, e.g., Roodman et al. (1989) Adv Exp Med Biol 271:185-196; Fuchs et al. (1991) Eur J Hematol 46:65-70; Jelkmann et al. (1991) Ann NY Acad Sci 718:300-311; Vannucchi et al. (1994) Br J Hematol 87:18-23; and Oldenburg et al. (2001) Aliment Pharmacol Ther 15:429-438.) The present invention provides methods for improving metabolic and physiologic pathways related to EPO production, EPO signaling, and iron utilization, resulting in complete or enhanced erythropoiesis and reduction or amelioration of anemia of chronic disease.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">The present invention provides advantages over existing therapies for anemia of chronic disease, such as, for example, recombinant EPO administration. Reduced EPO production is only one aspect of decreased erythropoiesis and it is recognized that administration of recombinant EPO does not address other deficiencies associated with reduced erythropoiesis that exist in patients with anemia of chronic disease. (See, e.g., Clibon et al. (1990) Exp Hematol 18:438-441 and Macdougall and Cooper (2002) Neprol Dial Transplant 17(11):39-43.) These deficiencies include, for example, reduced EPO responsiveness of the bone marrow, as well as numerous aspects of iron metabolism that contribute to complete or total erythropoiesis, including iron absorption from the gut, trans-enterocyte transport, oxidation of iron to the ferric state by hephaestin or ceruloplasmin, binding and uptake of iron by transferrin and transferrin receptor, and iron transport to the marrow where iron utilization occurs, including heme synthesis. Many patients are refractory to administration of recombinant EPO for the reasons described above, in which responses to recombinant EPO administration are reduced or absent, even at high doses of recombinant EPO.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">The prevalence of inflammatory cytokines in anemia of chronic disease leads to, e.g., decreased serum iron levels and increased iron storage, primarily in macrophages, within a cell compartment not readily accessible to emerging erythroid progenitors, which require iron for appropriate heme synthesis. The invention provides methods for enhancing the metabolic pathways contributing to complete and total erythropoiesis. In one embodiment, the therapeutic is administered in combination with supplements that further enhance its efficacy, e.g. iron and B vitamins.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">Anemia of chronic disease is associated with increased levels of ferritin. Despite high levels of ferritin, subjects with anemia of chronic disease are not able to utilize iron effectively. High levels of ferritin are indicative of reduced iron recycling to the marrow and enhanced iron storage, a functional iron deficiency often associated with anemia of chronic disease and a pseudo-inflammatory state often existing in uremic chronic kidney disease patients. By decreasing ferritin levels, methods and compounds of the present invention decrease stored iron and enhance iron recycling through transferrin and transferrin receptor. Reduced serum ferritin levels would be indicative of enhanced iron utilization and enhanced iron recycling to the marrow, thus increasing iron availability for heme production and erythropoiesis.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">The genomic response to hypoxia includes changes in gene expression and cell physiology to ameliorate the acute and chronic effects of oxygen deprivation. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor composed of an oxygen-regulated alpha subunit (HIFÎ±) and a constitutively expressed beta subunit (HIFÎ²). HIFÎ± is destabilized in normoxic environments due to hydroxylation of specific proline residues by HIF-specific proline hydroxylases (HIF-PHs). However, when oxygen becomes limiting, e.g., in hypoxic environments, HIF-PH cannot hydroxylate HIFÎ±, the subunit is not degraded, and active HIF complexes form, translocate to the nucleus, and activate gene transcription.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods treating anemia of chronic disease by pharmaceutically mimicking hypoxia. In certain aspects, the methods enhance EPO production in a manner that is resistant to the suppressive effects of inflammatory cytokines. EPO production is normally induced by hypoxia or low oxygen but expression and secretion remain depressed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IFN-Î³, prevalent in chronic disease patients. (See, e.g., Means (1995) Stem Cells 13:32-37; Means (1999) Int J Hematol 70:7-12; Roodman et al. (1989) Adv Exp Med Biol 271:185-196; Fuchs et al. (1991) Eur J Hematol 46:65-70; Jelkmann et al. (1991) Ann NY Acad Sci 718:300-311; and Vannucchi et al. (1994) Br J Hematol 87:18-23.) Prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors overcome the suppressive effects of inflammatory cytokines on EPO production, at least in part, as evidenced by the capacity of Hep3B cells to secrete EPO to levels above that observed in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. (See, e.g., <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B.) Agents such as the iron chelator, desferrioxamine, have also shown some efficacy in studies of erythropoietin-resistant anemia, e.g., anemia of chronic disease. (See, e.g., Salvarani et al. (1996) Rheumatol Int 16:45-48 and Goch et al. (1995) Eur J Hematol 55:73-77.)</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In other aspects, the present invention provides methods for improved signaling by the EPO receptor in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. The prevalence of inflammatory cytokines in chronic disease patients results in reduced efficacy of EPO signaling, evidenced by the inability of many patients to respond to recombinant EPO with enhanced erythropoiesis. This is thought to occur by a decreased sensitivity to EPO bioactivity, as well as defects in bone marrow architecture and/or microenvironment. (See, e.g., Clibon et al. (1990) Exp Hematol 18:438-441 and Macdougall and Cooper (2002) Neprol Dial Transplant 17(11):39-43.) In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for inducing total and complete erythropoiesis by restoring the sensitivity of appropriate cells to signal transduction through the EPO receptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">Iron deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide and is the leading cause of anemia on a global basis. Iron balance is fundamentally regulated by the rate of erythropoiesis and the size of iron stores. Iron deficiency can occur with or without anemia, and has been associated with impaired cognitive development.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">Iron deficiency is defined as inadequate iron supply (levels or stores) or as inadequate availability or utilization of iron in the body. This can be due to nutritional deficiencies, e.g., lack of iron in the diet; to iron malabsorption, due, for example, to surgery (post-gastrectomy) or disease (Crohn's disease); or to a depletion in iron supply or increased iron loss due to chronic or acute blood loss resulting from injury or trauma, menses, blood donation, phlebotomy (such as due to various procedures, surgeries); from increased iron demand, e.g., due to rapid growth in infancy or adolescence, pregnancy, erythropoietin therapy, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">Iron deficiency can also be functional iron deficiency, e.g., iron deficiency characterized by the subject's impaired ability to access and utilize iron stores. Iron is not available at a rate sufficient to allow normal hemoglobinization of erythrocytes, leading to reduced reticulocyte and erythrocyte cellular hemoglobin content. Functional iron deficiency is often seen in healthy individuals with apparently normal or even increased iron stores but with impaired iron availability, as measured, e.g., by low levels of percent transferrin saturation. This type of iron deficiency is frequently associated with acute or with chronic inflammation.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Iron deficiency of any kind can lead to iron-deficient or iron-restricted erythropoiesis, in which red blood cell numbers decrease and circulating red blood cells are smaller than normal (microcytic) and lack adequate hemoglobin, and as such are pale in color (hypochromic).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">Subjects with iron deficiency, including functional iron deficiency, can develop impaired hemoglobin synthesis, reduced % transferrin saturation, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, leading to iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common anemia in the world. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin; without iron, the marrow is unable to produce hemoglobin effectively. Iron deficiency anemia may occur in subjects with depleted or impaired iron supply, or may occur in subjects having functional iron deficiency, when iron is present in storage but is unavailable, e.g., for hemoglobin production.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">Iron metabolism encompasses in general the processes by which a cell, tissue, organ, organ system, or whole organism maintains iron homeostasis by altering, e.g., increasing or decreasing, specific processes of iron metabolism. Iron metabolism or iron metabolic processes encompass processes involving iron processing, transport, uptake, utilization, storage, mobilization, absorption, etc. Specific aspects of iron metabolism and processing include expression of iron transporters and enzymes which facilitate movement of iron across a cell membrane and retention or secretion of iron by a cell; alteration in expression of proteins involved in iron transport in blood; alteration in expression of transferrin and transferrin receptors; alteration in expression and/or activity of proteins involved in iron absorption; alteration in expression and activity of iron associated transcriptional and translational regulatory proteins; and alteration of iron distribution within body or culture fluids, including, e.g., interstitial (i.e. extracellular), intracellular, blood, bone marrow, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">In certain aspects, the present invention provides methods for improving iron uptake, transport, processing, and utilization. Anemia of chronic disease is associated with defects in iron utilization that negatively affect heme synthesis and hemoglobin formation, resulting in reduced erythropoiesis. (See, e.g., Oldenburg et al. (2001) Aliment Pharmacol Ther 15:429-438.) Decreased serum iron levels, iron mobilization, and any associated increases in iron storage in chronic disease patients, may relate to a microbial defense mechanism of macrophage under conditions of long-lasting inflammation. (See, Fuchs et al. (1991) Eur J Hematol 46:65-70.) In some aspects, the present invention provides methods for increasing effective metabolism of iron by stabilizing HIFÎ±.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">Numerous proteins mediate iron metabolism, including proteins such as erythroid 5-aminolevulinate acid synthase (ALAS) (the first and rate-limiting step in heme synthesis) (Bottomley and Muller-Eberhard (1988) Semin Hematol 25:282-302 and Yin et al. (1998) Blood, Cells, Molecules, and Diseases 24(3):41-533), transferrin, transferrin receptor, iron transporters (involved in iron transport), ceruloplasmin, etc. Increases in transferrin and transferrin receptor expression stimulate iron uptake by erythroid progenitors and facilitate iron uptake and transport to marrow by macrophage (Goswami et al. (2002) Biochem Cell Biol 80:679-689.). Ceruloplasmin increases the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric so that binding to transferrin occurs (Goswami et al. (2002) Biochem Cell Biol 80:679-689.). In certain aspects, methods of the present invention increase iron metabolism by increasing expression or activity of proteins involved in iron metabolism, including erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase, transferrin, transferrin receptor, NRAMP2, sproutin (duodenal cytochrome b reductase 1), and ceruloplasmin. In other aspects, methods of the present invention increase iron metabolism by decreasing expression or activity hepcidin and by modulating expression of ferritin.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">In one embodiment, the invention provides methods and compounds for increasing expression of genes whose products are involved in iron metabolism and processing, including iron uptake, storage, transport, absorption, etc. Such genes include, but are not limited to, transferrin receptor, ceruloplasmin, NRAMP2, 5-aminolevulinate synthase, sproutin (CYBRD1), etc. Therapeutic upregulation of genes involved in iron metabolism and processing will effectively increase iron availability and, thereby, produce a beneficial effect in patients with anemia of chronic disease, anemia of iron deficiency, functional iron deficiency, etc. In another embodiment, the invention provides methods and compounds for decreasing expression of hepcidin, a protein associated with iron regulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">Proper iron metabolism is regulated, in part, by iron response-element binding proteins (IRPs), which bind to iron-responsive elements (IREs) found in the 5â²- and/or 3â²-UTRs of mRNAs encoding, e.g., ferritin (iron storage), mitochondrial aconitase (energy metabolism), erythroid-aminolevulinate synthase, and transferrin receptor. IRP binding to a 5â²-IRE, as occurs, e.g., in the ferritin transcript, inhibits translation of the mRNA; whereas binding to a 3â²-IRE, as occurs in, e.g., the transferrin transcript, protects the mRNA from degradation. IRP-2 is made constitutively within cells, but is degraded and thus inactivated under iron-replete conditions. IRP-2 is stabilized, however, under iron deplete and/or hypoxic conditions (Hanson et al. (1999) J Biol Chem 274:5047-5052.). As IRP-2 decreases expression of ferritin, which is responsible for long-term storage of iron, and increases expression of transferrin and transferrin receptor, IRP-2 facilitates iron uptake, transport, and utilization, thus enhancing erythropoiesis (Klausner et al. (1993) Cell 72:19-28.). Recently, IREs have been described in other genes that are also necessary for erythropoiesis, including 5-aminolevulinate synthase, the NRAMP2 iron transporter (also known as Slc11a2, DCT1, DMT1, mk (microcytic anemia gene locus in mouse)), and the iron transporter that mediates iron absorption from dietary sources in the duodenum (Haile (1999) Am J Med Sci 318:230-240 and Gunshin et al. (2001) FEBS Lett 509:309-316.).</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0143">The methods of the present invention, by mimicking conditions of hypoxia, potentially stabilize IRP-2 in addition to HIFÎ±c, thus producing a synergistic effect involving both endogenous EPO production and enhanced iron uptake, transport, and utilization in the production of functional erythrocytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0144">Among adults, iron absorption of dietary iron averages approximately 6% for men and 13% for non-pregnant women. NRAMP2 (also known as DMT1, DCT1, slc11a2) is a ubiquitously expressed divalent metal transporter involved in transmembrane transport of non-transferrin bound iron. NRAMP2 is an iron transport protein associated with iron transport from gastrointestinal lumen into duodenal enterocytes and from erythroblast endosomes to cytoplasm. In animals experiencing dietary iron starvation, NRAMP2 (slc11a2) expression was dramatically increased in the apical pole of enterocytes in the columnar absorptive epithelium of the proximal duodenum. (See, e.g., Canonne-Hergaux et al. (1999) Blood 93:4406-4417.) Genetic rodent models have linked this gene with anemias associated with iron deficiency, including hypochromic and microcytic anemic mice (mk mice) having a mutated NRAMP2 gene. MK mice exhibit severe defects in iron absorption and erythroid iron utilization.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0145">In certain aspects, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing iron absorption of dietary iron. The present invention provides methods and compounds for increasing expression of genes associated with iron transport absorption. In particular, compounds of the present invention were effective at increasing expression of NRAMP2 in intestine. Increased NRAMP2 (slc11a2) expression would be desirable for increasing iron absorption of iron, e.g., dietary iron, from the gut.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0146">In addition, the present invention provides data showing increased sproutin gene expression in the intestine of animals treated with a compound of the present invention. Sproutin intestinal iron reductase, also known as Dcytb and Cybrd1 (CYBRD1, duodenal cytochrome b reductase 1), is a ferric reductase, and catalyzes the reduction of extracellular ferric to ferrous iron associated with iron absorption. Sproutin is co-expressed with NRAMP2 in iron-starved animals in the apical region of duodenal villi (See, e.g., McKie et al. (2001) Science 291:1755-1759.)</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0147">Methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing ceruloplasmin gene expression. Ceruloplasmin, also known as a ferroxidase-1, converts reduced iron released from storage sites (such as ferritin) to the oxidized form. Oxidized iron is able to bind to its plasma transport protein, transferrin. Ceruloplasmin deficiencies are associated with accumulation of iron in liver and other tissues. Evidence indicates that ceruloplasmin promotes efflux of iron from the liver and promotes influx of iron into iron-deficient cells. (See, e.g., Tran et al. (2002) J Nutr 132:351-356.)</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0148">Compounds of the present invention reduced expression of hepcidin mRNA in mouse liver. Inflammation leads to IL-6 production, which acts on hepatocytes to induce hepcidin production. Hepcidin inhibits macrophage iron release and intestinal iron absorption, reducing iron availability and leading to, for example, hypoferremia. Decreased hepcidin expression is associated with increased iron release from reticuloendothelial cells and increased intestinal iron absorption. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for decreasing hepcidin expression, increasing intestinal iron absorption, and reducing hypoferremia.</p>

In another aspect, methods and compounds for treating anemia associated with interferon-Î± therapy for HCV infection are provided. In another aspect, the present invention provides compounds and methods useful for treating anemia associated with ribavirin therapy for HCV infection.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0150">Methods for increasing the production of factors required for differentiation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic progenitor cells including, e.g., hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), CFU-GEMM (colony-forming-unit-granulocyte/erythroid/monocyte/megakaryocyte) cells, etc., are also contemplated. Factors that stimulate erythropoiesis include, but are not limited to, erythropoietin. In another aspect, the methods increase the production of factors required for iron uptake, transport, and utilization. Such factors include, but are not limited to, erythroid aminolevulinate synthase, transferrin, transferrin receptor, ceruloplasmin, ferritin, etc. In yet another aspect, the method increases factors required for differentiation of erythrocytes and additionally factors required for iron uptake, transport, and utilization.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0151">Methods for enhancing responsiveness of hematopoietic precursors to erythropoietin are also contemplated. As described above, such precursors include HSCs, CFU-GEMMs, etc. The responsiveness of the precursor cells can be augmented, e.g., by altering expression of erythropoietin receptors, intracellular factors involved in erythropoietin signaling, and secreted factors that facilitate interaction of erythropoietin with the receptors. The present invention provides methods for enhancing EPO responsiveness of the bone marrow, for example, by increasing EPO receptor expression.</p>

      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0175">Methods for identifying compounds of the invention are also provided. In certain aspects, a compound of the invention is one that stabilizes HIFÎ±. The ability of a compound to stabilize or activate HIFÎ± can be measured, for example, by direct measurement of HIFÎ± in a sample, indirect measurement of HIFÎ±, e.g., by measuring a decrease in HIFÎ± associated with the von Hippel Lindau protein (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 00/69908), or activation of HIF responsive target genes or reporter constructs (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,434). Measuring and comparing levels of HIF and/or HIF-responsive target proteins in the absence and presence of the compound will identify compounds that stabilize HIFÎ± and/or activate HIF.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0176">In other aspects, a compound of the invention is one that inhibits HIF hydroxylase activity. Assays for hydroxylase activity are standard in the art. Such assays can directly or indirectly measure hydroxylase activity. For example, an assay can measure hydroxylated residues, e.g., proline, asparagine, etc., present in the enzyme substrate, e.g., a target protein, a synthetic peptide mimetic, or a fragment thereof. (See, e.g., Palmerini et al. (1985) J Chromatogr 339:285-292.) A reduction in hydroxylated residue, e.g., proline or asparagine, in the presence of a compound is indicative of a compound that inhibits hydroxylase activity. Alternatively, assays can measure other products of the hydroxylation reaction, e.g., formation of succinate from 2-oxoglutarate. (See, e.g., Cunliffe et al. (1986) Biochem J 240:617-619.) Kaule and Gunzler (1990; Anal Biochem 184:291-297) describe an exemplary procedure that measures production of succinate from 2-oxoglutarate.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0177">Procedures such as those described above can be used to identify compounds that modulate HIF hydroxylase activity. Target protein may include HIFÎ± or a fragment thereof, e.g., HIF(556-575). Enzyme may include, e.g., HIF prolyl hydroxylase (see, e.g., GenBank Accession No. AAG33965, etc.) or HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase (see, e.g., GenBank Accession No. AAL27308, etc.), obtained from any source. Enzyme may also be present in a crude cell lysate or in a partially purified form. For example, procedures that measure HIF hydroxylase activity are described in Ivan et al. (2001, Science 292:464-468; and 2002, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99:13459-13464) and Hirsila et al. (2003, J Biol Chem 278:30772-30780); additional methods are described in International Publication No. WO 03/049686. Measuring and comparing enzyme activity in the absence and presence of the compound will identify compounds that inhibit hydroxylation of HIFÎ±.</p>

      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0180">The compositions of the present invention can be delivered directly or in pharmaceutical compositions containing excipients, as is well known in the art. Present methods of treatment can comprise administration of an effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject having or at risk for a metabolic disorder; particularly a disorder associated with glucose regulation, e.g., diabetes, hyperglycemia, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject, and in a most preferred embodiment, the subject is a human subject.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0181">An effective amount, e.g., dose, of compound or drug can readily be determined by routine experimentation, as can an effective and convenient route of administration and an appropriate formulation. Various formulations and drug delivery systems are available in the art. (See, e.g., Gennaro, ed. (2000) Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra; and Hardman, Limbird, and Gilman, eds. (2001) The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, supra.)</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0182">Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, topical, nasal, pulmonary, ocular, intestinal, and parenteral administration. Primary routes for parenteral administration include intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous administration. Secondary routes of administration include intraperitoneal, intra-arterial, intra-articular, intracardiac, intracisternal, intradermal, intralesional, intraocular, intrapleural, intrathecal, intrauterine, and intraventricular administration. The indication to be treated, along with the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the drug, dictate the type of formulation and the route of administration to be used, as well as whether local or systemic delivery would be preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0183">Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the invention may be provided in an instant release, controlled release, sustained release, or target drug-delivery system. Commonly used dosage forms include, for example, solutions and suspensions, (micro-) emulsions, ointments, gels and patches, liposomes, tablets, dragees, soft or hard shell capsules, suppositories, ovules, implants, amorphous or crystalline powders, aerosols, and lyophilized formulations. Depending on route of administration used, special devices may be required for application or administration of the drug, such as, for example, syringes and needles, inhalers, pumps, injection pens, applicators, or special flasks. Pharmaceutical dosage forms are often composed of the drug, an excipient(s), and a container/closure system. One or multiple excipients, also referred to as inactive ingredients, can be added to a compound of the invention to improve or facilitate manufacturing, stability, administration, and safety of the drug, and can provide a means to achieve a desired drug release profile. Therefore, the type of excipient(s) to be added to the drug can depend on various factors, such as, for example, the physical and chemical properties of the drug, the route of administration, and the manufacturing procedure. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are available in the art, and include those listed in various pharmacopoeias. (See, e.g., USP, JP, EP, and BP, FDA web page (www.fda.gov), Inactive Ingredient Guide 1996, and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, ed. Ash; Synapse Information Resources, Inc. 2002.)</p>
      <p id="p-00200-en" num="0184">Pharmaceutical dosage forms of a compound of the present invention may be manufactured by any of the methods well-known in the art, such as, for example, by conventional mixing, sieving, dissolving, melting, granulating, dragee-making, tabletting, suspending, extruding, spray-drying, levigating, emulsifying, (nano/micro-) encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilization processes. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention can include one or more physiologically acceptable inactive ingredients that facilitate processing of active molecules into preparations for pharmaceutical use.</p>
      <p id="p-00201-en" num="0185">Proper formulation is dependent upon the desired route of administration. For intravenous injection, for example, the composition may be formulated in aqueous solution, if necessary using physiologically compatible buffers, including, for example, phosphate, histidine, or citrate for adjustment of the formulation pH, and a tonicity agent, such as, for example, sodium chloride or dextrose. For transmucosal or nasal administration, semisolid, liquid formulations, or patches may be preferred, possibly containing penetration enhancers. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated in liquid or solid dosage forms and as instant or controlled/sustained release formulations. Suitable dosage forms for oral ingestion by a subject include tablets, pills, dragees, hard and soft shell capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and emulsions. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.</p>
      <p id="p-00202-en" num="0186">Solid oral dosage forms can be obtained using excipients, which may include, fillers, disintegrants, binders (dry and wet), dissolution retardants, lubricants, glidants, antiadherants, cationic exchange resins, wetting agents, antioxidants, preservatives, coloring, and flavoring agents. These excipients can be of synthetic or natural source. Examples of such excipients include cellulose derivatives, citric acid, dicalcium phosphate, gelatine, magnesium carbonate, magnesium/sodium lauryl sulfate, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, silicates, silicium dioxide, sodium benzoate, sorbitol, starches, stearic acid or a salt thereof, sugars (i.e. dextrose, sucrose, lactose, etc.), talc, tragacanth mucilage, vegetable oils (hydrogenated), and waxes. Ethanol and water may serve as granulation aides. In certain instances, coating of tablets with, for example, a taste-masking film, a stomach acid resistant film, or a release-retarding film is desirable. Natural and synthetic polymers, in combination with colorants, sugars, and organic solvents or water, are often used to coat tablets, resulting in dragees. When a capsule is preferred over a tablet, the drug powder, suspension, or solution thereof can be delivered in a compatible hard or soft shell capsule.</p>
      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0187">In one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention can be administered topically, such as through a skin patch, a semi-solid or a liquid formulation, for example a gel, a (micro-) emulsion, an ointment, a solution, a (nano/micro)-suspension, or a foam. The penetration of the drug into the skin and underlying tissues can be regulated, for example, using penetration enhancers; the appropriate choice and combination of lipophilic, hydrophilic, and amphiphilic excipients, including water, organic solvents, waxes, oils, synthetic and natural polymers, surfactants, emulsifiers; by pH adjustment; and use of complexing agents. Other techniques, such as iontophoresis, may be used to regulate skin penetration of a compound of the invention. Transdermal or topical administration would be preferred, for example, in situations in which local delivery with minimal systemic exposure is desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0188">For administration by inhalation, or administration to the nose, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or semisolid aerosol from pressurized packs, or a nebuliser, usually with the use of a propellant, e.g., halogenated carbons dervided from methan and ethan, carbon dioxide, or any other suitable gas. For topical aerosols, hydrocarbons like butane, isobutene, and pentane are useful. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the appropriate dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator, may be formulated. These typically contain a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0189">Compositions formulated for parenteral administration by injection are usually sterile and, can be presented in unit dosage forms, e.g., in ampoules, syringes, injection pens, or in multi-dose containers, the latter usually containing a preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents, such as buffers, tonicity agents, viscosity enhancing agents, surfactants, suspending and dispersing agents, antioxidants, biocompatible polymers, chelating agents, and preservatives. Depending on the injection site, the vehicle may contain water, a synthetic or vegetable oil, and/or organic co-solvents. In certain instances, such as with a lyophilized product or a concentrate, the parenteral formulation would be reconstituted or diluted prior to administration. Depot formulations, providing controlled or sustained release of a compound of the invention, may include injectable suspensions of nano/micro particles or nano/micro or non-micronized crystals. Polymers such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), or copolymers thereof, can serve as controlled/sustained release matrices, in addition to others well known in the art. Other depot delivery systems may be presented in form of implants and pumps requiring incision.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0190">Suitable carriers for intravenous injection for the molecules of the invention are well-known in the art and include water-based solutions containing a base, such as, for example, sodium hydroxide, to form an ionized compound, sucrose or sodium chloride as a tonicity agent, for example, the buffer contains phosphate or histidine. Co-solvents, such as, for example, polyethylene glycols, may be added. These water-based systems are effective at dissolving compounds of the invention and produce low toxicity upon systemic administration. The proportions of the components of a solution system may be varied considerably, without destroying solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the components may be varied. For example, low-toxicity surfactants, such as polysorbates or poloxamers, may be used, as can polyethylene glycol or other co-solvents, biocompatible polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone may be added, and other sugars and polyols may substitute for dextrose.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0191">For composition useful for the present methods of treatment, a therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially using a variety of techniques well-known in the art. Initial doses used in animal studies may be based on effective concentrations established in cell culture assays. Dosage ranges appropriate for human subjects can be determined, for example, using data obtained from animal studies and cell culture assays.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0192">A therapeutically effective dose or amount of a compound, agent, or drug of the present invention refers to an amount or dose of the compound, agent, or drug that results in amelioration of symptoms or a prolongation of survival in a subject. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such molecules can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio of toxic to therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index, which can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Agents that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0193">The effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is the amount of the compound or pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, e.g., regulation of glucose metabolism, decrease in elevated or increased blood glucose levels, treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with altered glucose metabolism, e.g., diabetes, etc</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0194">Dosages preferably fall within a range of circulating concentrations that includes the ED50 with little or no toxicity. Dosages may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and/or the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration, dosage, and dosage interval should be chosen according to methods known in the art, in view of the specifics of a subject's condition.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0195">Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety that are sufficient to achieve the desired effects, e.g., regulation of glucose metabolism, decrease in blood glucose levels, etc., i.e., minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from, for example, in vitro data and animal experiments. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0196">The amount of agent or composition administered may be dependent on a variety of factors, including the sex, age, and weight of the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0197">The present compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device containing one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. Such a pack or device may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack, or glass and rubber stoppers such as in vials. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.</p>

      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0200">Hep3B cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 0.4, 2, 10 ng/ml) of TNF-Î± in the absence or presence of compound A or compound B for 3 days. Secreted EPO levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, catalog no. DEP00). In the absence of compound, treatment of Hep3B cells with TNF-Î± reduced EPO production in a dose-dependent manner. Hep3B cells treated with various concentrations of either compound A (<figref>FIG. 1A</figref>) or compound B (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>) in the absence of TNF-Î± showed a dose-dependent increase in EPO production. Addition of either compound in the presence of TNF-Î± greatly reduced the inhibitory effects of TNF-Î± on EPO production.

      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0218">HUVEC were treated with vehicle control or various concentrations of compound B or compound C for 24 hours. Cells were washed and then stimulated with either 1 ng/ml TNF-Î±, 1 ng/ml IL-1Î², or a combination of 1 ng/ml each of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IFN-Î³ for 4 hours. Cell surface expression of E-selectin was measured by cell-based ELISA.</p>
      <p id="p-00235-en" num="0219">As shown in <figref>FIG. 26</figref>, pretreatment of HUVEC with compound B or compound C inhibited the induction of cell surface E-selectin expression induced by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± or IL-1Î². In addition, pretreatment with either compound decreased E-selectin expression in the presence of three inflammatory cytokines known to increase E-selectin expression (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IFN-Î³). These results indicated that the present compounds blocked the inflammatory function of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IFN-Î³ on endothelial cells, as exemplified by inhibition of the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules that mediate rolling of leukocytes on activated endothelium. Since leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium via E-selectin is an early step in perpetuating inflammatory cascades, inhibition of leukocyte rolling by inhibiting E-selectin expression provides a means for decreasing inflammatory cascades that further limit EPO production and suppress erythropoiesis.</p>

      <heading id="h-00031-en" level="1">Synergistic Increase in EPO Production</heading>
      <p id="p-00236-en" num="0220">Hep3B cells were treated with various concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 10 ng/ml) of IL-6 in the absence of presence of various concentrations (3 Î¼M, 10 Î¼M, 30 Î¼M) of compound A or compound B for 1 or 3 days. Secreted EPO levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, catalog no. DEP00). In the absence of compound, treatment of Hep3B cells with IL-6 had a minimal effect on EPO production. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>, Hep3B cells treated with IL-6 increased EPO expression slightly above that in non-treated cells. Specifically, EPO levels in control cells was approximately 20 mIU/ml, while that in cells treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 was approximately 50 mIU/ml.</p>
      <p id="p-00237-en" num="0221">Hep3B cells treated with compound A or compound B without IL-6 showed increased EPO levels in a dose-dependent manner. Hep3B cells treated with compound A or compound B in the presence of TL-6, however, showed a significant increase in EPO levels. (See <figref>FIGS. 27A and 27B</figref>.) The effect of compound treatment on EPO production in the presence of IL-6 was synergistic. For example, Hep3B cells treated with 10 ng/ml IL-6 showed approximately 50 mIU/ml EPO levels. Treatment of Hep3B cells with 10 mM compound A or compound B in the absence of IL-6 resulted in approximately 60 mIU/ml EPO and 220 mIU/ml, respectively. In the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-6, compound A and compound B addition increased EPO levels to approximately 270 mIU/ml and to greater than 400 mIU/ml, respectively. Therefore, compounds of the present invention acted synergistically with IL-6 at inducing EPO expression in hepatocytes.</p>

      <p id="p-00238-en" num="0222">The cell line TF-1 (human erythroleukemia; ATCC cat #CRL-2003) is stimulated to proliferate in response to EPO addition. In the presence of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, the EPO-mediated increase in TF-1 cell proliferation is attenuated. To determine the effects of prolyl hydroxylase inhibition on TF-1 cell proliferation, TF-1 cells are treated with the various concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, or IFN-Î³ in the absence or presence of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, and EPO-mediated cell proliferation is measured as follows. Triplicate wells of cells cultured in 96-well microtiter plates are incubated with serum-free medium in the absence or presence of EPO for 24 hours. During the final 4 hours of culture, 1 Î¼Ci of tritiated thymidine (<sup>3</sup>H-TdR; Amersham) is added to each well. Cell responsiveness to EPO receptor signaling is determined by measuring cell proliferation. Cell proliferation is measured by quantitating the amount of <sup>3</sup>H-TdR incorporated into cells, first by lysing the cells with water and then capturing the DNA on nylon filters in a cell harvester.</p>
      <p id="p-00239-en" num="0223">Alternatively, single cell suspensions of splenic cells obtained from phenylhydrazine-treated animals, which lead to prevalence of EPO responsive progenitors in spleen, are used as the source of EPO responsive cells. EPO-mediated proliferation is then assessed ex vivo as described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0224">TF-1 cells treated with EPO results in an increase in cell proliferation, as determined by an increase in tritiated thymidine incorporation. Addition of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TL-1Î², TNF-Î±, or IFN-Î³ to EPO-treated TF-1 cells results in decreased responsiveness to EPO, leading to decreased cell proliferation. The effect of addition of the present compounds on the inhibitory effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on EPO-mediated cell proliferation in TF-1 cells is determined. Increased cell proliferation, as measured by increased tritiated thymidine incorporation, in TF-1 cells treated with EPO and pro-inflammatory cytokines indicates that compounds and methods of the present invention overcome the suppressive effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on EPO-mediated increase in cell proliferation.</p>

      <p id="p-00243-en" num="0226">As shown above in Table 1, addition of various compounds of the present invention to cells increased expression of transferrin receptor. Inhibition of HIF prolyl hydroxylation using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors of the present invention increased transferrin receptor expression in cells. Increased transferrin receptor expression using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors of the present invention was observed in liver cells (e.g., Hep3B, HepG2), kidney cells (e.g., HK-2), and lymphocytes (e.g., THP-1). Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing transferrin receptor expression in various cell types. In addition, increased transferrin receptor expression would result in increased transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis of ferric transferrin, thereby increasing iron transport, utilization, storage, and metabolism. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for enhancing erythropoiesis by increasing iron transport, utilization, storage, and metabolism.</p>

Primary monocytes and macrophage, and monocyte and macrophage cell lines (e.g., THP-1), are treated for one, two, or three days with various concentrations of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Cells are then examined for the presence of cell surface transferrin receptor using fluorescent immunostaining and flow cytometry. Results showing that addition of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors increase cell surface transferrin receptor expression indicates effectiveness of prolyl hydroxylase inhibition at increasing transferrin binding and, therefore, iron binding, to cells. A change in iron uptake by cells treated with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors is determined as follows. Cells are treated with compound in the presence of <sup>59</sup>Fe. Increased iron uptake by cells treated with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors is determined by measuring cell-associated <sup>59</sup>Fe.

      <p id="p-00245-en" num="0228">The regulation of iron uptake, storage, and utilization occur, in part, through the expression and activity of key proteins involved in iron metabolism, including trans-acting proteins known as iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs). IRP-1 and IRP-2 control mRNA stability and translation by binding to specific iron-responsive elements in various mRNAs of proteins involved in iron metabolism, thereby affecting virtually all aspects of iron metabolism. Iron deficiency increases IRP activity, resulting in increased transferrin receptor expression and reduced ferritin expression. Likewise, in the presence of iron, IRP activity decreases, leading to decreased transferrin receptor expression and increased ferritin expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00246-en" num="0229">To examine the effect of the present compounds on various aspects of iron metabolism, the following experiment is performed. Mouse Hepa-1 cells are treated with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors for up to 48 hours. The cells are then harvested and cell lysates analyzed for IRP-2 expression by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for IRP-2 (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc., San Antonio Tex.). Results showing increased levels of cytoplasmic IRP-2 following addition of compound demonstrates that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing IRP levels and therefore iron metabolism.</p>
      <p id="p-00247-en" num="0230">The effect of compounds of the invention on IRP-2 activity, as measured by changes in ferritin and transferrin expression, is determined as follows. Mouse RAW 264.1 macrophage cell line is treated with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors for up to 48 hours. Cells are then harvested and analyzed for ferritin and transferrin protein expression by immunoblotting (ADI, catalogue #IRP21-S). Decreased levels of ferritin expression and increased levels of transferrin expression following prolyl hydroxylase inhibition indicates that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for stabilizing and increasing the activity of IRP-2. Increased expression of IRP-2 decreases expression of ferritin, which is responsible for long-term storage of iron, and increases expression of transferrin and transferrin receptor, facilitating iron uptake, transport, and utilization, thus enhancing erythropoiesis. By increasing expression and activity of IRP-2, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for decreasing expression of ferritin and associated long-term storage of iron, and increasing expression of transferrin and transferrin receptor. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing iron uptake, transport, and utilization, and are thus useful for enhancing erythropoiesis.</p>

      <p id="p-00257-en" num="0239">Animals used in the following examples include Swiss Webster male mice (30-32 g), Sprague Dawley male rats (200-350 g) and Lewis female rates obtained from Simonsen, Inc. (Gilroy, Calif.), Charles River (Hollister, Calif.), or Harlan. Animals were maintained using standard procedures, and food and water were available to the animals ad libitum. During treatment, animals were monitored for changes in body weight and signs of overt toxicity and mortality.</p>
      <p id="p-00258-en" num="0240">Compounds were generally administered orally by gavage or IV administration. Animals treated by oral gavage received a 4-10 ml/kg volume of either 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis Mo.) with or without 0.1% Polysorbate 80 (0 mg/kg/day) or varying doses of a compound of the present invention (e.g., a HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor) in 0.5% CMC, with or without 0.1% Polysorbate 80, using various dosing regimens. Blood samples were collected at appropriate intervals during treatment from, e.g., tail vein (rats), or abdominal vein or cardiocentesis (mice or rats). Generally, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood samples were collected into MICROTAINER serum separator tubes (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes N.J.). For measurement of serum components, the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4Â° C. for 10 minutes. The serum fraction was then processed and analyzed for the presence of specific components, e.g., serum iron (assay performed by Quality Clinical Labs, Mountain View, Calif.). For determination of hematocrit, blood samples were collected into MICROTAINER EDTA-2K tubes (Becton-Dickinson); EDTA-blood was then drawn into 75 mmÃ1.1-1.2 mm I.D. capillary tubes (Chase Scientific Glass, Inc., Rockwood Tenn.) to approximately Â¾ length, one end of the tube was sealed with CRITOSEAL sealant (Sherwood Medical Company), and the tubes were centrifuged in a J-503M MICROHEMATOCRIT centrifuge (Jorgensen Laboratories, Inc., Loveland Colo.) at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes. Hematocrit was read against a reader card. When indicated, complete blood count (CBC) analysis, including blood hemoglobin level, reticulocyte number, and hematocrit, was performed by Quality Clinical Labs (Mountain View, Calif.).</p>
      <p id="p-00259-en" num="0241">At the end of each study, animals were euthanized, e.g. by exsanguinations under general anesthesia or by CO<sub>2 </sub>asphyxiation, and organ and tissue samples were collected. Tissues were either fixed in neutral buffered formalin or stored frozen at â70Â° C. Tissues for genomic analysis were placed in RNAlater.</p>

      <p id="p-00260-en" num="0242">Swiss Webster male mice were treated as described above with a single dose of 0.5% CMC (Sigma-Aldrich) (0 mg/kg) or 100 mg/kg compound A. At 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, or 72 hours post-administration, animals were anesthetized, sacrificed, and tissue samples of kidney, liver, brain, lung, and heart were isolated and stored in RNALATER solution (Ambion) at â80Â° C. Alternatively, animals were treated to 4 consecutive daily doses of 0.5% CMC (0 mg/kg/day), 7.5 mg/ml compound A in 0.5% CMC (30 mg/kg/day), or 25 mg/ml compound A in 0.5% CMC (100 mg/kg/day). Four hours after administration of the final dose, animals were anesthetized, sacrificed, and approximately 150 mg of liver and each kidney were isolated and stored in RNALATER solution (Ambion) at â20Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00261-en" num="0243">RNA isolation was carried out using the following protocol. A section of each organ was diced, 875 Î¼l of RLT buffer (RNEASY kit; Qiagen Inc., Valencia Calif.) was added, and the pieces were homogenized for about 20 seconds using a rotor-stator POLYTRON homogenizer (Kinematica, Inc., Cincinnati Ohio). The homogenate was micro-centrifuged for 3 minutes to pellet insoluble material, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and RNA was isolated using an RNEASY kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was eluted into 80 Î¼L of water and quantitated with RIBOGREEN reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene Oreg.). The absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was measured to determine RNA purity and concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00262-en" num="0244">Alternatively, tissue samples were diced and homogenized in TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad Calif.) using a rotor-stator POLYTRON homogenizer (Kinematica). Homogenates were brought to room temperature, 0.2 volumes chloroform was added, and samples were mixed vigorously. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for several minutes and then were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4Â° C. The aqueous phase was collected and 0.5 volumes of isopropanol were added. Samples were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 g at 4Â° C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with 75% EtOH and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4Â° C. The absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was measured to determine RNA purity and concentration.</p>
      <p id="p-00263-en" num="0245">RNA was precipitated in 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 50 ng/ml glycogen, and 2.5 volumes of ethanol for one hour at â20Â° C. Samples were centrifuged and pellets were washed with cold 80% ethanol, dried, and resuspend in water. Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using a T7-(dT)24 first strand primer (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara Calif.) and the SUPERSCRIPT CHOICE system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The final cDNA was extracted with an equal volume of 25:24:1 phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol using a PHASE LOCK GEL insert (Brinkman, Inc., Westbury N.Y.). The aqueous phase was collected and cDNA was precipitated using 0.5 volumes of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Alternatively, cDNA was purified using the GENECHIP sample cleanup module (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
      <p id="p-00264-en" num="0246">Biotin-labeled cRNA was synthesized from the cDNA in an in vitro translation (IVT) reaction using a BIOARRAY HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Inc., Farmingdale N.Y.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Final labeled product was purified and fragmented using the GENECHIP sample cleanup module (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
      <p id="p-00265-en" num="0247">Hybridization cocktail was prepared by bringing 5 Î¼g probe to 100 Î¼l in 1Ã hybridization buffer (100 mM MES, 1 M [Na<sup>+</sup>], 20 mM EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20), 100 Î¼g/ml herring sperm DNA, 500 Î¼g/ml acetylated BSA, 0.03 nM control oligo B2 (Affymetrix), and 1Ã GENECHIP eukaryotic hybridization control (Affymetrix). The cocktail was sequentially incubated at 99Â° C. for 5 minutes and 45Â° C. for 5 minutes, and then centrifuged for 5 minutes. The Murine genome MOE430Aplus2 array (Affymetrix) was brought to room temperature and then prehybridized with 1Ã hybridization buffer at 45Â° C. for 10 minutes with rotation. The buffer was then replaced with 80 Î¼l hybridization cocktail and the array was hybridized for 16 hours at 45Â° C. at 60 rpm with counter balance. Following hybridization, arrays were washed once with 6ÃSSPE, 0.1% Tween 20, and then washed and stained using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene Oreg.), goat anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame Calif.), and a GENECHIP Fluidics Station 400 instrument (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's EukGE-WS2v4 protocol (Affymetrix). Arrays were analyzed using a GENEARRAY scanner (Affymetrix) and Microarray Suite software (Affymetrix).</p>

      <p id="p-00269-en" num="0250">Data shown in Table 3 above demonstrated that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing ceruloplasmin gene expression. Ceruloplasmin, also known as a ferroxidase-1, converts reduced iron released from storage sites (such as ferritin) to the oxidized form. Oxidized iron is able to bind to its plasma transport protein, transferrin. Ceruloplasmin deficiencies are associated with accumulation of iron in liver and other tissues. Evidence indicates that ceruloplasmin promotes efflux of iron from the liver and promotes influx of iron into iron-deficient cells. (See, e.g., Tran et al. (2002) J Nutr 132:351-356.)</p>

      <p id="p-00272-en" num="0252">As shown above in Table 4, administration of compound A resulted in reduced expression of hepcidin mRNA in mouse liver. Decreased hepcidin expression is associated with increased iron release from reticuloendothelial cells and increased intestinal iron absorption. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for decreasing hepcidin expression and increasing intestinal iron absorption.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows relative expression levels of the transferrin receptor (gray bars) in kidney, and the gut duodenal iron transporter NRAMP2 (natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein 2) (also known as Slc11a2 (solute carrier family 11, proton-coupled divalent metal ion transporter, member 2), alternatively called DCT1 (divalent cation transporter 1), DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1)) (black bars).</p>
      <p id="p-00274-en" num="0254">In another experiment, mRNA was isolated from small intestine harvested 4 hours following IV administration of 60 mg/kg compound A, compound B, and compound C to mice. Probes were prepared from each of two animals from 5 treatment groups, and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse MOE430Aplus2 microarrays (one animal per array). Statistical comparisons of data obtained from arrays from treated versus non-treated animals was performed. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> shows relative expression levels of NRAMP2 mRNA in small intestine in animals treated with compound A, compound B, and compound C. Expression levels are shown as fold-induction over control, untreated animals for each expressed gene. The results from these experiments indicated that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing expression of NRAMP2 in intestine. These results further suggested that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing iron absorption, thereby increasing iron availability for heme synthesis, hemoglobin synthesis, red blood cell production, and erythropoiesis.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6C</figref> shows the fold-induction of 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) expression in treated animals as compared to vehicle control. The data showed that treatment of normal animals with prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors resulted in increased expression of genes involved in iron metabolism, including genes involved in iron absorption from the gut and iron transport in the periphery via transferrin receptors. Expression of these genes returned to baseline (control) levels 16 hours after dosing. The data also showed coordinate expression of ALAS-2, the first enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway and rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis, in the indicated tissues after prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor treatment. Together these results showed compounds of the present invention coordinated increases in expression of genes encoding proteins involved in promoting erythropoiesis, including iron absorption, iron transport, and heme synthesis.</p>

Activity is shown for compound treatment by detecting increased macrophage transferrin receptor expression. Also, plasma can be collected and tested for levels of transferrin using a commercially available ELISA kit (see, e.g., KomaBiotech, Korea).</p>

      <p id="p-00277-en" num="0257">The effect of administration of the present compounds on erythropoiesis is determined as follows. Normal mice are made anemic and maintained in an anemic state by chronic administration of TNF-Î±, a regimen known to inhibit erythropoiesis due to lack of EPO production and signaling in response to TNF-Î±. After inducing anemia over a one- to four-week period, animals are administered prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors. Tissues are examined for BFU-E and CFU-E production, and blood samples are analyzed for composition. Results showing increases in the numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E in the marrow, spleen, and periphery, and/or increases serum hemoglobin, reticulocytes, and hematocrit in animals treated with PHIs demonstrate efficacy.</p>
      <p id="p-00278-en" num="0258">Another experimental animal model is useful for examining the effect of administration of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors on erythropoiesis. In this model, transgenic mice develop anemia of chronic disease as a result of constitutively over expressing TNF-Î±. Following onset of anemia in these mice, prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors are administered for various periods of time and using various dosing strategies. Tissue and blood samples are then collected and analyzed. As described above, results showing increases in the numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E in the marrow, spleen and periphery, and/or increased serum hemoglobin, reticulocytes and hematocrit, effectively demonstrate that anemia associated with TNF-Î±overproduction in transgenic animals is treated by administration of prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors using methods and compounds of the present invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0261">Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is associated with various inflammatory conditions, including arthritis, neoplastic disease, and other disorders associated with chronic inflammation. A rat model of ACD was used to examine the effects of HIF stabilization using methods and compounds of the present invention on treating anemia associated with chronic disease. In this animal model, ACD is induced in rats by peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers. (See, e.g., Sartor et al. (1989) Infection and Immunity 57:1177-1185.) In this model, animals develop severe, acute anemia in the initial stages, followed by moderately severe chronic microcytic anemia in later stages.</p>

PG-PS 10S contains purified peptidoglycan-polysaccharide polymers isolated from the cell wall of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>, Group A, D58 strain. Arthritis and anemia were allowed to develop for 35 days. On day 35, blood samples (approximately 400 Î¼l) were taken from the tail vein under general anesthesia (Isoflurane) for CBC and reticulocyte counts (performed by Quality Clinical Labs). Animals with a spun hematocrit level at or above 45% were considered non-anemic and were removed from the study.</p>

Reticulocytes levels were approximately 2% and 4% of red cells in control (non-anemic) and anemic (PG-PS treated) animals, respectively. Reticulocyte levels in treated animals, however, were approximately 10% of red cell counts. Compound A treatment increased reticulocyte count in anemic animals. Therefore, compound A stimulated erythropoiesis in a rat animal model of ACD.</p>

Administration of compound A to anemic animals increased hematocrit levels to approximately 37% as early as 5 days after initiation of compound treatment. Following a second dosing of compound A, hematocrit levels increased to approximately 40%, comparable to hematocrit levels observed in control non-anemic animals. Compound A increased hematocrit in anemic animals using a rat model of ACD. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing hematocrit and treating anemia of chronic disease.</p>

Mean corpuscular volume in treated animals remained elevated compared to non-treated anemic animals over the duration of the experiment. These results showed that compound A improved (i.e., reduced) the level of microcytosis (i.e., microcythemia, the presence of many microcytes, abnormally small red blood cells associated with various forms of anemia).

(Week 0 in <figref>FIG. 16</figref> corresponds to day 28 in this experimental protocol.) Administration of compound A to anemic animals resulted in reduction of the decrease in mean corpuscular volume. Therefore, inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase using compounds and methods of the present invention was effective at reducing the decrease in mean corpuscular volume associated with anemia of chronic disease and anemia associated with iron deficiency, restoring mean corpuscular volume, maintaining mean corpuscular volume, etc. This data further indicated that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing iron availability from storage for use in hemoglobin production.</p>

These results indicated that anemia of chronic disease is associated with reduced expression of proteins involved in iron absorption. Anemic animals treated with compound A, however, showed increased expression of both NRAMP2 and sproutin in intestine (<figref>FIG. 19</figref>). These results indicated that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for increasing expression of genes associated with iron transport and absorption. Additionally, these results suggested that compounds of the present invention increase iron absorption and transport in healthy subjects and in subjects with anemia of chronic disease.</p>

      <heading id="h-00070-en" level="1">Enhanced Erythropoiesis in Human Subjects</heading>
      <p id="p-00302-en" num="0281">The effect of prolyl hydroxylase inhibition on erythropoiesis in human subjects was examined as follows. An oral dose of 20 mg/kg of compound A was administered either two or three times per week for four weeks to healthy human volunteers. At various times following compound administration, blood was drawn for analysis of EPO, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell counts, soluble transferrin receptor, and serum ferritin levels.</p>
      <heading id="h-00071-en" level="2">Reticulocyte Count</heading>
      <p id="p-00303-en" num="0282">As shown in <figref>FIG. 20</figref>, administration of compound A to human subjects increased reticulocyte counts above that of placebo control. Increased reticulocyte counts occurred in subjects administered compound twice or three-times weekly. Reticulocyte levels increased to greater than approximately 1.7% of red blood cells in treated individuals, compared to levels of approximately 1.4% in non-treated individuals. Compound A administration increased reticulocyte counts in human subjects. Therefore, methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for enhancing erythropoiesis and thereby increasing reticulocyte levels.</p>
      <heading id="h-00072-en" level="2">Hematocrit</heading>
      <p id="p-00304-en" num="0283">Hematocrit levels were increased in human subjects treated with compound A. In human subjects administered compound A twice weekly for three weeks, hematocrit levels were greater than 46% compared to approximately 44% in placebo control subjects. Compound A increased hematocrit in human subjects. Therefore, compounds and methods of the present invention are useful for enhancing erythropoiesis and thereby increasing hematocrit.</p>
      <heading id="h-00073-en" level="2">Red Blood Cell Count</heading>
      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0284">Administration of compound A increased red blood cell count in human subjects. As shown in <figref>FIG. 21</figref>, red blood cell counts were increased in human subjects treated with 20 mg/kg compound A, either twice weekly or three-times per week, compared to non-treated placebo control subjects. These data indicated that methods and compounds of the present invention are useful for enhancing erythropoiesis and thereby increasing red blood cell count.</p>
      <heading id="h-00074-en" level="2">Iron StatusâSoluble Transferrin Receptor and Serum Ferritin</heading>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0285">Results shown above indicated methods and compounds of the present invention are effective at increasing reticulocyte count, red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit in human subjects. As shown in <figref>FIG. 22</figref>, administration of compound A to human subjects increased soluble transferrin receptor levels above that observed in non-treated control subjects. Increased soluble transferrin levels were observed human subjects treated twice or three-times weekly. A maximum response of 35% and 31% was observed on day 21 in patients treated 2-times and 3-times per week, respectively. Mean plasma concentrations of sTfR in placebo patients was unchanged. Additionally, serum ferritin levels decreased approximately 46% in human subject treated with compound A, indicative of increased iron utilization in these subjects. (See <figref>FIG. 23</figref>.)</p>
      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0286">Taken together, these data indicated that HIF stabilization using compounds and methods of the present invention resulted in increased mobilization of iron stores, increased transport of iron to bone marrow, and increased utilization of iron for hemoglobin synthesis, erythropoiesis, and red cell production.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0287">Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those shown and described herein, will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
