      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to cleaning and/or detergent compositions comprising metalloproteases (E.C 3.4.24). The invention further concerns new metalloproteases from <i>Alicyclobacillus </i>sp. and the use of thereof in cleaning processes, such as dish wash and laundry. Further the invention concerns methods of doing cleaning, such as dish wash and laundry.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The detergent industry has for more than 30 years implemented different enzymes in detergent formulations, most commonly used enzymes includes proteases, amylases and lipases each adapted for removing various types of stains. In addition to the enzymes detergent compositions typically include a complex combination of ingredients. For example, most cleaning products include surfactant system, bleaching agents or builders. Despite the complexity of current detergents, there remains a need for developing new detergent compositions comprising new enzymes and/or enzyme blends.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Metalloproteases are proteolytic enzymes having an absolute requirement for metal ion for their activity. Most metalloproteases are zinc-dependent, although some use other transition metals. Metalloproteases have been widely used in different industries like food and brewing industry. One group of metalloproteases is the M4 family metalloproteases which have been used, in various applications. For example, the M4 metalloprotease known as Thermolysin has been used as a nonspecific proteinase to obtain fragments for peptide sequencing such as described in, e.g., EP 0 316 725. It has also been used as a peptide synthetase as described in WO 2000/37486, disclosing a method for production of the artificial sweetener aspartame. Another M4 metalloprotease is the <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens </i>metalloprotease, also known as NeutraseÂ®, which has been used for many years as an additive in various food and feed products and, e.g., in brewing. This metalloprotease has also been described for use in detergent and cleaning compositions and processes as described, e.g., in WO 2007/044993, use of storage-stable metalloproteases in detergent or WO 2009/058518, and EP 1 288 282 (Unilever), which describes a blend of a metalloprotease and a serine protease for use in dish washing. WO 2000/60042 also describes detergent compositions containing a metalloprotease.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, the use of metalloproteases in the detergent industry has been very limited and focus has been on the use of the metalloproteases NeutraseÂ® and/or âNprEâ as set forth in WO 2007/044993. Generally, metalloproteases are very unstable under conventional wash conditions and in conventional detergent compositions. Thus, the use of metalloproteases in wash and cleaning processes and in detergents has been limited.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The increased focus on improving the washing processes in order to make them more environmental friendly has resulted in a global tendency to lowering wash time, pH and temperature, decreasing the amount of detergent components which may influence the environment negatively. The present invention is directed to these and other important ends.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0017">The term âprotease activityâ or âpeptidase activityâ is defined herein as the ability to break down the amide bond of a protein by hydrolysis of the peptide bonds that link amino acids together in a polypeptide chain.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0018">The term âmetalloproteaseâ as used herein refers to a protease having one or more metal ions in the binding/active site.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0019">The term âM4 Metalloprotease Familyâ or âM4 Metalloproteaseâ or âM4â as used herein means a polypeptide falling into the M4 metalloprotease family according to Rawlings et al., Biochem. J., 290, 205-218 (1993) and as further described in MEROPSâ(Rawlings et al., MEROPS: the peptidase database, Nucl Acids Res, 34 Database issue, D270-272, 2006). The M4 metalloproteases are neutral metalloproteases containing mainly endopeptidases. All peptidases in the family bind a single, catalytic zinc ion. M4 metalloprotease family members include the common HEXXH motif, where the histidine residues serve as zinc ligands and glutamate is an active site residue. M4 metalloproteases have a pH optimum mainly at neutral pH. The M4 metalloprotease family includes, e.g., NeutraseÂ® (classified as MEROPS subclass M04.014), Thermolysin, Bacillolysin, vibriolysin, pseudolysin, Msp peptidase, coccolysin, aureolysin, vimelysin, lambda toxin neutral peptidase B, PA peptidase (<i>Aeromonas</i>-type), griselysin, stearolysin, MprIII (<i>Alteromonas </i>sp. strain O-7), pap6 peptidase, neutral peptidase (<i>Thermoactinomyces</i>-type), ZmpA peptidase (<i>Burkholderia </i>sp.), zpx peptidase, PrtS peptidase (<i>Photorhabdus luminescens</i>), protealysin, ZmpB peptidase (<i>Burkholderia </i>sp.). The M4 metalloprotease family of polypeptides have been further characterized and presently includes, according to MEROPS, at least twenty-two subclasses for which a distinct MEROPS ID (i.e., an identifier of the formula M04.xxx) has been assigned, as well as non-peptidase homologues and unassigned peptidases.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0020">The term âisolated polypeptideâ as used herein refers to a polypeptide that is isolated from a source. In one aspect, the variant or polypeptide is at least 20% pure, more preferably at least 40% pure, more preferably at least 60% pure, even more preferably at least 80% pure, most preferably at least 90% pure and even most preferably at least 95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0021">The term âsubstantially pure polypeptideâ denotes herein a polypeptide preparation that contains at most 10%, preferably at most 8%, more preferably at most 6%, more preferably at most 5%, more preferably at most 4%, more preferably at most 3%, even more preferably at most 2%, most preferably at most 1%, and even most preferably at most 0.5% by weight of other polypeptide material with which it is natively or recombinantly associated. It is, therefore, preferred that the substantially pure polypeptide is at least 92% pure, preferably at least 94% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, more preferably at least 96% pure, more preferably at least 97% pure, more preferably at least 98% pure, even more preferably at least 99%, most preferably at least 99.5% pure, and even most preferably 100% pure by weight of the total polypeptide material present in the preparation. The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably in a substantially pure form. This can be accomplished, for example, by preparing the polypeptide by well-known recombinant methods or by classical purification methods.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0022">The term âmature polypeptide coding sequenceâ means a polynucleotide that encodes a mature polypeptide having protease activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0023">The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter âsequence identityâ. For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>48: 443-453) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, <i>Trends in Genetics </i>16: 276-277; http://emboss.org), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EBLOSUM62 (EMBOSS version of BLOSUM62) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled âlongest identityâ (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae](Identical ResiduesÃ100)/(Length of AlignmentâTotal Number of Gaps in Alignment)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0024">For purposes of the present invention, the degree of identity between two deoxyribonucleotide sequences is determined using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970, supra) as implemented in the Needle program of the EMBOSS package (EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Rice et al., 2000, supra; http://emboss.org), preferably version 3.0.0 or later. The optional parameters used are gap open penalty of 10, gap extension penalty of 0.5, and the EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix. The output of Needle labeled âlongest identityâ (obtained using the -nobrief option) is used as the percent identity and is calculated as follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae](Identical DeoxyribonucleotidesÃ100)/(Length of AlignmentâTotal Number of Gaps in Alignment)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0025">The term âfragmentâ means a polypeptide having one or more (several) amino acids deleted from the amino and/or carboxyl terminus of a mature polypeptide; wherein the fragment has protease activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0026">The term âfunctional fragment of a polypeptideâ or âfunctional fragment thereofâ is used to describe a polypeptide which is derived from a longer polypeptide, e.g., a mature polypeptide, and which has been truncated either in the N-terminal region or the C-terminal region or in both regions to generate a fragment of the parent polypeptide. To be a functional polypeptide the fragment must maintain at least 20%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably at least 100% of the protease activity of the full-length/mature polypeptide. An M4 metalloprotease may be truncated such that certain domain is removed to generate a functional fragment, which may be polypeptides where less than 200 amino acids have been removed from the mature M4 Metalloprotease, preferably less than 150 amino acids, more preferably less than 120, 100, 80, 60, 40, 30 amino acids, even more preferably less than 20 amino acids and most preferably less than 10 amino acids have been removed from the mature polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0027">The term âsubsequenceâ means a polynucleotide having one or more (several) nucleotides deleted from the 5â² and/or 3â² end of a mature polypeptide coding sequence; wherein the subsequence encodes a fragment having protease activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0028">The term âallelic variantâ means any of two or more alternative forms of a gene occupying the same chromosomal locus. Allelic variation arises naturally through mutation, and may result in polymorphism within populations. Gene mutations can be silent (no change in the encoded polypeptide) or may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequences. An allelic variant of a polypeptide is a polypeptide encoded by an allelic variant of a gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0029">The term âvariantâ means a polypeptide having metalloprotease activity comprising an alteration, i.e., a substitution, insertion, and/or deletion of one or more (several) amino acid residues at one or more (several) positions. A substitution means a replacement of an amino acid occupying a position with a different amino acid; a deletion means removal of an amino acid occupying a position; and an insertion means adding 1-3 amino acids adjacent to an amino acid occupying a position.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0030">The terms âcleaning compositionsâ and âcleaning formulations,â refer to compositions that find use in the removal of undesired compounds from items to be cleaned, such as fabric, carpets, dishware including glassware, contact lenses, hard surfaces such as tiles, zincs, floors, and table surfaces, hair (shampoos), skin (soaps and creams), teeth (mouthwashes, toothpastes), etc. The terms encompasses any materials/compounds selected for the particular type of cleaning composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid, gel, granule, or spray compositions), as long as the composition is compatible with the metalloprotease and other enzyme(s) used in the composition. The specific selection of cleaning composition materials is readily made by considering the surface, item or fabric to be cleaned, and the desired form of the composition for the cleaning conditions during use. These terms further refer to any composition that is suited for cleaning, bleaching, disinfecting, and/or sterilizing any object and/or surface. It is intended that the terms include, but are not limited to detergent composition (e.g., liquid and/or solid laundry detergents and fine fabric detergents; hard surface cleaning formulations, such as for glass, wood, ceramic and metal counter tops and windows; carpet cleaners; oven cleaners; fabric fresheners; fabric softeners; and textile and laundry pre-spotters, as well as dish detergents).</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0031">The term âdetergent compositionâ, includes unless otherwise indicated, granular or powder-form all-purpose or heavy-duty washing agents, especially cleaning detergents; liquid, gel or paste-form all-purpose washing agents, especially the so-called heavy-duty liquid (HDL) types; liquid fine-fabric detergents; hand dishwashing agents or light duty dishwashing agents, especially those of the high-foaming type; machine dishwashing agents, including the various tablet, granular, liquid and rinse-aid types for household and institutional use; liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, including antibacterial hand-wash types, cleaning bars, mouthwashes, denture cleaners, car or carpet shampoos, bathroom cleaners; hair shampoos and hair-rinses; shower gels, foam baths; metal cleaners; as well as cleaning auxiliaries such as bleach additives and âstain-stickâ or pre-treat types.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0032">The terms âdetergent compositionâ and âdetergent formulationâ are used in reference to mixtures which are intended for use in a wash medium for the cleaning of soiled objects. In some embodiments, the term is used in reference to laundering fabrics and/or garments (e.g., âlaundry detergentsâ). In alternative embodiments, the term refers to other detergents, such as those used to clean dishes, cutlery, etc. (e.g., âdishwashing detergentsâ). It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular detergent formulation or composition. It is intended that in addition to the metalloprotease according to the invention, the term encompasses detergents that contains, e.g., surfactants, builders, chelators or chelating agents, bleach system or bleach components, polymers, fabric conditioners, foam boosters, suds suppressors, dyes, perfume, tannish inhibitors, optical brighteners, bactericides, fungicides, soil suspending agents, anti corrosion agents, enzyme inhibitors or stabilizers, enzyme activators, transferase(s), hydrolytic enzymes, oxido reductases, bluing agents and fluorescent dyes, antioxidants, and solubilizers.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0033">The term âfabricâ encompasses any textile material. Thus, it is intended that the term encompass garments, as well as fabrics, yarns, fibers, non-woven materials, natural materials, synthetic materials, and any other textile material.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0034">The term âtextileâ refers to woven fabrics, as well as staple fibers and filaments suitable for conversion to or use as yarns, woven, knit, and non-woven fabrics. The term encompasses yarns made from natural, as well as synthetic (e.g., manufactured) fibers. The term, âtextile materialsâ is a general term for fibers, yarn intermediates, yarn, fabrics, and products made from fabrics (e.g., garments and other articles).</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0035">The term ânon-fabric detergent compositionsâ include non-textile surface detergent compositions, including but not limited to dishwashing detergent compositions, oral detergent compositions, denture detergent compositions, and personal cleansing compositions.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0036">The term âeffective amount of enzymeâ refers to the quantity of enzyme necessary to achieve the enzymatic activity required in the specific application, e.g., in a defined detergent composition. Such effective amounts are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art and are based on many factors, such as the particular enzyme used, the cleaning application, the specific composition of the detergent composition, and whether a liquid or dry (e.g., granular, bar) composition is required, and the like. The term âeffective amountâ of a metalloprotease refers to the quantity of metalloprotease described hereinbefore that achieves a desired level of enzymatic activity, e.g., in a defined detergent composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0037">The term âwash performanceâ of an enzyme refers to the contribution of an enzyme to washing that provides additional cleaning performance to the detergent without the addition of the enzyme to the composition. Wash performance is compared under relevant washing conditions. Wash performance of enzymes is conveniently measured by their ability to remove certain representative stains under appropriate test conditions. In these test systems, other relevant factors, such as detergent composition, detergent concentration, water hardness, washing mechanics, time, pH, and/or temperature, can be controlled in such a way that conditions typical for household application in a certain market segment are imitated.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0038">The term âwater hardnessâ or âdegree of hardnessâ or âdHâ or âÂ°dHâ as used herein refers to German degrees of hardness. One degree is defined as 10 milligrams of calcium oxide per litre of water.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0039">The term ârelevant washing conditionsâ is used herein to indicate the conditions, particularly washing temperature, time, washing mechanics, detergent concentration, type of detergent and water hardness, actually used in households in a detergent market segment.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0040">The term âimproved propertyâ is used to indicate that a better end result is obtained in a property compared to the same process performed without the enzyme. Exemplary properties which are preferably improved in the processes of the present invention include wash performance, enzyme stability, enzyme activity and substrate specificity.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0041">The term âimproved wash performanceâ is used to indicate that a better end result is obtained in stain removal from items washed (e.g., fabrics or dishware and/or cutlery) under relevant washing conditions as compared to no enzyme or to a reference enzyme, or that less enzyme, on weight basis, is needed to obtain the same end result relative to no enzyme or to a reference enzyme. Improved wash performance could in this context also be that the same effect, e.g., stain removal effect is obtained in shorter wash time, e.g., the enzymes provide their effect more quickly under the tested conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0042">The term âretained wash performanceâ is used to indicate that the wash performance of an enzyme, on weight basis, is at least 80 percent relative to another enzyme under relevant washing conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0043">The term âenzyme detergencyâ or âdetergencyâ or âdetergency effectâ is defined herein as the advantageous effect an enzyme may add to a detergent compared to the same detergent without the enzyme. Important detergency benefits which can be provided by enzymes are stain removal with no or very little visible soils after washing and/or cleaning, prevention or reduction of redeposition of soils released in the washing process an effect that also is termed anti-redeposition, restoring fully or partly the whiteness of textiles, which originally were white but after repeated use and wash have obtained a greyish or yellowish appearance an effect that also is termed whitening. Textile care benefits, which are not directly related to catalytic stain removal or prevention of redeposition of soils, are also important for enzyme detergency benefits. Examples of such textile care benefits are prevention or reduction of dye transfer from one fabric to another fabric or another part of the same fabric an effect that is also termed dye transfer inhibition or anti-back staining, removal of protruding or broken fibers from a fabric surface to decrease pilling tendencies or remove already existing pills or fuzz an effect that also is termed anti-pilling, improvement of the fabric-softness, colour clarification of the fabric and removal of particulate soils which are trapped in the fibers of the fabric or garment. Enzymatic bleaching is a further enzyme detergency benefit where the catalytic activity generally is used to catalyze the formation of bleaching component such as hydrogen peroxide or other peroxides.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0044">The term âanti-redepositionâ as used herein describes the reduction or prevention of redeposition of soils dissolved or suspended in the wash liquor onto the cleaned objects. Redeposition may be seen after one or multiple washing cycles (e.g., as a greying, yellowing or other discolorations).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0045">The term âadjunct materialsâ means any liquid, solid or gaseous material selected for the particular type of detergent composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid, granule, powder, bar, paste, spray, tablet, gel, or foam composition), which materials are also preferably compatible with the metalloprotease enzyme used in the composition. In some embodiments, granular compositions are in âcompactâ form, while in other embodiments, the liquid compositions are in a âconcentratedâ form.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0046">The term âstain removing enzymeâ as used herein, describes an enzyme that aids the removal of a stain or soil from a fabric or a hard surface. Stain removing enzymes act on specific substrates, e.g., protease on protein, amylase on starch, lipase and cutinase on lipids (fats and oils), pectinase on pectin and hemicellulases on hemicellulose. Stains are often depositions of complex mixtures of different components which either results in a local discolouration of the material by itself or which leaves a sticky surface on the object which may attract soils dissolved in the washing liquor thereby resulting in discolouration of the stained area. When an enzyme acts on its specific substrate present in a stain the enzyme degrades or partially degrades its substrate thereby aiding the removal of soils and stain components associated with the substrate during the washing process. For example, when a protease acts on a grass stain it degrades the protein components in the grass and allows the green/brown colour to be released during washing.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0047">The term âreduced amountâ means in this context that the amount of the component is smaller than the amount which would be used in a reference process under otherwise the same conditions. In a preferred embodiment the amount is reduced by, e.g., at least 5%, such as at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20% or as otherwise herein described.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0048">The term âlow detergent concentrationâ system includes detergents where less than about 800 ppm of detergent components are present in the wash water. Asian, e.g., Japanese detergents are typically considered low detergent concentration systems.</p>

      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0069">Substantially homologous polypeptides of the sequences described above are characterized as having one or more (several) amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions in the mature polypeptide. Preferably, amino acid changes are of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of one to about nine amino acids, such as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine amino acids; preferably from one to about 15 amino acids, such as 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 amino acids; and most preferably from one to about 30 amino acids, such as 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to about five to ten residues, preferably from 10 to 15 residues and most preferably from 20 to 25 residues, or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tag, an antigenic epitope, protein A, a carbohydrate binding module or a another binding domain.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0070">Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979<i>, In, The Proteins</i>, Academic Press, New York. The most commonly occurring exchanges are Ala/Ser, Val/Ile, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0071">Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0072">Essential amino acids in a parent polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, <i>Science </i>244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for protease activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996<i>, J. Biol. Chem. </i>271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, <i>Science </i>255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, <i>FEBS Lett. </i>309: 59-64. The identities of essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of identities with polypeptides that are related to the parent polypeptide. The catalytic residues may also be determined by alignment with known M4 metalloprotease where it has been found that the catalytic residues are conserved in all such proteases. In one embodiment essential amino acid residues determined by alignment with known M4 metalloproteases are Glu 350/E350) and His 435 (H435) of SEQ ID NO: 2 or Glu 358 (E358) and His 441 (H441) of SEQ ID NO: 4.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0073">Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, <i>Science </i>241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989<i>, Proc.

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0074">Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide.</p>

A limited number of non-conservative amino acids, amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid residues. âUnnatural amino acidsâ have been modified after protein synthesis, and/or have a chemical structure in their side chain(s) different from that of the standard amino acids.

Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fused polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion proteins may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusions are created post-translationally (Cooper et al., 1993, <i>EMBO J. </i>12: 2575-2583; Dawson et al., 1994, <i>Science </i>266: 776-779).</p>

Techniques for isolating microorganisms from natural habitats are well known in the art. The polynucleotide may then be obtained by similarly screening a genomic or cDNA library of such a microorganism. Once a polynucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide has been detected e.g. with the probe(s), the polynucleotide can be isolated or cloned by utilizing techniques which are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., 1989, supra).</p>

The cloning of the polynucleotides from genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et al., 1990<i>, PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application</i>, Academic Press, New York.

      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">Modification of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be necessary for synthesizing polypeptides substantially similar to the polypeptide. The term âsubstantially similarâ to the polypeptide refers to non-naturally occurring forms of the polypeptide. These polypeptides may differ in some engineered way from the polypeptide isolated from its native source, e.g., variants that differ in specific activity, thermostability, pH optimum, or the like. The variants may be constructed on the basis of the polynucleotide presented as the mature polypeptide coding sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, e.g., a subsequence thereof, and/or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that do not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism intended for production of the enzyme, or by introduction of nucleotide substitutions that may give rise to a different amino acid sequence.

The 5â²-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5â²-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence.

The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>laccase (WO 95/33836), <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor.</p>

      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0122">It may also be desirable to add regulatory sequences that regulate expression of the polypeptide relative to the growth of the host cell. Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase promoter, <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>glucoamylase promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.</p>

      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0123">The present invention also relates to recombinant expression vectors comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention, a promoter, and transcriptional and translational stop signals. The various nucleotide and control sequences may be joined together to produce a recombinant expression vector that may include one or more convenient restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide at such sites. Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0124">The recombinant expression vector may be any vector (e.g., a plasmid or virus) that can be conveniently subjected to recombinant DNA procedures and can bring about expression of the polynucleotide. The choice of the vector will typically depend on the compatibility of the vector with the host cell into which the vector is to be introduced. The vector may be a linear or closed circular plasmid.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0125">The vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e., a vector that exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is independent of chromosomal replication, e.g., a plasmid, an extrachromosomal element, a minichromosome, or an artificial chromosome. The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0126">The vector preferably contains one or more selectable markers that permit easy selection of transformed, transfected, transduced, or the like cells. A selectable marker is a gene the product of which provides for biocide or viral resistance, resistance to heavy metals, prototrophy to auxotrophs, and the like.</p>

Preferred for use in an <i>Aspergillus </i>cell are <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>or <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>amdS and pyrG genes and a <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus </i>bar gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0128">The vector preferably contains an element(s) that permits integration of the vector into the host cell's genome or autonomous replication of the vector in the cell independent of the genome.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0129">For integration into the host cell genome, the vector may rely on the polynucleotide's sequence encoding the polypeptide or any other element of the vector for integration into the genome by homologous or non-homologous recombination. Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0130">For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question.

      <p id="p-00280-en" num="0290">The wash performance is measured as the brightness of the colour of the textile washed. Brightness can also be expressed as the intensity of the light reflected from the sample when illuminated with white light. When the sample is stained the intensity of the reflected light is lower than that of a clean sample. Expressed another way, a cleaner sample will reflect more light and will have a higher intensity. Therefore the intensity of the reflected light can be used to measure wash performance.</p>
      <p id="p-00281-en" num="0291">Color measurements are made with a professional flatbed scanner (Kodak iQsmart, Kodak, Midtager 29, DK-2605 BrÃ¸ndby, Denmark), which is used to capture an image of the washed textile.</p>
      <p id="p-00282-en" num="0292">To extract a value for the light intensity from the scanned images, 24-bit pixel values from the image are converted into values for red, green and blue (RGB). The intensity value (Int) is calculated by adding the RGB values together as vectors and then taking the length of the resulting vector:</p>
