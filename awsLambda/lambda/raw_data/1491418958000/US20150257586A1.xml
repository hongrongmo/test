      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to apparatus, systems, and methods for preparing, or producing, a beverage, such as coffee or tea, and includes the disclosure of automated single-cup beverage systems.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many methods and systems for brewing beverages, such as coffee and tea, are known. In conventional beverage brewing systems, a brewing machine typically brews a relatively large batch of the beverage. In commercial settings, a barista may pour cup- or individual-sized portions from the batch when a customer places an order. Such beverage brewing systems can be inefficient because the beverage may be wasted when not all of the beverage in the batch is ordered or consumed. In addition, such systems may produce a beverage having an inconsistent flavor and taste because the beverage is not necessarily brewed when a customer places an order and may not be fresh when consumed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Automated single-cup coffee brewing systems may be employed to address some of the disadvantages of conventional batch-type coffee brewing systems. Users of automated single-cup coffee brewing systems may benefit from several improvements to those systems, including, but not limited to, reducing the time it takes to brew a single-cup portion or traveler portion of a beverage, reducing the labor and time involved in cleaning brewing equipment between brew cycles, reducing steam and condensation from entering the grinder and hopper areas of the system to improve the quality of the beverage and to reduce corrosion on grinder components, improving the accuracy and repeatability of providing a desired dose of ingredients to a grinder portion of the system, improving agitation of ingredients during a brew cycle, and reducing the labor and time involved in maintaining the hoppers and refilling the hoppers with ingredients.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="2">I. Introduction</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Generally described, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to beverage production, or preparation, devices or machines that are capable of producing, or preparing, a single-serve portion of a beverage from a cartridge based on a specific recipe determined by a processor or controller from an information element such as a tag (e.g., radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag or near field communication (NFC) tag) or machine-readable code (e.g., optical code, one dimensional (1D) bar code, two dimensional (2D) bar code, etc.) associated with the cartridge. The information element (e.g., bar or code) may be located on packaging independent of the cartridge or located on the cartridge itself. The beverage preparation devices or machines may be capable of preparing automated single-serve portions of brewed coffee, espresso, tea, hot cocoa or other beverages. The beverages may include hot beverages or cold beverages.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">As one example, multiple single-serve beverage cartridges may be provided within a packaging assembly (e.g., a box or bag). The packaging may include a 2D bar code (also referred to as a âmatrix codeâ), examples of which include, but are not limited to, a QRÂ® or âquick responseâ code, an EZCodeÂ® bar code, a PDF417 or âportable data fileâ bar code, a high capacity color bar code, etc., that encodes a specific recipe for preparation of a beverage from the single-serve beverage cartridges. In one embodiment, the 2D code from the packaging can be positioned near a scanning or reading area of the beverage preparation machine and the 2D code can be read or scanned by the beverage preparation machine and decoded to determine the recipe for automatically preparing a single-serve beverage. The 2D code may include, for example, beverage type, temperature, time or other recipe components or instructions, including instructions for preparing multiple single-serve beverage cartridges (e.g., a coffee cartridge followed by a beverage cartridge).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In some embodiments, the beverage preparation machine includes a multi-chambered basket unit or multiple separate baskets configured to receive cartridges of different beverage types (for example, brewed coffee, espresso coffee, tea) and the selection of which chamber or basket to use to prepare the beverage is determined from the 2D code. The different chambers or baskets may have different sizes, shapes, structural features, and/or materials. For example, a first chamber or basket may be configured to receive and prepare a cartridge for a first type of beverage, such as brewed coffee, and a second chamber or basket may be configured to receive and prepare a cartridge for a second type of beverage, such as espresso coffee. The brewed coffee chamber may include structural features such as filtration elements, strainers, large exit apertures, etc. configured to facilitate brewing of coffee grounds. The espresso coffee chamber may be smaller in size than the brewed coffee chamber and may include structural features configured to prepare the espresso beverage at a higher pressure than the brewed coffee beverage (for example, the espresso coffee chamber may include very small exit apertures or may be configured to receive a tamp that compresses the grounds in the cartridge). The cartridges to be received in each such respective chambers may also include different structural features to facilitate preparation of different types of beverages. For example, a cartridge for use in preparing an espresso or other high pressure type beverage may be configured may to withstand a higher pressure being applied to its contents, rather than a cartridge used for preparing a brewed type coffee or other low pressure type beverage, in order to prepare an espresso beverage rather than a brewed coffee beverage. Thus, an espresso or âhigh pressureâ cartridge may include a stretchable lid (for receiving a tamp that compresses the grounds in the cartridge), may include smaller exit apertures, or may be smaller in size, while a brewed coffee or âlow pressureâ cartridge may include larger or more exit apertures, may include a non-deformable or stretchable lid, or may be larger in size. In various embodiments, âlow pressureâ cartridges may be configured to be prepared in a low pressure chamber or basket at a pressure of less than 5 psi (0.345 bar) or less than 1 bar and âhigh pressureâ cartridges may be configured to be prepared in a high pressure chamber or basket at a pressure of greater than 5 bar (e.g., about 9 bar (130.5 psi), greater than 9 bar, greater than 10 bar, within a range of 9 bar-20 bar).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In accordance with several embodiments, a device (e.g., a beverage production, or preparation, device) includes a first cartridge-receiving chamber and a second cartridge-receiving chamber. The first cartridge-receiving chamber may be constructed or designed to receive a first cartridge of a first type and the second cartridge-receiving chamber may be constructed or designed to receive a second cartridge of a second type. The first type of cartridge may be a low pressure cartridge (e.g., brewed coffee cartridge) and the second type of cartridge may be a high pressure cartridge (e.g., espresso cartridge). The first cartridge-receiving chamber may have a first size and the second cartridge-receiving chamber may have a second size smaller than the first size.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The device may include a code reader (e.g., a machine-readable code reader or a bar code reader) that can read a code (e.g., 1D code or 2D code) associated with an insertable cartridge (e.g., a single-serve beverage cartridge) containing one or more ingredients. The code may be located on the packaging of the cartridge in which the cartridge is packaged or on a portion of the external surface of the cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The device may include a controller to determine a type of the insertable cartridge from code. In some implementations, if the controller determines from the code that the type of the insertable cartridge is a first type, the controller causes the first cartridge-receiving chamber to be presented to receive the insertable cartridge and, if the controller determines from the code that the type of the insertable cartridge is a second type, the controller causes the second cartridge-receiving chamber to be presented to receive the insertable cartridge. In some implementations, a multi-chambered basket unit may present the appropriate cartridge-receiving chamber by rotating about an axle (e.g., a central axle).</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In accordance with several embodiments, a method of preparing beverages of a first beverage type and a second beverage type using a beverage preparation machine includes reading an information element (e.g., a machine-readable code, an RFID tag, an NFC tag) associated with a first beverage cartridge of a first beverage type. In some implementations, the method includes determining the first beverage type from the information element. In response to determining the first beverage type from the information element, the method may include causing a first cartridge-receiving chamber of a multi-chambered basket unit to be presented in a position to receive the first beverage cartridge of the first beverage type from a user of the beverage preparation machine and preparing a first beverage using the first beverage cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The method may further include reading an information element (e.g., a machine-readable code, an RFID tag, an NFC tag) associated with a second beverage cartridge of a second beverage type and determining the second beverage type from the information element. In response to determining the second beverage type from the machine readable code, the method may include causing a second cartridge-receiving chamber of a multi-chambered basket unit to be presented in a position to receive the second beverage cartridge of the second beverage type from the user and preparing a second beverage using the second beverage cartridge. In some implementations, determining the first beverage type from a bar code includes accessing a look-up table based on an alphanumeric character determined from the bar code.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows an embodiment of content <b>605</b> that can be encoded on or otherwise included in the 2D code <b>215</b>. The content <b>605</b> provided by the 2D code <b>215</b> may include recipe information, beverage display names, locality information, and/or flavor notes. As shown in the symbol legend <b>610</b>, symbols may be used to assist the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> (for example, the reader <b>155</b> or a controller) in parsing the information or content provided by the 2D code <b>215</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring to <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> may include a look-up table or other data structure <b>620</b> that may be accessed by a controller (e.g., processor) of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> to interpret the content <b>605</b> provided by the 2D code <b>215</b> to determine the recipe for the desired beverage, language information, display information or other instructions. Because the 2D code may be limited to a certain number of characters to be encoded, use of the lookup table <b>620</b> may advantageously allow codes, symbols, letters, or shortened strings to be used within the content <b>605</b> to enable more information to be provided in the content <b>605</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">For example, to reduce the amount of characters within the 2D code <b>215</b> related to the recipe information, the recipe portion of the content <b>605</b> can be limited to four alphanumeric characters or symbols, with each character or symbol correlating to a different recipe component or instruction. The lookup table <b>620</b> may include entries related to recipe information <b>625</b> that correspond to different recipe options. For example, the recipe information <b>625</b> can include beverage type (e.g., brewed coffee, espresso, and tea), water temperature, preparation time, and whether or not there is a pre-infusion required for the beverage preparation.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">For embodiments where four alphanumeric characters or symbols are used, the first character can include a letter to identify a beverage type in the lookup table <b>620</b>. As one example, the beverage types may include brewed coffee, espresso and tea and the letters corresponding to each beverage type may be âB,â âEâ and âT,â respectively. Characters or symbols (e.g., numbers or letters) can also be provided in the recipe portion of the content <b>605</b> to indicate the water temperature, preparation time (e.g., brew, infusion or shot time) and whether a pre-infusion is required. In the illustrated embodiment, numbers are used for the water temperature and preparation time, and a Y or N is used for whether a pre-infusion is required. Other implementations may be used as desired or required.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The lookup table <b>620</b> may also include entries corresponding to common words and names <b>630</b> so that abbreviations or symbols or characters can be used in the content <b>605</b>. Entries corresponding to different languages <b>635</b> may also be included in the lookup table <b>620</b>. The display may be tailored to the language of a particular locality as determined from the content <b>605</b> of the 2D code. The lookup table <b>620</b> may also include entries corresponding to flavor notes (e.g., caramel, coconut, hazelnut, chocolate, vanilla, etc.) associated with the beverage. These flavor or tasting notes may be displayed during preparation of the beverage.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">IV. Multi-Chambered Basket Assemblies</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some embodiments, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> comprises multiple baskets or chambers, or a multi-chambered basket assembly (e.g., a double-sided brew basket). For example, a first brew basket or first side of a double-sided brew basket may be used for espresso-type beverages or short beverages and a second brew basket or second side of a double-sided brew basket may be used for brewed coffee beverages or long beverages. If a multi-chambered basket unit or assembly is present, the basket unit or assembly may be rotatable so that the different baskets or chambers can be selectively presented and/or accessed.

        <figref>FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref> illustrate perspective views of the multi-chambered basket unit <b>700</b> of <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> at various stages of rotating operations. According to various implementations, the multi-chambered basket unit <b>700</b> is configured to rotate about a central axle <b>708</b>. <figref>FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates the multi-chambered basket unit <b>700</b> in the process of rotating to present the first chamber <b>702</b> in a position for receiving a first cartridge. In some implementations, a âreadyâ position for insertion of a cartridge is a vertical position with the chamber to receive the cartridge on top and facing upward and the other chamber facing downward. The first chamber <b>702</b> may be configured to prepare brewed coffee beverages. As shown, a chamber for preparing brewed coffee beverages may include relatively large exit apertures or filter elements due to the reduced level of pressure required to prepare brewed coffee beverages. <figref>FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates the multi-chambered basket unit <b>700</b> in the process of rotating to present the second chamber <b>704</b> in a position for receiving a second cartridge. The second chamber <b>704</b> may be configured to prepare espresso coffee beverages. As shown, the espresso coffee chamber or basket may include very small exit apertures configured to induce a much higher pressure within the chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As discussed above, the determination of the chamber to be selectively presented to receive a cartridge may be based on a beverage type identified from a code or tag corresponding to the cartridge. The code or tag may be identified by a reader or scanner (e.g., reader <b>155</b>) of the beverage preparation machine. The code or tag may be disposed on the cartridge or on packaging associated with the cartridge (e.g., packaging that surrounds one or more cartridges for shipping or delivery). If the beverage type is identified as a first beverage type, the first chamber <b>702</b> may be rotated or otherwise caused to be presented to a receiving area to receive a single-serve beverage cartridge of the first beverage type. If the beverage type is identified as a second beverage type, the second chamber is rotated or otherwise caused to be presented to the receiving area to receive a single-serve beverage cartridge of the second beverage type.</p>

      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Turning to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, a control diagram <b>800</b> illustrating overall operation of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention, is provided. The control diagram <b>800</b> illustrates the operation of various components of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> at different states of a beverage preparation process. The various components illustrated are the display, the start button, the scan area of the reader and the brew chamber. The execution of the states and actions described herein may be controlled by one or more processors or controllers of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The first state <b>805</b> corresponds to a sleep state. In the sleep state, the display is blank, the start button is dark or unlit, the scan area is unlit and the brew chamber is empty. When the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is turned on (e.g., by a user pressing a main power button), the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> enters a wake state <b>810</b>. The display portion may display a greeting for a predetermined amount of time and then an instruction indicating to the user that a code or tag must be scanned by the reader <b>155</b> to initiate the beverage preparation process. The scan area or a perimeter of the scan area of the reader <b>155</b> may be illuminated to provide a visual indication to the user to scan the code or tag corresponding to the desired beverage.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">After the code or tag is read by the reader <b>155</b> (from the packaging containing the cartridge or the cartridge itself), the beverage preparation process proceeds to state <b>815</b>. At state <b>815</b>, the display portion <b>125</b> displays the name of the beverage based on information received from the code or tag and the scan area is no longer illuminated. At this stage, the lid <b>150</b> of the beverage machine <b>100</b> may be opened (either automatically or manually) and the user may be instructed or may simply know to insert a single-serve cartridge into the brew chamber and close the lid <b>150</b>. For embodiments of machines with multiple chambers or baskets (e.g., one low-pressure basket and one high-pressure basket), the determination of which basket to present may be determined from the information contained on or within the code or tag, as described above in connection with <figref>FIGS. 5A-7C</figref>. For example, if the beverage is determined to be a brewed coffee or âlow pressureâ beverage, the low-pressure brew basket may be presented for insertion of a brewed coffee cartridge. If the beverage is determined to be an espresso or âhigh pressureâ beverage, the high-pressure basket may be presented for insertion of an espresso cartridge. As described in more detail above in connection with <figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, for a machine with a double-sided basket assembly, if the beverage is determined to be a brewed coffee beverage, the side of the basket assembly configured for preparing brewed coffee beverages at low pressure may be rotated or otherwise manipulated so that it is presented in a position to receive a brewed coffee cartridge (e.g., in an upward-facing position just below the lid). If the beverage is determined to be an espresso coffee beverage, the side of the basket assembly configured for preparing beverages at high pressure may be rotated or otherwise manipulated so that it is presented in a position to receive an espresso coffee cartridge (e.g., in an upward-facing position just below the lid).</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Once the lid <b>150</b> is closed, the beverage preparation process may proceed to state <b>820</b>, where the user is instructed to place a cup or other container in the dispensing portion <b>130</b> and press the start button <b>160</b>A, which may also be partially or fully illuminated to provide a visual indication. Once the start button <b>160</b>A has been pressed, the brew or extraction cycle begins at state <b>825</b>. Various status messages (e.g., status bars and/or percentages) or flavor notes may be displayed on the display during the cycle. After the cycle is complete, the beverage preparation process proceeds to state <b>830</b>, where the cartridge is ejected from the brew chamber and a rinse cycle is performed. The scan area may then be partially or fully illuminated again to indicate that the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is ready to prepare another beverage, as in the wake state <b>810</b>. In some embodiments, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is configured to store the most recently-used recipe in memory and use the most recently-used recipe to prepare the next beverage if a code or tag is not presented for reading by the reader <b>155</b> prior to the start button <b>160</b>A being pressed by a user. In other embodiments, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> requires scanning of a code or tag prior to preparation of every beverage or prior to insertion of every cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">After a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 30 seconds) without a user either scanning a new code or tag or otherwise interfacing with the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> may enter a sleep state <b>835</b>. In some embodiments, after a second predetermined amount of time (e.g., 5 minutes), a deep sleep state <b>840</b> may be entered to reduce power consumption. The beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> may be battery-operated, inductively charged, or connected to a standard electrical outlet with a plug.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">
        <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a control diagram illustrating states involved in preparation of a single-serve brewed coffee beverage by the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention. The control diagram <b>900</b> illustrates the operation of various components of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> at different states of the single-serve brewed coffee preparation process. The various components illustrated are the display <b>125</b>, the start button <b>160</b>A, the scan area of the reader <b>155</b> and the hot water button <b>160</b>B. The execution of the states and actions described herein may be controlled by one or more processors or controllers of the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The first state corresponds to an initial wake state <b>905</b> after the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is powered on. The display portion may display a greeting in the wake state <b>905</b> for a predetermined amount of time. Once the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> is ready for a code or tag to be read by the reader <b>155</b>, a scan state <b>910</b> is entered, in which a textual instruction may be displayed on the display portion and the scan area or a perimeter or other portion of the scan area may be partially or fully illuminated. After the code or tag is read or scanned, a cartridge insertion state <b>915</b> is entered. The display portion displays the name of the coffee and optionally any flavor or tasting notes based on the information received from the code or tag via the reader <b>155</b>. The lid is also opened (either automatically or manually) and the single-serve cartridge is inserted into the brew chamber or basket configured for brewing coffee beverages.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">For embodiments of machines with multiple chambers or baskets (e.g., one low-pressure basket and one high-pressure basket), the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> determines that the brew basket or low-pressure basket should be presented for insertion of the brewed coffee beverage cartridge based on information or content provided by the code or tag, as described above in connection with <figref>FIGS. 5A-7C</figref>. For example, in a machine with a double-sided basket assembly (as shown and described in connection with <figref>FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>), the brew basket may be rotated or otherwise manipulated so that it is presented in a position to receive the brewed coffee cartridge (e.g., in an upward-facing position just below the lid).</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">After the lid is closed, a waiting state <b>920</b> is entered in which the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> instructs the user to place a cup in the dispensing portion <b>130</b> and press the start button <b>160</b>A (e.g., on the display portion <b>125</b>). The start button <b>160</b>A may also be illuminated to provide a visual indication to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">After the start button <b>160</b>A is pressed, the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> enters a heating state <b>925</b> in which an appropriate amount of water is heated to a temperature determined from the recipe received from the code or tag. When the proper temperature has been reached, a brew state <b>930</b> is entered and the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> completes the preparation of the coffee beverage and dispenses the prepared beverage into the cup or other receptacle placed in the dispensing portion <b>130</b>. Various status indications may be displayed during the heating state <b>925</b> and the brewing state <b>930</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. Once the brewing cycle is complete, an ejection and/or cleaning state <b>935</b> is entered in which the beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> ejects the cartridge and/or cleans or rinses the brew chamber. For example, for a machine with a double-sided basket assembly, the side of the double-sided brew basket containing the cartridge may be rotated in such a manner so as to eject the cartridge from the brew basket and into a waste chamber and a rinsing of the brew basket may be performed to remove any lingering particulates or residue. The beverage preparation machine <b>100</b> then returns to the scan state <b>910</b>.</p>
