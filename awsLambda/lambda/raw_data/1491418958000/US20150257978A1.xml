      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A multiple pill cutter provides an individual the ability to cut multiple pills simultaneously or near simultaneously, via one action from the individual (e.g. closing a lever or hinge, pressing a button, etc.). The multiple pill cutter can include a pill cutting bed on which pills can be placed. The multiple pill cutter can further include pill retainers that allow the individual to place and align multiple pills on the cutting bed. The pill cutting bed and the pill retainers can be housed within a lower portion. The multiple pill cutter can also include a top portion, one end of which is hinged to one end of the lower portion. An inner surface of the top portion can include a cutting blade for cutting pills placed on the cutting bed. The cutting blade is positioned such that when the top portion is lowered over the lower portion, the cutting edge of the cutting blade cuts through one or more pills placed on the cutting bed between the pill retainers.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Particular implementations of the subject matter described in this disclosure can be implemented to realize one or more of the following potential advantages. The multiple pill cutter can cut multiple pills in a single cutting operation. Furthermore, having adjustable pill retainers can allow the individual to secure and cut pills of various sizes. The adjustable pill retainers are configured such that the pills can be positioned to be cut substantially in half, regardless of their size.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of an implementation of a multiple pill cutting device <b>100</b>. In particular, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a pill cutting device <b>100</b> that can be employed for cutting multiple pills in a single cutting operation. The pill cutting device <b>100</b> includes a lower portion <b>102</b>, and a top portion <b>104</b> pivotally attached to the lower portion <b>102</b>, a cutting blade <b>106</b> attached to an inner surface <b>108</b> of the top portion <b>104</b>, and a cutting bed <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the pill cutting device <b>100</b> may include one or more fixed or adjustable pill retainers, such as a first pill retainer <b>112</b>, a second pill retainer <b>114</b> as shown. In some implementations in which the pill cutting device <b>100</b> includes one or more adjustable pill retainers, the pill cutting device <b>100</b> may include and a dial <b>116</b>. The cutting bed <b>110</b> can accommodate one or more pills, such as pills <b>118</b>, which a user desires to cut.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In some implementations as shown, a first end <b>120</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b> is pivotally engaged with a first end <b>122</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> at hinge <b>124</b>. A second end <b>126</b> of the top portion <b>104</b>, opposing the first end <b>122</b>, can be lowered or raised in along and arc with respect to an axis formed at the hinge <b>124</b>. For example, the top portion <b>104</b>, or in particular the second end <b>126</b> of the top portion <b>104</b>, can be held by a user's hand and lowered such that the second end <b>126</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> mates with a second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b>. In other implementations, other mechanisms may be used to lower the top portion <b>104</b> or a cutting blade <b>106</b> connected to the top portion <b>104</b> into contact with the lower portion <b>102</b> or a cutting bed <b>110</b>. For example, the top portion <b>104</b> may be wholly removable and not pivotally attached; rather, the user may nest the two portions <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> against or within each other to cut pills. In a similar embodiment, the top portion <b>104</b> may be slidingly coupled to the lower portion <b>102</b>. For example, the top portion <b>104</b> may be slid in a direction orthogonal to a cutting direction; e.g. slid to one side or another to allow the user to place pills within the cutting bed, then returned to position above the bottom portion <b>102</b> and pressed downwards to divide the pills.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In some embodiments, the cutting blade <b>106</b> is disposed on the inner surface <b>108</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> substantially centered along the smaller dimension of the top portion <b>104</b>. The cutting blade <b>106</b> is also disposed substantially parallel to the edges along the longer dimension of the top portion <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the cutting blade <b>106</b> is disposed such that when the top portion <b>104</b> is lowered, the cutting blade <b>106</b> is substantially centered along the longer dimension of the cutting bed <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the cutting blade <b>106</b> may be positioned elsewhere, such as on a corresponding portion of the bottom portion <b>102</b>. For example, in one such embodiment, the cutting blade <b>106</b> may be positioned beneath a longitudinal slot in the cutting bed, which may be slidingly attached to the bottom portion <b>102</b> such that when the user presses the top portion against the bottom portion, the cutting bed is translated downwards, exposing the cutting blade and dividing the pills from beneath.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the lower portion <b>102</b> houses the cutting bed <b>110</b> and the first and second pill retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. The cutting bed <b>110</b>, and the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are engaged in a manner to allow retaining pills <b>118</b> securely on the cutting bed <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, as discussed above, the cutting bed may comprise a portion of the top portion; e.g. in embodiments in which the cutting blade is exposed from below to cut pills against a cutting bed in the top portion. A knob <b>116</b>, disposed at the second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion, may be attached to a shaft (not shown) that is coupled with gear mechanism (not shown) associated with the first and second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> (the shaft and the gear mechanism is discussed in detail below with reference to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The knob <b>116</b> can be turned in a clockwise or in an anti-clockwise direction (e.g., centered around the x-axis). In some implementations, turning the knob <b>116</b> in one direction imparts motion to both the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> such that the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are slidably drawn towards each other. On the other hand, turning the knob <b>116</b> in the opposite direction imparts a motion in the opposite direction in the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> such that the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are slidably drawn away from each other. In other embodiments, a lever, thumbscrew, or similar mechanism may be used to reposition the first and second retainers <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. In still other embodiments, no mechanism may be included; rather, a user may manually position the first and second retainers <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, such as in notches or grooves based on predetermined pill diameters. In yet still other embodiments, a first retainer may be fixed and another retainer may be moved in relation to the first retainer to adjust for different pill diameters. In such embodiments, the cutting bed and/or cutting blade may also move with the adjustable retainer such that the cutting location remains centered between the retainers.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">To cut one or more pills, a user can place the pills <b>118</b> over the cutting bed <b>110</b>. The pills <b>118</b> can be positioned over the cutting bed <b>110</b> such that the direction of the cut desired is substantially parallel to an edge along the length of the lower portion <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the initial positions of the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> may be such that the distance between them may be too small to accommodate the size of the pills <b>118</b>. In some such instances, the user may turn the knob or other mechanism <b>116</b> in the appropriate direction to pull the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> apart so as to increase the distance between them. Thereafter, the user can place the pills <b>116</b> on the cutting bed <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">After placing the desired number of pills <b>118</b> over the cutting bed <b>110</b>, the user can turn the knob <b>116</b> or other mechanism such that the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are pulled towards each other. The user can continue turning the knob <b>116</b> up to a point where the motion of the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> is impeded by the pills <b>118</b>. At this point, the knob <b>116</b> may offer resistance to the user's attempt to rotate the knob <b>116</b> any further. This can indicate to the user that the pills <b>118</b> have been secured, and that they are ready to be cut. In other implementations, such as where a lever is used to reposition first and second retainers <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, the user may encounter increased resistance while manipulating the lever, indicating that the pills are securely retained.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The user can then proceed with lowering the second end <b>126</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> toward the second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion. The lowering of the top portion <b>104</b>, in turn, lowers the cutting blade <b>106</b> towards the pills <b>118</b> secured between the first and the second retainers <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. At a certain point in the lowering of the top portion <b>104</b> toward the lower portion <b>102</b>, the cutting blade <b>106</b> may come in contact with the pills <b>118</b>. Additional lowering force (or torque) provided by the user to the top portion <b>104</b> may cause the cutting blade <b>106</b> to cut through the pills <b>118</b>. The user can continue to lower the top portion <b>104</b> until the cutting blade <b>106</b> cuts through the pills <b>118</b> and comes in contact with the cutting bed <b>110</b>. As discussed above, in other implementations, the user may press the top portion against the bottom portion, moving a sliding cutting bed that exposes a cutting blade from beneath and cutting through pills <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Subsequently, the user can lift the top portion <b>104</b> such that the second end <b>126</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> is pulled away from the second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b>. The user can then turn the knob <b>116</b> in the opposite direction such that the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are pulled away from each other. This results in the pills <b>118</b>, which have been cut by the cutting blade <b>106</b>, to be released and be in a position to be readily retrieved by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">While <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows the pills <b>118</b> being disposed on the cutting bed <b>110</b> closer to the second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b> than to the first end <b>120</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b>, it is understood that the pills <b>118</b> could be disposed at any position along the length of the cutting bed <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the entire length of the cutting bed <b>110</b> (from near the first end <b>120</b> to near the second end <b>128</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b>) can be populated with pills <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows an exploded view of an embodiment of a pill cutting device <b>100</b>. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows various components that constitute the pill cutting device <b>100</b>, such as the lower portion <b>102</b>, the top portion <b>104</b>, the cutting blade <b>106</b>, the cutting bed <b>110</b>, the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, and the knob <b>116</b>. In addition, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows various features of embodiments of pill cutting devices that were not visible or not included in the embodiment of in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, such as the shaft <b>130</b>, a first pinion gear <b>132</b>, a second pinion gear <b>134</b>, a knob retaining opening <b>136</b> on the lower portion <b>102</b>, a pair of hinge members <b>138</b> (only one of which is visible in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) on the side surfaces of the lower portion <b>104</b>, and a pair of hinge openings <b>140</b> on the side surfaces of the top portion <b>104</b>, which can mate with the pair of hinge members <b>138</b>. As discussed below in further detail, the shaft <b>130</b> is attached to the knob <b>116</b>. The knob <b>116</b>, in turn, is retained by the knob retaining opening <b>136</b> on the lower portion <b>102</b>.</p>

The front view corresponds to the view seen in the direction of the positive x-axis as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. The front view of the lower portion <b>102</b> (as also shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) shows the knob retaining opening <b>136</b>. The knob retaining opening <b>136</b> has a diameter that is large enough to accommodate the knob <b>116</b>. Various views of the lower portion <b>102</b> also show the pair of hinge members <b>138</b> disposed near the first end of the lower portion <b>102</b>. The pair of hinge members can mate with the pair of hinge openings <b>140</b> in the top portion (shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>). In some implementations, the pair of hinge members <b>138</b> may have a sloping profile to allow the top portion <b>104</b> to easily slide downwards on the outside of the hinge members <b>138</b> until the hinge members <b>138</b> are engaged within the respective hinge openings <b>140</b>, for easy assembly/disassembly during manufacture or for cleaning. The top view of the lower portion <b>102</b> also shows two dowels <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>disposed over an inner surface <b>142</b> of the lower portion <b>102</b>, which may be present in some embodiments.

The first shaft opening <b>142</b><i>a </i>forms one end of a shaft passage <b>144</b> (shown in broken lines in the side view), the other end of which is formed by the second shaft opening <b>142</b><i>b </i>over the rear of the cutting bed. The shaft passage <b>144</b> allows a shaft <b>130</b> (such as shaft <b>130</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to pass through the shaft passage <b>144</b> and extend out from the first and the second shaft openings <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the first shaft opening <b>142</b><i>a </i>is disposed on the front of the cutting bed <b>110</b> such that when the cutting bed <b>110</b> is placed within the lower portion, the first shaft opening <b>142</b><i>a </i>is substantially coaxial in relation with the knob retaining opening <b>136</b>. The coaxial relationship ensures that the shaft <b>130</b>, which is attached to the knob <b>116</b>, is able to pass through the shaft passage <b>144</b>. In other implementations, as discussed above, other mechanisms may be used for positioning the first and second retainer, and accordingly, a shaft <b>130</b> may not be utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As shown in the top view, the cutting bed <b>110</b> may include a top surface <b>146</b>, over which the pills <b>118</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) can be placed. In some implementations, the top surface can be coated with a material that is different from the material used to form the cutting bed <b>110</b>. In some implementations, a rubberized material may be used to form the top surface <b>146</b>, e.g. rubber, silicon, polypropylene, etc. A rubberized top surface <b>146</b> can provide a high friction surface, which can minimize the movement of the pills <b>118</b> during the cutting operation. In other implementations, the top surface <b>146</b> may not be rubberized, and the pills may be securely retained by the first and second retainer as discussed above. In some implementations, the top surface <b>146</b> may over time become damaged due to repeated contact with the cutting blade <b>106</b> during cutting operations. In some such implementations, the top surface <b>146</b> can be removable and replaceable. For example, the top surface <b>146</b> could be adhered to the cutting bed <b>110</b> with an adhesive such that, when desired, the top surface <b>146</b> could be peeled off the cutting bed <b>110</b> and replaced with a replacement top surface. In other implementations, the entire cutting bed may be replaced. In still other implementations, the top surface <b>146</b> may be of sufficient hardness to resist damage during cutting operations, e.g. glass, transparent aluminum (sapphire), etc. In still other embodiments, the top surface may have a longitudinal notch parallel to and disposed beneath the cutting blade, such that when the pill cutter is closed (e.g. during a cutting operation), the cutting blade may extend into the notch and below the surface of the cutting bed adjacent to the notch. In such embodiments, the cutting blade need not contact the bottom of the notch to fully divide a pill. This may reduce wear on the blade. In a further embodiment and as discussed above, the cutting bed may be removable to clean pill remnants, dust, or other materials that are retained within said notch.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The cutting bed <b>110</b> may include a pair of rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b </i>at each end along the length of the cutting bed <b>110</b>. The rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b </i>may extend normally upwards (i.e., in the direction of the positive z-axis shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) from the top surface <b>146</b> of the cutting bed <b>110</b>. As discussed further below, in many implementations, the pair of rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b </i>may provide a guide over which the first and the second retainers <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> can slide. The cutting bed <b>110</b> may also include a pair of extension members <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>that extend normally from the outer walls of the rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b</i>, respectively. When the cutting bed <b>110</b> is positioned within the lower portion <b>102</b>, the extension members <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>extend to abut with the inner surfaces of the second end <b>128</b> and the first end <b>120</b>, respectively. The extension members <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>may prevent undesirable movement of the cutting bed <b>110</b> along the length of the lower portion <b>102</b> during the cutting operation. The cutting bed <b>110</b> may also include a pair of dowel receiving holes <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>for receiving dowels <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>, respectively, when the cutting bed <b>110</b> is positioned within the lower portion <b>102</b>. As mentioned above, the dowel receiving holes <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>may be engaged with the dowels <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to allow installation of the cutting bed, and may prevent undue lateral movement of the cutting bed <b>110</b> during the operation of the cutting device <b>100</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows an example pill retaining gear mechanism <b>200</b> of an embodiment of a pill cutting device <b>100</b>. In particular, the gear mechanism <b>200</b> includes a cutting bed <b>110</b>, a first retainer <b>112</b>, a second retainer <b>114</b>, a shaft <b>130</b>, a first pinion gear <b>132</b>, and, in some embodiments, a second pinion gear <b>134</b> (not shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). In some embodiments, the gear mechanism <b>200</b> is placed in the lower portion <b>102</b>. A first end of the shaft <b>130</b> is attached to the knob <b>112</b>, which in turn is retained within the knob retaining opening <b>136</b>. Turning the knob <b>116</b> imparts rotary motion to the shaft <b>130</b>. The shaft <b>130</b> is passed through the cutting bed <b>110</b> (via the shaft passage <b>144</b>, such as the passage <b>144</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). A shaft <b>130</b> may also pass through openings in the first pinion gear <b>132</b> and the second pinion gear <b>134</b> (not shown), such that the first pinion gear <b>132</b> is disposed near the first end of the shaft <b>130</b> while the second pinion gear <b>134</b> is disposed over the second end of the shaft <b>130</b> (only the first end of the shaft <b>130</b> and the first pinion gear <b>132</b> is visible in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In embodiments employing the gear mechanism <b>200</b>, the first pinion gear <b>132</b> may be positioned such that the first pinion gear <b>132</b> engages with the first linear gear <b>164</b><i>a </i>of the first retainer <b>112</b> and the third linear gear <b>184</b><i>a </i>of the second retainer <b>114</b>. Specifically, the first linear gear <b>164</b><i>a </i>engages with the first pinion gear <b>132</b> at a point on the first pinion <b>132</b> that is diametrically opposite (or about 180 degrees) to the point on the first pinion <b>312</b> where the third linear gear <b>184</b><i>a </i>engages with the first pinion <b>132</b>. While not shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, in some embodiments, at the other end of the shaft <b>130</b>, a second pinion gear <b>134</b> may engage with the second linear gear <b>164</b><i>b </i>of the first retainer <b>112</b> and the fourth linear gear <b>184</b><i>b </i>of the second retainer <b>114</b>.

In other embodiments, a second pinion gear <b>134</b>, second linear gear <b>164</b><i>b</i>, and fourth linear gear <b>184</b><i>b </i>may not be utilized.

      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The first retainer <b>112</b> is disposed over the cutting bed <b>110</b> such that the first and the second rail grooves <b>160</b><i>a </i>and <b>160</b><i>b </i>engage with the first and second rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Similarly, the second retainer <b>114</b> is disposed over the cutting bed <b>110</b> such that the third and the fourth rail grooves <b>180</b><i>a </i>and <b>180</b><i>b </i>engage with the first and second rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As discussed above, to securely retain the pills <b>118</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) between the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>, in some embodiments, the user turns the knob <b>116</b> such that the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are pulled toward each other. This motion can be imparted to the first and the second retainer in some embodiments by turning the shaft <b>130</b> in the anti-clockwise direction (centered around the x-axis). In other embodiments, orientations of the first and second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> or the linear gears may be reversed, such that the shaft may be turned in a clockwise direction to pull the retainers towards each other. As the shaft <b>130</b> turns in the anti-clockwise direction in the embodiment illustrated, the first pinion gear <b>132</b> (and the second pinion gear <b>134</b>, in some embodiments) also rotates in the anti-clockwise direction. As the first pinion gear <b>132</b> is engaged with the first linear gear <b>164</b><i>a</i>, the anti-clockwise rotation of the first pinion gear <b>132</b> causes the first linear gear arm <b>162</b><i>a </i>to move in a direction indicated by the arrow A (in the direction of the positive y-axis). Furthermore, as the first pinion gear <b>132</b> is also engaged with the third linear gear <b>184</b><i>a</i>, the anti-clockwise rotation of the first pinion gear <b>132</b> causes the third linear gear arm <b>182</b><i>a </i>to move in the direction indicated by the arrow B (i.e., in the direction of the negative y-axis). This causes the first retainer <b>112</b> to also move in the direction of the arrow A and the second retainer <b>114</b> to move in the direction of the arrow B. That is, the first retainer <b>112</b> and the second retainer <b>114</b> move closer towards each other by sliding over the rails <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b </i>of the cutting bed <b>110</b>. It should be noted that the as the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> move closer to each other, the first recess <b>166</b><i>a </i>provides room for the third linear gear arm <b>182</b><i>a </i>to move under the first retainer <b>112</b>, thus avoiding impeding the motion of the third linear arm <b>182</b><i>a </i>and the second retainer <b>114</b> as a whole.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In the embodiment illustrated, moving the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> apart can be achieved by rotating the shaft <b>130</b> in the clock-wise direction. Rotating the shaft in the clockwise direction causes the first pinion <b>132</b> to also rotate in the clock-wise direction. This results in the first linear gear arm <b>162</b><i>a </i>and the first retainer <b>112</b> moving in a direction that is opposite to that indicated by the arrow B (i.e., in the direction of the negative y-axis). At the same time, the third linear gear arm <b>182</b><i>a </i>and the second retainer <b>114</b> would move in a direction that opposite to that indicated by the arrow A (i.e., in the direction of the positive y-axis). This would result in the first and the second retainers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> being pulled away from each other. In other embodiments as discussed above, the orientations of the first retainer and second retainer may be reversed, and the shaft may be rotated in a counter-clockwise direction to move the retainers apart.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In some implementations, the gear mechanism <b>200</b> can be configured to have independent gear mechanisms associated with the first pinion <b>132</b> and the second pinion <b>134</b>. Specifically, while the gear mechanism <b>200</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref> includes a single shaft <b>130</b> attached to both the first and the second pinions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>, in some implementations, two separate shaftsâone attached to the first pinion <b>132</b> and the other attached to the second pinion <b>134</b>âcan be employed. In some such implementations, the cutting device can include two knobs, levers, thumbscrews, or other mechanisms, with one at each end of the lower portion <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, as discussed above, a gear mechanism <b>200</b> may not be utilized; rather, the first retainer and second retainer may be manually positioned, such as in slots for predetermined pill diameters, or slidingly positioned and fixed via set screws, retaining pins, shims, or other such mechanisms.</p>
