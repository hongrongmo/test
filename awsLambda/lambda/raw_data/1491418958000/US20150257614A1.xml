    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Generally, potty training of a child is reserved for late toddler years and more advanced ages when a child is physically capable of using a standard toilet. Consequently, young children are not acclimated to the use and purpose of a toilet. Some children may be unwilling to use a toilet, either out of fear or because they fail to recognize any purpose or benefit to doing so. Parents employ various methods to provide incentives for children to use the toilet, and many also seek potty training aids from a variety of forms such as, potty chairs and related devices, books and DVDs, and toys. While the existence of such aids has somewhat helped ease the general challenges for parents in the potty training process, there remains a need for tools to facilitate early potty training.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Many tools and apparatuses exist to aid in the training of a child that is physically ready to use a toilet. Examples range from training pants to easier-to-use, especially-designed flushless toilets to acclimate a child to using a toilet. While these devices are valuable in training a child to use an actual toilet, they are designed to be of use for a child that is physically ready to use a toilet and are not meant to aid a younger child in becoming comfortable and familiar with the purpose and function of a toilet.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview. It is not intended to either identify key or critical elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The described apparatuses and methods provide a functional toy that can be used to acclimate a younger child to the purpose and functionality of toilets. By familiarizing a younger child with the process and functioning of a toilet, they can feel more comfortable, confident, and able to use a proper toilet when they are physically ready to begin toilet training.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The described apparatuses provide a novel, functional toy or model toilet for easy use by small children in the early stages of toilet training. The model toilet can be used as a component of a potty training system for children to use through the toilet training process and may be used to help aide a child to understand the function of a toilet and to associate a toilet with urination. In one embodiment, the toilet includes a flushing mechanism comprised of a top-facing button that is depressed to âflushâ the model toilet. The depression of the button causes an attached, vertically-oriented rod to be pushed downward against the force of attached restoring springs. In embodiments, the vertically-oriented rod is in a fixed, perpendicular position to a horizontally-running stem that is attached at the base of the vertical rod via male-to-female fasteners at the end of each connecting rod. At the opposite end of the horizontal stem is a valve, for example a diaphragm-type, convex-side-up valve. In the default position, this valve seals the drain of the toilet bowl through the force of the aforementioned springs. When the button is depressed, the valve and rods are lowered, breaking the seal of the toilet bowl drain, and emptying the contents of the toy toilet to simulate the functioning of a full-size toilet. This action enables a small child to grasp the purpose and use of a toilet at a scale and in a context that is less threatening and intimidating than a full-size toilet. In embodiments, the flushing mechanism is partially or entirely enclosed within the shell of the toy toilet to prevent pinching of the child and potential obstructions from interfering with the motion of the mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A model toilet for use in potty training, comprising a model toilet bowl having an aperture at about the bottom of the bowl, and a flushing mechanism that includes a valve that seals the aperture of the model toilet bowl, and a button functionally connected to the valve, wherein pressure applied to the button is directed to open the valve. The model toilet also comprises a shell that supports the model toilet bowl and covers at least a portion of the flushing mechanism and at least one suction cup connected to the shell that removably attaches to a surface to suspend the model toilet.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In embodiments, the shell comprises a back portion that generally models the shape of a tank of a functional toilet; and a base portion that supports the model toilet bowl and connects to the back portion. In other embodiments, at least a portion of the base portion is open at the bottom to allow liquid to drain from the bowl through the aperture in the model toilet bowl and through the base portion out of the model toilet.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A potty training system, comprising a model toilet and a doll. The model toilet comprising a model toilet bowl having an aperture at about the bottom of the bowl and a flushing mechanism that comprises a valve that seals the aperture of the model toilet bowl and a button functionally connected to the valve; wherein pressure applied to the button is directed to open the valve. The model toilet also comprises a shell that supports the model toilet bowl and covers at least a portion of the flushing mechanism. The doll is sized and shaped for use with the model toilet, wherein the doll is adapted to simulate urination by squirting liquid into the model toilet, and the flushing mechanism operates to drain the liquid from the model toilet bowl and out the bottom of the model toilet.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A potty training system, comprising a doll and a model toilet. The model toilet, comprising a model toilet bowl having an aperture at about the bottom of the bowl and a flushing mechanism that comprises a valve that seals the aperture of the model toilet bowl, and a button functionally connected to the valve; wherein pressure applied to the button is directed to open the valve.

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a potty training system <b>100</b> is illustrated. In one embodiment, the potty training system <b>100</b> includes an animal-shaped doll <b>102</b> and a model toilet <b>104</b>. The doll <b>102</b> and the model toilet <b>104</b> can be used to demonstrate proper toilet use and introduce potty training to a child in a positive way. The potty training system <b>100</b> may be used as a potty training tool, a toy for children, or both. It is an important goal of potty training that children associate the act of urination with a toilet and using the potty training system <b>100</b> will help a child make that association.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In one embodiment, the animal-shaped doll <b>102</b> is capable of releasing liquid <b>118</b> into the model toilet <b>104</b>. It is intended that the child, or adult interacting with the child, position the animal-shaped doll <b>102</b> roughly centered over the top of the model toilet <b>104</b>. When the liquid <b>118</b> is released from the animal-shaped doll <b>102</b>, the liquid <b>118</b> enters the model toilet <b>104</b> and resembles urination into a functioning toilet. In embodiments, the doll <b>102</b> is sized and shaped so that it can be easily grasped by a small child, allowing the child to take an active role in the play and training. The doll <b>102</b> and model toilet <b>104</b> used in this way are a non-threatening and non-intimidating way to introduce children to potty training.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In one embodiment the potty training system <b>100</b> is used in the bathtub. The doll <b>102</b> and model toilet <b>104</b> can be formed from materials conducive to bathtub play, such as rubber, plastic or other non-porous, quick-drying materials. In addition to the bathtub, the child may use the potty training system <b>100</b> in any convenient location such as a sink, shower, pool, or plastic tub. The use of the potty training system <b>100</b> in the bathtub may be beneficial as the water is contained within the bathtub, or at least the bathroom, aiding cleanup. Additionally, the bathtub is a fun environment for a child and using the potty training system <b>100</b> in the bathtub may create a positive association with the potty training system <b>100</b>, alleviating some of the pressures of potty training and encouraging the child.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In embodiments, the doll <b>102</b> is elastic and compressible and may be shaped like an animal. In one embodiment, the doll <b>102</b> may be shaped like a duck, as shown. However, the doll <b>102</b> may take the shape of any animal. As used herein, the term âdollâ encompasses a wide range of figures, including but not limited to, representations of humans, animals, anthropomorphized animals, cartoons, mythical creatures, and the like. For example, the doll <b>102</b> can be shaped like a mythical creature (e.g., a unicorn), cartoon animal (e.g., Winnie-the-Pooh or Mickey Mouse) or may even take the shape of a human being. The doll <b>102</b> may be any shape that would encourage the child to use the potty training system <b>100</b> as a toy. The doll <b>102</b> may also take a shape with which the child would identify or seek to emulate, such as a favorite character from a television show or book. The doll <b>102</b> may be sized proportionally to the model toilet <b>104</b>, such that the child associates the two together. In embodiments, the doll <b>102</b> is sized and shaped to be grasped easily by a toddler, such that the child is able to manipulate and play with the potty training system <b>100</b>. However, it is understood that the doll <b>102</b> may take any size and any shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> is shaped similar to a functioning toilet and may be comprised of scaled models of several of the elements of a functioning toilet. For example, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the model toilet <b>104</b> can include a toilet seat <b>110</b> and a toilet bowl <b>108</b> with a bowl interior <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the toilet model <b>104</b> can also include a lid <b>114</b>, with one or more suction cups <b>106</b> attached to the back of the lid <b>114</b>. It is contemplated that the suction cups <b>106</b> allow the model toilet <b>104</b> to be attached to a surface such as a bathtub or tile wall, so that the toilet model <b>104</b> is held in place while the child plays with the doll <b>102</b>. The model toilet <b>104</b> may be proportionally sized to the doll <b>102</b>. However, it is understood that the model toilet <b>104</b> may take any size and any shape. In embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> is approximately five inches in length, from the back of the suction cups <b>106</b> to the front of the toilet seat <b>110</b>, and approximately three inches in width. The model toilet <b>104</b> can be approximate 5.25 inches in height. Embodiments of the model toilet <b>104</b> are described in detail below with respect to <figref>FIGS. 4-9</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">With reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, an embodiment of the doll <b>102</b> is illustrated. In one embodiment, the structure of the doll <b>102</b> has an exterior surface <b>202</b> and an interior surface <b>204</b>. The distance between the external surface <b>202</b> and internal surface <b>204</b> may vary. In embodiments, the thickness of the doll <b>102</b> between the external surface <b>202</b>, and internal surface <b>204</b>, and material from which the doll <b>102</b> is formed, are such that a small child would be capable of squeezing the doll <b>102</b> and deforming the doll <b>102</b> to compress the interior of the doll <b>102</b>. This would allow the child to use the potty training system <b>100</b> on his or her own without the aid of an adult, which would encourage the child to be an active participant in potty training. In another aspect of this embodiment, the doll has an internal compartment <b>206</b> that holds the fluid. As used herein, the term âfluidâ means a liquid or a gas. When the doll <b>102</b> is compressed, the internal surface <b>204</b> will collapse and the volume of the internal compartment <b>206</b> will correspondingly be decreased, forcing the fluid from the aperture <b>208</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In embodiments, the doll has an aperture <b>208</b> creating an egress through the external surface <b>202</b> and the internal surface <b>204</b> as well as between the exterior of the doll <b>102</b> and the internal compartment <b>206</b> of the doll <b>102</b>. In an embodiment, the aperture <b>208</b> is positioned near the bottom center of the doll <b>102</b>. However, it is understood that the aperture <b>208</b> may be positioned anywhere on the doll <b>102</b>. While a single aperture <b>208</b> is illustrated, there may also be more than one aperture <b>208</b> on the doll <b>102</b>. In one embodiment the aperture <b>208</b> is annular. However, in other embodiments the aperture <b>208</b> may be any suitable shape. For example, the aperture can be a slit, such that when the doll <b>102</b> is compressed, the elastic nature of the doll opens the aperture <b>208</b>, and when the doll <b>102</b> is released, the aperture <b>208</b> effectively closes, as the sides of the slit abut one another and hold the fluid in place. In embodiments, the aperture <b>208</b> may be sized or shaped such that when the interior compartment is filled with fluid, the fluid is held within the internal compartment <b>206</b>, and either does not leak or leaks minimally by the force of gravity alone. The aperture <b>208</b> may also be sized or shaped and configured to make a squirt or a squeaking sound when air is released from the doll <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">With reference to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment of the doll <b>102</b> is illustrated as compressed. The doll <b>102</b>, shown as a duck, is compressed when a child or parent pushes the exterior surface <b>202</b> inward towards the center of the doll <b>102</b>. The doll <b>102</b> may be sized and configured such that it is easily used by a child. Upon compression of the doll <b>102</b>, the interior surface <b>204</b> will move in relation to the exterior surface <b>202</b>. It is contemplated that the compression of the doll <b>102</b> will decrease the volume of the internal compartment <b>206</b>. Consequently, the fluid within the internal compartment <b>206</b> will be released through the aperture <b>208</b>. Depending on the fluid within the internal compartment <b>206</b>, either gas or liquid, and the size and configuration of the aperture <b>208</b>, the fluid may be released in a squeaking nature or a squirting nature. It is also contemplated the fluid may simply pass through the aperture <b>208</b>. Upon the termination of the compressive force on the doll <b>102</b>, the elastic nature of the doll <b>102</b> will cause it to return to its initial shape <b>302</b>. As the doll <b>102</b> returns to its initial shape <b>302</b>, the volume of the internal compartment <b>206</b> will increase, returning to its initial size and shape. As the internal compartment <b>206</b> increases, it will create a suction effect through the aperture <b>208</b> and the fluid, whether liquid or gas, in the external environment will be sucked into the internal compartment <b>206</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The doll <b>102</b> can be used to simulate urination through compression of the body of the doll <b>102</b>. In one embodiment a child may compress the body of the doll <b>102</b> to release the liquid within the internal compartment <b>206</b>. The child may then place the doll <b>102</b>, in the compressed position, into a liquid such as water. As the compressive force is released, the liquid will be drawn into the internal compartment <b>206</b> due to the resulting vacuum and suction effect. The child may lift the doll <b>102</b> from the liquid and compress the doll <b>102</b>, decreasing the volume of the internal compartment <b>206</b>, and thus forcing the liquid back out through aperture <b>208</b>. In an embodiment in which the aperture <b>208</b> is located at the bottom of the doll <b>102</b>, the liquid released through the aperture will resemble urination. When a child positions the doll <b>102</b> roughly centered over the model toilet <b>104</b> while compressing the doll <b>102</b>, the potty training system <b>100</b> will resemble urination into a toilet. It is contemplated that this repeated process will reinforce the association of urination with a toilet. The system provides a fun way to introduce potty training to a child and allows the child to actively participate in the process, creating a positive association with potty training. This positive association may help to alleviate the intimidation a child may feel with respect to an actual toilet and aid in the potty training process.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Turning now to <figref>FIGS. 4-9</figref>, a perspective view, side view, front view, back view, top view and bottom view, of a model toilet <b>104</b> are shown. In embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> is shaped similar to a functioning toilet and may be comprised of scaled models of several of the elements of a functioning toilet. As depicted in the perspective view of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the model toilet <b>104</b> can include a toilet seat <b>110</b> and a toilet bowl <b>108</b> with an interior <b>112</b>. The toilet bowl can include an aperture <b>116</b> through which liquid can drain. In embodiments, the seat <b>110</b> is fixed to the toilet bowl <b>108</b> or removably attached to the toilet bowl <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, the seat <b>110</b> can be hinged in the same manner as in a functional toilet. In an embodiment, the model toilet <b>104</b> can also include a hinged lid <b>114</b>, which can include an aperture that allows the user to easily grip the lid <b>114</b> to raise and lower the lid <b>114</b>. In other embodiments, the lid <b>114</b> is fixed in position.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> includes a back portion <b>400</b> and a base portion <b>402</b>. As shown, the base portion <b>402</b> supports the toilet bowl <b>108</b> and connects the toilet bowl <b>108</b> to the back portion <b>400</b> of the model toilet <b>104</b>. The back portion <b>400</b> and base portion <b>402</b> resemble parts of a functional toilet, assisting the child in connecting the model toilet <b>104</b> to a functional toilet. In addition, the back portion <b>400</b> and base portion <b>402</b> act as a cover for the mechanics of a model toilet <b>104</b>. For example, the back portion <b>400</b> and base portion <b>402</b> encase the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 4</figref> and more clearly in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the interior <b>112</b> of the model toilet bowl <b>108</b> can include an aperture <b>116</b> through which liquid can drain from the model toilet <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the aperture <b>116</b> is left open to allow the liquid to drain freely from the toilet bowl <b>108</b>. In other embodiments, a flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> includes a valve <b>1006</b> (shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>) that seals the aperture <b>116</b>, where the child can flush the model toilet <b>104</b> by pushing the button and opening the valve <b>1006</b> in the bottom of the interior <b>112</b> of the toilet bowl <b>108</b>. The flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is described in greater detail below with respect to <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In embodiments, the back portion <b>400</b> can be similar in appearance to a functioning toilet, but does not necessarily function in a similar manner. For example, in embodiments the back portion <b>400</b> does not operate as a holding tank for water used in flushing the toilet. Instead, the back portion <b>400</b> provides a cover for the moving parts of the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>, illustrated in the <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, protecting the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> from damage. Additionally, the back portion <b>400</b> can be shaped generally to model the tank of a toilet, assisting the child in associating play and operations of the model toilet <b>104</b> and an actual working toilet. Similarly, the model toilet <b>104</b> can include a base portion <b>402</b> that supports the toilet bowl <b>108</b> and connects to the back portion <b>400</b>. The model toilet <b>104</b> may be proportionally sized to a common functional toilet. However, it is understood that the model toilet <b>104</b> may take any size, shape, and proportions. For example, the model toilet <b>104</b> can be shaped, sized and colored to appeal to a child, introducing the child to the concept of the toilet, but simplified for manufacturing purposes and for use by a small child.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> features a button <b>404</b> that operates the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>. The button <b>404</b> can be located on the top of the back portion <b>400</b> connected to a valve that controls draining of the toilet bowl <b>108</b>. In embodiments, the button <b>404</b> is designed to be easily used by the tiny, weak hands of a small child. In embodiments, the button <b>404</b> is large and takes up most of the top of the back portion <b>400</b>. The button <b>404</b> can be large and brightly colored to encourage the child to press the button <b>404</b> and operate the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>. Depression of the button <b>404</b> can also trigger audio and/or visual stimuli intended to encourage and reward the child for using the model toilet <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As can be seen in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, embodiments of the model toilet <b>104</b> include two suction cups <b>106</b> attached to the back of the toilet tank <b>400</b>. The suction cups <b>106</b> can be attached via any suitable means. When the suction cups <b>106</b> are positioned on the back of the toilet tank <b>400</b>, the model toilet can be attached to a surface via the suction cups <b>106</b> by pressing the suction cups <b>106</b> against the surface. The model toilet <b>104</b> then extends out from the surface, with the button <b>404</b> and toilet bowl <b>108</b> in easy reach of a child user.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The suction cups <b>106</b> can be a circular shape and of a diameter capable of creating suction force strong enough to support the model toilet <b>104</b>. However, it is understood that the suction cups <b>106</b> can take any shape and size capable of creating the suction effect. Generally, suction cups rely on negative fluid pressure to adhere to nonporous surfaces, such as bathroom tile or bathtubs. The suction cups <b>106</b> are made from a flexible material, such as silicone or rubber and have a curved surface. When the center of the suction cup <b>106</b> is pressed against a surface, the suction cup <b>106</b> flexes, expelling air and the volume of space between the surface and the interior of the suction cup <b>106</b> decreases. When the center of the suction cup <b>106</b> is released, or no longer pressed, the suction cup <b>106</b> returns to its original shape, increasing the volume of space between the surface and the suction cup <b>106</b>. The resulting difference in pressure keeps the suction cup <b>106</b> adhered to the surface. When air leaks back into the volume, or the seal is broken allowing air to enter the volume, the suction cup <b>106</b> no longer adheres to the surface. The result is that the suction cup <b>106</b> allows the model toilet to be removably adhered to a variety of generally non-porous surfaces, including but not limited to, mirrors, tile, and bathtubs. The model toilet <b>104</b> can be easily removed generally without damaging the surface to which it was adhered.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">While two suction cups <b>106</b> are shown, a single suction cup <b>106</b> may be sufficient to support the model toilet <b>104</b>, and any number or configuration of suction cups suitable to support the model toilet <b>104</b> can be used. In other embodiments, a method other than suction cups <b>106</b> is used for support. For example, a simple hook or strip of Velcro can be used to support the model toilet <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The suction cups <b>106</b> may be used to temporarily affix the model toilet <b>104</b> to a surface. In one embodiment, the model toilet <b>104</b> may be temporarily affixed to a vertical, tiled wall adjacent to a bathtub or shower, or to the bathtub or shower itself. This may be accomplished by simply pressing the suction cups <b>106</b> of the model toilet <b>104</b> against the wall. With the model toilet <b>104</b> temporarily affixed to the wall, the child will have the freedom to use both hands to compress the doll <b>102</b>. Using both hands may be advantageous considering children lack strength and motor abilities. Additionally, the use of both hands may allow the child to better maneuver the doll <b>102</b> from the water to the model toilet <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> may be temporarily affixed via suction cups <b>106</b> to a surface, for example a mirror or wall near a sink. Alternatively, the potty training system <b>100</b> may be used without affixing the model toilet <b>104</b> to any surface. In another embodiment, the model toilet <b>104</b> can include a hook or loop or molded fitting, such that the model toilet <b>104</b> can be attached to a faucet, handle, spout or other convenient fixture to hold the model toilet <b>104</b> generally in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In other embodiments, the model toilet <b>104</b> can be constructed to float. For example, the model toilet can be formed from a buoyant material and/or shaped to balance and float in liquid. In another embodiment, the model toilet <b>104</b> can be attached to a raft that allows the model toilet <b>104</b> to float in a bathtub or other bodies of water. In a further embodiment, the model toilet <b>104</b> can be attached to a floating ring. For example, a ring of Styrofoam or other buoyant material can be shaped like a life preserver, or other playful shape, and the model toilet <b>104</b> can be attached to this material such that the model toilet <b>104</b> floats in the bathtub or body of water.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, a side view depicting an embodiment of the model toilet <b>104</b> illustrating a flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is shown. The flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is comprised of a button <b>404</b> seated on top of a substantially vertically-oriented rod <b>1002</b>, which is attached to a generally horizontally-oriented stem <b>1004</b>. The stem is connected to a valve <b>1006</b>. In an embodiment, the valve <b>1006</b> is generally hemispherical in shape, so that when the valve <b>1006</b> is closed it is seated in the aperture <b>116</b> at the bottom of the toilet bowl <b>108</b>, which allows the toilet bowl <b>108</b> to retain liquid. Upon opening the valve <b>1006</b>, liquid in the toilet bowl <b>108</b> will drain through the aperture <b>116</b> into the base portion <b>402</b>. In embodiments, the bottom of the base portion <b>402</b> is open allowing the liquid to drain out of the model toilet <b>104</b>, as shown in the bottom view in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>. The draining of the liquid upon pressing the button will likely entertain a small child, encouraging interaction with the model toilet <b>104</b>, and eventually with a functional toilet.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In other embodiments, the valve <b>1006</b> is a pad or protrusion that mates with the aperture <b>116</b>, generally forming a seal to retain liquid in the toilet bowl <b>108</b>. The valve can be formed from an elastic material, including but not limited to silicone or rubber, to better form a seal against the aperture <b>116</b>. It is not required that the valve form a complete seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> also features one or more arms <b>1102</b>, shown in the exploded view in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> and in detail in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>, which hold the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>, including button <b>404</b> and valve <b>1006</b> in place within the back portion <b>400</b> and base portion <b>402</b> of the model toilet <b>104</b>. The arms <b>1102</b> can be shaped to be seated on one or more protrusions within the body of the back portion <b>400</b>. In embodiments, the arms <b>1102</b> flex allowing the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> to move when the button <b>404</b> is pushed and then return the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> to its original position when the button <b>404</b> is released.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Referring once again to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, the flushing mechanism can include one or more springs <b>1008</b> that bias the valve <b>1006</b>, holding the valve <b>1006</b> in place against the aperture <b>116</b> of the toilet bowl <b>108</b> unless pressure is applied via the button <b>404</b>. This pressure from pressing the button <b>404</b> forces the valve <b>1006</b> open from the aperture <b>116</b>. The springs <b>1008</b> create a seal between the toilet aperture <b>116</b> and flushing mechanism valve <b>1006</b>, until a downward force is applied to the button <b>404</b> by the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In embodiments, the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is contained within the model toilet shell, formed from the back portion <b>400</b> and base portion <b>402</b>, and oriented for front-facing symmetry. The flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is enclosed within the model toilet <b>104</b> to prevent injuries to a child such as pinched fingers as well as preventing interference with or breakage of the mechanism <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, the only exposed element of the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is the button <b>404</b>. It is understood that the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> may be constructed of any suitable material known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In embodiments, the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> utilizes a diaphragm-type, convex-side-up valve <b>1006</b>. The valve seal is maintained by the (spring constant) force of the springs <b>1008</b>, connected to the horizontally-oriented stem <b>1004</b>. When the button <b>404</b> is depressed, the connection of the rod <b>1002</b> to the stem <b>1004</b> causes the valve <b>1006</b> to be lowered at a about a 1:1 rate to the depression of the button <b>404</b>. This breaks the valve seal and allows the contents of the toilet bowl <b>108</b> to drain out of the model toilet <b>104</b>. The restoring force of the springs <b>1008</b> causes the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> and valve <b>1006</b> to rise and restore the valve seal when the button <b>404</b> is released, allowing the toilet bowl <b>108</b> to be refilled. It is understood that the valve <b>1006</b> may take any suitable shape, including the aforementioned diaphragm shape, a ball valve, or any other suitable valve. In embodiments, the valve can be formed from rubber, silicone, or other materials capable of forming a seal.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Referring to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, an assembly of the model toilet <b>104</b> and potty training system <b>100</b> is illustrated. As shown, a number of suction cups <b>106</b> are attached to a back plate <b>1100</b> of a back portion <b>400</b> of a model toilet <b>104</b>. Any suitable means for attaching the suction cups <b>106</b> to the back plate <b>1100</b> can be used. The back plate <b>1100</b> is shaped to form the back of the back portion <b>400</b> and to support the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> of the model toilet <b>104</b>. In particular, the back plate <b>1100</b> can include one or more protrusions that support the arms <b>1102</b> of the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In embodiments, the flushing mechanism <b>1000</b> is seated within the back portion <b>400</b> with only the button <b>404</b> exposed to the user.
