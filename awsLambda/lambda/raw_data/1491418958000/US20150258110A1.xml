      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is directed to a method of treating alcohol dependence, including acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms, comprising treating an alcohol dependent patient with ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof at a dosage that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL, including under conditions where the QT interval prolongation does not exceed about 50 milliseconds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Alcohol dependence (also referred to alcohol abuse, alcohol addiction, or alcoholism) is a serious public health problem throughout the world. As many as 140 million people worldwide have an alcohol abuse problem, although only a small fraction of those receive treatment. Alcohol abuse can cause damage to almost every organ in the body, including the brain. Long-term alcohol abuse is known to cause or contribute to numerous diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, dementia, heart disease, peptic ulcers, damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system, cancer, polyneuropathy, nutritional deficiencies, and death.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Complicating the treatment of alcohol dependence, alcohol-dependent patients generally experience significant, potentially fatal, withdrawal symptoms while attempting to quit using alcohol. Acute withdrawal lasts one to three weeks after cessation of alcohol consumption. Acute withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes, and heart failure. Post-acute withdrawal can last significantly longer, with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and tension being common.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Treatment for alcohol dependence generally includes detoxification followed by individual and/or group therapy. Detoxification may include treatment with medications (such as benzodiazepines) that reduce the symptoms of withdrawal. However, drugs such as benzodiazepines have numerous negative side effects, including adverse psychological effects and physical dependence. Benzodiazepines are also known to increase alcohol cravings in alcohol dependent people, and are thus not suitable for long-term treatment of alcohol dependence/addiction.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Due to the severity and duration of withdrawal symptoms, alcohol-dependent patients have a high rate of relapse. There is a significant need for effective, non-addictive treatment for acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms, as well as a method for preventing relapse to alcohol use by a detoxified patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Alcohol consumption has been shown to stimulate the release of endogenous opioids in the brains of both humans and experimental animals. Alcohol's effects on the opioid system are believed to be central to drug-induced reward and relapse to alcohol use, as well as sensitivity to alcohol.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The therapeutic dosing of ibogaine for treating alcohol dependence in humans has not previously been addressed, especially as it relates to dosing protocols that are effective, as well as safe. Indeed, prior to the instant invention, it was uncertain as to whether ibogaine could be administered at a dose which was therapeutic while at the same time safe for patients.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Ibogaine has been used as a botanical preparation from the root bark of iboga tabernathe for over 100 years both as a crude preparation and as semisynthetic ibogaine, which was marketed in France until about 1970. In the United States, ibogaine is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. The use of ibogaine in humans is complicated by the fact that the ranges in the prior art are exceptionally broad (0.01 to 1000 mg/kg body weight). Furthermore, the ranges generally used to treat addiction (e.g., 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg) cause hallucinations and may be fatal. Lotsof and Wachtel, Manual for Ibogaine Therapy: Screening, Safety, Monitoring &amp; Aftercare (2d revision, 2003), accessed at www.ibogaine.desk.nl/manual.html; Hoelen, et al. New Engl. J. Med. 360(3), 308 (2009), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all of its methods, compositions and teachings.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential ventricular tachyarrhythmia which, and can result in death. Serious complications, including ventricular tachyarrhythmia and death, can result from prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval by ibogaine, rendering high doses of ibogaine unacceptable. Heretofore, it was unclear whether a therapeutic dose of ibogaine could be found that resulted in QT interval prolongation within an acceptable range. It is expected that other compounds that share ibogaine's core structure will have a similar prolongation effect on QT interval. See, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/945,746 filed Feb. 27, 2014 entitled METHOD FOR ACUTE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF DRUG ADDICTION, which application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The current invention is predicated on the surprising discovery that treatment of alcohol dependence with ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof can be achieved with an acceptable QT interval prolongation when such compounds are administered within a narrow dosage range. Specifically, dosing an addicted patient with greater than about 1 mg/kg body weight to about 8 mg/kg body weight, provides a therapeutic reduction in withdrawal symptoms in alcohol dependent patients. Preferably, the dose range that provide both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds in addicted humans is between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 4 mg per kg body weight and, more preferably between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 3 mg per kg body weight, or any subrange or subvalue within the aforementioned ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the narrow therapeutic doses of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof described above do not prolong the QT interval to unacceptable levels in human patients. It is expected that alcohol dependent patients will be administered therapeutic doses of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof in a clinical setting with cardiac monitoring. In some embodiments, the patient will be pre-screened to evaluate tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, e.g., to determine whether the patient has any pre-existing cardiac conditions or other indicators which would disqualify them from treatment with ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof. In one embodiment, a patient who exhibits a QT interval prolongation of less than about 20 ms after treatment with one or more therapeutic doses of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof will not require further clinical monitoring.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Some aspects of the current invention are further predicated on the discovery that even lower doses of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof for example approximately 80% or less of the therapeutic dose, may be effective for prevention of relapse of alcohol use in an addicted patient treated to ameliorate their alcohol dependence. That is, a lower dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof can prevent a patient who is no longer physically dependent on alcohol from relapsing to use thereof. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a patient who is no longer physically dependent on alcohol requires less ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof to prevent relapse at least in part because the changes made to the brain by alcohol dependence at least partially reverse when the patient detoxifies from alcohol. This lower, maintenance dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof results in a QT interval prolongation that does not require clinical cardiac monitoring.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient is sufficient to provide an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL, or any subrange or subvalue there between. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 400 ng/mL.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some embodiments, the patient is administered a high (therapeutic) dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof for a period of time to ameliorate the most significant withdraw symptoms, and then is administered a lower (maintenance) dose to prevent relapse to alcohol use. In some embodiments, the patient is administered a therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof for a period of time to ameliorate the most significant withdraw symptoms, and then is administered a decreasing (tapered) amount of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof over time until the maintenance dose is reached. In some embodiments, a high initial therapeutic dose is administered, followed by administration of a lower therapeutic dose. In some embodiments, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is tapered over time from the high therapeutic dose to a lower therapeutic dose.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">In some embodiments, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL is administered as a single dose. In some embodiments, the dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL is administered as multiple doses. In some embodiments, the aggregate dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to about 8 mg/kg. In a preferred embodiment, the aggregate dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to about 4 mg/kg. In another preferred embodiment, the aggregate dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In some embodiments, the serum concentration of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate said dependence while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 80 ms. In one embodiment, the maintenance dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms. In some embodiments, the maintenance dose or therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 30 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the maintenance dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 20 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the patient is tested to determine QT interval before treatment with ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, and if clinician determines that the QT prolongation would be unacceptable risk, ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof therapy will be contraindicated.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">In some embodiments, the serum concentration of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate said dependence while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 80 ms. In one embodiment, the maintenance dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms. In some embodiments, the maintenance dose or therapeutic dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 30 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the maintenance dose of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 20 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the patient is tested to determine QT interval before treatment with ibogaine, and if clinician determines that the QT prolongation would be unacceptable risk, ibogaine therapy will be contraindicated.</p>

      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0000">It should be understood that where âibogaineâ is mentioned herein, one more polymorphs of ibogaine can be utilized and are contemplated. Ibogaine is isolated from Tabernanth iboga, a shrub of West Africa. Ibogaine can also be synthesized using known methods. See, e.g., BÃ¼chi, et al. (1966), J. Am. Chem Society, 88(13), 3099-3109. Unless specified otherwise, âibogaineâ as used herein refers to ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0100">âPharmaceutically acceptable compositionâ refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, particularly, a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0101">âPharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0102">âTherapeutically effective amountâ or âtherapeutic amountâ refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, in the context of treating alcohol dependency, refers to an amount of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that attenuates the dependency and/or symptoms of acute withdrawal for at least 2 hours beyond control (placebo), at least 5 hours beyond control, and preferably at least 10 hours beyond control.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0103">A âtherapeutic levelâ of a drug is an amount of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that is sufficient to treat drug addiction or to treat, prevent, or attenuate acute withdrawal symptoms, but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the âserum concentration.â Where the serum concentration of ibogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term âibogaineâ encompasses any form of ibogaine, including derivatives thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0104">As defined herein, a âprophylactically effective amountâ of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provides attenuation and/or prevention of nicotine cravings in a patient. The prophylactically effective amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically addicted to nicotine. For example, a prophylactically effective amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount. However, a prophylactically effective amount may be the same as the therapeutically effective amount, for example when a patient who is physically addicted to nicotine is administered ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof to attenuate cravings for a period of time when nicotine use is not feasible.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0105">As defined herein, a âmaintenance amountâ of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount that provides attenuation and/or prevention of post-acute withdrawal syndrome in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically dependent upon alcohol. For example, a maintenance amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount, or any subvalue or subrange there between.</p>

      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0110">As used herein the term âsolvateâ is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term âsolvateâ. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0111">As used herein, the terms âaddictionâ, âabuseâ, and âdependenceâ are used interchangeably to refer to the patient's inability to stop using alcohol, even when it would be in his/her best interest to stop.

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0120">âAddictiveâ refers to a compound that, when administered to a mammal over a period of time, creates dependency in the mammal to that compound. The dependence can be physiological and/or psychological. A therapeutic effect of an addictive compound on a mammal may decrease with prolonged administration of the addictive compound, which is a non-limiting example of a physiological dependence. When administered to a mammal, an addictive compound may also create a craving in the mammal for more of it, which is a non-limiting example of a psychological dependence. Examples of addictive compounds include, without limitation, nicotine, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0121">The term âdoseâ refers to a range of ibogaine, ibogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that provides a therapeutic serum level of ibogaine when given to a patient in need thereof.

The attending clinician will select an appropriate dose from the range based on the patient's weight, age, degree of addiction, health, and other relevant factors, all of which are well within the skill of the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0122">The term âunit doseâ refers to a dose of drug that is given to the patient to provide therapeutic results, independent of the weight of the patient. In such an instance, the unit dose is sold in a standard form (e.g., 20 mg tablet). The unit dose may be administered as a single dose or a series of subdoses. In some embodiments, the unit dose provides a standardized level of drug to the patient, independent of weight of patient. Many medications are sold based on a dose that is therapeutic to all patients based on a therapeutic window. In such cases, it is not necessary to titrate the dosage amount based on the weight of the patient.</p>
