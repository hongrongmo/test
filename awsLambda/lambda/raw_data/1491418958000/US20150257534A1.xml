      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Various improved shelving systems are described. The shelving systems are described in the context of a shower caddy, due to particular utility in that context. However, the embodiments and inventions disclosed herein can also be applied to other types of devices and other environments, such as shelving units for kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, cabinets, offices, and other environments outside of a shower.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">Overview</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an embodiment of a shelving system, such as a shower caddy <b>10</b>. As shown, the shower caddy <b>10</b> can include a shelf assembly <b>12</b> and a support member <b>14</b>. The shelf assembly <b>12</b> can be coupled with the support member <b>14</b>, such as to enable the shelf assembly <b>12</b> to be moved relative to (e.g., slid up and down along) the support member <b>14</b> and/or secured with the support member <b>14</b>. In various embodiments, the support member <b>14</b> is configured to attach to a rigid structure of the environment, such as a shower pipe or a floor and/or ceiling of a shower. As shown, the shelf assembly <b>12</b> can include a shelf <b>16</b>, which can be configured to support and/or organize bathing articles. The shelf assembly <b>12</b> can include a shroud <b>18</b> that is configured to selectively reveal and obscure the shelf <b>16</b> and the articles on the shelf <b>16</b>. For example, the shroud <b>18</b> can be an opaque screen that can be rotated around the shelf <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a shower caddy <b>100</b>. As shown, the shower caddy <b>100</b> can include a shelf assembly <b>101</b>. The shelf assembly <b>101</b> can include a first support member <b>102</b> and one or more shelves <b>103</b>. The shelf assembly <b>101</b> can be connected with a second support member <b>104</b>, such via first and/or second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>. As shown, the second support member <b>104</b> can be a rod assembly, which can be configured to extend between a floor and ceiling in a shower enclosure. As also shown, the shelf assembly <b>101</b> can include a shroud <b>107</b>, which can be configured to obscure a portion of the shelves <b>103</b> from view. For example, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the shroud <b>107</b> can be moved between a closed position (e.g., to obscure a portion of the shelves <b>103</b> from view) and an open position (e.g., to permit access and/or view of some or all of the shelves <b>103</b>). Certain implementations have a soap tray <b>108</b>, which can be rigidly or rotatably fixed to the first support member <b>102</b> or to one of the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The shelves <b>103</b> can be configured to facilitate storage and/or drying of bath or shower items. For example, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the shelves <b>103</b> can include drainage holes <b>142</b>, a soap tray <b>108</b>, towel rack, and/or other accessories (e.g., hooks, dividers, baskets, or organizers <b>144</b>, etc.). In certain implementations, one or more of the shelves <b>103</b> have openings <b>146</b> for holding bottles of toiletries (e.g., shampoo) upside down, with the cap of the bottle extending through the openings <b>146</b>. In some embodiments, the shelves <b>103</b> are configured to be the same or similar or include one or more of any of the features of any of the shelves or racks described with respect to U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the shelves <b>103</b> can include article containment features, such as raised edges or walls <b>117</b>. The walls <b>117</b> can encircle or surround the entire or substantially the entire perimeter or circumference of the shelves <b>103</b>. In some embodiments, the raised edges or walls <b>117</b> are solid walls. In other embodiments, the raised edges or walls <b>117</b> include one or more wires, cables, or cylindrical tubes instead of a solid wall construction or configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">As described in further detail below, the shroud <b>107</b> can be configured to obscure the contents of at least one of the shelves <b>103</b>. For example, the shroud <b>107</b> can be a cover, gate, shield, curtain, cabinet, or screen that inhibits or prevents viewing and/or accessing of the contents of the shelves <b>103</b> in certain configurations. In various embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is movable (e.g., rotatable, retractable, pivoted about a joint or pin, etc.) between a first position and a second position. The first position can be a position in which the contents of the shelves <b>103</b> are closed, hidden, or concealed. The second position can be a position in which the contents of the shelves <b>103</b> are open, accessible, or viewable. This can provide the ability to selectively obscure or reveal the contents of the shelves <b>103</b>, such as depending on whether the shroud <b>107</b> is placed in the first or second position.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is rotatable. In certain variants, the shroud <b>107</b> rotates about an axis A<b>1</b> that extends axially through, and/or generally parallel to, a longitudinal axis of the first support member <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> rotates independently of or relative to the one or more shelves <b>103</b>. In certain embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> rotates relative to (e.g., around) the shelves <b>103</b>. In some variants, the shroud <b>107</b> and shelves <b>103</b> rotate together. In some implementations, the shroud <b>107</b> has one degree of freedom of movement (e.g., around the axis A<b>1</b>). In certain variants, the shroud <b>107</b> has two degrees of freedom of movement (e.g., around the axis A<b>1</b> and along an axis A<b>2</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In various embodiments, some, substantially all, or the entire shower caddy <b>100</b> is made of one or more corrosion-resistant materials. For example, the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the second support member <b>104</b> can be aluminum (e.g., extruded aluminum, formed satin aluminum that is bead blasted with clear anodizing, etc.). The support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be constructed of other suitable materials, including, but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, or any other metal, plastics, wood, or any other material.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Support Members</heading>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">With continued reference to <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can each be in the form of an elongate member, such as a pole, shaft, rod, or otherwise. Either or both of the support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be the same or similar to, or include one or more of any of the features of, any of the support or elongate members described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the second support member <b>104</b> (and/or the first support member <b>102</b>) can have a telescoping configuration. In some embodiments, upper and lower ends of one of the support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can be anchored against upper and lower stationary objects. For example, in some embodiments, a lower end of the second support member <b>104</b> can be pressed against the floor of a shower or bathtub and an upper end of the second support member <b>104</b> can be pressed against the ceiling above the shower or bathtub. The anchoring can occur with sufficient force to secure the entire shower caddy <b>100</b> in a desired position.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The first and second support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can have various cross-sectional shapes. For example, the first and second support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> can have a cross-sectional shape that is generally: cylindrical, circular, triangular, trapezoidal, rectangular, square, or other angular cross-sectional configuration. In some embodiments, the first and/or second support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> have an I-beam shaped cross-section. In certain implementations, the first and second support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> have the same cross-sectional shape. As shown, in some variants, the first and second support members <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> have different cross-sectional shapes. For example, the first support member <b>102</b> can have a generally circular cross-sectional shape and the second support member <b>104</b> can have a non-circular cross-sectional shape, such as generally: rectangular, diamond shaped, or otherwise. This can aid in allowing components (e.g., the shelves <b>103</b>) to rotate about the first support member <b>102</b> and can inhibit components (e.g., the shelf assembly <b>101</b>) from rotating about the second support member <b>104</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="2">Arms</heading>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As noted above, the shower caddy <b>100</b> can include first and/or second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>. The arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> can be configured to facilitate spacing the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the shelf assembly <b>101</b> apart from the second support member <b>104</b>. This can allow clearance for the movement of the shroud <b>107</b>, as will be discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are configured to facilitate moving (e.g., sliding) the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the shelf assembly <b>101</b> relative to the second support member <b>104</b>. This can allow the shelf assembly <b>101</b> to be placed at a desirable position (e.g., a convenient height to allow access to articles on the shelves <b>103</b>). In some embodiments, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are configured to facilitate securing (e.g., coupling, connecting, locking) the shelf assembly <b>101</b> with the second support member <b>104</b>. This can aid in maintaining the shelf assembly <b>101</b> at the desirable position.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> can connect the shelving assembly <b>101</b> with the second support member <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, an end of the first arm <b>105</b> can be coupled to the shelf assembly <b>101</b> and another end of the first arm <b>105</b> can be coupled to the second support member <b>104</b>. Similarly, an end of the second arm <b>106</b> can be coupled to the shelf assembly <b>101</b> and another end of the second arm <b>106</b> can be coupled to the second support member <b>104</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> connect to top and bottom portions of the first support member <b>102</b> of the shelf assembly <b>101</b>, respectively. In some other embodiments, the first and/or second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> couple with other portions along the length of the first support member <b>102</b>, such as at approximately: Â¼ of the length, â of the length, Â½ of the length, â of the length, Â¾ of the length, or otherwise. As illustrated, in certain embodiments, the first and second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> extend generally orthogonally away from a longitudinal axis A<b>2</b> of the second support member <b>104</b> and/or towards the first support member <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The first and second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, respectively, can include a receiving element <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>, such as an aperture or recess. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a portion of the second support member <b>104</b> can extend through the receiving elements <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, the receiving elements <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the second support member <b>104</b> have a corresponding or mating shape. In some embodiments, such a corresponding or mating shape can inhibit or prevent the one or more arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and/or the shelf assembly <b>101</b> from rotating about the second support member <b>104</b>. For example, the shape can be polygonal (e.g., triangular, rectangular, etc.) or otherwise non-circular.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In some embodiments, the first and/or second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> are movably connected to the second support member <b>104</b>. For example, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> can slide vertically in an axial direction along the second support member <b>104</b>. In some implementations, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> can rotate about the longitudinal axis A<b>2</b> of the second support member <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> can have at least one or two degrees of freedom relative to the second support member <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, at least one of the first and second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> can include a locking mechanism <b>118</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the second arm <b>106</b> (e.g., a bottom arm) includes the locking mechanism <b>118</b>. The locking mechanism <b>118</b> can be configured to releasably engage (e.g., secure, lock, or fix) the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> with the second support member <b>104</b>. This can enable the shelving assembly <b>101</b> to be moved relative to the second support member <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, locking mechanism <b>118</b> is configured to be toggled between a locked position (e.g., in which the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> are secured in position relative to the second support member <b>104</b>) and an unlocked position (e.g., in which the arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and the shelf assembly <b>101</b> are movable along the longitudinal axis A<b>2</b> of the second support member <b>104</b> and/or rotatable about the longitudinal axis A<b>2</b> of the second support member <b>104</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The locking mechanism <b>118</b> can include an actuatable component <b>120</b>, such as a handle, lever, switch or otherwise. The actuatable component <b>120</b> can be movable between a first position and a second position corresponding to the locked and unlocked positions, respectively. An engagement mechanism <b>122</b>, such as a pin, can be coupled to the actuatable component <b>120</b>. In certain embodiments, when the actuatable component <b>120</b> is in the first position, the engagement mechanism <b>122</b> is engaged with a corresponding engagement structure <b>124</b> (e.g., hole, opening, channel, aperture, recess, etc.) in the second support member <b>104</b>. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, a pin of the locking mechanism <b>118</b> can be received in an aperture in the second support member <b>104</b>. This can provide a physical interference that inhibits the arm <b>106</b> (and/or the shelving assembly <b>101</b> as a whole) from moving relative to the second support member <b>104</b>. In certain implementations, when the locking mechanism <b>118</b> is in the locked position, some or all of the weight of the shelf assembly <b>101</b> is transferred to the second support member <b>104</b> via the locking mechanism <b>118</b> (e.g., such as through the interference between the pin and the second support member <b>104</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">In certain embodiments, when the actuatable component <b>120</b> is in the second position, the engagement mechanism <b>122</b> and the corresponding engagement structure <b>124</b> are disengaged from each other. In some variants, the engagement mechanism <b>122</b> can be positioned away from and/or out of the engagement structure <b>124</b>. For example, with reference to the embodiment shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the pin can be withdrawn from the aperture in the second support member <b>104</b>, thereby removing the physical interference connecting the arm <b>106</b> and the second support member <b>104</b>. This can allow the arm <b>106</b> (and/or the shelving assembly <b>101</b> as a whole) to be relative to the second support member <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the second support member <b>104</b> includes a plurality of the engagement structures <b>124</b> at various positions along and/or around the second support member <b>104</b>, such as at various heights and/or positions about the circumference or outer perimeter of second support member <b>104</b>. This can provide flexibility in selecting where to position the arm <b>106</b> along the second support member <b>104</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In some embodiments, the actuatable component <b>120</b> of the locking mechanism <b>118</b> is configured for ready access by a user. For example, as shown, the actuatable component <b>120</b> can be located on the arm <b>106</b>, such as on a lower surface of the arm <b>106</b>. In some variants, during movement of the actuatable component <b>120</b> from the first position to the second position, the actuatable component <b>120</b> is pushed or pulled away from the second support member <b>104</b> and/or towards the first support member <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the actuatable mechanism <b>120</b> is moved within an aperture, recess, opening or space <b>128</b> in the arm <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The locking mechanism <b>118</b> can include a biasing member <b>126</b>, such as a spring. The biasing member <b>126</b> can bias the engagement mechanism <b>122</b> into engagement with the engagement structure <b>124</b>. This can encourage the locking mechanism <b>118</b> toward the locked position. For example, in some variants, when no force is applied to the actuatable mechanism <b>120</b> by the user, then the engagement mechanism <b>122</b> is pushed toward the second support member <b>104</b> (e.g., toward the engagement structure <b>124</b>). In various embodiments, the locking mechanism <b>118</b> can be spring-loaded.</p>
      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="2">Shroud</heading>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">As previously mentioned, some embodiments include a shroud <b>107</b>. The shroud <b>107</b> can be a cover, gate, shield, curtain, or screen that inhibits or prevents viewing of the contents of the shelves <b>103</b> in certain configurations. In the embodiment illustrated, the shroud <b>107</b> includes a curved opaque plate. In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is opaque (e.g., allows the passage therethrough of no or substantially no light). In some variants, the shroud <b>107</b> is translucent, thereby allowing passage therethrough of some light (e.g., less than or equal to about: 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, values between the aforementioned values, or other values).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The shroud <b>107</b> can be configured to enable a user to selectably obscure one or more of the shelves <b>103</b> and their contents from view. This can protect the privacy of a user by hiding certain articles on the shelves <b>103</b> from view. For example, during a party or other social occasion, the shroud <b>107</b> can hide articles on the shelves <b>103</b> from being observed by guests that use the bathroom in which the shower is located.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The shroud <b>107</b> can enhance the aesthetic of a shower. Users may choose to store many different articles (e.g., shampoos, body washes, razors, wash cloths, etc.) on the shelves <b>103</b>, which can lead to a disorganized appearance. Also, articles on the shelves <b>103</b> may drip or otherwise cause a mess, which can further reduce the aesthetic of the shower. The shroud <b>107</b> ameliorates such problems by hiding the shelves <b>103</b>, as well as the articles and/or the associated mess. This can provide an organized and/or clean appearance of the shower. For example, the shroud <b>107</b> can provide a streamlined look for the shower. The ability, using the shroud <b>107</b>, to conceal portions of the shelves <b>103</b> and/or personal articles positioned thereon (e.g., when not in use or as desired) can confer an improved quality, feel, functionality, and/or a more luxurious, seamless and aesthetically-pleasing appearance.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the shroud <b>107</b> can partially cover or surround portions of the one or more shelves <b>103</b>. For example, as shown, the shroud <b>107</b> can extend around a portion of the circumference of the shelves <b>103</b> and fully or partially between a top plate <b>130</b> and a bottom plate <b>134</b> of the shelf assembly <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> includes a half or semi-circular, cylindrical, arced, or arched wall, plate, or base. In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> has an angular, wedged, generally V-shaped, generally U-shaped, rectangular, and/or planar wall or base configuration. The shroud <b>107</b> can extend partially or substantially around the entire outer circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves <b>103</b>. For example, the shroud <b>107</b> can extend around a portion of the circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves <b>103</b>, such as at least â, Â¼, â, Â½, â, Â¾, â, or any value between the aforementioned values. The shroud <b>107</b> can be configured to extend around various amounts of the circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves <b>103</b>, such as at least approximately: 45Â°, 90Â°, 135Â°, 180Â°, 225Â°, 270Â°, 315Â° and/or any value therebetween. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the shroud <b>107</b> extends around approximately 180 degrees (e.g., approximately half) of the circumference of the one or more shelves <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In various embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> can be configured to move (e.g., relative the shelves <b>103</b> and/or the second support member <b>104</b>) between a first position and a second position. For example, the shroud <b>107</b> can be configured to rotate, retract, pivot, or slide between the first and second positions. In the first position, the shroud <b>107</b> can surround or cover at least a first portion of the shelves <b>103</b>, such as a front or anterior portion. This can obscure from view (e.g., conceal, cover, hide, block, and/or render generally inaccessible) some or all of the shelves <b>103</b>, as well as one or more personal articles (not shown) positioned on the shelves <b>103</b>. In the second position, the shroud <b>107</b> can extend around a second portion of the shelves <b>103</b>, such as a rear or posterior portion. This can provide ready access to, and viewing of, the articles on the shelves <b>103</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In the embodiment illustrated, the shroud <b>107</b> rotates about a longitudinal axis A<b>1</b> of the first support member <b>102</b>. In certain variants, between the first and second positions, the shroud <b>107</b> rotates approximately 180Â° about A<b>1</b>. In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is configured to rotate about A<b>1</b> at least about: 15Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 75Â°, 90Â°, 105Â°, 120Â°, 135Â°, 150Â°, 165Â°, 195Â°, 210Â°, 225Â°, 240Â°, 255Â°, 270Â°, 285Â°, 300Â°, 315Â°, 330Â°, 345Â°, values between the aforementioned values, or other values. In certain embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> can be moved to intermediate positions, such as positions between the first and second positions. This can provide flexibility in the amount of the shelves <b>103</b> that is concealed and revealed, and/or in the amount of access that is permitted to the shelves <b>103</b> and the articles thereon.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is coupled to the top plate <b>130</b> and the bottom plate <b>134</b> of the shelving assembly <b>101</b>. For example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the shroud <b>107</b> can be coupled to the plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> via one or more fastening members <b>132</b> (e.g., screw, pins, rivets, welds, or otherwise). In some embodiments, one or both of the plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> has a shape that corresponds to the outer shape of one or all of the shelves <b>103</b>. For example, as shown, the plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> and the shelves <b>103</b> can each have a generally round peripheral shape. In certain embodiments, the plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> have different shapes than the shelves <b>103</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, one or both of the plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> can have an opening or channel to facilitate airflow and/or drainage.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In certain implementations, the top and bottom plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> are coupled to the first and second arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> via upper and lower collars <b>138</b>, <b>136</b>, respectively. The top and bottom plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> can have openings through which the first support member <b>102</b> extends. In various embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b>, plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, and/or collars <b>138</b>, <b>136</b> are rotatable about the first support member <b>102</b> (e.g., providing at least one degree of freedom) between at least the first and second positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In various embodiments, the shelf assembly <b>101</b> includes features to facilitate rotation of the shroud <b>107</b>. For example, as shown in FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b>-<b>7</b>, the shelf assembly <b>101</b> can have lower and/or upper bearing assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>170</b>, such as bearings, bushings, or otherwise. The bearing assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> can be configured to enable the shroud <b>107</b>, plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, and/or collars <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> to rotate around the shelves <b>103</b> and/or the first support member <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the shroud <b>107</b> is configured to rotate at least about 180Â° and/or less than or equal to about 360Â° around the shelves <b>103</b>. In certain variants, shelves <b>103</b> and the shroud <b>107</b> remain rotationally fixed relative to each other (e.g., the shelves <b>103</b> and the shroud <b>107</b> are directly or indirectly rigidly connected together). In some implementations, the shelves <b>103</b> and the shroud <b>107</b> rotate around the first support member <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In some embodiments, the bearing assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> are positioned between the first support member <b>102</b> and the collars <b>138</b>, <b>136</b>, plates <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, and/or arms <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>. For example, the bearing assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> can be positioned around or adjacent an exterior surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and an interior surface of the collars <b>138</b>, <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, the upper bearing assembly <b>170</b> is coupled or connected to a downwardly extending inner surface <b>172</b> of the upper collar <b>138</b>. The upper bearing assembly <b>170</b> is positioned between an outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and a perimeter of an aperture or hole in the upper plate <b>130</b>. Such a configuration can allow the plate <b>130</b>, shroud <b>107</b>, and/or collar <b>138</b> to rotate about the first support member <b>102</b> extending through the aperture or hole in the upper plate <b>130</b>. The upper plate <b>130</b> can be attached or coupled to the collar <b>138</b> by engagement or fastening members <b>174</b>, such as screws or pins. In some implementations, the lower bearing assembly <b>150</b> is similarly rotatably connected with the first support member <b>102</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Detent Assembly</heading>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In some embodiments, one or both of the bearing assemblies <b>150</b>, <b>170</b> includes a position facilitating assembly, such as a detent assembly. For example, in the shower caddy <b>100</b>, the lower bearing assembly <b>150</b> includes the detent assembly. The detent assembly can be configured to bias or urge the shroud <b>107</b> into or towards one or more discrete and/or rotational positions. For example, the detent assembly can encourage the shroud <b>107</b> into or toward the first or second positions discussed above (e.g., an obscuring position and a non-obscuring position, closed position and an open, or otherwise).</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an example of the detent assembly. As shown, the detent assembly can include a lower detent block <b>152</b>. The lower detent block <b>152</b> can include one or more recesses <b>154</b> and one or more raised portions <b>157</b> (e.g., formed along an upper surface of the lower detent block <b>152</b>). For example, as shown, the lower detent block can include first and second recesses <b>154</b> and first and second raised portions <b>157</b>. In some implementations, the first and second recesses <b>154</b> and/or the first and second raised portions <b>157</b> are positioned at approximately opposite sides of the detent block <b>152</b> (e.g., spaced or positioned 180 degrees from each other and/or positioned at about 0Â° and 180Â°, respectively).</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The detent assembly can include an upper detent block <b>153</b>. As shown, the upper detent block <b>153</b> can have one or more protrusions <b>158</b>, such as a tab or ball. Some embodiments have first and second protrusions <b>158</b>. As shown, the first and second protrusions <b>158</b> can be positioned on approximately opposite sides of the upper detent block <b>153</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">The detent assembly can include a biasing member, such as a spring <b>155</b>. In certain variants, the spring <b>155</b> is compressed between the lower detent block <b>152</b> and the arm <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the spring <b>155</b> biases the lower detent block <b>152</b> upwardly and/or into engagement with the upper detent block <b>153</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">With continued reference to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the lower and upper detent blocks <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> can interact to provide rotational rest positions. Such positions can be positions in which the blocks <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> tend not to rotate relative to each other. In certain embodiments, a rotational rest position is achieved when corresponding features of the lower and upper detent blocks <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> are rotationally aligned (e.g., raised portions of one of the detent blocks are received in recessed portions of the other, or vice versa). For example, in some embodiments, the recess <b>154</b> and/or the raised portion <b>157</b> of the lower detent block <b>152</b> can engage with the protrusion <b>158</b> on the upper detent block <b>153</b>, which can urge the protrusion <b>158</b> into the recess <b>154</b> and can produce a rotational rest position. Similarly, in some embodiments, a lower surface of the upper detent block <b>153</b> can includes a recess that can be urged into juxtaposition with the raised portions <b>157</b> of the lower detent block <b>152</b>, thereby producing a rotational rest position. In various embodiments, the number of recesses <b>154</b> and/or raised portions <b>157</b> determine the number of rotational rest positions for the shroud <b>107</b>. For example, a pair of recesses can correspond to two rotational rest positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">In various implementations, when the upper detent block <b>153</b> is in a rotational rest position, the shroud <b>107</b> is in a rotational rest position as well. This is because, in some embodiments, the upper detent block <b>153</b> is rigidly connected with the shroud <b>107</b> (e.g., via the plate <b>134</b>). In some variants, when the protrusion <b>158</b> is positioned within or generally aligned with a first recess, the shroud <b>107</b> is in a closed position, and when the protrusion <b>158</b> is positioned within or generally aligned with a second recess (e.g., located approximately 180 degrees from the first recess) the shroud <b>107</b> is in an open position. In some implementations, the bias of the spring <b>155</b> can aid in maintaining the blocks <b>152</b>, <b>153</b> in the rotational rest position.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In some embodiments, a plurality of (e.g., two or more) rotatable rest positions are provided, such as an open position, a closed position, and at least one intermediate position. For example, one, two, three, four, or more corresponding recesses <b>154</b>, raised portions <b>157</b>, and/or corresponding ramped surfaces <b>156</b> can be provided, such as on opposite sides or about 180Â° apart from each other on the lower detent block <b>152</b>. Pairs of recesses <b>154</b> and raised portions <b>157</b> can be formed about 180Â° apart from each other at various positions between the closed and open positions. For example, pairs of recesses <b>154</b> and/or raised portions <b>157</b> can be formed on opposite sides of the detent block <b>152</b> at about: Â±15Â°, Â±30Â°, Â±45, Â±60Â°, Â±75Â°, Â±90Â°, Â±105Â°, Â±120Â°, Â±135Â°, Â±150Â°, Â±165Â°, Â±180Â°, 0Â° and 180Â°, value between the aforementioned values, or other values. This can provide flexibility in positioning the shroud <b>107</b> and/or provides the shroud <b>107</b> with multiple rotatable rest positions between the closed and open positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Certain embodiments require an initial force to move the shroud <b>107</b> from a rotational rest position, such as the open and closed positions of the shroud <b>107</b>. In some implementations, the initial force (e.g., a force that is generally tangential to the periphery of the shroud <b>107</b>) must be sufficient to overcome a force of the spring <b>155</b> urging the protrusion <b>158</b> into the recess <b>154</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In some embodiments, the detent assembly is configured to aid in rotating the shroud <b>107</b> to a rotational rest position. For example, when a user rotates the shroud <b>107</b> to a position between the closed and open position (or another position in which the protrusion <b>158</b> is not aligned with recess <b>154</b>) and then releases the shroud <b>107</b>, the detent assembly can motivate the shroud <b>107</b> to rotate to the open or closed positions (or another position in which the protrusion <b>158</b> is aligned with recess <b>154</b>). In some implementations, when the shroud <b>107</b> is rotated from the closed position and the protrusion <b>158</b> is moved up the first ramped surface <b>156</b> towards the adjacent raised portion <b>157</b>, and the shroud <b>107</b> is released, then the interaction of the spring <b>155</b>, first ramped surface <b>156</b>, protrusion <b>158</b>, and detent block <b>152</b> will tend to urge the protrusion <b>158</b> back down the first ramped surface <b>156</b> toward alignment with the recess <b>154</b> and into the closed position. In certain variants, when the shroud <b>107</b> is rotated from the closed position and the protrusion <b>158</b> is moved up the first ramped surface <b>156</b> past the adjacent raised portion <b>157</b> to a second ramped surface <b>156</b> on a second side of the raised portion <b>157</b>, and the shroud <b>107</b> is released, the interaction of the spring <b>155</b>, second ramped surface <b>156</b>, protrusion <b>158</b>, and detent block <b>152</b> can motivate the protrusion <b>158</b> down the second ramped surface <b>156</b>. This can urge the protrusion <b>158</b> into alignment with the second recess <b>154</b> (e.g., on the opposite side of the first recess <b>154</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In some embodiments, in response to movement of the shroud <b>107</b> (e.g., by a user moving the shroud <b>107</b>), the detent assembly (and thus the shroud <b>107</b>) can appear to âautomaticallyâ move to a rotational position. For example, after a user applies an initial force (e.g., to move the protrusion <b>158</b> beyond an apex of the raised portion <b>157</b>), the shroud <b>107</b> can appear to move the remainder of the way to the next rotational rest position on its own, such as because of the protrusion <b>158</b> being motivated down the ramped surfaces <b>156</b> into the recesses <b>154</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In some implementations, the shower caddy <b>100</b> is configured to provide tactile feedback to a user during movement of the shroud <b>107</b>. For example, the above-described manner in which the shroud <b>107</b> is maintained in one of the open and closed positions via the detent assembly, and/or in which the shroud <b>107</b> is moved between the open and closed positions, provides tactile feedback to the user. This can provide an indication to the user, such as a positioning of the shroud <b>107</b>. In some implementations, the detent assembly facilitates substantially silent movement of the shroud <b>107</b> and/or can promote a smooth and elegant operation, which can suggest a high-quality of workmanship of the shower caddy <b>100</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Clamping Mechanism</heading>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">As noted above, the caddy <b>100</b> can include one or more shelves <b>103</b>. In some embodiments, the shelves <b>103</b> can be rotatable and/or adjusted in the vertical direction relative to the longitudinal axis A<b>1</b> of the first support member <b>102</b> (e.g., move or articulate about two degrees of freedom). This can allow the shelves <b>103</b> to be positioned as desired (e.g., along and/or around the first support member <b>102</b>) or to accommodate other devices or appliances that may be in a user's shower, as well as various sizes of items, such as toiletries, that may be oversized.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Certain embodiments of the shower caddy <b>100</b> include features configured to selectively secure the shelves <b>103</b>, such as a clamping mechanism <b>162</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can be configured to releasably secure and support one of the shelves <b>103</b> on the first support member <b>102</b>. In some variants, one or more of the shelves <b>103</b> are rigidly or fixedly coupled to the first support member <b>102</b>. The clamping mechanism <b>162</b> may be configured the same or similar to or include one or more of any of the features of any of the clamping mechanisms described with respect to U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, or may include any of the features described herein. As will be described in more detail below, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can be configured to allow a user to adjust a position of the shelves <b>103</b> in addition to holding it in place on the first support member <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can be slidably mounted on the first support member <b>102</b> in the vertical or longitudinal direction and/or rotatably mounted about the longitudinal axis A<b>1</b> of the first support member <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can have a body <b>166</b>, such as a portion that surrounds or fits around the entire or substantially the entire perimeter of the first support member <b>102</b>. The clamping mechanism <b>162</b> be configured to couple to a bottom surface of a shelf <b>103</b>. As described in more detail below, the shelf <b>103</b> can be adjusted, rotatably and/or vertically about the longitudinal axis A<b>1</b> of the first support member <b>102</b>, when the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> is loosened. When the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> is tightened, the shelf <b>103</b> is secured to the first support member <b>102</b> in a fixed position. Thus, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can be configured to hold the shelf <b>103</b> in place, even when the shelf <b>103</b> is loaded with the maximum design weight and/or in wet environments, such as a shower.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">In some implementations, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> includes an outer clamp body <b>166</b> and clamp lever <b>164</b>. The clamp body <b>166</b> can have an internal gasket, clamping plate, or clamping surface <b>168</b> that surrounds and/or engages a portion of, substantially the entire, or the entire outer surface or perimeter of the first support member <b>102</b>. The internal surface <b>168</b> can be configured as a curved surface extending radially outward around the perimeter of the first support member <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In certain variants, the clamp lever <b>164</b> can be rotatably mounted relative to the clamp body <b>166</b>. The lever <b>164</b> can be configured to move between open (or unlocked) and closed (or locked) positions. For example, the lever <b>164</b> can be configured to secure the shelf <b>103</b> to the first support member <b>102</b> when the lever <b>164</b> is in the closed position and to allow the shelf <b>103</b> to be moved (e.g., vertically and/or rotatably) when the lever <b>164</b> is in the open position. In some embodiments, the clamp lever <b>164</b> can be formed of a translucent material, such as translucent polycarbonate. In some embodiments, the clamp lever <b>164</b> can be formed of a material comprising polyoxymethylene, such as DelrinÂ®. In some variants, the clamp lever <b>164</b> is made of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or plastic.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In some embodiments, the lever <b>164</b> can include a cam <b>165</b> (which can be identical or similar to, or include one or more of the features of, the cams described is U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405). In certain variants, the lever <b>164</b> has movement converting feature, such as an inwardly protruding surface <b>167</b> (e.g., a surface that extends generally towards the center of the first support member <b>102</b>). The protruding surface <b>167</b> can be configured to convert the pivotal movement of the lever <b>164</b> into a translational movement and/or radially inward force of the cam <b>165</b> and/or inner surface <b>168</b> against the first support member <b>102</b> to secure the shelf <b>103</b> in position. For example, the lever <b>164</b> can be hinged or otherwise pivotally mounted relative to the clamp body <b>166</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In some embodiments, the cam <b>165</b> can include at least a first portion having a radius R<b>1</b> and a second portion with a radius R<b>2</b>, R<b>2</b> being larger than R<b>1</b>. When the lever <b>164</b> is rotated such that the first portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and the protruding surface <b>167</b> is disengaged from the inner surface <b>168</b>, the clamp device <b>162</b> is in the open position. In some variants, when the lever <b>164</b> is rotated such that the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and the protruding surface <b>167</b> is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface <b>168</b>, the clamp device <b>162</b> is in the closed position. These movements are described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some embodiments, the cam <b>165</b> can include a third portion having a radius R<b>3</b> which is larger than radius R<b>2</b>. As such, the cam <b>165</b> can be configured to provide an âover-centerâ operation. For example, with the radius R<b>3</b> being larger than both the radiuses R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, the cam <b>165</b> will generate a maximum pressing force against the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> when the third portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. This pressing force can be reduced as the lever <b>164</b> is further pivoted until the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the protruding surface <b>167</b> is engaged with (e.g., abutted against) the inner surface <b>168</b>. This can provide the user with a tactile signal that the lever <b>164</b> has been moved to the closed position.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In some variants, the lever <b>164</b> is configured to move more rapidly during certain portions of its travel than in other portions of its travel. For example, the lever <b>164</b> can be configured to move rapidly from the intermediate position (e.g., in which the third portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>) to the closed position (e.g., in which the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and the protruding surface <b>167</b> is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface <b>168</b>). In some implementations, the lever <b>164</b> is configured to move between the intermediate and closed positions more rapidly (e.g., with less rotation and/or time) than it moves between the open and intermediate positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">
        <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show an example of the lever <b>164</b> in the closed position, which is when the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> is tightened to hold the shelf <b>103</b> in place. In this closed position, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> is secured to the first support member <b>102</b> by the pressing force (e.g., radially inward force, friction force) generated by the cam <b>165</b> against the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>, such as when the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the protruding surface <b>167</b> is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface <b>168</b>. In certain embodiments, the inner surface <b>168</b> is configured to act as a stopping member to maintain the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> in the closed position (e.g., such that the lever <b>164</b> is in a generally vertical position or orientation and the second portion of the cam <b>165</b> is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>) and/or to inhibit the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> from over-rotating or rotating past the closed position. In some embodiments, the protruding surface <b>167</b> imparts a pressing force that pushes or presses against the inner surface <b>168</b>, which, in turn, pushes or presses the inner surface <b>168</b> against an outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. In various implementations, the magnitude of the pressing force is sufficient to support the shelf <b>103</b> at the desired location along and/or around the first support member <b>102</b> under a maximum load.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In certain embodiments, the lever <b>164</b> can be moved to the open position by pulling or rotating it generally in the direction of an arrow A (e.g., in a direction generally away from the first support member <b>102</b>). This can result in the cam <b>165</b> rotating in a counter-clockwise direction (as viewed in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>) and moving away from the inner surface <b>168</b> and/or outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. In some variants, the first portion is moved into juxtaposition with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. When the cam <b>165</b> (e.g., lever <b>164</b>) moves away from the inner surface <b>168</b> and/or outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>, the pressing force (e.g., radially inward force, compression, etc.) can be reduced and/or eliminated. For example, the pressing force can be reduced when the second portion of the cam <b>165</b> moves out of juxtaposition with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the protruding surface <b>167</b> disengages (e.g., moves out of contact with) the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. The reduction and/or elimination of the pressing force can remove the securement of the shelf <b>103</b>, which can allow the shelf <b>103</b> to be adjusted vertically and/or rotatably. In some embodiments, when the lever <b>164</b> is in the open position, the first portion having the radius R<b>1</b> is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and/or the protruding surface <b>167</b> is disengaged (e.g., not in contact) with the inner surface <b>168</b> and/or the pressing force is decreased between the cam <b>165</b> and the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>. This can enable the shelf <b>103</b> to be adjusted relative to the second support member <b>102</b>, such as vertically and/or rotatably.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Some embodiments include features to facilitate secure engagement between the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> and the first support member <b>102</b>. For example, the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> can include a resilient member <b>169</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, the resilient member <b>169</b> can be positioned on (e.g., abutted with) the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b>, such as on a side opposite the side the lever <b>164</b> is positioned on. In some variants, the resilient member <b>169</b> is positioned between the outer surface of the first support member <b>102</b> and an inner surface of the clamp body <b>166</b>. The resilient or flexible material <b>169</b> may provide flex and/or increase friction between the clamping mechanism <b>162</b> and the first support member <b>102</b>, such as in response to actuation or moving of the lever <b>164</b> and the cam <b>165</b>. The resilient member <b>169</b> can be made of various resilient and/or flexible materials, such as rubber, rubber-like material, silicone-based material, plastic, or otherwise. In some embodiments, the resilient member <b>169</b> is formed (e.g., co-molded) with a portion of the clamp body <b>166</b>.</p>
