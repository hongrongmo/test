      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present application relates to an aqueous based topical corticosteroid composition.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Topical drug delivery systems are an ideal choice for treating various skin disorders locally. Topical dosage forms such as ointments, creams, gels, sprays, etc. are available to deliver the active agents to diseased area of the skin.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Inflammatory skin disorders are common in people of all age groups, races and genders, and these disorders are characterized by inflammation and irritation of the skin. Diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory skin disorders remains challenging in dermatological practice. Psoriasis is one of the inflammatory skin disorders. It is a chronic papulosquamous cutaneous disease which manifests through the appearance of red scaly patches on the skin. It generally affects the elbows, knees, and scalp. Although many therapeutic choices are available to treat psoriasis such as: topical therapy, phototherapy and systemic therapy, topical corticosteroids are the first choice for treating psoriasis. Phototherapy and systemic therapy are secondary and they are generally preferred when topical corticosteroids fail in treating psoriasis.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Corticosteroids are widely used in clinical practice. In particular, topical corticosteroids have been used to treat various skin conditions such as psoriasis, dermatitis, etc. Corticosteroids are chemically classified into hydrocortisone type, acetonide type, betamethasone type, etc. They are also classified based on their potency in the Vasoconstrictor assay (VCA), otherwise called the skin blanching assay.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The VCA is often used to access the potency of topically administered corticosteroids and to determine the bioequivalence of topically administered corticosteroids as U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for industry. Accordingly, corticosteroids can be classified by VCA as super potent (Class 1), high potent (Class 2), upper mid strength (Class 3), mid strength (Class 4), lower mid strength (Class 5), low potent (Class 6), and least potent (Class 7).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The drug compound having the adopted name âbetamethasone dipropionateâ belongs to super potent (Class 1) and/or high potent (Class 2) and has a chemical name 9-fluoro-11(Î²),17,21-trihydroxy-16(Î²)-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione 17,21-dipropionate and is represented by structural Formula I.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0000">
        <chemistry id="chem-00001-en" num="00001">
          <img id="img-00001-en" he="42.67mm" wi="72.47mm" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" file="US20150258119A1_00006.PNG" img-format="png" original="US20150258119A1-20150917-C00001.TIF" />
        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to cream white, powder. It is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in ethanol and freely soluble in acetone and chloroform.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">Topical betamethasone dosage forms, such as aerosol foam, cream, ointment, gel, and lotion formulations are commercially available. Combination formulations of betamethasone dipropionate with calcipotriene hydrate and also with clotrimazole exist. Betamethasone dipropionate is the active ingredient in commercially available products sold as DIPROLENE AFÂ® and DIPROLENEÂ® that comprise 0.05% betamethasone base, and are intended for application to affected skin areas once or twice daily.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0010">Some topical corticosteroids are administered as occlusive dosage forms, which cause stratum corneum to hydrate thereby improving penetration of corticosteroidal drug into skin layers. The ointment dosage form has greater absorption because of the occlusive nature of the ointment base, however, which creates greasy sensation to subjects. Moreover, it is necessary to rub such formulations into the target site to improve the penetration of the active agent into the epidermis, an action which itself produces irritation. In addition, the presence of alcohol causes irritation/stinging to subject skin, and solution based topical compositions have tendency to evaporate before the active agent penetrates the epidermis. Propellant-containing topical aerosol compositions, in the market, are priced relatively higher than their counterparts.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0011">The stratum corneum (SC) is the first layer of the skin comprising dead cells and provides the rate limiting step in percutaneous absorption of drugs through the skin layers. There are only a few drugs that possess the physiochemical properties to necessary to penetrate the SC. Percutaneous absorption involves the passage of the drug molecule from the skin surface into the stratum corneum under the influence of a concentration gradient and the drug molecule's subsequent diffusion through the stratum corneum and underlying epidermis, through the dermis.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">The nature of the vehicle in a topical composition has a profound effect on the rate of release and delivery of the agent in the skin layers passage through the stratum corneum. The vehicle used to deliver the drug can aid in the efficacy and stability of the product. Generally aqueous vehicles are preferred in topical dosage form due to their non-irritant, superior tolerability and non-toxic nature. An important aspect here is that most of corticosteroid drugs are exceptionally poorly soluble in aqueous vehicles and cause instability.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">Another important aspect in a topical composition is the inclusion of a substance which assists the active agent to penetrate or diffuse through the skin layers, i.e., âskin penetration enhancers.â Skin penetration enhancers are necessary for the active to penetrate in the skin layers. Various classes of skin penetration enhancers are available, such as, fatty acids and their esters, pyrrolidones, sulfoxides, glycols, glycerides, etc. However, skin penetration enhancers are known to act differently with different active agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">Conventionally, topical coricosteroid products are available as creams, lotions and ointments. U.S. Pat. No. 3,892,856 describes the use of corticosteroids dissolved in polyethylene glycol and emulsified into an oleaginous base.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 3,934,013 describes topical pharmaceutical compositions containing at least two corticosteroids, propylene glycol, a fatty alcohol and water. The patentee describes the âfatty alcohol ingredientâ as any fatty alcohol having from 16-24 carbon atoms and, preferably, as a saturated, monohydric primary alcohol such as cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol or behenyl alcohol.</p>

      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0197">Topical Absorption and penetration study of Examples 1-16 compositions Topical spray compositions of the present applications were screened for the penetration of drug into different layers of skin and permeation into the receptor phase by finite dosing method using vertical diffusion cells (Franz-type)</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0198">Methods and Materials:</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0199">There were sixteen treatment groups (n=9 cells for each). Each group was having 3 skin samples received from 3 different donors (55 years old or younger; 3 donorsÃ3 replicates). All the test compositions were stored at room temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0200">Skin model: Human cadaver skin was used in this study. The dermatomed human cadaver skin tissue with average thickness of about 350-450 Î¼m. The donor tissue was divided evenly among the diffusion cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0201">In vitro percutaneous absorption and penetration study: the topical spray compositions of Examples 1-16 were screened using vertical diffusion cells (Franz-type). The skin samples were mounted on individual diffusion cells. Each cell in the station was having diffusion area of 0.503 cm<sup>2 </sup>(8 mm in diameter). Each individual cell was static Franz-cell type. The receptor chamber was filled with 3.0 ml of 4% BSA in water supplemented with 0.01% gentamicin sulfate, which will be vigorously and continually mixed. The temperature was set at 32Â±0.2Â° C. The cell was incubated at 32Â° C. for one hour before dosing. At end of incubation period, samples from the receptor fluid were taken as the t=0 samples. A fresh batch of receptor fluid pre-incubated at 32Â° C. was introduced into the receptor chamber in the HTS cells. The compositions were dosed at a level of approximately 2.5 mg per cell, which was equivalent to 5 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and they were applied using a positive displacement pipette. The dosing volumes were calculated by calculating density of each composition. The samples were collected at the time intervals of 0 hour, 2 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours or 24 hours and stored in a freezer before analysis. Skin penetration was analyzed by samples collected at 0, 2, 6, 10, 12 or 24 hours and the full mass balance study was conducted after 24 hours.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0202">The full mass balance study amount of betamethasone dipropionate and its metabolites were analysed from following skin locations: skin surface (unabsorbed, and/or unpenetrated), stratum corneum (from tape stripping), and epidermis (separation from dermis and followed by solvent extraction), dermis (separation from epidermis and followed by solvent extraction). The tissue surface was wiped with Q-tip wetted with 1ÃPBS three times to remove unabsorbed and unpenetrated API (i.e.,) betamethasone and its metabolites. The standard tape-stripping method was used to remove the stratum corneum (SC) layer. After removal of stratum corneum layer, the remaining tissue was wetted with 1ÃPBS, epidermis and dermis layers were separated mechanically.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0203">All collected samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS with qualified method for following analytes: betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone 17-propionate, betamethasone 21-propionate and betamethasone base. Betamethasone 17-propionate, betamethasone 21-propionate and betamethasone base are the metabolites of the parent drug betamethasone dipropionate.</p>

      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0204">Total forty (40) subjects were enrolled and out of which thirty four (34) had completed the study. This was a randomized, double-blind, single-center, vehicle-controlled, within-subject comparison patch test study of followings for irritation potential when repeatedly applied to the skin under semi-occlusive conditions in healthy volunteers: <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>i. Betamethasone dipropionate Spray (Example 6),</li><li>ii. Vehicle spray (without active agent of example 6),</li><li>iii. Vehicle lotion (isopropyl alcohol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, propylene glycol, phosphoric acid, sodium hydroxide and water i.e. vehicle for DIPROLENE Lotion Augmented 0.05%,</li><li>iv. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) 0.2% and</li><li>v. Saline 0.9%</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0210">All subjects received applications of each study product to intact skin at randomly assigned, adjacent sites on the back. Evaluators and subjects were blinded and unaware of the identity of the study product at the patch test sites. The study products were applied under semi-occlusive patch conditions using a 2 cmÃ2 cm patch. The products were applied to either side of the infrascapular area of the back. Evaluation of dermal reactions at the application sites were assessed clinically using a visual scale that rates the degree of erythema, edema, and other signs of cutaneous irritation.</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0211">A total of 21 patch applications were made over a period of 21 days. Irritancy score of each compositions were recorded.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0212">Conclusion: Significantly more irritation was observed at the Vehicle Lotion site and 0.2% SLS site than at the betamethasone dipropionate spray site, vehicle spray site and 0.9% sterile saline site. There was no significant difference in irritation between the vehicle lotion site and 0.2% SLS site, and no significant difference in irritation between the betamethasone dipropionate spray site and vehicle spray site, the betameth0.9% sterile saline site. Under the exaggerated conditions of use in this study, with continuous exposure under semi occlusion for 21 days, betamethasone dipropionate spray (Example 6) and its vehicle spray (Example 6 without active agent) produced no evidence of significant irritation. In comparison, the vehicle lotion (vehicle for DIPROLINE Lotion augmented 0.05%) produced mild irritation, as there was no significant difference in irritation between the Vehicle Lotion site and 0.2% SLS site, a known mild irritant.</p>

      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="1">Spray Characteristics of Example 6 Composition</heading>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0213">The spray pattern characterizes the spray following impaction on an appropriate target (i.e.,) a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. A TLC plate having silica gel 60, F254 (florescence indicator), 250 Î¼m thick layer on glass was used as target in present study and the TLC plate was held with suitable fastener. Automatic air pressure actuation device were used in the study to automate the spray actuations. Mark VIIÂ® Max pumps (1-10) were used to pump the composition in the spray pattern studies. The spray distance was 40 mm from the spray nozzle to the TLC plate. The sprayer (the container is a 2 oz HDPE bottle) was loaded with compositions of Example 1 and the composition density was 0.9081 g/ml and Kern ALJ220-4NM was used to measure the output from each stroke. Compositions were shaken three times before priming and priming the pump 10Ã into a hood was done to ensure a full stroke. Sprayer and TLC plate with fastener were brought into right position at 40 mm distance. Actuation profile was chosen as the pump output is 0.16 ml; actuation/return Velocity was 100 mm/s; actuation/return acceleration was 5700 mm/s2; initial delay was 0 ms; hold time was 100 ms; final delay was 0 ms and inter actuation delay was 0 ms. After spray, the TLC plate was taken away from the fastener and the spray pattern was viewed under 254 nm UV light and a suitable camera was used to take pictures (eg. Digital camera) in ultraviolet light and minimum and maximum diameters of spray patterns were determined. This test was repeated for 28 days (2 times a day) and compositions were stored in room temperature horizontally and upright positions between the daily tests.</p>
