      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Household dishwashers typically include a treating chamber with one or more dish racks for holding various types of dishes. Traditionally, a non-drawer type dishwasher includes an upper rack that holds glassware and small dishes, and a lower rack that holds larger dishes, such as plates. A spray system that provides treating liquid into the treating chamber may include one or more sprayers that direct the liquid onto the dishes in the racks. It can be challenging for the sprayer to provide a sufficient amount of the liquid into glassware with narrow openings, such as bottles and vases.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A dishwasher according to one embodiment comprises a tub at least partially defining a treating chamber receiving dishes for treatment according to a cycle of operation, a rack disposed within the tub for receiving dishes, and at least one sprayer provided on the rack and positioned to spray treating liquid onto dishes received by the rack. The at least one sprayer may have a first liquid opening and a movable extension having a second liquid opening. The extension may be movable between a first position where the treating liquid flows through the first liquid opening into the treating chamber and does not flow through the second liquid opening and a second position where the treating liquid flows through the second liquid opening into the treating chamber.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an exemplary automated dishwasher <b>10</b> according to a first embodiment. The dishwasher <b>10</b> shares many features of a conventional automated dishwasher, which will not be described in detail herein except as necessary for a complete understanding of embodiments of the invention. A chassis <b>12</b> may define an interior of the dishwasher <b>10</b> and may include a frame, with or without panels mounted to the frame. For built-in dishwashers, outer panels are typically not needed. For dishwashers that are not built into existing cabinetry, the chassis <b>12</b> may include the panels mounted to the frame to form a cabinet for the dishwasher <b>10</b>. An open-faced tub <b>14</b> may be provided within the chassis <b>12</b> and may at least partially define a treating chamber <b>16</b> for washing or otherwise treating dishes. The open face of the tub <b>14</b> defines an access opening for the treating chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">A closure element, such as a door assembly <b>18</b>, may be movably mounted to the dishwasher <b>10</b> for movement between opened and closed positions to respectively selectively open and close the treating chamber access opening defined by the open face of the tub <b>14</b>. Thus, the door assembly <b>18</b> provides accessibility to the treating chamber <b>16</b> for the loading and unloading of dishes or other washable items. It should be appreciated that the door assembly <b>18</b> may be secured to the lower front edge of the chassis <b>12</b> or to the lower front edge of the tub <b>14</b> via a hinge assembly (not shown) configured to pivot the door assembly <b>18</b>. When the door assembly <b>18</b> is closed, user access to the treating chamber <b>16</b> may be prevented, whereas user access to the treating chamber <b>16</b> may be permitted when the door assembly <b>18</b> is open. Alternatively, the closure element may be slidable relative to the chassis <b>12</b>, such as in a drawer-type dishwasher, wherein the access opening for the treating chamber <b>16</b> is formed by an open face of an open-top tub. Other configurations of the closure element relative to the chassis <b>12</b> and the tub <b>14</b> are also within the scope of embodiments of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Dish holders, illustrated in the form of upper and lower dish racks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may be located within the treating chamber <b>16</b> and receive dishes for treatment, such as washing. The upper and lower racks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are typically mounted for slidable movement in and out of the treating chamber <b>16</b> for ease of loading and unloading. In a drawer-type dishwasher, the dish holders are typically held stationary within the open-top tub and slidably move with the open-tub relative to the chassis <b>12</b>. Other dish holders may be provided, such as a silverware basket, separate from or combined with the upper and lower racks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. As used in this description, the term âdish(es)â is intended to be generic to any item, single or plural, that may be treated in the dishwasher <b>10</b>, including, without limitation, dishes, plates, pots, bowls, pans, glassware, and silverware.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">A spray system may be provided for spraying liquid in the treating chamber <b>16</b> and may include one or more spray assemblies, such as, for example, an upper spray assembly <b>24</b>, a middle spray assembly <b>26</b>, a lower spray assembly <b>28</b>, and a rear spray assembly <b>30</b>. The upper spray assembly <b>24</b>, the middle spray assembly <b>26</b>, and the lower spray assembly <b>28</b> may be located, respectively, above the upper rack <b>20</b>, between the upper and lower racks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and beneath the lower rack <b>22</b> and are illustrated as rotating spray arms by example but are not limited to such positions and sprayer type. The rear spray assembly <b>30</b> is illustrated as being located adjacent the lower rack <b>22</b> toward the rear of the treating chamber <b>16</b> and, by example, as including a vertically oriented distribution header or spray manifold <b>32</b>. An exemplary spray manifold is set forth in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,594,513, issued Sep. 29, 2009, and titled âMultiple Wash Zone Dishwasher,â which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The spray system may further include a rack spray assembly <b>34</b> coupled to the upper dish rack <b>20</b>; the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">A recirculation system may be provided for recirculating liquid from the treating chamber <b>16</b> to the spray system. The recirculation system may include a sump <b>35</b> and a pump assembly <b>36</b>. The sump <b>35</b> collects the liquid sprayed in the treating chamber <b>16</b> and may be formed by a sloped or recess portion of a bottom wall of the tub <b>14</b>. The pump assembly <b>36</b> may include both a drain pump <b>38</b> and a recirculation pump <b>40</b>. The drain pump <b>38</b> may draw liquid from the sump <b>35</b> and pump the liquid out of the dishwasher <b>10</b> to a household drain line (not shown). The recirculation pump <b>40</b> may draw liquid from the sump <b>35</b>, and the liquid may be simultaneously or selectively pumped through a supply tube <b>42</b> to each of the spray assemblies <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> for selective spraying. While not shown, a liquid supply system may include a water supply conduit coupled with a household water supply for supplying water to the treating chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">A heating system including a heater <b>44</b> may be located, for example, within the sump <b>35</b> for heating the liquid contained in the sump <b>35</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">A control system including a controller <b>46</b> may also be included in the dishwasher <b>10</b>, which may be operably coupled with various components of the dishwasher <b>10</b> to implement a treating cycle of operation. The controller <b>46</b> may be located within the door assembly <b>18</b> as illustrated, or it may alternatively be located somewhere within the chassis <b>12</b>. The controller <b>46</b> may also be operably coupled with a control panel or user interface <b>48</b> for receiving user-selected inputs and communicating information to the user. The user interface <b>48</b> may include operational controls such as dials, lights, switches, and displays enabling a user to input commands, such as a cycle of operation, to the controller <b>46</b> and receive information.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As illustrated schematically in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>46</b> may be coupled with the heater <b>44</b> for heating the wash liquid during a cycle of operation, the drain pump <b>38</b> for draining liquid from the treating chamber <b>16</b>, and the recirculation pump <b>40</b> for recirculating the wash liquid during the cycle of operation. The controller <b>46</b> may be provided with a memory <b>50</b> and a central processing unit (CPU) <b>52</b>. The memory <b>50</b> may be used for storing control software that may be executed by the CPU <b>52</b> in completing a cycle of operation using the dishwasher <b>10</b> and any additional software. For example, the memory <b>50</b> may store one or more pre-programmed cycles of operation that may be selected by a user and completed by the dishwasher <b>10</b>. The controller <b>46</b> may also receive input from one or more sensors <b>54</b>. Non-limiting examples of sensors that may be communicably coupled with the controller <b>46</b> include a temperature sensor and turbidity sensor to determine the soil load associated with a selected grouping of dishes, such as the dishes associated with a particular area of the treating chamber <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The dishwasher <b>10</b> may include all of the above exemplary systems, a selection of the above exemplary systems, and/or other systems not listed above as desired. Further, some of the systems may be combined with other systems and/or may share components with other systems. Examples of other systems that the dishwasher may further include are a dispensing system that supplies one or more treating agents or chemistries to the treating chamber <b>16</b> and an air supply system that may provide air, which may be heated or not heated, to the treating chamber <b>16</b>, such as for drying and/or cooling the dishes. An exemplary air supply system is set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/959,673, filed Dec. 3, 2010 and published as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0138106 on Jun. 7, 2012, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the exemplary upper rack <b>20</b> may be formed by a wire frame rack having a peripheral wall <b>60</b> formed by a pair of opposed side walls <b>62</b> joined by a front wall <b>64</b> and a rear wall <b>66</b> and a bottom wall <b>70</b> joining the lower ends of the peripheral wall <b>60</b>. The peripheral wall <b>60</b> and the bottom wall <b>70</b> may be constructed by a plurality of wire elements. Peripheral wire elements <b>72</b> may extend generally horizontally around at least a portion of the periphery of the wire frame rack, and side-to-side (extending generally in the direction defined between the side walls <b>62</b>) and front-to-rear (extending generally in the direction between the front and rear walls <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>) intersecting wire elements <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may intersect one another to form the bottom wall <b>70</b>. Additionally, the intersecting wire elements <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may turn upward at their ends in a generally vertical direction to, together with the peripheral wire elements <b>72</b>, form the peripheral wall <b>60</b>. Optionally, tines <b>78</b> may be integrated with or mounted to the wire frame rack. While illustrated as a wire frame, any of the racks <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may have a non-wire frame construction. The rack may be of any structure that can support the dishes while permitting for the sprayed liquid to flow back to the sump <b>35</b> for recirculation or draining.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The rack spray assembly <b>34</b> may be provided on the upper rack <b>20</b> in any suitable position. In the present embodiment, the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> includes a supply conduit <b>80</b> carried by the upper rack <b>20</b>, such as by clips, brackets, and/or other suitable hardware secured to the bottom wall <b>70</b>, such that the supply conduit <b>80</b> extends below the upper rack <b>20</b> in a direction generally parallel to the side walls <b>62</b> from near the rear wall <b>66</b> towards front wall <b>64</b>. The supply conduit <b>80</b> may have any suitable length and may, for example, have a length corresponding to the depth of the upper rack <b>20</b>. Further, the supply conduit <b>80</b> may have any appropriate configuration and is not limited to the generally linear tubular structure illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. A liquid connector <b>82</b> at a rear end of the supply conduit <b>80</b> may dock with a corresponding receiver on the supply tube <b>42</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>) or other structure of the liquid supply and/or recirculation systems when the upper rack <b>20</b> is slid to its most rearward position in the tub <b>14</b> to establish fluid communication with the rack spray assembly <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">One or more sprayers <b>84</b> may be associated with the supply conduit <b>80</b> of the rack spray assembly <b>34</b>, and the illustrated embodiment includes two of the sprayers <b>84</b> by example, wherein one sprayer is positioned near each end of the supply conduit <b>80</b>. The sprayer <b>84</b> may include a base <b>86</b> and an extension <b>88</b> mounted to the base <b>86</b>. In <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>, which is an enlarged perspective view of the rear left corner of the dish rack <b>20</b>, the extension <b>88</b> is shown in a lowered position adjacent to the rack bottom wall <b>70</b> and pointing away from the interior of the upper rack <b>20</b>. When the extension <b>88</b> is in the lowered position, the extension <b>88</b> may be generally horizontal and below the bottom wall <b>70</b> of the rack <b>20</b> or in some other suitable position not pointing into the upper rack <b>20</b>. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>, the extension <b>88</b> may be movable relative to the base <b>86</b>, such as by rotating relative to the base <b>86</b>, between the lowered position and a raised position, wherein the extension <b>88</b> projects upward into the upper rack <b>20</b>. The extension <b>88</b> may be generally vertical when in the raised position or inclined at an acute angle relative to horizontal or relative to the rack bottom wall <b>70</b> as long as the extension projects into the upper rack <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Referring now to FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B, which are enlarged and sectional views, respectively, of the sprayer <b>84</b> with the extension <b>88</b> in the lowered position (<figref>FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref>) and the raised position (<figref>FIG. 6B</figref>), the base <b>86</b> of the sprayer <b>84</b> may have a generally cylindrical configuration with a sidewall <b>90</b> and a pair of opposing end walls <b>92</b> defining a hollow interior <b>94</b> that liquidly communicates with the supply conduit <b>80</b>. One or more liquid openings may be formed in the sidewall <b>90</b>, and the illustrated embodiment includes first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> formed in the sidewall <b>90</b> and fluidly communicating the hollow interior <b>94</b> with areas external to the base <b>86</b>. The base <b>86</b> may be integrally formed with the supply conduit <b>80</b> or formed separately from and mounted to the supply conduit <b>80</b> in a liquid tight manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">The extension <b>88</b> may include a body <b>102</b> from which extends a pair of spaced arms <b>104</b> in one direction and an elongated tubular portion <b>106</b> in an opposite direction. The arms <b>104</b>, one of which is viewable in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, may straddle the base <b>86</b> along the end walls <b>92</b> of the base <b>86</b> for coupling with the supply conduit <b>80</b>. The arms <b>104</b> may each have a generally triangular configuration and may encircle the supply conduit <b>80</b> at the apex to facilitate rotation of the extension <b>88</b> about the supply conduit <b>80</b> relative to the base <b>86</b>. The body <b>102</b> may conform to the shape of the base <b>86</b> and transition the extension <b>88</b> from the arms <b>104</b> to the tubular portion <b>106</b>, which may have a handle configuration to facilitate manual movement of the extension <b>88</b> by a user. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, internally, the body <b>102</b> of the extension <b>88</b> forms a blocking portion <b>108</b> on one side and a liquid channel <b>110</b> on another side. While the blocking portion <b>108</b> may have any suitable configuration, the blocking portion <b>108</b> of the illustrated embodiment may be sized to at least cover the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> on the base <b>86</b>. The liquid channel <b>110</b> may extend from an inlet <b>112</b> at the body <b>102</b> and along the length of the tubular portion <b>106</b> to outlets in the form of fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> located at the end of the tubular portion <b>106</b>. The inlet <b>112</b> may have any suitable configuration and may be sized in accordance with the third liquid opening <b>100</b> in the base <b>86</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A sealing system may be positioned between the base <b>86</b> and the extension <b>88</b> to prevent undesired liquid leakage. For example, o-rings, gaskets, and/or other sealing elements <b>117</b> may be arranged on the extension <b>88</b> to surround the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> depending on the position of the extension <b>88</b>, as seen in <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. Optionally, the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> may be recessed within the sidewall <b>90</b> of the base <b>86</b> so that the sealing elements <b>117</b> are not damaged by features of the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> as the sealing elements <b>117</b> travel across the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> when the extension <b>88</b> moves relative to the base <b>86</b>. Exemplary configurations of the recessed first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> are illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 7A</figref>, <b>7</b>B, and <b>7</b>C. The sidewall <b>90</b> forms the sealing surface upon which the sealing elements <b>117</b> rest.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Referring back to <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> on the base <b>86</b> and the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> on the extension <b>88</b> may be defined by spray nozzles that are configured to dispense the liquid into a spray having a desired pattern, capacity, impact, angle, and drop size. The spray nozzles defining the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> may be the same or different than the spray nozzles defining the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, depending on whether the desired sprays from the liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are the same or different, as will be more apparent in the description below of the operation of the sprayer <b>84</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">An exemplary operation of the sprayers <b>84</b> of the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> will now be described with the extensions <b>88</b> assumed to be initially in the lowered position of <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>A. A user may slide the upper rack <b>20</b> forward from the tub <b>14</b> and, if desired, manually raise the extension <b>88</b> for a desired sprayer <b>84</b> upon which the user wishes to place a bottle, jar, or other relatively tall dish. The user may grasp the extension <b>88</b> at the elongated tubular portion <b>106</b> and rotate the extension <b>88</b> about the longitudinal axis of the base <b>86</b> to the raised position projecting into the dish rack <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 4B and 6B</figref>. With the extension <b>88</b> raised, the user may then place the dish on the extension <b>88</b> within the dish rack <b>20</b>. This process can be repeated for as many of the sprayers <b>84</b> as desired. If the user does not wish to use one of the sprayers <b>84</b> for a relatively tall dish, the sprayer <b>84</b> may remain in the lowered position. If a sprayer <b>84</b> happens to be in the raised position but is not intended for use with a relatively tall dish, the user may grasp the extension <b>88</b> and rotate it about the longitudinal axis of the base <b>86</b> to the lowered position so that it does not interfere with loading of the dishes. With all dishes loaded into the upper rack <b>20</b>, the user may then slide the upper rack <b>20</b> rearward into the tub <b>14</b> for fluidly coupling the liquid connector <b>82</b> with the corresponding receiver on the supply tube <b>42</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The conversion of the sprayer <b>84</b> resulting from movement of the extension <b>88</b> will now be described in further detail with reference to <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, before the user raises the extension <b>88</b>, the elongated tubular portion <b>106</b> of the extension <b>88</b> is in a generally horizontal orientation with the body blocking portion <b>108</b> covering the third liquid opening <b>100</b>. The first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are not covered or otherwise blocked by the extension <b>88</b>. When the extension <b>88</b> moves to the raised position of <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, the blocking portion <b>108</b> covers the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, and the inlet <b>112</b> aligns with the third liquid opening <b>100</b> to establish fluid communication between the third liquid opening <b>100</b> and the liquid channel <b>110</b> and, thereby, the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">With the dish rack <b>20</b> slid to the most rearward position in the tub <b>14</b>, the user may initiate a treating cycle of operation during which liquid may be supplied to the rack spray assembly <b>34</b>. The liquid may flow through the supply conduit <b>80</b> to each of the sprayers <b>84</b>. For the sprayers <b>84</b> with the extension <b>88</b> in the lowered position of <figref>FIG. 6A</figref>, the liquid will flow through the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> and spray into the treating chamber <b>16</b>, particularly upwardly into the dish rack <b>20</b> for treating the dishes held therein. Liquid flow from the third liquid opening <b>100</b> will be blocked by the extension <b>88</b>. However, for the sprayers <b>84</b> with the extension <b>88</b> in the raised position of <figref>FIG. 6B</figref>, liquid will flow through the third liquid opening <b>100</b>, into the liquid channel <b>110</b> from the inlet <b>112</b>, and into the treating chamber <b>16</b> through the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Liquid flow from the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> will be blocked by the extension <b>88</b>. Because the extension <b>88</b> in the raised position effectively extends or increases the height of the sprayer <b>84</b>, the liquid exits the sprayer <b>84</b> at a position vertically higher than when in the lowered position. The higher spraying of the liquid allows the liquid to more effectively reach the interior of a relatively tall dish that may otherwise be difficult to clean. When the higher dispensing of the liquid is not needed, the sprayer <b>84</b> remains active to assist in cleaning other dishes held within the dish rack <b>20</b> by spraying liquid from a position closer to the bottom of the dish rack <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The number, size, and configuration of the liquid openings of the sprayer <b>84</b> may be modified as needed in both the base <b>86</b> and the extension <b>88</b>. For example, in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> may each have a diameter of about 2 mm (0.08 inches), while the third liquid opening <b>100</b> may have a diameter of about 4 mm (0.16 inches). The opening(s) in the base <b>86</b> that are employed to provide liquid to the extension <b>88</b> may be relatively large compared to the other opening(s) because the liquid flow must be sufficient to reach the end of the extension <b>88</b> and spray into the dishes placed on the extension <b>88</b>. The number, size, and configuration of the openings may be adjusted to provide a desired liquid supply when the extension <b>88</b> is in both the raised and lowered positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In an alternative embodiment shown in <figref>FIGS. 8A-8C</figref>, the extension <b>88</b> may be configured so that one of the base liquid openings is employed when the extension <b>88</b> is in both the raised and lowered positions to increase liquid flow to the extension <b>88</b> in the raised position. As seen in <figref>FIG. 8A</figref>, liquid may flow through the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> in the same manner as described for the previous embodiment when the extension <b>88</b> is in the lowered position. However, the extension <b>88</b> is configured so that the blocking portion <b>108</b> only covers the first liquid opening <b>96</b> and not the second liquid opening <b>98</b> when the extension <b>88</b> is in the raised position of <figref>FIG. 8B</figref>. The inlet <b>112</b> is larger and aligns with both the second and third liquid openings <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> to fluidly communicate both with the liquid channel <b>110</b>. Thus, the liquid flows through both the second and third liquid openings <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> into the liquid channel <b>110</b> for spraying into the treating chamber <b>16</b> through the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The extension <b>88</b> of the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 8A-8C</figref> further includes a closure element <b>118</b> that wraps around the base <b>86</b> on a side opposite the blocking portion <b>108</b>. The closure element <b>118</b> is sized to cover and block liquid flow from all of the openings on the base <b>86</b>, that is, the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, thus effectively closing the sprayer <b>84</b> so no liquid flows from the sprayer <b>84</b> into in the treating chamber <b>16</b>. To close the sprayer <b>84</b>, the user may continue rotation of the extension <b>88</b> about the base <b>86</b> beyond the second position to a third position, shown in <figref>FIG. 8C</figref>, with the closure element <b>118</b> covering the first, second, and third liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>100</b>. Other embodiments of the sprayer <b>84</b>, including those to be disclosed below, may be adapted to include the closure element <b>118</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In another alternative configuration shown in <figref>FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the liquid may flow through the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> when the extension <b>88</b> is in the lowered position of <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, as in the previous embodiments, but the extension <b>88</b> is configured to spray at two different heights when in the raised position. In particular, as shown in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>, the blocking portion <b>108</b> is sized to cover the first liquid opening <b>96</b> when in the raised position, but a second inlet <b>120</b> that provides access to a second liquid channel <b>122</b> terminating in a sixth liquid outlet <b>124</b> is formed in the extension <b>88</b> for alignment with the second liquid opening <b>98</b>. The liquid, therefore, may enter the treating chamber <b>16</b> from the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> via the third liquid opening <b>100</b> and from the sixth liquid opening <b>124</b> at a height lower than the fourth and fifth liquid openings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> via the second liquid opening <b>98</b>. The height of the sixth liquid opening <b>124</b> may be at any height lower than the end of the extension <b>88</b>, including a height directly adjacent the base <b>86</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In yet another alternative configuration shown in <figref>FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the sprayer <b>84</b> includes additional liquid outlets that allow the sprayer <b>206</b> to spray both into the dish placed on the sprayer <b>84</b> and to areas surrounding the dish. To this end, the base <b>86</b> may include additional liquid openings, such as seventh and eighth liquid openings <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>. When the extension is in the lowered position of <figref>FIG. 10A</figref>, the blocking portion <b>108</b> covers and prevents liquid flow from the eighth liquid outlet <b>128</b> while liquid may enter the treating chamber <b>16</b> through the first, second, and seventh liquid outlets <b>96</b>, <b>98</b>, <b>126</b>. Referring now to <figref>FIG. 10B</figref>, movement of the extension <b>88</b> to the raised position uncovers the eighth liquid outlet <b>128</b> while the seventh liquid outlet <b>126</b> remains exposed for liquid flow from both of the openings <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> to areas surrounding a dish that may be placed on the extension <b>88</b> in addition to liquid flow at the end of the extension <b>88</b> via the third liquid opening <b>100</b> into the dish while the first and second liquid openings <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> are covered and blocked by the blocking portion <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Various other modifications may be made to the rack spray assembly <b>34</b>. Any number of the sprayers <b>84</b> may be positioned in any suitable location in the dish rack <b>20</b>, including in the corners of the dish rack. The sprayers <b>84</b> may be modified to integrate the base <b>86</b> with the supply conduit <b>80</b> such that the supply conduit <b>80</b> functions as the base <b>86</b> with the various liquid openings formed directly in the supply conduit <b>80</b>. The extension <b>88</b> may move in any suitable manner relative to the base <b>86</b> and is not limited to rotational movement. The movement of the extension <b>88</b> may be manual, as described above, or automatic, whereby the user may select a button or other switch, such as on a user interface, that communicates with the controller <b>46</b> and a motorized device to automatically move the extension <b>88</b> between the raised and lowered positions. Alternatively, a button or similar switch may be located on the sprayer <b>84</b> itself and may be operatively coupled to a motor or a non-motorized actuator or release mechanism for moving the extension <b>88</b>. Further, when the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> includes more than one of the sprayers <b>84</b>, the movement of the extensions <b>88</b> for the sprayers <b>84</b> may be independent or linked such that the movement of one of the extensions <b>88</b> causes simultaneous or subsequent movement of one or more of the other extensions <b>88</b> of other sprayers <b>84</b>. The operation of the sprayers <b>84</b> may be adapted so that the sprayers <b>84</b> dispense the treating liquid sequentially rather than all at the same time, thus producing a pulsing effect. Even more, the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> may be modified as desired to include other types of sprayers, such as a rotating spray arm, zone sprayers, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">An alternative embodiment of a dish rack <b>200</b> with a rack spray assembly <b>202</b> is illustrated in the perspective view of <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. In this embodiment, the rack spray assembly <b>202</b> includes a rotatable spray arm <b>204</b> such that the assembly essentially combines the schematic middle spray assembly <b>26</b> and rack spray assembly <b>34</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The rack spray assembly <b>202</b> of <figref>FIG. 11</figref> may be employed with any type of dish rack and is shown by example with the dish rack <b>200</b> having the same general elements of the dish rack <b>20</b>, that is, the peripheral wall <b>60</b> formed by the side walls <b>62</b>, front wall <b>64</b>, and rear wall <b>66</b> and the bottom wall <b>70</b>. The wire frame for the dish rack <b>200</b> may be formed by the similar peripheral wire elements <b>72</b>, side-to-side wire elements <b>74</b>, and front-to-back wire elements <b>76</b> and may include tines <b>78</b>. The rack spray assembly <b>202</b> may be carried by the dish rack <b>200</b>, such as by being mounted to the dish rack <b>200</b> under the bottom wall <b>70</b> of the dish rack <b>200</b> by any suitable brackets or other hardware and may include one or more sprayers <b>206</b> movable relative to the dish rack <b>200</b>, as will be described in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">As better seen in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, which is a perspective view of the rack spray assembly <b>202</b>, the rack spray assembly <b>202</b> includes a fluid connector <b>210</b> that selectively docks with a corresponding receiver on the supply tube <b>42</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>) or other structure of the liquid supply and/or recirculation systems when the dish rack <b>200</b> is slid to its most rearward position in the tub <b>14</b> to establish fluid communication with the rack spray assembly <b>202</b>. The fluid connector <b>210</b> may also be configured to supply liquid to a central conduit <b>212</b> coupled to the rotatable spray arm <b>204</b> positioned approximately at the center of the dish rack <b>200</b> (<figref>FIG. 12</figref>) and to a supply conduit <b>214</b> that provides liquid to the sprayers <b>206</b>. The supply conduit <b>214</b> may be disposed above the spray arm <b>204</b> to avoid interfering with the rotation of the spray arm <b>204</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The supply conduit <b>214</b> may be formed by a pair of generally parallel, spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> extending approximately from the rear wall <b>66</b> to the front wall <b>64</b> of the dish rack <b>200</b> and joined to each other at their front ends by a front connecting conduit <b>220</b>, which may be adjacent the front wall <b>64</b> of the dish rack <b>200</b> (<figref>FIG. 11</figref>). Together, the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and the front connecting conduit <b>220</b> form a U-shape for the supply conduit <b>214</b>, with the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> as the legs and the front connecting conduit <b>220</b> as the bight portion of the U-shape. A pair of rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> couple the rear ends of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> to the fluid connector <b>210</b> for establishing fluid communication between the fluid connector <b>210</b> and the supply conduit <b>214</b>. The spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, the front connecting conduit <b>220</b>, and the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> may be integrally formed or may comprise individual sections joined together to form the supply conduit <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The front connecting conduit <b>220</b> may include a plurality of liquid outlets or openings <b>226</b> spaced along the length thereof for providing liquid in a generally upward direction into the dish rack <b>200</b>. A spray nozzle may form each of the liquid openings <b>226</b> so as to provide a spray of liquid into the dish rack <b>200</b>. The liquid openings <b>226</b> may have any suitable size, shape, number, and arrangement on the front connecting conduit <b>220</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the front connecting conduit <b>220</b> may include liquid openings (not shown) that direct liquid downward to aid in treating dishes held by a dish rack below the dish rack <b>200</b>. The openings <b>226</b> may also be located along any other portion, not just the connecting conduit <b>220</b>, of the supply conduit <b>214</b>, and oriented to spray in any desired direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Similarly, the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> may include one or more liquid outlets or openings <b>228</b> for providing liquid in a generally upward direction into the dish rack <b>200</b>. A spray nozzle may form each of the liquid openings <b>228</b> so as to provide a spray of liquid into the dish rack <b>200</b>. The liquid openings <b>228</b> may have any suitable size, shape, number, and arrangement on the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> may include liquid openings (not shown) that direct liquid downward to aid in treating dishes held by a dish rack below the dish rack <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The sprayers <b>206</b> may be arranged along the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> in any suitable configuration, and the illustrated embodiment shows four of the sprayers <b>206</b> on each of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> positioned equidistant from one another by example. As shown in the inset sectional view in <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> form a liquid opening <b>230</b> in an upper surface thereof at each sprayer position such that the sprayer <b>206</b> is mounted to the conduit <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> over the liquid opening <b>230</b>. A guide pin <b>232</b> projects radially downward from the conduit <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> directly below each of the liquid openings <b>230</b> on a lower surface of the conduit <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The guide pin <b>232</b> aids in guiding movement of the sprayer <b>206</b> and fixing the sprayer <b>206</b> in a desired position, as will be described in further detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>, the sprayer <b>206</b> includes a body <b>240</b> and an extension <b>242</b> projecting from the body <b>240</b>. The body <b>240</b> may be generally tubular with open ends for receipt of the supply conduit <b>214</b>. A guide slot <b>244</b> formed on an inner surface of the body <b>240</b> may include a plurality of detents corresponding to a number of desired positions for the sprayer <b>206</b>, which is four in the present illustrative embodiment. Three detents <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> correspond to three raised positions and may be spaced from a fourth detent <b>252</b> corresponding to a lowered position. Opposite the fourth detent <b>252</b> may be a liquid outlet or opening <b>254</b> that extends through the body, and opposite the other detents <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> may be, as best seen in <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>, a recess <b>256</b> formed on the inner surface of the body <b>240</b> and within which may be located an inlet <b>258</b> to the extension <b>242</b>. Moving on to <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, the inlet <b>258</b> leads to a liquid channel <b>260</b> within the elongated tubular extension <b>242</b>. The extension <b>242</b>, which projects linearly from the body <b>240</b> with its longitudinal axis laterally offset from the parallel radius of the body <b>240</b>, terminates at a tip <b>262</b> with one or more liquid outlets or openings <b>264</b> formed therein and fluidly connected to the liquid channel <b>260</b>. The present embodiment includes four of the liquid openings <b>264</b>; however, the extension <b>242</b> may include any suitable number, size, and arrangement of liquid openings, which need not be positioned on the tip <b>262</b> but may alternatively be located adjacent the tip <b>262</b> or along the length of the extension <b>242</b> near the tip <b>262</b>. Spray nozzles may form may the liquid openings <b>254</b>, <b>264</b> for dispensing of the liquid in a spray.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">As mentioned above, the sprayer <b>206</b> is rotatable between a plurality of raised positions and a lowered position, which are illustrated in the sectional views of the sprayer <b>206</b> and the supply conduit <b>214</b> in <figref>FIGS. 14A-14D</figref>. The three exemplary raised positions shown in <figref>FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>, hereinafter referred to as the first, second, and third raised positions for convenience, situate the extension <b>242</b> at an acute angle with respect to a horizontal reference, which may be the bottom wall <b>70</b> of the dish rack <b>200</b> (<figref>FIG. 15</figref>), wherein the acute angle decreases moving from the first raised position to the second raised position to the third raised position. In the highest position of the extension <b>242</b>, i.e., the first raised position, shown in <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, the extension <b>242</b> is slightly inclined from a vertical position; however, it is well within the scope of embodiments of the invention for the extension <b>242</b> to be positioned generally vertical in the raised position. In the first, second, and third raised positions of <figref>FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>, the guide pin <b>232</b> resides in one of the respective detents <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> based on the rotational position of the sprayer body <b>240</b>, and the guide pin <b>232</b> secures the sprayer <b>206</b> in each position until sufficient force is applied to move the guide pin <b>232</b> out the detent <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b> within which it is seated and along the guide slot <b>244</b>. Further, in all of the raised positions, the recess <b>256</b> of the sprayer body <b>240</b> is aligned with the liquid opening <b>230</b> on the supply conduit <b>214</b>, thus placing the liquid opening <b>230</b> in fluid communication with the inlet <b>258</b>, the liquid channel <b>260</b>, and the liquid openings <b>264</b> at the extension tip <b>262</b> to spray liquid supplied by the supply conduit <b>214</b> through the extension <b>242</b>. The liquid opening <b>254</b> on the body <b>240</b> does not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b>, thus resulting in no liquid flow through the liquid opening <b>254</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">When the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the lowered position of <figref>FIG. 14D</figref>, which may be generally horizontal, the body <b>240</b> is situated so that the guide pin <b>232</b> resides in the detent <b>252</b>, and the liquid opening <b>254</b> aligns with the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> to spray liquid supplied by the supply conduit <b>214</b> through the body <b>240</b>. The recess <b>256</b> on the body does not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b>, which results in no liquid flow into the extension <b>242</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the spatial relationship between the dish rack <b>200</b> and the sprayer <b>206</b> in the raised and lowered positions. When the sprayer <b>206</b> is in any of the raised positions, shown in phantom in <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, the extension <b>242</b> extends into the dish rack <b>200</b> for spraying items held in the dish rack <b>200</b>, such as items placed directly onto the extension <b>242</b>. In contrast, when the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the lowered position, the extension <b>242</b> is below the bottom wall <b>70</b> of the dish rack <b>200</b> and generally parallel to the bottom wall <b>70</b> so as to avoid interfering with dishes held in the dish rack <b>200</b>, while the body <b>240</b> is positioned so that the liquid outlet <b>254</b> generally faces upward for dispensing liquid into the dish rack <b>200</b>. The sprayer <b>206</b> emits liquid into the dish rack <b>200</b> from a higher location when in the raised positions compared to the lowered position.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The illustrated positions of the sprayer <b>206</b> are provided for exemplary purposes, and it is contemplated that that sprayer <b>206</b> can have any suitable angle relative to the horizontal when in any raised or lowered positions. Further, the sprayer <b>206</b> may have only one raised position or any number of raised positions. The sprayer <b>206</b> may also have multiple lowered positions; for example, the user may desire to orient the liquid opening <b>254</b> to spray into the dish rack <b>200</b> at varying angles in addition to or as an alternative to spraying vertically upward, which may be achieved by positioning the sprayer <b>206</b> in differing lowered positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The operation of the rack spray assembly <b>202</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 11-15</figref> is essentially the same as that for the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> in the previous embodiments and will not be repeated here for brevity. Further, the modifications described above for the rack spray assembly <b>34</b> apply to the rack spray assembly <b>202</b>, including those related to the operation thereof.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> provide perspective and exploded views, respectively, of another embodiment of a rack spray assembly substantially similar to the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 11-15</figref> with modified front and rear connecting conduits <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and a modified sprayer <b>206</b>. The front connecting conduit <b>220</b> of the present embodiment may be formed by a manifold that connects to the front ends of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The manifold may include a pair of connected tubes <b>272</b>, <b>274</b> that may be joined together and then mounted to the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The manifold may have several of the liquid outlets or openings <b>226</b>, as in the previous embodiment. Similarly, the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the present embodiment may be formed by a manifold that connects to the rear ends of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. Each side of the manifold may be a tube with liquid outlets or openings <b>228</b>, as in the previous embodiment. The manifold design allows extension of the width of the connecting conduits <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> beyond the width of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, if desired and as illustrated. Optionally, the manifolds may extend to the side walls of the rack so as to provide additional spraying along the entire width of the dish rack.</p>

Referring to <figref>FIG. 18A</figref>, which shows the sprayer <b>206</b> in the same raised position shown in <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, i.e., the first raised position, the sprayer <b>206</b> includes two liquid channels: (1) the liquid channel <b>260</b> that provides liquid to the liquid openings <b>264</b> at the tip <b>262</b> of the extension <b>242</b> and (2) an additional liquid channel <b>282</b> that fluidly couples the liquid opening <b>254</b> with the additional liquid opening <b>270</b>. When the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the first raised position, and also in the second and third raised positions, the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> aligns with the recess <b>256</b> to allow liquid to flow from the supply conduit <b>214</b>, through the liquid opening <b>230</b>, through the recess <b>256</b>, into the inlet <b>258</b>, through the liquid channel <b>260</b>, and out the liquid openings <b>264</b> to emit spray from the tip <b>262</b> of the extension <b>242</b>. The liquid openings <b>254</b>, <b>270</b> do not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 18B</figref>, when the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the lowered position, the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> aligns with the liquid opening <b>254</b> to allow liquid to flow from the supply conduit <b>214</b>, through the liquid opening <b>230</b>, and out the liquid opening <b>254</b> to emit spray upward from the body <b>240</b> of the sprayer <b>206</b>. In addition, liquid flows from the liquid opening <b>254</b> into the liquid channel <b>282</b> and out the liquid opening <b>270</b> to emit spray upward from the side of the extension <b>242</b>. The liquid openings <b>264</b> do not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The additional liquid channel <b>282</b> may have any suitable configuration. In one alternative design, the liquid channel <b>282</b> need not be fluidly connected to the liquid opening <b>254</b>, so as to not interfere with spray emission from the liquid opening <b>254</b>, but rather be fluidly connected to the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> in another manner, or perhaps to another liquid opening in the supply conduit <b>214</b>. In another alternative embodiment, the liquid opening <b>270</b> may be fluidly coupled with the liquid channel <b>260</b> such that liquid sprays from the liquid opening <b>270</b> at the same time that liquid sprays from the liquid openings <b>264</b>, i.e., in the raised position(s). As another option, the liquid opening <b>270</b> may be fluidly coupled to both the liquid channel <b>260</b> and the liquid channel <b>282</b> for providing spray from the liquid opening <b>270</b> in both the raised and lowered positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Another exemplary alternative embodiment sprayer <b>206</b> is illustrated in the perspective views of <figref>FIGS. 19A-19C</figref>. The sprayer <b>206</b> may be similar to the sprayers <b>206</b> in <figref>FIGS. 11-18B</figref> but may be configured for telescoping movement about its longitudinal axis in addition to rotational movement about the supply conduit <b>214</b>. As seen in <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, the sprayer <b>206</b> may include the body <b>240</b>, which is rotatable about the supply conduit <b>214</b>, the extension <b>242</b>, and a shaft <b>290</b> coupling the extension <b>242</b> to the body <b>240</b>. The shaft <b>290</b> may be fixedly mounted to the body <b>240</b>, and the extension <b>242</b> may be slidably mounted to the shaft <b>290</b> such that the extension <b>242</b> may slide relative to the body <b>240</b> and the shaft <b>290</b> between an extended position, shown in <figref>FIG. 19A</figref>, and a retracted position, shown in <figref>FIG. 19B</figref>, to effectively change the length of the sprayer <b>206</b> and, thus, the distance to which the sprayer <b>206</b> extends into the dish rack <b>20</b> when the sprayer <b>206</b> is raised.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">The sprayer <b>206</b> may extend and retract in any suitable manner. In one example, the user may manually move the sprayer <b>206</b> between the extended and retracted positions by grasping the extension <b>242</b> and sliding the extension <b>242</b> along the shaft <b>290</b> in the desired direction. The sprayer <b>206</b> may include a lock or other structure to secure the extension <b>242</b> in the extended position. In another example, the sprayer <b>206</b> may extend and retract in response to liquid flow, or lack thereof, in the sprayer <b>206</b>. When liquid flows into the sprayer <b>206</b>, the pressure of the liquid may force the extension <b>242</b> to slide from the retracted position to the extended position. The extension <b>242</b> may remain in the extended position while the liquid continues to flow through the sprayer <b>206</b> and may retract when the liquid flow decreases and/or ceases. Optionally, the sprayer <b>206</b> may be configured so that the degree to which the extension <b>242</b> extends depends on the liquid pressure, during both extension and retraction. In such an embodiment, the extension <b>242</b> may assume an intermediate, partially extended position between fully extended and fully retracted, as illustrated by example in <figref>FIG. 19C</figref>, when the liquid pressure is intermediate the pressures that result in the full extension and full retraction. The liquid pressure may be optionally tailored according to a height of a dish placed on the extension <b>242</b> whereby the liquid pressure is set so that the amount of extension corresponds to the height of the glass (i.e., less extension for a shorter glass, more extension for a taller glass). In yet another example, the extension <b>242</b> may be operably coupled to a motor or other type of actuator that may automatically move the extension <b>242</b> into the desired extended or retracted position and, optionally, also rotate the sprayer <b>206</b> to the desired raised or lowered position.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">The operation of the sprayer <b>206</b> may be substantially similar to the operation described previously for the sprayers <b>206</b> in earlier embodiments. The primary difference in operation is related to the extension and retraction of the extension <b>242</b>. When the sprayer <b>206</b> is in a raised position, the extension <b>242</b> may be in the fully or partially extended position, either by manual or automatic methods, for spraying the liquid onto dishes in the rack <b>20</b>. Upon movement to the lowered position, while it is acceptable for the sprayer <b>206</b> to remain extended, the sprayer <b>206</b> may assume the retracted position.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">The telescoping and rotating sprayer <b>206</b> of <figref>FIGS. 19A-19C</figref> may differ from the specific structure shown in the illustrations. For example, the sprayer <b>206</b> may or may not include the additional liquid opening <b>270</b>. Additionally, the sprayer <b>206</b> may be configured for telescoping movement in another manner and is not limited to the particular shaft <b>290</b> upon which the extension <b>242</b> slides.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">Yet another exemplary alternative embodiment of the rack spray assembly <b>202</b> is illustrated in the perspective view of <figref>FIG. 20</figref>. The rack spray assembly <b>202</b> is similar to the previous embodiments and includes a modified spray arm <b>204</b>, modified front and rear connecting conduits <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> and a modified sprayer <b>206</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The spray arm <b>204</b> of the present embodiment is in an s-shaped arm. The front connecting conduit <b>220</b> of the present embodiment may be formed by a manifold that connects to the front ends of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The manifold may include a single tube <b>272</b> that may be mounted to the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. The front connecting conduit has been illustrated as extending beyond the width of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> although this need not be the case. The manifold may have several liquid outlets or openings <b>226</b>, as in the previous embodiment. The openings <b>226</b> may spray upwards and/or downwards. In the illustrated example, there are a plurality of openings <b>226</b> along the top of the manifold and a single opening on the bottom of the manifold. It will be understood however that any number of openings, which may spray in any direction, may be included in the front connecting conduit <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Similarly, the rear connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the present embodiment may be formed by a manifold that connects to the rear ends of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. While no openings or liquid outlets have been illustrated, it is contemplated that each side of the manifold may be a tube with liquid outlets, as in the previous embodiment. In the present embodiment the connecting conduits <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> do not extend beyond the width of the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, although they may if desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The sprayer <b>206</b> of the present embodiment is similar to the sprayer <b>206</b> in the embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 16-18B</figref> but is limited to the sprayer <b>206</b> being configured to spray liquid from the additional liquid opening <b>270</b> in the raised position. As an example, <figref>FIGS. 21A and 21B</figref> illustrate sectional views of the modified sprayer <b>206</b> with the additional liquid opening <b>270</b> wherein the sprayer <b>206</b> is configured to supply liquid through the additional liquid opening <b>270</b> only in the raised position. Referring to <figref>FIG. 21A</figref>, which shows the sprayer <b>206</b> in the same raised position shown in <figref>FIG. 14A</figref>, i.e., the first raised position, the sprayer <b>206</b> includes a single liquid channel <b>260</b> that provides liquid to both the liquid opening(s) <b>264</b> at the tip <b>262</b> of the extension <b>242</b> and the additional liquid opening <b>270</b>. When the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the first raised position, and also in the second and third raised positions, the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> aligns with the recess <b>256</b> to allow liquid to flow from the supply conduit <b>214</b>, through the liquid opening <b>230</b>, through the recess <b>256</b>, into the inlet <b>258</b>, through the liquid channel <b>260</b>, and out the additional liquid opening <b>270</b> and out the liquid opening(s) <b>264</b> to emit spray from the tip <b>262</b> of the extension <b>242</b>. The liquid opening <b>254</b> does not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 21B</figref>, when the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the lowered position, the supply conduit liquid opening <b>230</b> aligns with the liquid opening <b>254</b> to allow liquid to flow from the supply conduit <b>214</b>, through the liquid opening <b>230</b>, and out the liquid opening <b>254</b> to emit spray upward from the body <b>240</b> of the sprayer <b>206</b>. The liquid opening(s) <b>264</b> and the additional liquid opening <b>260</b> do not fluidly communicate with the supply conduit <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">
        <figref>FIG. 22</figref> illustrates several of the sprayers <b>206</b> in the lowered position and several of the sprayers <b>206</b> in the raised position. As can be seen, when the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the lowered position spray is emitted only from the liquid openings <b>254</b> and when the sprayer <b>206</b> is in the raised position spray is not emitted from the liquid opening <b>254</b> but is emitted from both the additional liquid openings <b>270</b> and the liquid opening(s) <b>264</b>. Further, <figref>FIG. 22</figref> shows sprays emitted from both an upper and lower portion of the front connecting conduit <b>220</b> through the openings <b>226</b>. While sprays have not been shown as being emitted from the spray arm <b>204</b> for clarity purposes, it will be understood that sprays may also be emitted from the spray arm <b>204</b> at the same time as form the remainder of the rack spray assembly <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Alternatively, the rack spray assemblies <b>202</b> in <figref>FIGS. 11-22</figref> need not include the front connecting conduit <b>220</b> such that the spaced conduits <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> terminate at their front ends. Additionally, the sprayers <b>206</b> may be modified as desired, and any suitable sprayers <b>206</b> may be used with the supply conduit <b>214</b>. Optionally, the extension <b>242</b> may be removable from the body <b>240</b> for maintenance or replacement. Further, the supply conduit <b>214</b> and the sprayers <b>206</b> may be configured so that the sprayers <b>206</b> may rotate relative to the supply conduit <b>214</b> without being obstructed by the wires of the dish rack, or the dish rack may be modified to accommodate the movement of the sprayers <b>206</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">While the sprayers <b>84</b>, <b>206</b> may be configured to provide liquid to any size and shape of dishes, including glassware, exemplary ranges of dimensions for glassware that may be especially suitable for positioning on the sprayers <b>84</b>, <b>206</b> when in the raised position for treatment thereof are: height-165 mm (6.5 inches) to 241 mm (9.5 inches), body diameter-64 mm (2.5 inches) to 89 mm (3.5 inches), and neck diameter-138 mm (1.5 inches) to 64 mm (2.5 inches).</p>
