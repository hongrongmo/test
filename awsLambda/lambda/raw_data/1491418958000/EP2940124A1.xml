    <heading id="h-00001-en">Technical Field</heading>
    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a novel lactic acid bacterium belonging to <i>Lactobacillus paracasei,</i> a drug, food or drink, and feed which contain the lactic acid bacterium.</p>
    <heading id="h-00002-en">Background Art</heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">It has been reported that some lactic acid bacteria show prophylactic action and defensive action against various infectious diseases (Non-patent document 1). It has also been reported that these actions of lactic acid bacteria are based on activation of cell-mediated host immunity, promotion of IgA secretion from mucosae, such as those of intestinal tract and respiratory organs (Non-patent document 1), and so forth. For example, it has been reported that lactic acid bacteria belonging to <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> induce production of cytokines such as IL-12 (interleukin-12) and IFN-Î³ (interferon-Î³) by immunocompetent cells of hosts to activate cell-mediated host immunity and thereby defend the hosts from infection by influenza virus, and so forth (Non-patent documents 2 to 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">IL-12 and IFN-Î³ are cytokines having an action of inducing differentiation of naive helper T cells into type 1 helper T cells (Th1), an action of activating natural killer cells (NK cells), and an action of promoting phagocytosis of cells such as macrophages, and are involved in defensive actions against infections by viruses or bacteria, and antitumor effect of hosts. Therefore, in order to acquire high prophylactic action and defensive action of lactic acid bacteria against infectious diseases, it is important to use a lactic acid bacterium having a potent IL-12 production-inducing ability. As such lactic acid bacteria, there is known the <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> FERM BP-11313 strain, which shows high survivability under acidic conditions, and superior IL-12 production-inducing ability (Patent document 1, in this reference, this strain is also referred to as MCC1375 strain).</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There has also been suggested involvement of cell walls of lactic acid bacteria in the induction of IL-12 production by lactic acid bacteria (Patent document 2), and it has been reported that if lactic acid bacteria are treated with a cell wall-digesting enzyme (N-acetyl muramidase), the IL-12 production-inducing ability is spoiled (Non-patent document 5). It has been also suggested that RNAs contained in lactic acid bacteria participate in the induction of IL-12 production by lactic acid bacteria, and it has been reported that if dead cells of lactic acid bacteria killed by heating are treated with RNase, the IL-12 production-inducing ability is markedly spoiled (Non-patent document 6). There have so far been also provided immunostimulants utilizing RNA of lactic acid bacteria itself (Patent documents 3 and 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Since human bodies contain cell wall-digesting enzymes such as lysozyme having the N-acetyl muramidase activity against bacteria, it is considered that lactic acid bacteria taken into the bodies are influenced by those enzymes. Further, RNases exist everywhere in the environment, and they are extremely stable against heat. Therefore, they easily contaminate products, and they are not inactivated by sterilization or the like, and may remain in the products. Moreover, since RNases also exist in human bodies, for example, in saliva and digestive juices, it is considered that lactic acid bacteria are also influenced by RNases after they are orally taken into the bodies.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Even if lactic acid bacteria inherently have high IL-12-inducing ability, they may not maintain and exhibit sufficient IL-12-inducing ability in living bodies, because they are influenced by the cell wall-digesting enzymes (N-acetyl muramidase) and RNases existing in saliva or digestive juices. It is considered that secretion amounts of these cell wall-digesting enzymes and RNases differ among individuals, and it is strongly considered that such difference possibly provides differences of the effect observed among individuals.</p>

    <heading id="h-00010-en">Embodiments for Carrying out the Invention</heading>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Hereafter, the present invention will be explained in detail.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The present invention relates to the <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> MCC1849 (NITE BP-01633) strain, which is a novel strain of a lactic acid bacterium belonging to <i>Lactobacillus paracasei.</i> This strain is henceforth also referred to as the "lactic acid bacterium of the present invention", or the "strain of the present invention", or simply as the MCC1849 strain.</p>
    <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The lactic acid bacterium of the present invention was isolated from human feces as an isolation source. The bacteriological characteristics of this strain will be shown in Example 1 described later. This strain was deposited on June 6, 2013 at the independent administrative agency, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, NITE Patent Microorganisms Depositary (#122, 2-5-8, Kazusakamatari, Kisarazu-shi, Chiba, 292-0818, Japan) with an accession number of NITE P-01633, and the deposit was converted to an international deposit under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on January 31, 2014, and given an accession number of NITE BP-01633.</p>
    <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The lactic acid bacterium of the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned deposited strain, and it may be a strain substantially equivalent to the deposited strain. Such a substantially equivalent strain is a strain belonging to <i>Lactobacillus paracasei,</i> exhibiting an IL-12 production-promoting action at a level comparable to that exhibited by the deposited strain, and preferably exhibiting reduction of the IL-12 production-promoting action at a low level comparable to that exhibited by the deposited strain even after a treatment with a cell wall-digesting enzyme or RNase. Moreover, the substantially equivalent strain further shows a homology of the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of 98% or more, preferably 99% or more, more preferably 100%, with respect to the nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the aforementioned deposited strain, and preferably has the same bacteriological characteristics as those of the aforementioned deposited strain. Furthermore, the lactic acid bacterium of the present invention may be a strain bred from the deposited strain or a strain substantially equivalent to the deposited strain by a mutation treatment, gene recombination, selection of a naturally mutated strain, or the like, so long as the effect of the present invention is not degraded.</p>
    <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The MCC1849 strain has a higher IL-12 (interleukin-12) production-promoting activity as compared with known lactic acid bacteria. Although the IL-12 production-promoting activity of lactic acid bacteria is generally markedly reduced by a treatment with a cell wall-digesting enzyme such as N-acetyl muramidase or RNase, the MCC1849 strain shows less reduction of the IL-12 production-promoting activity even after a treatment with a cell wall-digesting enzyme or RNase. The IL-12 production-promoting activity can be measured by the method described in the Example section.</p>
    <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The MCC1849 strain can be easily proliferated by, for example, culturing the strain. The culture method is not particularly limited so long as the MCC1849 strain can be proliferated, and a method usually used for culture of lactic acid bacteria can be appropriately modified as required, and used. For example, the culture temperature may be 25 to 50Â°C, and is preferably 35 to 42Â°C. Although the culture may be performed under aerobic conditions, or anaerobic conditions, the culture is preferably performed under anaerobic conditions, for example, with supplying an anaerobic gas such as carbon dioxide gas. The culture may also be performed under microaerobic conditions as liquid stationary culture, or the like.</p>
    <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The medium for culturing the MCC1849 strain is not particularly limited, and a medium usually used for culture of lactic acid bacteria can be appropriately modified as required, and used. That is, as a carbon source, for example, saccharides such as galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, sucrose, trehalose, starch, starch hydrolysate, and blackstrap molasses can be used according to the assimilation characteristics. As a nitrogen source, for example, ammonia, ammonium salts such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium nitrate, and nitrates can be used. Further, as inorganic salts, for example, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride, calcium nitrate, manganese chloride, ferrous sulfate, and so forth can be used. Furthermore, organic components such as peptone, soybean flour, defatted soybean meal, meat extract, and yeast extract may also be used. Further, as a ready-made medium, for example, the MRS medium can be preferably used.</p>
    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As the MCC1849 strain, culture obtained by culturing the strain may be used as it is, or may be used after dilution or concentration, or cells collected from the culture may also be used. Further, so long as the effect of the present invention is not degraded, various additional operations such as heating and lyophilization can be performed after the culture. Such additional operations are preferably those providing high live cell survivability. In the drug, food or drink, and feed of the present invention, the cells of the MCC1849 strain are preferably live cells, but they may be dead cells.</p>

However, the MCC1849 strain maintained the high IL-12 production-inducing ability even after it was subjected to the aforementioned treatments. Since the IL-12 production-inducing activity of the FERM BP-11313 strain, which is a strain of the same species as the MCC1849 strain, was degraded by the N-acetyl muramidase treatment or RNase treatment, it was demonstrated that the stability of the IL-12 production-inducing ability of the MCC1849 strain is not species-dependent property, but a strain-specific property.</p>

    <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The strain of the present invention, the <i>Lactobacillus paracasei</i> MCC1849 strain, has high IL-12 production-promoting activity. The IL-12 production-promoting activity of the strain is hardly reduced by a cell wall-digesting enzyme treatment or an RNase treatment. Therefore, it is thought that individual differences of the IL-12 production-promoting activity observed among objects of the application thereof would be small, and thus the strain is useful as an immunostimulant. Further, the strain can reduce infection or proliferation of influenza virus etc., and can be used for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments of infectious diseases, and so forth.</p>
