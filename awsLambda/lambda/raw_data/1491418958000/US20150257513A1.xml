      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention pertains to cosmetic applicator systems. Specifically, the invention pertains to immersion-type cosmetic applicator systems.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">By a “wand-type” applicator we mean an extended rod or stem having a proximal end with a handle and a distal free end that is adapted to aid in the delivery of product to a product application surface. The extended rod allows the free end to reach to the bottom of a product reservoir. The extended rod also facilitates application of the product and grooming, by providing clearance between the applicator head and the handle of the applicator. This clearance is especially necessary for mascara application to the eyelashes. This definition might include a cotton swab, but not a cotton ball, because a cotton ball does not have an extended rod or stem with a proximal and a distal end.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">By an “immersion-type” applicator we mean a wand-type applicator having a distal end that is adapted to be immersed in a reservoir of product, to remove product from the reservoir. Conventional mascara applicators fit this description. Examples of applicators that do not fit this description include those in which product is made to flow from an integrated reservoir, through an applicator head and onto the applicator surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Immersion-type cosmetic applicator systems that have two wand-type applicators are known. For example, there are applicator systems having two product reservoirs, one for each applicator, wherein the reservoirs are joined together, often end to end or side by side. U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,080 and U.S. Pat. No. 2,691,184 describe systems where the applicator heads point toward each other. U.S. Pat. No. 3,690,777, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,612,764, 6,682,242, US200210018688, DE3923731 and CA1,158,602 describe systems in which the applicator heads point away from each other. Systems with applicator heads pointing in the same direction are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,742 and US-D287,168.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There are also applicator systems having two wand-type applicators, but only one product reservoir, and only one entry into the reservoir. U.S. Pat. No. 2,829,655, U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,990, U.S. Pat. No. 2,902,041 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,073,320 describe systems wherein one of the wand-type applicators is not intended to be immersed in the product reservoir. Often this applicator is actually a grooming tool, such as a comb or other accessory tool. Both wand-type applicators may be attached to the same closure that seals off the reservoir, and a removable cap is provided for the applicator that does not go into the reservoir.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">There are also applicator systems having two wand-type applicators, but neither applicator is ever immersed in a product reservoir. Either product is made to flow from a reservoir, through an applicator head and onto the applicator surface (for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,592,202, US-D286,163, US-D295,878, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,688,450) or there is no product in the applicator system (i.e. U.S. Pat. No. 5,056,179).</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In all of the applicator systems described in the foregoing references, all of the applicator heads are functional. In almost all of them, the applicator heads are different from each other. In US-D295,878, the applicator heads appear to be identical, but apparently dispense different products (i.e. differently colored inks).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Sometimes a cosmetics seller wants to show potential customers the type of applicator that comes with a product. Many types of applicator head have been developed, with a variety of bristle configurations and bristle shapes. However, the applicator head is not visible when it is immersed in a product reservoir, as it is when the product reservoir is sealed for distribution in a commercial environment. One way around this problem is by sealing the product reservoir with temporary closure or seal, and then packaging the reservoir and the applicator side-by-side, in a transparent outer packaging. The problem here is that a relatively small and sleek design, such as a mascara tube, is replaced by a bulky plastic over shell. The plastic overshell significantly increases the cost of goods. Also, once the applicator head is immersed in the product, the applicator head is again not visible. A woman who owns several mascara products, for example, may not remember which applicator is in each product. Furthermore, for some consumers, the bristle features may be too small to see.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A main object of the invention is to provide a cosmetic applicator system that comprises a magnifying cap that produces a magnified image of a non-functioning applicator head.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another object of the invention is to provide a cosmetic applicator system that can be distributed and sold in a fully assembled condition, while still allowing a consumer to see, under magnification, the type of applicator head that she is purchasing.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Like some of the applicator systems of the prior art, the applicator system of the present invention has one reservoir that holds a product, or that is able to hold a product; one wand-type applicator having a distal free end that must be immersed in the product reservoir in order to remove product from the reservoir; and one wand-type applicator that is intended not to be immersed in the product reservoir. Like some of the prior art, both applicators are attached to the same closure, and a cap is supplied for the applicator that is not intended to be immersed in the product reservoir. Unlike the prior art, however, the present applicator system has two identical or substantially identical applicators. In preferred embodiments, a magnifying cap is provided for the applicator that is not intended to be immersed in the product reservoir. More preferably, this cap is permanently affixed, thus rendering that applicator non-functional. Preferably, at least a portion of the magnifying cap is transparent and able to provide optical magnification, so that the structural details of the non-functional applicator can be more easily seen by a consumer.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Referring to the embodiments of <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>, an applicator system (<b>1</b>) comprises exactly one reservoir (<b>2</b>) that is able to hold a cosmetic product (the product is denoted as ‘P’ in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). The opened end (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) of the reservoir is adapted to be sealed and unsealed, such as by a closure (<b>3</b>) that comprises threads (<b>3</b><i>b</i>), that are designed to engage to a treaded neck (<b>2</b><i>b</i>) of the reservoir. Depending from an interior surface (<b>3</b><i>d</i>) of the closure is a wand (<b>3</b><i>a</i>), or extended rod, that has a distal free end (<b>3</b><i>c</i>) that extends down into the reservoir when the closure is engaged with the neck of the reservoir. The distal end of the wand supports a first applicator head (<b>4</b>) that is adapted to remove product from the reservoir, and aid in the delivery of product to a product application surface. For example, the first applicator head may be implemented as a mascara brush. In that case, any type of applicator head known to be useful in making up the eyelashes may be suitable for use in the present invention. Several examples of mascara brush heads are shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B. A portion (<b>4</b><i>b</i>) of the first applicator head (<b>4</b>) may insert into the distal end (<b>3</b><i>c</i>) of the wand (<b>3</b><i>a</i>) (as in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), or the first applicator head may be implemented as a sleeve (<b>4</b><i>c</i>) that fits over the distal end of the wand (as in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>). In either case, the length of the wand is such that the applicator head is able to reach to the bottom (<b>2</b><i>c</i>) of the reservoir when the closure (<b>3</b>) is engaged with the neck (<b>2</b><i>b</i>) of the reservoir.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As is usually done in the art, the opened end (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) of the reservoir (<b>2</b>) may be fitted with a wiper element (<b>5</b>) which function is to remove excess product from the bristles (<b>4</b><i>a</i>) of the first applicator head (<b>4</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Protruding from an exterior surface (<b>3</b><i>e</i>) of the closure (<b>3</b>), is a second applicator head (<b>6</b>). Generally, the second applicator head is co-axial with, but pointing away from the first applicator head (<b>4</b>). The second applicator head may be attached to the closure through a short stem (<b>3</b><i>f</i>) that arises from the exterior surface (<b>3</b><i>e</i>) of the closure. Preferably, the short stem is short enough to render the second applicator head non-functional. For example, the short extension of the second applicator head means that even if the second applicator head were inserted into the opened end (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) of the reservoir (<b>2</b>), the second applicator head is unable to reach the product in the reservoir. Also, the relatively short extension of the second applicator head beyond the closure (<b>3</b>) inhibits the second applicator head from being used to groom the eyelashes, because the closure (<b>3</b>) gets in the way. Thus, a critical feature of the invention is that the second applicator head (<b>6</b>) be non-functional as a product applicator. Nevertheless, the second applicator head does have a purpose. When the closure (<b>3</b>) is engaged with the neck (<b>2</b><i>b</i>) of the reservoir, then the first applicator head is not visible, being immersed in the reservoir, but the second applicator head remains visible, and optically magnified, at all times.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The second applicator head (<b>6</b>) is protected by a magnifying cap (<b>7</b>) that surrounds the second applicator head. Furthermore, because the second applicator head is non-functional, it may be preferable if the magnifying cap cannot be removed by ordinary means. For example, the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>) may be non-removable if it rigidly connects to the closure (<b>3</b>) by any suitable, permanent means, such as with adhesive, welding, snap fitments, crimping, etc. In order the for the second applicator head to remain visible, at least a portion of the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>) should be fashioned of a transparent material. For example, in <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B and <b>10</b>, the entire cap is transparent, while in <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, a portion of the magnifying cap is opaque, and a portion (<b>7</b><i>a</i>) is transparent. Preferably, the whole cap is transparent material. Preferred transparent materials have a light transmission rate of at least 80%, so that the view of the second applicator head (<b>6</b>) is not obscured.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Furthermore, the whole transparent material or at least a portion of the transparent material must be able to produce a magnified image of the second applicator head (<b>6</b>) when the second applicator head is viewed through the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>). In <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B, the effect of the magnifying cap is shown by depicting the second applicator head when the magnifying cap is not in place, and then when the magnifying cap is in place. Preferably the whole transparent material is able to provide optical magnification. More preferably, the whole cap is transparent (i.e. no opaque portions) and is able to provide optical magnification. In the field of optics, magnification is the ratio between the apparent size of an object, and its true size, regardless of which is larger or smaller. However, in the present specification, optical magnification specifically means that the image of the second applicator head (<b>6</b>) is larger than the actual size of the second applicator head. Useful optical magnifications are between 1.10× and 5.0×, such as 2.0×, or 3.0×, or 4.0×, or any other value between 1.10× and 5.0×. Preferred magnifications are between 1.50× and 2.50×. It should be understood that the magnifying cap is a cheap plastic component, and not a high performance optical element. Therefore, at any useful level of magnification, the image of the applicator head will have at least some distortion. This may present no problem as long as a consumer can see the features of the applicator head that she is intended to see. However, magnifications larger than about 5× may be less helpful, since the magnified image of the applicator head is likely to be significantly distorted.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In general, optical magnification will depend upon the internal and external shapes of the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>), and by the material of the magnifying portions of the cap, including any surface coatings with optical properties. In order to produce an enlarged image of the second applicator head (<b>6</b>), the magnifying portion(s) of the cap must behave as a positive (converging) lens, and the distance between the second applicator head and the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>) must be less than the focal length of the magnifying portion. For example, some portion of the protective cap may be bi-convex or plano-convex, with an effective focal length of at least 12 mm, or at least 20 mm, or at least 30 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The magnifying cap (<b>7</b>) may fit over the sides of the closure, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B, or the cap may rest on top of the closure, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B. The combination of cap (<b>7</b>) and closure (<b>3</b>) serves as a handle for manipulating the first applicator head (<b>4</b>). Plastic materials that may be useful for the non-removable cap include polymethylmethacrylate (i.e. acrylic glass), butyrate (cellulose acetate butyrate), polycarbonate, ABS, high impact styrene, PETG (glycol modified polyethylene terephthalate), etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In preferred applicator systems of the present invention, the second applicator head (<b>6</b>) is identic al or substantially identical to the first applicator head (<b>4</b>). By “substantially identical”, we mean that as viewed under the magnifying cap (<b>7</b>), a user can not tell the difference between the first and second applicator heads. For example, the second applicator head may differ from the first applicator head in some internal structure, dimension or material that is not visible to a user, while on the outside the two applicator heads are generally indistinguishable, even under magnification.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">One benefit of the present invention is that in the closed (or fully assembled) configuration, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 5A</figref>, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B, a user is still able to see the type of applicator head that she will be purchasing without the need to package the functional applicator head separated from the reservoir. The state of the art of molding applicator heads has reduced the cost to where it is advantageously cheaper to provide the second (unusable) applicator head, rather than bulky plastic overshell packaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Another benefit is that throughout the life of the applicator system, the applicator head is visible so that a woman who owns several similar products will always be able to identify an applicator head according to the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">
        <figref>FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>B, <b>6</b>A, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B, <b>8</b>A, <b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>A, <b>9</b>B and <b>10</b> demonstrate that various types of applicator heads may be used in an applicator system of the present invention. Obviously, the invention is not limited to the applicator heads shown.</p>
