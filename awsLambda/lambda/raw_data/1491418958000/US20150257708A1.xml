    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates generally to signal processing, and more specifically to extending the dynamic range of a signal.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Low amplitude signals are frequently obscured by the noise generated by a sensor of the signal. Thus, small changes in the actual signal are masked. One way around this problem is to extend the dynamic range of the signal by amplification.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">One such signal having a small change in amplitude relative to the underlying background signal is generated by photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements. In these measurements, light is used to measure the changes in vascular blood volume generally in a peripheral part of the body. The volume of blood in that body part, such as a finger, changes during each heartbeat.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In a typical embodiment of a photoplethysmographic system <b>10</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>), light from a light source <b>14</b>, such as a light emitting diode <b>14</b>, is either transmitted through or reflected from the internal vasculature (only through shown for clarity) and detected by a photodetector <b>22</b>. Generally the light source <b>14</b> actually comprises a red LED and an InfraRed (IR) LED (not shown). The signal from the photodetector <b>22</b> is amplified by an amplifier <b>24</b>, demodulated by demodulator <b>26</b> so that the signals from the red and IR LEDs can be separated, low-pass filtered <b>28</b>, and converted to digital form by an analog-to-digital converter <b>30</b>. The digitized signal is processed by a microprocessor <b>32</b> and the PPG measurements displayed by an output device <b>34</b>. The microprocessor also determines when the LED lights <b>14</b> should be turned on and controls the illumination using an LED driver circuit <b>36</b>. The electrical signal from the photodetector varies over the heart beat cycle and is analyzed by the processor using signal processing techniques.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">One way known to the prior art to increase the dynamic range of the signal from the photodetector is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. This embodiment involves using an analog error amplifier <b>40</b> in a feedback loop with a main amplifier <b>44</b> and photodiode <b>38</b>. This error amplifier <b>40</b> controls a transistor <b>42</b> which generates a current that cancels the static current of the photodiode <b>38</b>. The error amplifier <b>40</b> tries to maintain the output of the main amplifier <b>44</b> at a specific voltage that is typically at the midsupply voltage of the system. The pass-band of the circuit is dependent upon the amount of current sourced by the transistor. Because PPG signals are typically low frequency, it is difficult to generate a pole close enough to DC in an integrated circuit to make the pass band of the circuit begin at 1 Hz. Thus, these systems frequently infringe on the bandwidth of interest and are inherently lossy.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">What is needed is a system that permits expanded dynamic range while having components that permit it to be constructed in a small package such as an integrated circuit for portable use.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">A digitally assisted dynamic range enhancer is a circuit type and technique that can be used to separate static and time varying signals from a sensor. This is particularly important when the static component is much larger than the time varying component. Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the device shown may be used in a photoplethysmogram (PPG) front end <b>10</b>â², which comprises the dynamic range enhancer circuit <b>50</b>, a photodiode <b>22</b>â², and an integrating transimpedance (main) amplifier <b>54</b>. In the configuration shown, photoplethysmogram signals typically have static or DC components that are 25Ã to 400Ã larger than their time varying components. For such a use, it is desirable to design the circuit such that it may be constructed as a small package such as an integrated circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In more detail, when the two LEDs <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>â² (in one embodiment, red and IR respectively) are turned on, the photodiode <b>22</b>â² generates a photocurrent I<sub>ph</sub>. In other embodiments, other wavelengths and other numbers of LEDs are used. The dynamic range enhancer <b>50</b> is also turned on, which generates a current I<sub>st </sub>in the opposite direction to the photodiode current I<sub>ph</sub>. The resulting remaining current, I<sub>Res </sub>equal to (I<sub>ph</sub>âI<sub>st</sub>), is integrated by the amplifier <b>52</b>, as part of a switched integrator <b>54</b>, and the resulting output of the switched integrator is digitized by an A/D converter or ADC <b>58</b>. Amplifier <b>54</b>, in one embodiment, is a switched integrator topology. In this arrangement, when the circuit is not integrating, termed the first configuration, the reset switch <b>53</b> is closed and the I<sub>Res </sub>switch <b>55</b> is open. Once the LEDs <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>â² turn on, typically sequentially, the reset switch <b>53</b> opens and the I<sub>Res </sub>switch <b>55</b> closes to integrate the signal, termed the second configuration. The switches remain in the second configuration until the A/D <b>58</b> has sampled the output of the switched integrator <b>54</b>, at which time the switches return to the first configuration. In one embodiment, the output of the A/D converter is decimated <b>59</b> by a factor of M and is output <b>60</b> as data. The output of the A/D converter also is fed back to the dynamic range enhancer <b>50</b> and the LED drivers <b>63</b>, <b>63</b>â² respectively, through digital feedback modules <b>62</b>â². In another embodiment, only one LED driver <b>63</b> is used and the output of the driver is switched to control both LEDs. The digital feedback modules <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>â² are integrated processing circuits executing the algorithm of <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, as explained below.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Using this technique allows the amplifier gain to be much larger than typical, while being powered by a low voltage supply. This is because the amplifier <b>52</b> is not being saturated by the large static component of the input signal. The current of the dynamic range enhancer <b>50</b> is set in digital steps by the digital feedback module <b>62</b> so that the output of the system is within the power supply rails of the amplifier <b>52</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3(</figref><i>a</i>), in another embodiment the switched integrator <b>54</b> (<figref>FIG. 3)</figref> is replaced with a resistive transimpedance amplifier configuration <b>54</b>â². In this embodiment, output of the transimpedance amplifier <b>52</b> is connected to one of its inputs through a resistor <b>56</b>, instead of switch <b>53</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In operation, and referring to <figref>FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>4</b>, if the digitized output V<sub>out </sub>of the amplifier <b>54</b> (Step <b>16</b>) is greater than a minimum threshold (Step <b>20</b>), and less than a maximum threshold (Step <b>24</b>), then the digital feedback <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>â² will not change either I<sub>st </sub>or I<sub>LED</sub>, respectively, and the algorithm loops to obtain the next value (Step <b>26</b>). If, however, V<sub>out </sub>is below a minimum threshold (Step <b>20</b>), the algorithm determines if the LED current I<sub>LED </sub>can be increased (Step <b>30</b>). If it can, then the feedback <b>62</b> will increase I<sub>LED </sub>(Step <b>34</b>) and loop for the next sample (Step <b>36</b>). If I<sub>LED </sub>is already at a maximum (Step <b>38</b>), then the algorithm determines if sufficient time has passed, for example 1.5 sec (Step <b>39</b>), and if not, loops to obtain another signal (Step <b>40</b>). If sufficient time has passed, the algorithm decreases I<sub>st</sub>, resets I<sub>LED </sub>to zero (Step <b>42</b>), and loops for another value (Step <b>40</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Similarly, if V<sub>out </sub>is greater than a maximum threshold, the algorithm determines if I<sub>LED </sub>can be decreased (Step <b>44</b>). If it can, then the algorithm will decrease I<sub>LED </sub>(Step <b>48</b>) and wait for the next sample (Step <b>40</b>). If I<sub>LED </sub>is already at a minimum threshold (Step <b>50</b>), then the algorithm determines if sufficient time has passed (Step <b>54</b>). If sufficient time has not passed, the algorithm loops for a new value ((Step <b>40</b>). If sufficient time has passed, the algorithm increases I<sub>st</sub>, resets I<sub>LED </sub>to zero (Step <b>58</b>), and loops for the next value (Step <b>40</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">This digitally-assisted analog technique has several advantages. First, compared to the prior art, which in one embodiment was limited to subtracting 3.240 Î¼A, the current invention can subtract large amounts of DC current, because the DRE block can be implemented as a tunable current source.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Another advantage to using a digitally assisted analog technique to cancel static current over the analog error amplifier method occurs because the error amplifier <b>40</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) is trying to maintain the output of the main amplifier <b>44</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) to a specific voltage value, the error amplifier <b>40</b> adds a zero into the frequency domain of the PPG signal at 0.0 Hz. However, the PPG signal band of interest is between 0.1 Hz and 10 Hz, which means that a low frequency pole at 0.1 Hz or below is required to not interfere with the signal bandwidth. This low frequency pole is very difficult to achieve in an integrated circuit chip, and frequently the low frequency pole is higher than 0.1 Hz, reducing the overall gain of the PPG signal. However, when using the present digitally assisted approach, the output of the amplifier is not maintained at a specific voltage, rather it is simply maintained within the rails of the amplifier. Therefore, a zero is not introduced at 0 Hz and the bandwidth of interest is not reduced by the signal chain, allowing for large gains across the entire band of interest.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Still another advantage for using a digitally assisted analog technique is that it is inherently substantially lossless. When using the prior art method shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the control is an all-analog loop, so the amount of current subtracted from the photodiode <b>38</b> is unknown. However, when using a digitally assisted approach, there are set, specific values of the subtraction current that are controlled by the user. Therefore, the total current (static and time-varying) of the photodiode is known, which, in many instances of PPG, is an important piece of information.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Further, although this circuit is discussed in conjunction with a transducer that produces a large DC component relative to a small AC component, it is also possible to use the circuit and technique with a transducer that produces only DC signals. In such a case, the technique can be used to remove a portion of the DC component to thereby improve the resolution of subsequent A/D conversion.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In more detail, the dynamic range enhancer, in one embodiment, is an 8-bit switched capacitor current source constructed to generate 100 Î¼A of current. Referring to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, in one embodiment, the DRE <b>50</b> has one input that is connected to a system clock <b>70</b> which is used by the DRE <b>50</b> to form two non-overlapping clock signals <b>74</b>, <b>78</b>. Each signal is used to open and close a respective switch <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. One terminal of the first switch <b>82</b> is connected to a supply voltage <b>89</b>. The other terminal of the first switch <b>82</b> is connected to one terminal of a variable capacitor <b>88</b>. The capacitance of the variable capacitor <b>88</b> is controlled by the digital feedback module <b>62</b>. The other terminal of the variable capacitor <b>88</b> is connected to ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The second terminal of the second switch <b>84</b> is connected to one terminal of the photodiode <b>22</b>â² and one terminal of the amplifier <b>52</b> through switch <b>55</b>â². The two non-overlapping clock pulses <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> alternately open and close switches <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> so as to alternately charge and discharge the variable capacitor <b>88</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">When the system clock <b>70</b> operates at 6 MHz, the least significant bit (LSB) of variable capacitor <b>88</b> has a value of 73 fF. The voltage source, V<sub>DD </sub><b>89</b>, is 1.8V and the voltage at the cathode of the photodiode <b>22</b>â² is set by the integrating amplifier <b>52</b> virtual ground to equal 0.9V. The Charge <b>82</b> and Dump <b>84</b> switches are both 25 Î¼m/0.18 Î¼m line widths to reduce the RC time constant between the switch resistance and the capacitance of variable capacitor <b>88</b>. This ensures that the variable capacitor completely charges and discharges for all values of the variable capacitor <b>88</b>.</p>
