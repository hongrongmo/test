      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">2. FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to an edible product containing a decontaminant. Particularly, the invention relates to an edible product, for example, a food-like product containing an effective amount of activated charcoal to mitigate, substantially reduce or cause the cessation of adverse effects associated with the ingestion of a toxic substance. The invention also relates to methods for manufacturing such a decontaminant edible product, for example, a food-like product and uses thereof.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The ingestion of toxic substances has historically been and continues to be a significant problem. While efforts in recent years to mitigate ingestion of toxic substances have arisen, such as conspicuous labeling, tamper-proof sealing, and limiting the number of tablets in bottles of children's medicines, a significant numbers of poisoning incidents continue to occur. Moreover, an overwhelming percentage of these incidents occur in the residence, and the majority of the victims tend to be young children.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the emergency treatment of poisoning, unless a specific antidote exists, which is uncommon, the effort centers on two main objectives: (i) general support and stabilization and (ii) decontamination. As decontamination and treatment must begin immediately in such toxicological emergencies, often without the benefit of full and thorough clinical information on the patient, it is particularly important that any drug or therapeutic substance administered to the patient be substantially free of adverse effects. Sorbents, which when introduced into the patient's gastrointestinal tract resist decomposition and adsorb the ingested toxins until eventual excretion by the patient, have been employed for decontamination. Of those sorbents, activated charcoal has emerged as the decontaminant of choice. Its administration to poisoning victims has now surpassed the administration of syrup of ipecac as the single most important general toxicological treatment measure.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Activated charcoal is a fine, black, powdery substance which is tasteless, odorless, and non-toxic. Activated charcoal is generally formed by oxidation (activation) of combustion residue derived from a controlled process performed on wood, peat, or other organic material producing a substance composed of extremely porous particles with extraordinarily high internal surface area, typically ranging between about 900 m<sup>2</sup>/g and about 2000 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Activated charcoal exhibits great adsorptivity and thus has proven to be quite effective as a decontaminant when introduced in sufficient quantities in a timely manner into the gastrointestinal tract of a poisoning victim. The chief mechanism of action of activated charcoal is by its direct binding with toxins in the gastrointestinal tract. A secondary mechanism, called intestinal dialysis, occurs when activated charcoal in the intestine is able to remove toxins from blood within the intestinal blood vessels. Toxins bound to the activated charcoal in the gastrointestinal tract are excreted in the stool.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Activated charcoal is currently available in several forms to be orally administered to individuals who have ingested a toxin. In the most widely used form, activated charcoal is contained in a suspension such as commercially available ACTIDOSE AQUA and CHARCOAID 2000. Activated charcoal is also available extensively in Europe and to a more limited extent in the United States simply in its powdered or granulated form for mixture within a drinkable liquid prior to ingestion. In yet another form, activated charcoal is contained in tablets or capsules for the treatment of gas and upset stomach. Use of these tablets or capsules for decontamination in toxicological treatment however is not readily feasible due to the large number that would be required and the impracticality of administration to children.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In whatever form activated charcoal is delivered to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., suspended in a liquid, compressed within a tablet or capsule), the activated charcoal is likely to have beneficial effects if the necessary amount can be expeditiously delivered to the gastrointestinal tract of the victim. Therein lies the single greatest obstacle to optimal utilization of activated charcoal as a decontaminant in toxicological treatment. Except for the tablet or capsule form, which presents its own obstacles to ingestion, the antidotal substances are extremely unpalatable. Liquid antidotal suspensions of activated charcoal, for instance, form a black gritty liquid bearing a striking resemblance to old engine crank case oil, which is off-putting to children and adults alike.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Whereas to an adult poisoning victim, the noxiousness of an activated charcoal-containing antidote may simply represent an unpleasant consequence that must be tolerated to avoid the far greater consequences of the poisoning, it would hardly be such a trivial matter to a young child victim. Children will simply refuse activated charcoal in a form that is not appealing to them.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Aspiration is the most serious risk of activated charcoal administration and, although rare, can be life-threatening. It usually occurs in the patient who is vomiting, is uncooperative, or has altered mental status and is most often associated with the placement of a nasogastric or orogastric tube in the absence of airway protection.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In cases where activated charcoal must be administered to an uncooperative patient, there is no choice but to introduce it through a nasogastric or orogastric tube. This procedure often requires physically restraining the patient. It also carries the risk of trauma to the mouth, pharynx, esophagus and stomach. Inadvertent placement into the tracheo-bronchial tree can result not only in trauma to these areas, but in massive charcoal aspiration which can be fatal.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Efforts have been made to render the currently available forms of activated charcoal more palatable, but those efforts have at best yielded only products that may be somewhat less noxious but certainly not palatable especially to young children. Those efforts at times have led to the introduction of substances or components, which may actually diminish the adsorptivity of the activated charcoal, thereby undermining the singular central function of the antidote.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">There is a continued need for an antidotal product containing ample quantities of activated charcoal, which is palatable and in which the adsorptivity of the activated charcoal is not diminished in any substantial measure. In addition, the product should be familiar in form and taste to a young child.</p>

      <heading id="h-00009-en" level="1">6.2.1 Illustrative Embodiments</heading>
      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="1">6.2.1.1 Wafers Sandwiching a Cream</heading>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0135">In one embodiment, the invention encompasses an edible product comprising a pair of biscuit-like wafers and a creamy filling sandwiched therebetween. The wafers may include coloring to make the edible product appealing and easily identified by young children in order to entice them to eat the edible product of the subject invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0136">In an illustrative embodiment, a pair of disk-shaped wafers are produced. The wafers exhibit a compressed granular texture and a degree of friability akin to that of a cookie. The degree of friability is such that the wafers are easily crumbled by the average biting force generated by even a very young child. The degree of friability is also such that the crumbled wafers may thereafter be effectively disintegrated by the subsequent chewing action generated by the given young child.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0137">Subject to the allowable ranges of their component composition weight percentages, the wafers exhibit a degree of rich, sweet flavor to accompany their cookie-like crumbly texture, wherein in an illustrative embodiment, the sweet flavor of the wafers is sufficient to encourage substantial chewing prior to ingestion into the user's gastrointestinal tract.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0138">Each wafer includes activated charcoal, in addition to one or more flavoring agents, one or more complexing or thickening agents, one or more emulsifying agents; water, and an agent to improve porosity and texture in the approximate weight range proportions indicated in Table 2.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0139">The combination of activated charcoal, one or more flavoring agents, one or more complexing or thickening agents, one or more emulsifying agents; water, and an agent to improve porosity and texture in the approximate weight range proportions followed by baking the ingredients results in a product having, for example, a cookie-like wafer appearance, which has a consistency emulating that of a baked cookie.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0140">In another embodiment, to further add to the appeal and sweet flavor of the edible product, a cookie is prepared having a cream filling. In such a form, therapeutically or prophylactically effective amounts of activated charcoal arc ingested by a subject who has ingested a poison or toxin in an amount sufficient to mitigate, substantially reduce, or cause the cessation of at least one adverse effect associated with the ingestion of the toxin or poison.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0141">In another illustrative embodiment, to enhance the sweet flavor of the wafers, and to enhance the emulation of a cookie treat, a creamy white filling is sandwiched between a pair of wafers. The precise consistency, color, and taste of the filling is not integral to the invention; however, it is preferable that the filling be of a consistency and color appealing to children and that its flavor exhibit a sufficient sweet component to supplement or augment the sweet flavor of the wafers. The pleasant taste further encourages the child to likewise ingest addition âedible product of the invention,â which make up the required pharmacological activated charcoal dosage.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0142">An important factor in the proper use of activated charcoal or any other decontaminant in toxicological treatment is, in addition to its ingestion in significant doses by the victim, the promptness with which the ingestion occurs. The edible product of the invention is such that a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of activated charcoal is found in the edible product and is ingested with chewing in an ordinary fashion (i.e., the way a subject would chew and swallow any other ingestable food).</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0143">In one embodiment, the activated charcoal is administered at the site at which the poisoning incident occurs, which in most cases is the victim's home, immediately following the discovery of the accidental or purposeful ingestion, before the ingested toxins have had the opportunity to be extensively absorbed into the bloodstream,</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0144">The edible product produced by the inventive method, given its inherent palatability, could easily be administered in the home or any other setting outside a medical institution, and by any individual. Hence, the edible product of the invention would not only expand the usage of activated charcoal as a decontaminant, but it would actually enhance, in a significant manner, the effectiveness of that usage.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="1">6.2.1.2 Leavening Agents</heading>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0145">In the illustrative embodiments set forth above, the ingredients were blended and processed to remove water, for example by baking, in the absence of a leavening agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0146">In another illustrative embodiment, the edible product contains a leavening agent to allow the edible product to rise and increase in volume. Embodiments of the Invention in the form of a wafer, cracker, or pie crusts can utilize leavening to make them flaky or lighter in texture. Leavening can occur mainly during cooking, such as for pie crusts. In other cases most of the leavening happens prior to baking, as for example wife many yeast breads, or more often, leavening may occur partially before and partially when the product is heated. The type of leavening used may depend on the product, for example whether the un-baked product is a batter or a dough.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0147">Several types of leavening agents can be combined to give the maximum amount of lift to the product. For example, a recipe might require sugar and butter to be creamed, representing one type of leavening (i.e., air) and call for baking powder as well, which is another type of leavening (i.e., carbon dioxide).</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0148">In addition, the batter or dough should be suitable for holding the expanded shape, before, during, and after cooking. For example a cake containing flour will rise in the oven and hold the volume even after the cake cools and the leavening gases contract. The structure of the cake is strong enough after cooking so that foe air cells remain. On the other hand, many cheesecakes and soufflÃ©s which have little flour will attain a high volume in the oven but will collapse when the product is cooled. The egg protein-based walls of the little air cells are not strong enough to hold up the weight of the cake when the heated air cools and contracts.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">6.2.1.3 Cream Filling</heading>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0149">The optional cream to be included in an embodiment of the edible product of the invention may be used to enhance the palatability and flavor of the wafers, for example, the cream may improve the texture or month feel of the product. In an illustrative embodiment, a creamy white filling is sandwiched between a pair of wafers. The precise consistency, color and taste of the filling is not important to the invention. Thus, the color, texture, and its flavor should supplement or augment the sweet flavor of the wafers themselves.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0150">In one embodiment, the optional cream filling comprises one or more flavoring agents, shortening, lecithin, salt, and sugar. In another embodiment, the optional cream filling is a reduced fat cream filling that comprises sugar, glycerine, shortenings and a fat replacer. In still another embodiment, the optional cream filling is a non-fat cream filling that comprises one or more flavoring agents, lecithin, salt, glycerine, a fat replacer, and one or more emulsifying agents.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0151">In a particular embodiment, the flavoring agent is vanilla or chocolate flavoring. In another particular embodiment, the flavoring is vanilla flavoring. In a particular illustrative embodiment, the flavoring in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 0.05% to about 1%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the flavoring in the optional cream is in an approximate weight percent of about 0.2%.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0152">In another particular embodiment, the shortening is vegetable cubed shortening. In another particular embodiment, the shortening in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 25% to about 35%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the shortening in the optional cream is in an approximate weight percent of about 31%.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0153">In another particular embodiment, the lecithin in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 0.01% to about 0.5%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the lecithin in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of about 0.05%.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0154">In another particular embodiment, the salt in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 0.1% to about 1%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the salt in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of about 0.25%.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0155">In another particular embodiment, the sugar is powdered sugar. In another particular embodiment, the sugar in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 65% to about 75%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the sugar in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of about 69%.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0156">In another embodiment, the fat replacer is a carbohydrate-based, protein-based, or non-digestible or non-absorbable fat-based fat replacer. Illustrative examples of fat replacers include, but are not limited to, cellulose, maltodextrins, gums, starches, fiber, polydextrose, and olestra. In another particular embodiment, the fat replacer in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of from about 5% to about 15%. In another particular illustrative embodiment, the fat replacer in the optional cream is present in an approximate weight percent of about 11%.</p>

For example, a skilled artisan would readily be able to determine the administration of the edible product of the present invention. The following working examples therefore, specifically point out the illustrative embodiments of the invention, and are not to be construed as limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">7. EXAMPLES</heading>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">7.1 In Vitro Testing</heading>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0182">A rapid test method based on Trinder's Reagent was used in order to determine adsorptivity of the activated charcoal cookie formulation. Tests were conducted in vitro by mixing a predetermined amount of a test substance into a stock solution. The in vitro stock solution used in each test consisted of 1 g/L of sodium salicylate dissolved in a simulated gastric fluid solution containing 2.0 g/L of NaCl, 7.0 mL/L of 12 N strength concentrated HCl and distilled water. The simulated gastric fluid was characterized in this form by a pH level of 1.2, the salicylate of this pH level being more than 99.99% in the form of undissociated salicylic acid, which is very similar in its properties to aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0183">Equilibrium adsorption tests for determining the total amount of salicylate that a given test substance may potentially adsorb, if allowed to attain equilibrium conditions, was conducted with the following procedures. First, a predetermined amount of the substance to be tested was placed in a glass vial, and 20 mL of the stock solution was added to that vial. The vial was thereafter continuously shaken by placement on a shaking table for approximately 15 hours. This caused the test substance to fully disintegrate such that the activated charcoal contained therein attained virtually perfect adsorption equilibrium with the salicylate in the stock solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0184">Kinetic tests were conducted generally by performing the following steps. Approximately 500 mL of the stock solution was poured into a <b>1</b> liter glass container. A predetermined quantity of the given test substance was then introduced into the solution in the glass container. The container was then placed on a shaking table and shaken thereby at a 60 cycles per minute oscillation frequency. Samples were taken at various times. Activated charcoal was filtered from each sample and the solution analysed calorimetrically to determine the salicylic concentration corresponding to the given sample time.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0185">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates comparative kinetic effects of varying amounts of filling on the adsorptivity of 2.1 g of activated charcoal. For this test, a cookie weighing approximately 6.80 grams (5.15 g wafers and 1.65 g filling) was crushed to simulate chewing, and then introduced into a given volume of the stock solution. This study illustrates the effect of adsorptivity on varying amounts of cream filling on the decontaminant and demonstrates no effect on adsorptivity of the activated charcoal.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0186">The superior adsorption performance of the subject decontaminant, edible product made in accordance with the inventive method is apparent from <figref>FIG. 2</figref> when curve <b>1</b> is compared with curve <b>2</b>, plotting the decrease in salicylate concentration upon introduction therein of 10.06 ml of ACTIDOSE AQUA, a liquid suspension commercially marketed by PADDOCK LABS, INC., Minneapolis, Minn. That amount of ACTIDOSE AQUA was determined to contain approximately the equivalent amount of activated charcoal as contained in the cookie sample from which curve <b>1</b> was derived. Comparison of the two curves indicates that the cookie produced by the instant inventive method not only reduced the salicylate concentration in the simulated gastric fluid solution at a significantly faster rate, but also yielded a significantly greater overall reduction in the concentration than a comparable amount of ACTIDOSE AQUA suspension. For instance, the salicylate concentration, 5 minutes subsequent to introduction of the subject cookie, was substantially below 0.2 g/L. Whereas, the salicylate concentration 5 minutes subsequent to introduction of the ACTIDOSE AQUA was observed to be approximately 0.5 g/L. After 30 minutes, the salicylate concentration had diminished to approximately 0.03 g/L with the subject cookie, whereas it had begun to level off at approximately 0.15 g/L with ACTIDOSE AQUA.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref> illustrate kinetic tests on illustrative edible decontaminant product of the invention. In one illustrative embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, 2.1 g of activated charcoal (essentially a 1:1 ratio with sodium salicylate) were added to illustrate the absolute degree to which the other ingredients interfere with activated charcoal. In another illustrative embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>, 20 g of activated charcoal (essentially a 10:1 ratio with sodium salicylate) were added to illustrate how the product would perform in a clinical situation. <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> further illustrate an illustrative embodiment of the invention in comparison with ACTIDOSE AQUA using 2.1 g and 20 g of activated charcoal, respectively.</p>
