      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0034">In the present embodiment, a labeled plastic container has a container body and a label. The label is formed for example by attaching a film to the container body.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0035">(Method of Preparing Labeled Plastic Container)</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0036">A labeled plastic container according to the present embodiment is prepared for example by an in-mold molding method. More specifically, the labeled plastic container is prepared by placing a film (which is sometimes referred to as an in-mold label) on an inner surface of a mold, and then injecting, into the mold, a thermoplastic resin composition in a moldable state. The in-mold molding method can be exemplified by a blow molding method and an injection molding method.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0037">For example, in a blow molding method, first a film is placed at an appropriate position in a mold. Next, a preform or parison made of the above-described thermoplastic resin composition is prepared. Next, in a state where the preform or parison is sandwiched by the mold, compressed gas is blown into the inside of the preform or parison, and the preform or parison is caused to expand inside the mold. Then, the molded body is cooled to obtain a labeled plastic container.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0038">(Properties of Labeled Plastic Container)</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0039">In an in-mold molding method, resin which forms a container body and is in a molten state (which is sometimes referred to as a molten resin) is caused to contact a film that forms a label. At this time, the resin that is present on a surface of the film on the container body side is dissolved to be integrated with the container body, and then is cooling-solidified; thereby, the film is attached to the container body. Accordingly, if the heat insulating property of the film is insufficient, heat that is conducted from the molten resin to the film is conducted to the mold, and the resin that is present on the surface of the film on the container body side cannot be dissolved sufficiently. As a result, the film and the container body may not adhere to each other at all, and even if the film and the container body adhere to each other, adhesive strength that allows actual use may not be attained.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0040">As one method for suppressing such adhesion failure as described above, it may be possible to use, as an in-mold label, a laminated body having a base material layer and an adhesion layer, the base material layer being made of a porous film whose main component is thermoplastic resin. Note that the âmain componentâ means a component whose content is 50 pts. mass or higher in the total content of components contained (100 pts. mass). In this case, because the specific thermal resistivity of the base material layer is relatively high, conduction, to the mold, of heat that has been conducted from the molten resin to the adhesion layer can be suppressed when the molten resin is injected into the mold after the in-mold label is placed in the mold such that the adhesion layer comes into contact with the molten resin. Thereby, the in-mold label and the container body can be attached to each other firmly.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0041">However, when a porous film whose main component is thermoplastic resin is used as a base material layer of an in-mold label, air confined within the porous film may expand due to heat at the time of molding. As a result, pore walls included in the porous film may buckle and deform, and unevenness (which is sometimes referred to as orange peel) appears on surfaces of the in-mold label more easily. Also, when the density of the porous film is decreased for the purpose of improving the heat insulating property of the in-mold label, the pore diameter becomes larger, and pore walls buckle more easily; thereby, occurrence of orange peel is facilitated. Therefore, it is difficult to realize both adhesion between an in-mold label and a container body, and suppression of orange peel when a porous film is used as a base material layer of an in-mold label.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0042">On the other hand, a synthetic paper including a thermoplastic resin composition that contains a large amount of inorganic material powders is known. For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2013-010931 discloses a thin film sheet having an apparent specific gravity that is adjusted by: extruding raw materials including 60 to 82 pts. mass of inorganic material powders, 18 to 40 pts. mass of thermoplastic resin and 0.05 to 4.0 pts. mass of auxiliary materials through a die by a T-die method to mold a thin film sheet intermediate; and stretching the thin film sheet intermediate at a specific stretching ratio.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0043">Generally, the thermal conductivity of inorganic fine powders is higher than the thermal conductivity of thermoplastic resin. Therefore, it has been thought that it is difficult to apply a thermoplastic resin composition containing a large amount of inorganic materials for applications that require a heat insulating property. Rather, a thermoplastic resin composition containing a large amount of inorganic fine powders is used for applications that make use of its heat transfer property. For example, a thermoplastic resin composition containing a large amount of inorganic fine powders is used for the purpose of improving heat dissipation of a casing of a cellular phone. Actually, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2013-010931 mentions about printability, processing aptitude, and water resistance of synthetic paper, but neither describes nor suggests a heat insulating property of it. Also, although many applications are described as applications of synthetic paper, applications like an in-mold label that require a heat insulating property are not described.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0044">As a result of a thorough investigation, the present inventors found that, by adjusting the porosity (which is sometimes referred to as the void ratio), the pore length and/or the thermal conductivity of a porous layer of a film containing a relatively large amount of inorganic fine powders, and/or by adjusting the thermal conductivity and/or the thermal resistance of the film, the film can be used as an in-mold label. Also, the present inventors found that, by using the film as an in-mold label, both adhesion between the in-mold label and a container body, and suppression of orange peel can be realized.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0045">According to the present embodiment, a thermoplastic resin film that has an excellent heat insulating property and contains a large amount of inorganic material powders is used as an in-mold label. Thereby, both adhesion between the in-mold label and a container body and suppression of orange peel can be realized. Thereby, a labeled plastic container that has excellent adhesive strength between the in-mold label and the container body can be obtained. Also, a labeled plastic container that exhibits almost no orange peel and has aesthetically excellent appearance can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0046">Also, by a blow molding method, the container body of a plastic container is molded, and at the same time, a film can be attached to a container body. Therefore, a labeled plastic container can be manufactured simply and conveniently in a short period of time while maintaining the design property, the light-weight property, and the productivity of the container body itself. However, when a labeled plastic container is created by a blow molding method, the heat amount transferred from a thermoplastic resin composition to a film is small as compared with a case where a labeled plastic container is created by an injection molding method. Therefore, adhesion failure easily occurs as compared a case where a labeled plastic container is created by an injection molding method.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0047">However, according to the present embodiment, a thermoplastic resin film that has an excellent heat insulating property and contains a large amount of inorganic material powders is used as an in-mold label. Thereby, the adhesion of the in-mold label is improved. As a result, adhesion failure can be suppressed even in a case where a labeled plastic container is manufactured by a blow molding method.</p>

In one embodiment, when a large amount of inorganic fine powders is blended into thermoplastic resin at the step of forming a porous layer, the fluidity of a kneaded molten material of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders may lower, and it may become difficult to form the porous layer. By combining thermoplastic resin with different degrees of viscosity, lowering of fluidity of a kneaded molten material of thermoplastic resin and inorganic fine powders can be suppressed even when a large amount of inorganic fine powders is blended into the thermoplastic resin. In another embodiment, irregularity of a thickness at the time of stretching can be suppressed by blending ultrahigh molecular weight thermoplastic resin with thermoplastic resin of a main component, or by blending resin whose melting point is lower by 10Â° C. or more (for example, LDPE) than the thermoplastic resin of the main component (for example, HDPE).</p>

      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0078">Note that the content of the inorganic fine powders in the porous layer is determined by measurement according to JIS P 8251: 2003 âPaper, board and pulpsâDetermination of residue (ash) on ignition at 525Â° C.â. Also, when hydrophilic treatment or hydrophobic treatment has been performed on surfaces of inorganic fine powders, the content of the inorganic fine powders in the porous layer is calculated based on the mass of the inorganic fine powders before the surface treatment. The mass of the surface treatment agent used in the surface treatment of the inorganic fine powders is handled as the mass of additives described below (which are, for example, dispersant or lubricant).</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0079">The volume-average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders as measured by laser diffractometry is preferably 0.1 Î¼m or larger, and more preferably 0.3 Î¼m or larger. Thereby, a porous layer with a sufficient heat insulating property for use as an in-mold label can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0080">The volume-average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders is preferably 10 Î¼m or smaller, and more preferably 4 Î¼m or smaller. Thereby, the number of pores within the porous layer can be increased. Also, the external appearance of a surface of the thermoplastic resin film is improved. For example, when the volume-average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders is 4 Î¼m or smaller, unevenness of the film surface becomes less, and it is possible to attain effects that print ink is transferred evenly when printing is performed on the film surface, and the print quality is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0081">The smaller the average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders is, the larger the number of poses in the porous layer is. Therefore, the average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders is preferably smaller. However, even when the average particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders is small, if the inorganic fine powders include coarse particles, pore walls in the porous layer become thinner, or the pores become continuous so that the strength of the porous layer lowers, and buckling occurs more easily. Therefore, the residue of the inorganic fine powders is preferably 5 ppm or less in a test with a JIS standard sieve whose aperture is 45 Î¼m (JIS Z 8801-1: 2006, âTest sievesâPart 1: Test sieves of metal wire clothâ), and is 5 ppm or less in a test with a JIS standard sieve whose aperture is 38 Î¼m.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0082">Also, D50 and D90 of the inorganic fine powders may satisfy the expression 1.2â¦D90/D50â¦2.1. D50 refers to a cumulative 50% particle diameter based on a volume as measured by laser diffractometry, and is also referred to as a median size. D90 refers to a cumulative 90% particle diameter based on a volume as measured by laser diffractometry. By using such inorganic fine powders, orange peel caused by buckling of the porous layer can be suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0083">The inorganic fine powders with a sharp particle distribution that achieves a residue of 5 ppm or less in a test with a JIS standard sieve having an aperture of 45 Î¼m or that achieves D50 and D90 satisfying the above-described relationship can be obtained by improving a sharpness of classification. Examples of such inorganic fine powders include CUBE-13B (manufactured by Maruo Calcium Co., Ltd.), CUBE-06B (manufactured by Maruo Calcium Co., Ltd.), and BF-100 (manufactured by Bihoku Funka Kogyo Co., Ltd.).</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0084">As described above, by adjusting at least either one of the content and the particle diameter of the inorganic fine powders, a porous layer with a smaller pore size, a narrower pore diameter distribution, and a larger number of pores, as compared with a conventional in-mold label having a porous film whose main component is thermoplastic resin, can be obtained. The conventional porous film whose main component is thermoplastic resin is prepared by stretching, at a high ratio, thermoplastic resin molded into a sheet-like form. Therefore, it is difficult to prepare a porous layer with a small pore size, a narrow pore diameter distribution, and a large number of pores as in the present embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0085">The pore size in the porous layer is expressed for example as a maximum distance between surfaces of inorganic fine powders and pore walls. The maximum distance between surfaces of the inorganic fine powders and pore walls may be 50 Î¼m or shorter. Thereby, buckling of the porous layer at the time of in-mold molding can be suppressed effectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0086">The maximum distance between surfaces of the inorganic fine powders and pore walls can be determined by observing a cross-section of the film or the porous layer with an electron microscope and performing image analysis of the cross-section image. Specifically, the film is embedded in epoxy resin and solidified, and then is cleaved by using a microtome, for example, in the direction parallel with the thickness direction of the film (that is, in the direction that is vertical to the surface direction). The cleaved surface is metallized, and then is magnified and imaged at a given ratio (for example, 500 to 2000-fold) that makes observation with a scanning electron microscope easy. The obtained image is input to an image analysis device, and subjected to an imaging process, and the maximum distance between surfaces of inorganic fine powders and pore walls is determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0087">(Additives)</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0088">Examples of additives included in the porous layer include dispersant or lubricant, a heat stabilizer, a photo stabilizer, an antistatic agent, or the like. The content of additives in the porous layer may be 0.1 to 5 pts. mass relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. A porous layer with excellent temporal stability can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0089">When the porous layer contains dispersant or lubricant, the content of the dispersant or the lubricant in the porous layer is preferably 0.1 pts. mass or more relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, sufficient functions of dispersant or lubricant can be attained. The content of dispersant or lubricant in the porous layer is preferably 4 pts. mass or less, and more preferably 2 pts. mass or less relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, a porous layer with excellent moldability, printability, and the like can be obtained. Examples of dispersant or lubricant include one or more types selected from a group consisting of a silane coupling agent; C8-C24 fatty acid such as oleic acid or stearic acid, its metal salt, amide, and ester with C1-C6 alcohol; a poly(meta)acrylic acid and its metal salt; and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0090">When the porous layer contains a heat stabilizer, the content of the heat stabilizer in the porous layer is preferably 0.001 pts. mass or more relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, sufficient functions of the heat stabilizer can be attained. The content of a heat stabilizer in the porous layer is preferably 1 pts. mass or less, and more preferably 0.5 pts. mass or less relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, a porous layer with excellent economic efficiency can be obtained. Also, examples of heat stabilizers that improve the external appearance of the thermoplastic resin film include one or more types selected from a group consisting of hindered phenolic, phosphorous, and amine heat stabilizers (which are sometimes referred to as antioxidants).</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0091">When the porous layer contains a photo stabilizer, the content of the photo stabilizer in the porous layer is preferably 0.001 pts. mass or more relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, sufficient functions of the photo stabilizer can be attained. The content of a photo stabilizer in the porous layer is preferably 1 pts. mass or less, and more preferably 0.5 pts. mass or less relative to the total 100 pts. mass of the thermoplastic resin and the inorganic fine powders. Thereby, a porous layer with excellent economic efficiency can be obtained.

A photo stabilizer may be used in combination with the above-described heat stabilizer.</p>

      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0093">In the present embodiment, the adhesion layer is disposed on a surface on the side that contacts a container body at the time of attaching the film to the container body by in-mold molding. When the film is attached to a container body by in-mold molding, a surface of the adhesion layer melts, and is integrated with molten resin of the container body and cooled; thereby, the film is attached to the plastic container.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0094">The adhesion layer is preferably made of a resin composition whose main component is thermoplastic resin having a melting point lower than the melting point of thermoplastic resin included in the porous layer. The difference between the melting point of the thermoplastic resin which is the main component of the adhesion layer and the melting point of the resin composition included in the porous layer is preferably 10Â° C. or larger, and more preferably 15Â° C. or larger. Thereby, deformation of the porous layer can be suppressed at the time of attaching the film to the container body.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0095">The difference between the melting point of the thermoplastic resin which is the main component of the adhesion layer and the melting point of the resin composition included in the porous layer is preferably 150Â° C. or smaller. Thereby, blocking of the film at steps before a film attaching step can be suppressed, and it becomes easy to handle the film. Examples of steps before the film attaching step include a film storage step, a film processing step, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0096">Examples of thermoplastic resin used for the adhesion layer include one or more types selected from a group consisting of: ultralow-density, low-density or mid-density high-pressure processed polyethylene; straight-chain linear low-density polyethylene; ethylene.vinyl acetate copolymers; ethylene.acrylic acid copolymers; ethylene.acrylic acid alkyl ester polymers with a C1-C8 alkyl group; ethylene.methacrylic acid alkyl ester copolymers with a C1-C8 alkyl group; propylene resin represented by propylene.Î± olefin copolymers; polyester resin; styrene elastomer resin; polyamide resin; and the like. The adhesion layer may include straight-chain low-density polyethylene as its main component. Thereby, an adhesion layer with excellent heat-seal adhesive strength can be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0097">The adhesion layer may include other known additives for resin as long as it does not inhibit heat-sealability. Examples of other additives for resin include inorganic pigments, dyes, nucleating agents, plasticizers, mold releasing agents, flame retardants, antioxidants, photo stabilizers, UV absorbers, and the like. The added amount of the other additives for resin is preferably 10 pts. mass or less, and more preferably 5 pts. mass or less relative to the entire adhesion layer. Thereby, a phenomenon in which additives deposit on dies at the time of continuous production of films can be suppressed.</p>

The adhesion layer may be provided, by a coating method, on the porous layer after molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0099">When an adhesion layer is provided by a coating method, in one embodiment, the above-described materials constituting the adhesion layer are dissolved into an organic solvent, coated onto one surface of the porous layer, and then dried. According to another embodiment, aqueous resin emulsion including the above-described materials constituting the adhesion layer is coated onto one surface of the porous layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0100">The above-described aqueous resin emulsion is obtained by a method described in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Publication Nos. S58-118843, S56-2149, S56-106940, S56-157445, or the like. Specifically, first, materials to constitute the adhesion layer (which are sometimes referred to as adhesion layer materials) are supplied to a biaxial screw extruder, and melt-kneaded. Then, water containing dispersion liquid is introduced through a liquid introducing pipe that is provided in a compression area or a vent area of the extruder, and a screw is rotated; thereby; the melted copolymer resin and the water are kneaded. Then, screws within a housing of the extruder are reversed to release the obtained kneaded material through an outlet nozzle of the extruder into the atmospheric area. Water is further added as needed, and the material is housed in a storage tank.</p>

Also, the adhesion layer formed by coating the dispersion liquid tends to have more excellent transparency after the obtained film is attached to a bottle by in-mold molding, that is, in the state of a resin molded article. In order to attain the average particle diameter within the above-described range, dispersant (for example, various types of surfactants) for dispersing the adhesion layer materials may be added.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0102">The average particle diameter of the adhesion layer materials in the aqueous resin emulsion is calculated by the following procedure. First, a sample solution (for example, an olefin resin emulsion solution) is dried under a low temperature, and reduced pressure condition. The sample after drying is magnified at an appropriate magnification (for example, 1,000-fold) by using a scanning electron microscope, and a picture image thereof is taken. Based on the taken image, the average value of particle diameters (major axis) of randomly selected 100 particles present in the sample is calculated. Thereby, the average particle diameter is calculated.</p>

      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0134">In one embodiment, one layer of the thermoplastic resin film is molded by a cast molding method. When required, a multilayer structure laminated body is obtained by stretching a layer that has been obtained by a cast molding method by utilizing different rotational speeds, and then melt-laminating a resin composition to constitute another layer of a film.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0135">[Stretching]</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0136">When any of layers to constitute a film is stretched, the stretching method is not limited to a particular method, but various known methods may be used. Specifically, stretching of each layer may be uniaxial stretching, biaxial stretching, or non-stretching. Also, the stretching direction may be a longitudinal direction or a lateral direction. Furthermore, in a case of biaxial stretching, stretching may be performed simultaneously or sequentially.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0137">When a cast molded film is stretched, examples of stretching methods include a longitudinal stretching method that utilizing different rotational speeds of roller groups, a horizontal stretching method using a tenter oven, a pressure stretching method, and a simultaneous biaxial stretching method using a combination of a tenter oven and a linear motor. Also, methods for stretching an inflation film can be exemplified by a simultaneous biaxial stretching method with a tubular method.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0138">Preferable conditions for stretching a film with a porous layer include a low ratio. Thereby, micropores are formed. When stretching in one direction, the stretching ratio is preferably approximately 1.2 to 8-fold, and more preferably 2 to 5-fold. In a case of biaxial stretching, the stretching ratio is preferably 1.5 to 12-fold in terms of areas, and more preferably 2 to 6-fold. Thereby, it becomes possible to avoid circumstances where pores cannot be obtained because the stretching ratio is too low or where the distribution of pores become uneven.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0139">The stretching temperature is set within a temperature range that is suitable for thermoplastic resin included in the porous layer. In one embodiment, the stretching temperature is set at a temperature which is no less than the glass-transition temperature and no greater than the melting point of the crystal portion. The stretching temperature is preferably 1 to 70Â° C. lower than the melting point. When the main component of the thermoplastic resin included in the porous layer is a propylene homopolymer (melting point=155Â° C. to 167Â° C.), the stretching temperature is preferably 100 to 164Â° C. When the main component of the thermoplastic resin included in the porous layer is high-density polyethylene (melting point=121 to 134Â° C.), the stretching temperature is preferably 70 to 133Â° C. When the main component of the thermoplastic resin included in the porous layer is polyethylene terephthalate (melting point=246 to 252Â° C.), the stretching temperature is preferably a temperature that does not allow rapid crystallization.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0140">The stretch speed is preferably 1 to 350 m/min, and more preferably 5 to 150 m/min. Also, heating treatment is preferably performed after the stretching. The temperature of the heating treatment is preferably no less than the stretching temperature, and no greater than the temperature that is 30Â° C. higher than the stretching temperature. By performing the heating treatment, the heat shrinkage percent in the stretching direction is lowered, and winding/tightening at the time of product storage, lenticulation due to shrinkage at the time of heat and fusion sealing, and the like can be suppressed. The heating treatment may be performed by utilizing at least either one of rollers and a heat oven. The heating treatment is preferably performed in a state where the stretched film is kept tensioned. Thereby, the heating treatment can be performed effectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0141">[Surface Treatment]</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0142">(Oxidation Treatment)</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0143">Oxidation treatment may be performed on surfaces of the film. Surfaces of the film after molding has a comparatively low surface free energy, is hydrophobic, and tends to repel ink or a coating agent. By performing oxidation treatment on the surfaces of the film, the surface free energy of the surfaces of the film can be improved. As a result, the adhesion between at least either one of print ink and various functional material layers formed in post-processing steps (for example, a thermal coloring layer, an ink jet receiving layer, an adhesive agent layer, and a dry laminate layer), and the film can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0144">Oxidation treatment may be performed on a surface on a side that contacts molten resin when the film is attached to a container body by in-mold molding among surfaces that are vertical to the thickness direction of the film (which are sometimes referred to as film surfaces or surfaces of the film). Specifically, when the film has an adhesion layer, oxidation treatment is performed on a side on which the adhesion layer of the porous layer is disposed, among the film surfaces. When the adhesion layer is disposed on the outermost surface of the film, oxidation treatment is performed on the adhesion layer. Also, when the film does not have an adhesion layer, but has a surface layer, oxidation treatment is performed on a surface on the side where a surface layer of the porous layer is not disposed, among the film surfaces. Thereby, the adhesive strength between the film and the container body can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0145">Examples of surface oxidation treatment include corona discharge treatment, flame treatment, plasma treatment, glow discharge treatment, and ozone treatment. As the surface oxidation treatment, corona discharge treatment and plasma treatment are preferably used.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0146">In a case of corona discharge treatment, the oxidation treatment amount is preferably 10 WÂ·min/m<sup>2 </sup>(600 J/m<sup>2</sup>) or more, and more preferably 20 WÂ·min/m<sup>2 </sup>(1,200 J/m<sup>2</sup>) or more. Thereby, sufficient effects can be attained. In a case of corona discharge treatment, the oxidation treatment amount is preferably 200 WÂ·min/m<sup>2 </sup>(12,000 J/m<sup>2</sup>) or less, and more preferably 180 WÂ·min/m<sup>2 </sup>(10,800 J/m<sup>2</sup>) or less. Thereby, degradation of adhesion due to excessive oxidation treatment can be suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0147">(Coating)</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0148">When oxidation treatment is performed on film surfaces, the surface free energy may lower over time, and the adhesion may lower. To cope with this, immediately after the surface oxidation treatment or within one week after the surface oxidation treatment, preferably, a coating step is performed, and a surface coating layer is formed. Examples of coating methods include coating by a die coater, a roller coater, a gravure coater, a spray coater, a blade coater, a reverse coater, an air knife coater, a size press coater, and the like, and immersion and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0149">The coating process may be performed together with film molding in a film molding line, and the coating process may be performed in a line that is different from a film molding line, on a film that is molded in the film molding line. When the molding of a porous layer is performed by a stretching method, the coating step may be performed before the stretching step, and the coating step may be performed after the stretching step. After the coating step, when required, the surface coating layer may be formed by removing extra solvent through a drying step using an oven and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0150">When the thickness of the surface coating layer is too large, aggregation of components of the surface coating layer may occur inside the surface coating layer. As a result, the adhesion between the film and ink or the functional material layer coating solution may lower. To cope with this, the upper limit of the coating amount of the surface coating layer on the film is preferably 20 g/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 5 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and especially preferably 1 g/m<sup>2 </sup>in terms of a solid content after drying per unit area (square meter).</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0151">On the other hand, if the thickness of the surface coating layer is too small, the components of the surface coating layer cannot be present evenly on the film surface; therefore, a sufficient surface treatment effect may be hard to be obtained, or the adhesion between the film and ink or the functional material layer coating solution may lower. To cope with this, the lower limit of the coating amount is preferably 0.07 g/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and especially preferably 0.15 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0152">The coating amount of the surface coating layer is determined according to the following procedure. First, a wet coating amount is computed by subtracting the film mass before coating a coating agent on the film from a wet film mass immediately after coating the coating agent. The wet coating amount is multiplied with the solid content concentration of the coating agent to determine the coating amount in terms of a solid content. Note that however, when required by circumstances, the coating amount after drying may be directly determined by peeling the surface coating layer from the film and measuring the mass of the peeled surface coating layer. Also, the coating amount after drying may be computed by observing a cross-section that is parallel with the thickness direction of the film with a scanning electron microscope to determine the thickness of the surface coating layer, and multiplying the thickness of the surface coating layer with the density of the solid content of the coating agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0153">The surface coating layer may be formed on at least one surface of the film. The surface coating layer may be formed only on a surface, among the film surfaces, on a side where information is printed or where various functional materials are coated in post-processing. The surface coating layer may be formed only on a surface, among the film surfaces, on a side that contacts molten resin when the film is attached to a container body by in-mold molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0154">(Embossing)</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0155">When attaching the film according to the present invention to a plastic container by in-mold molding, contacting surfaces of the film and the plastic container preferably have lower smoothness. For this purpose, embossing may be performed. Embossing uses a rubber roll that faces an engraved metallic roll. Embossing may be performed before stretching at the time of film manufacturing or may be performed after the stretching. Also, an embossed adhesion layer can be obtained by a method of attaching a pre-embossed film to a porous layer. Patterns of embossing are preferably patterns that have continuous grooves that are obtained by using embossing rolls that are engraved with non-continuous concaved portions, or ridge line patterns that are obtained by using embossing rolls having 50 to 300 lines of grooves.</p>

The film thickness D is preferably 20 Î¼m or larger, more preferably 40 Î¼m or larger, and further preferably 60 Î¼m or larger. Thereby, when the film is to be attached to a container body by in-mold molding, and the film is inserted inside a mold by using a label inserter, the film can be placed at an appropriate position more easily. Also, occurrence of wrinkles of the film can be suppressed.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0160">The film thickness D is preferably 250 Î¼m or smaller, and more preferably 200 Î¼m or smaller. Thereby, occurrence of a gap between the film and the container body or a thin portion of the container body can be suppressed. As a result, the durability of the molded body when dropped can be improved. Also, the processing cost of a mold can be lowered.</p>

When a film consists only of a porous layer, the film density is preferably 0.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher, and more preferably 0.6 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or higher. Thereby, the surface strength of a label can be maintained. Also, the film density is preferably 1.3 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower, and more preferably 1.0 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or lower. Thereby, IML adhesion (heat seal strength) can be provided to a film.</p>

Thereby, an amount of heat received by the film from molten resin at the time of in-mold molding to flow out to the outside of the film can be suppressed. As a result, because thermoplastic resin included in a layer, among the film surfaces, that is disposed on a side that contacts a container body can be sufficiently melted, occurrence of blisters can be suppressed.</p>

Note that when the density Ï of a porous layer included in a film is determined by using the film that is attached to a labeled plastic container as a sample, the density p of the porous layer is determined by the following procedure. First, a film including a porous layer is taken away from a labeled plastic container by cleaving and the like. Next, the porous layer is peeled away from the film that has been taken away, and a sample for density measurement is obtained.

The area ratios of the respective parts in an image may be alternatively used in place of the above-described volume ratio. Next, values obtained by multiplying the volume ratios of the respective parts of the porous layer by the density of the respective parts are combined to determine the density Ï of the porous layer. For example, the density Ï of the porous layer is determined by combining: a value obtained by multiplying the volume ratio of the thermoplastic resin by the density of the thermoplastic resin; a value obtained by multiplying the volume ratio of the inorganic fine powders by the density of the density of the inorganic fine powders; and a value obtained by multiplying the volume ratio of the pores by the density of the pores.</p>

Inorganic fine powders are assumed to function as nuclei for pore formation, and the higher the content of the inorganic fine powders in a porous layer is, the larger the number of nuclei for pore formation is. When the number of nuclei for pore formation is increased, the number of pores after stretching increases, and the heat insulating property of a porous layer is improved.

Note that measurement of wet tension is judged by dropping liquid mixture for a wet tension test onto a film, spreading the liquid on the film with a No. 2 wire bar, and examining the state of droplets after two seconds.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0199">(Surface Resistivity)</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0200">The surface resistivity R<sub>5 </sub>at 23Â° C. 50% RH is determined according to surface resistivity of JIS K6911: 1995 âTesting methods for thermosetting plasticsâ. The surface resistivity of at least either one of film surfaces is preferably 1Ã10<sup>8 </sup>to 1Ã10<sup>12</sup>Î©. Thereby, charging of a film can be prevented. When the surface resistivity is within the above-described range, a film that has an excellent antistatic property and offset printability can be obtained. At least either one of film surfaces may be a surface subjected to surface treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0201">When a film is placed inside a mold, an electrostatic charge label inserter is used in some cases. An electrostatic charge label inserter uses a DC high voltage generator to generate static electricity on a surface, among the film surfaces, that contacts a container body, and fix the film on a mold by electrostatic suction. When an electrostatic charge inserter is used, the surface resistivity of a surface, among the film surfaces, that is on a side that contacts a container body is preferably 1Ã10<sup>12</sup>Î© or higher.</p>

      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0203">[Printing]</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0204">Information may be printed on a film. Information may be printed on a surface of a layer, among layers included in a film, that is disposed on a side of one surface of a porous layer. Information may be printed on a surface of a layer, among layers included in a film, that is disposed on a side of a porous layer in which an adhesion layer is not disposed. Information may be printed on a film by a printing method such as gravure printing, flexography, letter press printing, screen printing, and an electrophotographic recording method. When a printing method such as an ink-jet recording method, a thermal transfer recording method, and a pressure sensitive transfer recording method is used, a known receiving layer that is suited to the respective printing methods may be further provided on a film surface. Gravure printing, an ink-jet recording method, and an electrophotographic recording method are excellent in fineness. Letter press printing and flexography can cope with small lot printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0205">In a case of offset printing, when wetting of water on a film surface is too good, ink yields to water more easily, and ink transfer becomes more difficult. Therefore, it is not suited to certain pictures. On the other hand, when wetting of water on a film surface is too bad, ink attaches to non-printed portion of offset printing, and scrumming may occur. To cope with this, a surface coating layer may be formed on a film surface on which information is to be printed to control water contact angles on a film surface to be within an appropriate range. Thereby, offset printing becomes favorable. The same applies to the surface free energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0206">Ink to be used in printing may be oil-based ink or ultraviolet-curable ink. In terms of rubfastness, ultraviolet-curable ink is preferably used. Ultraviolet-curable ink is dry-solidified by ultraviolet irradiation. Ultraviolet irradiation methods are not limited as long as they can cure ultraviolet-curable ink, and examples thereof include irradiating ultraviolet light irradiated from, for example, metal halide lamp (200 to 400 nm), low-pressure mercury lamp (180 to 250 nm), high-pressure mercury lamp (250 to 365 nm), black light (350 to 360 nm), or UV-LED lamp (355 to 375 nm) with an irradiation amount of 300 to 3000 m J/cm<sup>2</sup>, preferably 400 to 1000 m J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0210">The entire film thickness D obtained in sheet molding examples was measured by using a constant pressure thickness gauge (manufactured by TECLOCK Corporation, equipment name: PG-01J) based on JIS K 7130: 1999 âPlasticsâFilm and sheetingâDetermination of thicknessâ. Also, the thickness of each layer in a film obtained in sheet molding examples was measured by the following procedure. First, a measurement target sample was cooled to a temperature no greater than â60Â° C. by using liquid nitrogen. Next, the measurement target sample after cooling was placed on a glass plate, and cleaved by pressing a razor blade (manufactured by Schick Japan K.K., product name; Proline Blade) at a right angle against the measurement target sample to prepare a sample for cross-section measurement. Next, the cross-section of the sample for cross-section measurement was observed by using a scanning electron microscope (manufactured by JEOL Ltd., equipment name: JSM-6490), borders were identified in the observed image, and the ratio of the layer thickness to be the measurement target relative to the entire film thickness D was determined. Thereafter, the layer thickness to be the measurement target was determined by multiplying the entire thickness D with the above-described ratio that was determined by observation of the sample for cross-section measurement.</p>

      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0212">A film obtained in each example or comparative example was divided into small pieces each with 150 mm width to prepare slit-like samples. Text information such as a product name, a manufacturer, a sales company name, a use method, and cautions, and a picture including a barcode and a design are printed on one surfaces of the slit-like samples by using flexography equipment (product name âTCLâ, manufactured by TAIYO KIKAI Ltd.), and ultraviolet curable flexography ink (product name âUV Flexographic CFâ, manufactured by T&amp;K TOKA Corporation). Four-color printing was performed. The printing was performed in an environment where the temperature was 23Â° C. and the relative humidity was 50%. Also, the print speed was 60 m/min. Next, the sample after printing was caused to pass under a ultraviolet curing unit (metal halide lamp, 100 W/cm, single lamp, manufactured by EYE GRAPHICS Co., Ltd.) at the speed of 60 m/min, and ink on a printing surface was dried to prepare a sample for evaluation.</p>

      <p id="p-00328-en" num="0314">It can be known, from the results of Examples 1 to 12, that a film could be obtained in which 25 to 65 pts. mass of thermoplastic resin and 35 to 75 pts. mass of inorganic fine powders are included (the total of the two components equals 100 pts. mass), and a porous layer with a pore length L of 20 Î¼m or longer is included so that good adhesion is observed in in-mold molding, and orange peel is rarely observed. Assumingly, this is because discharge of heat from a parison through a label to a mold is suppressed in in-mold molding. Also, it can be known that the pore length L of a porous layer can be adjusted by suppressing the stretching ratio at the time of molding.</p>
      <p id="p-00329-en" num="0315">On the other hand, assumingly, judging from the results of Examples 7 and 8, and Comparative Examples 3 and 4, a thickness is not related to orange peel that occurs at the time of in-mold molding, but the stretching ratio has a significant influence and the pore size has an influence on it. Assumingly, a large number of small sized pores is included in the porous layer, and this makes buckling of the porous layer hard to occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00330-en" num="0316">Also, by adjusting the melting point of thermoplastic resin included in the outermost surface of the plastic container and the melting point of thermoplastic resin included in a layer of a film that contacts the plastic container to satisfy a specific relationship, a labeled plastic container that has an excellent label adhesion property could be obtained, even without providing an adhesion layer. Also, printability could be attained by increasing wet tension by corona discharge, and further by providing an appropriate surface coating layer, a film that has an excellent surface antistatic property and the like and can maintain good printability could be obtained.</p>
      <heading id="h-00026-en" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
      <p id="p-00331-en" num="0317">Because a film having a high porosity and small and uniform pore sizes was obtained according to the present invention, a labeled plastic container could be obtained with which high adhesive force could be attained even under conditions of lower parison temperature at the time of in-mold molding, and in which occurrence of orange peel was very rare. Therefore, the present invention is suited to manufacturing of a labeled plastic container formed by attaching a thermoplastic resin film. Also, printability can be provided by appropriate surface treatment, and when a film is processed, handling defects due to static electricity can be suppressed. Therefore, the present invention is also suited to uses in printing paper, labels, and the like.</p>
