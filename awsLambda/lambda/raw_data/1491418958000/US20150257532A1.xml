      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/952,525, filed on Mar. 13, 2014 by Corbo et al. for a âRack Frame Assembly,â the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein.</p>
    </related-apps>
    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The invention relates to an improved metal rack frame assembly for electronics equipment that facilitates assembly of the frame. Most frame assemblies include a top shelf, a base, and four vertical support rails that are screwed into the top and base through the use of generally 32 screws and multiple components, which makes assembly time consuming. The present invention reduces the screws down to 8 through a uniquely designed set of components.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">One aspect of the invention provides an assembly for a frame, comprising an end unit comprising an end wall, a first side wall extending perpendicularly from the end wall, and a second side wall extending perpendicularly from the end wall and forming a corner with the first side wall; and an elongate rail, comprising a first flange and a second flange together forming an L-shaped cross section. In a first position one end of the rail is seated in the corner, with an end face of the rail against the end wall, the first flange flat against the first side wall, and the second flange flat against the second side wall.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">As shown in the figures, the assembly <b>10</b> includes a top shelf <b>12</b>, a base <b>14</b>, and four or more vertical rails <b>16</b>. Each end of each vertical rail attaches to the top shelf with one pin, which in this embodiment is in the form of a screw or bolt <b>18</b> and the base with one pin, which in this embodiment is in the form of a screw or bolt <b>18</b>. The top shelf <b>12</b> includes a top wall <b>20</b>, and four side walls <b>22</b> that generally project downward from the top wall <b>20</b>. For simplicity the top side walls <b>22</b> are referenced as <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, <b>22</b>D in the figures. Similarly, the base includes a bottom wall <b>24</b> and four side walls <b>26</b> that generally project upward from the bottom wall <b>24</b>. As shown for the bottom wall <b>24</b> in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, either or both of the top and bottom walls <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> may be in the form of a planar flange surrounding an opening. For simplicity, the base side walls <b>26</b> are referenced as <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>C, <b>26</b>D in the figures. As may be seen from the drawings, the top wall <b>20</b> and the top side walls <b>22</b> may be formed from a single piece of sheet metal or other suitable material. Similarly, the bottom wall <b>24</b> and the base side walls <b>26</b> may be formed from a single piece of sheet metal or other suitable material.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">At least two of the side walls <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C on the top shelf and two of the side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C of the base include at least one or more inwardly projecting protrusions or stubs <b>28</b> on each end of the side walls <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>C, <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C. For simplicity, the following description will refer to the components on the base <b>14</b>. However, it is intended that the same connection can also be used on the top shelf <b>12</b>. The protrusions <b>28</b> are preferably formed as an inwardly pressed piece of the side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C. Preferably there are two protrusions <b>28</b> on each end of the side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C. The protrusions <b>28</b> are spaced from the end of the side wall a sufficient distance to receive a first side flange <b>30</b> of one vertical rail <b>16</b> so as to laterally restrict movement of the rail in the plane of the side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">A second side flange <b>34</b> of the vertical rail <b>16</b> is positioned against an adjacent side wall <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>D. More particularly, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the bottom wall <b>24</b> projects outwards beyond the rails <b>16</b>. A vertical first web forming the first part of the adjacent side wall <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>D rises from the outer edge of the bottom wall <b>24</b>. The adjacent side wall <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>D preferably includes a flange or second web <b>36</b> extending inwards from the top of the first web, parallel to the plane of the bottom wall <b>24</b>. At the inner end of the second web <b>36</b> is a vertical flange or third web <b>38</b> against which the second side flange <b>32</b> of the vertical rail <b>16</b> rests. The top shelf <b>12</b> has a similar projection. The projections permit a door or cover panel (not shown) to be installed, with the outer face of the door flush with the vertical first webs. The projections may be provided on only one side of the frame assembly or, as shown in the drawings, on two opposite sides.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">A screw or bolt <b>18</b> attaches the vertical flange <b>36</b> to the third web <b>38</b> of the second side flange <b>32</b>. Thus, side walls <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>D and the protrusions <b>28</b> prevent any lateral movement of the vertical rails along the plane of side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C, and the screw or bolt <b>18</b> and side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C prevent any lateral movement of the vertical rails <b>16</b> along the plane of side walls <b>26</b>B, <b>26</b>D. The screw or bolt <b>18</b> also prevents the removal of the rail from the top/base.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">To further secure the rails <b>16</b> to the base <b>14</b>, the side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C include tabs <b>40</b> that extend inward from the side walls <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C and include a joggled portion that is bent upward as shown (the tabs on the top shelf which are shown in less detail in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are, of course, bent downward). The tabs <b>40</b> are preferably formed from a punched section of the side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C. The tabs <b>40</b> are spaced away from the side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C a sufficient distance to receive the first side flange <b>30</b> of the rail <b>16</b>. As shown, the first side flange <b>30</b> includes one or more slots <b>42</b> which are cut into the rail <b>16</b> and are sized to receive the tabs <b>40</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, there are two tabs <b>40</b> located at each end of each side wall <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>C of the base. The first side flange <b>30</b> of each rail <b>16</b> has at least two slots <b>42</b> formed at each end and that are vertically spaced and aligned with each other and configured to engage with the tabs <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">While one corner is shown in the figures, it should be readily apparent that all four corners of the base and the top would preferably have similar features, assembled in the similar manner.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">To assemble the frame, the slots <b>42</b> in a rail <b>16</b> are aligned with the tabs <b>40</b> in the side wall <b>26</b>A and then the rail is slid downward so that the tabs engage the first side flange <b>30</b>. A screw or bolt <b>18</b> is then placed through a hole <b>44</b> in the vertical flange <b>38</b> to secure the vertical flange <b>38</b> of the side wall <b>26</b>B to the second side flange <b>34</b> of the vertical rail <b>16</b>. This is repeated with the remaining three vertical rails <b>16</b> on the base <b>24</b>. The top shelf <b>12</b> is then attached in a similar fashion to the other end of the vertical rails <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Thus the entire rack frame assembly <b>10</b> consists of six components <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> and eight screws <b>18</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">While the invention has been disclosed with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous modifications, alterations, and changes to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the sphere and scope of the invention, as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but that it have the full scope defined by the language of the following claims.</p>
