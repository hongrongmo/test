      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to aerosol delivery devices such as smoking articles, and more particularly to an aerosol delivery device and related methods and computer program products for controlling an aerosol delivery device based at least in part on input characteristics. The smoking articles may be configured to heat a material, which may be made or derived from tobacco or otherwise incorporate tobacco, to form an inhalable substance for human consumption.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Many smoking devices have been proposed through the years as improvements upon, or alternatives to, smoking products that require combusting tobacco for use. Many of those devices purportedly have been designed to provide the sensations associated with cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking, but without delivering considerable quantities of incomplete combustion and pyrolysis products that result from the burning of tobacco. To this end, there have been proposed numerous smoking products, flavor generators, and medicinal inhalers that utilize electrical energy to vaporize or heat a volatile material, or attempt to provide the sensations of cigarette, cigar, or pipe smoking without burning tobacco to a significant degree. See, for example, the various alternative smoking articles, aerosol delivery devices and heat generating sources set forth in the background art described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,726,320 to Robinson et al., U.S. Pat. U.S. App. Pub. No. 2013/0255702 to Griffith, Jr. et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2014/0000638 to Sebastian et al., U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2014/0060554 to Collett et al., and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/647,000, filed Oct. 8, 2012, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Ongoing developments in the field of aerosol delivery devices have resulted in increasingly sophisticated aerosol delivery devices. However, due to factors such as form factor, many aerosol delivery devices have relatively limited user interface mechanisms via which control inputs may be provided by a user. As such, the provision of control inputs to control various device functions and settings continues to be problematic.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to an aerosol delivery device and related methods and computer program products for controlling an aerosol delivery device based at least in part on input characteristics.

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof. These exemplary embodiments are described so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Indeed, the disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. As used in the specification, and in the appended claims, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ, âtheâ, include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Some example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an aerosol delivery device and related methods and computer program products for controlling an aerosol delivery device based at least in part on input characteristics. Aerosol delivery devices (e.g., smoking articles) that may be used with various example embodiments may, by way of non-limiting example, include so-called âe-cigarettes.â It should be understood that the mechanisms, components, features, and methods associated with such aerosol delivery devices may be embodied in many different forms and associated with a variety of articles.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In this regard, the present disclosure provides descriptions of aerosol delivery devices that use electrical energy to heat a material (preferably without combusting the material to any significant degree) to form an inhalable substance; such articles most preferably being sufficiently compact to be considered âhand-heldâ devices. An aerosol delivery device may provide some or all of the sensations (e.g., inhalation and exhalation rituals, types of tastes or flavors, organoleptic effects, physical feel, use rituals, visual cues such as those provided by visible aerosol, and the like) of smoking a cigarette, cigar, or pipe, without any substantial degree of combustion of any component of that article or device. The aerosol delivery device may not produce smoke in the sense of the aerosol resulting from by-products of combustion or pyrolysis of tobacco, but rather, that the article or device may yield vapors (including vapors within aerosols that can be considered to be visible aerosols that might be considered to be described as smoke-like) resulting from volatilization or vaporization of certain components of the article or device. In highly preferred embodiments, aerosol delivery devices may incorporate tobacco and/or components derived from tobacco.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Aerosol delivery devices of the present disclosure also can be characterized as being vapor-producing articles, smoking articles, or medicament delivery articles. Thus, such articles or devices can be adapted so as to provide one or more substances (e.g., flavors and/or pharmaceutical active ingredients) in an inhalable form or state. For example, inhalable substances can be substantially in the form of a vapor (i.e., a substance that is in the gas phase at a temperature lower than its critical point). Alternatively, inhalable substances can be in the form of an aerosol (i.e., a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in a gas). For purposes of simplicity, the term âaerosolâ as used herein is meant to include vapors, gases and aerosols of a form or type suitable for human inhalation, whether or not visible, and whether or not of a form that might be considered to be smoke-like.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In use, aerosol delivery devices of the present disclosure may be subjected to many of the physical actions employed by an individual in using a traditional type of smoking article (e.g., a cigarette, cigar or pipe that is employed by lighting and inhaling tobacco). For example, the user of an aerosol delivery device of the present disclosure can hold that article much like a traditional type of smoking article, draw on one end of that article for inhalation of aerosol produced by that article, take puffs at selected intervals of time, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Aerosol delivery devices of the present disclosure generally include a number of components provided within an outer body or shell. The overall design of the outer body or shell can vary, and the format or configuration of the outer body that can define the overall size and shape of the aerosol delivery device can vary. Typically, an elongated body resembling the shape of a cigarette or cigar can be a formed from a single, unitary shell; or the elongated body can be formed of two or more separable pieces. For example, an aerosol delivery device can comprise an elongated shell or body that can be substantially tubular in shape and, as such, resemble the shape of a conventional cigarette or cigar. In one embodiment, all of the components of the aerosol delivery device are contained within one outer body or shell. Alternatively, an aerosol delivery device can comprise two or more shells that are joined and are separable. For example, an aerosol delivery device can possess at one end a control body comprising an outer body or shell containing one or more reusable components (e.g., a rechargeable battery and various electronics for controlling the operation of that article), and at the other end and removably attached thereto an outer body or shell containing a disposable portion (e.g., a disposable flavor-containing cartridge). More specific formats, configurations and arrangements of components within the single shell type of unit or within a multi-piece separable shell type of unit will be evident in light of the further disclosure provided herein. Additionally, various aerosol delivery device designs and component arrangements can be appreciated upon consideration of the commercially available electronic aerosol delivery devices, such as those representative products listed in the background art section of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Aerosol delivery devices of the present disclosure most preferably comprise some combination of a power source (e.g., an electrical power source), at least one control component (e.g., means for actuating, controlling, regulating and ceasing power for heat generation, such as by controlling electrical current flow the power source to other components of the articleâe.g., a microcontroller), a heater or heat generation component (e.g., an electrical resistance heating element or component commonly referred to as an âatomizerâ), an aerosol precursor composition (e.g., commonly a liquid capable of yielding an aerosol upon application of sufficient heat, such as ingredients commonly referred to as âsmoke juice,â âe-liquidâ and âe-juiceâ), and a mouthend region or tip for allowing draw upon the aerosol delivery device for aerosol inhalation (e.g., a defined air flow path through the article such that aerosol generated can be withdrawn therefrom upon draw). Exemplary formulations for aerosol precursor materials that may be used according to the present disclosure are described in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2013/0008457 to Zheng et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Alignment of the components within the aerosol delivery device can vary. In specific embodiments, the aerosol precursor composition can be located near an end of the article (e.g., within a cartridge, which in certain circumstances can be replaceable and disposable), which may be proximal to the mouth of a user so as to maximize aerosol delivery to the user. Other configurations, however, are not excluded. Generally, the heating element can be positioned sufficiently near the aerosol precursor composition so that heat from the heating element can volatilize the aerosol precursor (as well as one or more flavorants, medicaments, or the like that may likewise be provided for delivery to a user) and form an aerosol for delivery to the user. When the heating element heats the aerosol precursor composition, an aerosol is formed, released, or generated in a physical form suitable for inhalation by a consumer. It should be noted that the foregoing terms are meant to be interchangeable such that reference to release, releasing, releases, or released includes form or generate, forming or generating, forms or generates, and formed or generated. Specifically, an inhalable substance is released in the form of a vapor or aerosol or mixture thereof. Additionally, the selection of various aerosol delivery device components can be appreciated upon consideration of the commercially available electronic aerosol delivery devices, such as those representative products listed in the background art section of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">An aerosol delivery device incorporates a battery or other electrical power source to provide current flow sufficient to provide various functionalities to the article, such as resistive heating, powering of control systems, powering of indicators, and the like. The power source can take on various embodiments. Preferably, the power source is able to deliver sufficient power to rapidly heat the heating member to provide for aerosol formation and power the article through use for the desired duration of time. The power source preferably is sized to fit conveniently within the aerosol delivery device so that the aerosol delivery device can be easily handled; and additionally, a preferred power source is of a sufficiently light weight to not detract from a desirable smoking experience.</p>

For example, in some embodiments, a puff input to an aerosol delivery device may be leveraged to perform one or more control functions beyond triggering the heating of aerosol precursor composition to form an inhalable substance depending on a characteristic of the puff input.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Some example embodiments may accordingly be used to increase the number of control inputs that may be provided to an aerosol delivery device, thus providing users with a finer level of control over device functionality without adding additional input mechanisms to an aerosol delivery device. This diversification of control inputs that may be provided by a given input mechanism may thus provide a user with additional control over an aerosol delivery device without necessitating the addition of further input mechanisms to the aerosol delivery device, which may be cost prohibitive and/or result in an undesirable device form factor.</p>

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">In some example embodiments, the apparatus <b>300</b> may further include the user interface <b>316</b>. The user interface <b>316</b> may be in communication with the processing circuitry <b>310</b> to receive an indication of a user input and/or to provide an audible, visual, mechanical, or other output to a user. For example, the user interface <b>316</b> may include one or more buttons, keys, and/or other input mechanisms to enable a user to control operation of an aerosol delivery device.

In some example embodiments, the sensor <b>318</b> may be configured to detect a reverse puff, which may be characterized by an air flow change and/or pressure change that is a reverse of that associated with a puff drawing in air to inhale vaporized aerosol precursor composition. A reverse puff may, for example, be triggered by a user blowing into a mouthend of an aerosol delivery device rather than drawing. As another example, a reverse puff may be triggered by a user drawing on an air intake, such as air intake <b>118</b>, to cause airflow to flow reverse of a direction associated with airflow when a user draws on a mouthend. In some example embodiments, the sensor(s) <b>318</b> may additionally or alternatively include one or more motion sensor, which may be configured to motion and/or changes in orientation of an aerosol delivery device that may result from manipulation of the aerosol delivery device.

The control module <b>320</b> may be further configured to determine a type of the manipulation. For example, a manipulation type may include rotation of the aerosol delivery; shaking the aerosol delivery device; tilting the aerosol delivery device; performing a simulated ashing manipulation, such as by tapping and/or flicking the aerosol delivery device (e.g., as if ashing a regular cigarette); and/or other manipulation of the aerosol delivery device. In this regard, a manipulation type may be considered a characteristic of a manipulation that may be determined based at least in part on one or more further characteristics of the manipulation that may be detected based at least in part on data from a motion sensor. For example, a shaking manipulation may be characterized by a repeated series of accelerations and decelerations in substantially opposing directions on a plane.

The control module <b>320</b> may accordingly configured to determine a control function having a defined association with a characteristic(s) of a received user input to an aerosol delivery device. For example, some embodiments may utilize a database and/or other data structure, which may store a library of control functions and respective associated user input characteristics. In this regard, given a determined characteristic of a user input, the control module <b>320</b> of some example embodiments may be configured to look up the characteristic in the data structure and determine a control function having a defined association with the characteristic.</p>

Additionally or alternatively, as another example, haptic feedback (e.g., for various event notifications) can be activated/deactivated based on characteristics of a user input in accordance with some example embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As a further example, a heating profile configuration setting may be modified. As another example, modification of a configuration setting may comprise modifying an aerosol precursor composition vaporization setting, such as a configuration defining an amount of aerosol precursor composition that is vaporized per puff, and/or other configuration setting that may relate to the vaporization of aerosol precursor composition. As still a further example, modification of a configuration setting may comprise modifying a puff control setting, such as a number of puffs that are allowed within a period of time and/or for a single smoking session, a minimum interval of time that must elapse between puffs, and/or other setting that may govern device behavior with respect to user puffs. In some embodiments, a battery management setting, such as a configuration relating to charging of a battery and/or a configuration that may regulate consumption of the battery, may be modified.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">As an additional example, the control module <b>320</b> may be configured to activate/deactivate a wireless communication interface that may be implemented on an aerosol delivery device in response to a user input having a particular characteristic(s). For example, an aerosol delivery device in accordance with some example embodiments may implement one or more wireless communication interfaces that may enable the aerosol delivery device to communicate data to and/or receive data from another device. For example, the aerosol delivery device of some embodiments may include a Bluetooth interface, Near Field Communication (NFC) interface, an infrared (IR) interface, a Wi-Fi interface, and/or other wireless communication interface. In such embodiments, a wireless communication interface(s) may be activated/deactivated in response to a user input having a particular characteristic(s).</p>

For example, if the user input was a puff input, the control function may be a function other than heating aerosol precursor composition to form an inhalable substance. As another example, if the user input included actuation of a button used for toggling a power state (e.g., on/off) of the aerosol delivery device, the control function may comprise a control function other than toggling the power state. In some such example embodiments, a characteristic of the user input may be used by the control module <b>320</b> to determine that a control function other than a default function associated with the input mechanism should be performed. As a non-limiting example, if a puff input is comprised of a sequence of one or more short draws (e.g., puffs having less than a defined duration) is received, the control module <b>320</b> may determine that a control function other than and/or in addition to heating aerosol precursor composition to form an inhalable substance should be performed, and may determine and perform the associated control function.</p>

For example, manipulation by rotating and/or tilting the aerosol delivery device in a first direction may be used to increase an amount of aerosol precursor composition vaporized per puff, while rotating and/or tilting the aerosol delivery device in a second direction may be used to decrease the amount of aerosol precursor composition vaporized per puff. As another example, manipulation involving an angular displacement exceeding a threshold may be used to increase the amount of precursor composition vaporized per puff, while manipulation involving an angular displacement that does not exceed the threshold may be used to decrease the amount of aerosol precursor composition vaporized per puff.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">The aerosol delivery device of some example embodiments may be toggled between different control modes. For example, an aerosol delivery device may be operated in a first control mode in which a user input via an input mechanism may result in performance of a default function associated with the input mechanism, or may be operated in a second control mode in which an alternate control function may be performed based at least in part on a characteristic of the user input, such as in accordance with one or more of the methods of <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>. As a more particular example of some such embodiments, a puff input may be used to trigger heating of aerosol precursor composition to form an inhalable substance when operating in a first control mode, while an alternate control function other than heating aerosol precursor composition may be performed in response to a puff input when operating in a second control mode. For example, a user input, such as actuation of a button may be performed prior to and/or contemporaneously with a user input, such as a puff input or manipulation, to trigger activation of an alternate control mode that may be used to perform a control function based at least in part on a characteristic of the user input in accordance with one or more of the methods of <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a flowchart according to an example method for changing a control mode for an aerosol delivery device in accordance with some such example embodiments. One or more of processing circuitry <b>310</b>, processor <b>312</b>, memory <b>314</b>, user interface <b>316</b>, sensor(s) <b>318</b>, or control module <b>320</b> may, for example, provide means for performing one or more of the operations illustrated in and described with respect to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">Operation <b>700</b> may comprise an aerosol delivery device receiving a user input to change a control mode to an alternate control mode. Operation <b>710</b> may comprise changing the control mode to the alternate control mode in response to the user input.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">It will be appreciated that the method of <figref>FIG. 7</figref> may be applied in combination with any one or more of the methods of <figref>FIGS. 4-6</figref>. For example, if applied in combination with the method of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the puff input that may be sensed in operation <b>500</b> may result in heating of aerosol precursor composition to form an inhalable substance and operations <b>510</b>-<b>530</b> may be omitted if the aerosol delivery device is not operating in the alternate control mode. However, if operating in the alternate control mode as a result of operations <b>700</b>-<b>710</b>, operations <b>510</b>-<b>530</b> may be performed in response to the puff input.</p>
