    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention pertains to hydrometallurgical processes in which lixiviant leaching is used to extract valuable metals from ore and tailings. In particular, it pertains to improving such processes via appropriate use of nanofiltration.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Hydrometallurgical processes are commonly used to obtain valuable base metals as well as other metals from ores and tailings containing these metals. Several major operations are typically involved in such processes. Initially, a leaching of the crushed ore or tailings is performed using a lixiviant (e.g. using an aqueous acidic solution such as sulphuric acid solution) to dissolve the metal content from crushed ore or tailings and provide a leach solution comprising the desired metal or metals. The leach solution of course generally also comprises unwanted liquid and solid impurities which are desirably removed. Further, the leach solution is generally quite dilute. Thus, solution concentration and purification operations are performed to produce a more concentrated, purified solution known in the art as pregnant solution stream. Finally then, operations are performed to recover the desired metals from the pregnant solution stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A variety of lixiviants may be considered for such hydrometallurgical processing and the selection depends on the metal to be extracted and the type of ore or tailings involved. Aqueous acid solutions are perhaps most commonly employed as lixiviants and include solutions of such acids as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid. Further, various arrangements are commonly considered in order to accomplish the leaching process including heap leaching, dump leaching, tank leaching and in-situ leaching arrangements.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">The chemistries and equipment involved in the solution concentration and purification operations can also be quite diverse and depend on the metals and ores or tailings involved. However, a solvent extraction step is frequently employed in which an organic solvent is used to selectively extract the desired metal content from the impure leach solution to the organic phase. This is followed by a stripping of the desired metal content from the organic phase using strong acid to produce the pregnant solution stream which is a strong electrolyte or concentrated metal solution. The solvent extraction step also results in a raffinate stream or waste stream which is an aqueous solution containing low metal content with appreciable amount of residual acidity and traces of organics. The raffinate stream is commonly divided into two portions in which one portion is recycled to the leaching circuit and the other is sent to neutralization where it is treated with lime to neutralize the acidity and to precipitate the metal contents prior to discharge as effluent in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The metal recovery operations separate the desired metals from the concentrated pregnant solution stream. Typical metal recovery processes include electrolytic processing (e.g. âelectrowinningâ or âelectrorefiningâ), chemical precipitation, and gaseous reduction. In operations involving electrolytic processing, the pregnant solution stream serves as electrolyte in the associated electrolysis. There is generally a need to continuously bleed a proportion of the tankhouse inventory however, as âspent electrolyteâ, in order to prevent excess build-up of contaminants transferred from the primary leach solution and to maintain the purity of the recovered metal product. This bleed stream is commonly âdisposed ofâ in several ways: (i) is added to the primary feed of the solvent extracting circuit where the desired metal is recovered and sent around again to the electrolytic operation; (ii) is taken directly back to the leaching circuit and cycles back through an even longer path; and/or (iii) is sent as a purge stream for metal recovery and acid neutralization prior to disposal as effluent.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">There are therefore two major effluent streams that are typically generated in hydrometallurgical processes that need to be managed properly. These are the spent electrolyte stream in processes involving electrolytic processing and the raffinate stream in processes involving solvent extraction. While the common chemical (lime) treatment of the raffinate stream meets environmental standards, it unfortunately involves a series of complex precipitation and separation steps which are not only expensive to set up and operate but also which generate a large amount of gypsum solids that are often classified as hazardous materials due to its heavy metal contents and thus must be properly disposed of. Further, the acid content in the raffinate is lost and yet this is preferably recovered instead. As for spent electrolyte streams, recycling them in whole or in great part to the leaching circuit would likely overload the circuit and negatively impact the overall leaching efficiency due to its high acid and metal concentration. Further, sending them in the whole or great part to the stripping operation in a solvent extracting circuit would also affect the stripping efficiency as well as increase the capacity requirement of the overall solvent extracting circuit. And purging a side stream of spent electrolyte to metals recovery and neutralization processes would increase acid losses as well as lime consumption. There is therefore a need to better handle such effluent streams in hydrometallurgical processes. The present invention addresses this need and provides other benefits as disclosed below.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Nanofiltration is an example of a pressure driven membrane separation process in which organic molecules or inorganic ionic solutes in aqueous solutions are concentrated or separated to various degrees by the application of a positive osmotic pressure to one side of a filtration membrane. Such a pressure driven membrane process employs a cross-flow mode of operation in which only a portion of a feed stream solution is collected as a permeate solution and the rest is collected as a retentate solution. Thus, in a nanofiltration module, the exiting process stream which has not passed through the nanofiltration membrane is referred to as the âretentateâ stream and the exiting process stream which has passed through the membrane is referred to as the âpermeateâ stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">NF membranes reject ionic species according to the charge density of the ions and the surface charges of the membrane. Accordingly, divalent anions, such as SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2â</sup>, are more strongly rejected than monovalent ones, such as Cl<sup>â</sup>, and divalent cations, such as Cu<sup>2+</sup>, are more strongly rejected than monovalent ones, such as Na<sup>+</sup>. And therefore, nanofiltration can be particularly suitable for processes requiring separation of multivalent anions from monovalent ones.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Commercial NF membranes are available from known suppliers of reverse osmosis and other pressure driven membranes. The NF membranes are, typically, packaged as membrane modules. A so-called âspiral woundâ module is most popular, but other membrane module configurations, such as tubular membranes enclosed in a shell or plate- and-frame type, are also known.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">During the NF process, a minimum pressure equal to the osmotic pressure difference between the feed/retentate liquor on one side and the permeate liquor on the other side of the membrane must be applied since osmotic pressure is a function of the ionic strengths of the two streams. In the case of separation of a multivalent solute, e.g. Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, from a monovalent one, e.g. NaCl, the osmotic pressure difference is moderated by the low NaCl rejection. Usually, a pressure in excess of the osmotic pressure difference is employed to achieve practical permeate flux.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Use of multiple nanofiltration subsystems which have been configured in accordance with the invention can provide for greater recovery of lixiviant from a concentrated waste stream in a hydrometallurgical process. This is achieved by diluting the concentrated stream supplied to one nanofiltration subsystem in the process using the dilute permeate from another nanofiltration subsystem. The invention can be used to recover more acid in hydrometallurgical processes involving acid leaching or for instance to recover more sodium carbonate in certain processes involving alkaline leaching. Further advantages include possible reductions in the amount of raw materials required, in the effluent produced, in the size of plant, and in overall cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The hydrometallurgical process requires at least two nanofiltration subsystems in which raffinate from a solvent extraction process is treated in a first nanofiltration subsystem, after which permeate therefrom is combined with a pregnant solution stream and is treated in a second nanofiltration subsystem. Specifically, the process is for extracting a valuable metal from a material, e.g. ore or tailings, and comprises the usual steps of leaching the material with a lixiviant to produce a leach solution of the metal and impurity solids, concentrating and purifying the leach solution to produce a pregnant solution stream in which the step of concentrating and purifying the leach solution comprises solvent extracting the leach solution to produce a metal-rich organic solution and a metal-poor raffinate, and then recovering the metal from the pregnant solution stream. In addition however, the hydrometallurgical process comprises directing at least a portion of the raffinate from the solvent extracting to the inlet of a first nanofiltration subsystem to produce a first retentate stream and a first permeate stream, then combining the first permeate stream from the first nanofiltration subsystem with the pregnant solution stream obtained either before or after recovering the metal therefrom, directing at least a portion of the combined first permeate stream and pregnant solution stream to the inlet of a second nanofiltration subsystem to produce a second retentate stream and a second permeate stream, and employing the second permeate stream in either the leaching or the concentrating and purifying the leach solution steps.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The process of the invention is suitable for operations in which the lixiviant is an aqueous acid solution. It is also suitable for extracting metals including but not limited to any base metal or combination of base metals, such as copper, nickel, cobalt, zinc, iron, lead, uranium, and radium.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">While the first permeate stream is used to dilute the pregnant solution stream, the first retentate stream can be neutralized (e.g. if acidic, with lime) and the metal content precipitated for recovery after which the stream can be discharged as effluent.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">One advantageous embodiment relates to a process for extracting uranium from ore using sulfuric acid in which the metal recovery operation involves chemical precipitation. Here, the hydrometallurgical process comprises counter current decanting the leach solution and impurity solids with a counter current decanting mixture comprising sulfuric acid and water to remove the solids. The first permeate stream from the first nanofiltration subsystem is then combined with the pregnant solution stream obtained before the metal recovery operation. The second permeate stream is employed in the counter current decanting mixture. And uranium is chemically precipitated from the retentate stream of the second nanofiltration subsystem, thus recovering and purifying the uranium.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">A second advantageous embodiment relates to a general process in which the metal recovery operation involves electrolytic processing (e.g. electrowinning or electrorefining). Here, the hydrometallurgical process comprises combining the first permeate stream from the first nanofiltration subsystem with the pregnant solution stream obtained after the metal recovery operation. The second retentate stream is combined with the leach solution prior to the concentrating and purifying the leach solution step. And the second permeate stream is combined with the aqueous acid solution in the leaching step.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The invention includes both the aforementioned hydrometallurgical processes along with systems appropriately configured to accomplish such processes.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout this specification and claims, the words âcompriseâ, âcomprisingâ and the like are to be construed in an open, inclusive sense. The words âaâ, âanâ, and the like are to be considered as meaning at least one and are not limited to just one. In particular, when used in reference to the various streams or raffinates herein, the words âaâ, âanâ, and the like are to be considered as meaning at least one portion of such a stream or raffinate and are not limited to just one such portion. Thus specifically, the phrases âa raffinateâ, âa first permeate streamâ, and âa pregnant solution streamâ for instance should be construed as âat least one portion of raffinateâ, âat least one portion of first permeate streamâ, and âat least one portion of pregnant solution streamâ respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Herein, âpregnant solution streamâ refers to the process stream in a hydrometallurgical process after the solution concentration and purification operations.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">âElectrolytic processingâ is intended to include any metals recovery process involving electrolysis, including for instance electrowinning and electrorefining.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In addition, âpregnant solution stream after recovering the metal therefromâ refers to what is also commonly known as the spent electrolyte after electrolytic processing.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">With regards to nanofiltration generally, âfeed streamâ refers to the solution to be subjected to nanofiltration and which is supplied to a nanofiltration module. âRetentate streamâ refers to the process stream exiting a nanofiltration module which has not passed through the nanofiltration membrane. And âpermeate streamâ refers to the process stream exiting a nanofiltration module which has passed through the nanofiltration membrane. A ânanofiltration moduleâ is an independent component comprising one or more nanofiltration membranes and ports for such feed, permeate, and retentate streams.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Further, in nanofiltration arrays comprising multiple nanofiltration modules, multiple modules are considered to belong to a single âstageâ if they are supplied in parallel with a common feed stream. An array is considered to be âmulti-stageâ when the retentate stream from an upstream module is supplied as the feed stream for another module downstream. The number of stages in such an array is given by the number of modules connected in series in this manner (i.e. connected such that the retentate stream from an upstream module in the series is supplied as the feed stream to a downstream module in the series). An array is considered to be âmulti-passâ when the permeate stream from an upstream module is supplied as the feed stream for another module. The number of passes in such an array is given by the number of modules connected in series in this manner (i.e. with the permeate stream from an upstream module in a series supplied as the feed stream to a downstream module in the series). More complicated arrays can be created however which incorporate elements of both of these arrangements.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The following description exemplifies several alternative embodiments of the invention. The first involves recovering lixiviant (in this case, acid) and water from the raffinate waste stream arising from a solvent extraction step and then using this dilute aqueous acid solution as a diluent to recover additional acid content from the pregnant solution stream. The other embodiments again involve recovering acid lixiviant and water from the raffinate waste stream arising from a solvent extraction step and then using this dilute aqueous acid solution as a diluent to recover additional acid content from the spent electrolyte stream from electrolytic processing.</p>

In this process, sulphuric acid is added in multiple stages to the process liquor stream to promote leaching and purification of the valuable metals with a portion of this acid stream being continuously directed to a neutralization step where it is treated with lime before final disposal as effluent. Recovery of the sulphuric acid is only performed via return of part of the raffinate stream resulting from solvent extraction to a counter current decanting stage. Specifically, process <b>1</b> involves subjecting an appropriate ore to crushing <b>2</b> and then to acid leaching <b>3</b> using sulphuric acid in the presence of sodium chlorate oxidant to create a leach solution comprising dissolved uranium and other liquid and solid impurities. The leach solution is then purified and concentrated in several steps. Initially, counter current decantation <b>4</b> is performed using supplies of sulphuric acid, water, and raffinate from a later solvent extraction step <b>6</b>. The decanted leach solution is filtered in a clarification sand filtering step <b>5</b> in which flocculant is supplied to promote agglomeration of fines to enhance separation of certain impurity solids for removal. The filtered leach solution is then directed to solvent extraction step <b>6</b>. The organic phase of the leach solution after solvent extraction <b>6</b> is then subjected to a stripping step <b>7</b> which again involves the addition of sulphuric acid and creates pregnant solution stream comprising concentrated uranium in solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">In solvent extraction step <b>6</b>, the leach solution is brought into intimate contact with an immiscible organic phase containing an extractant selective to the uranium metal, such as tertiary amine in kerosene (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>). After mechanical mixing and settling, phase separation occurs between the organic phase loaded with the uranium metal (also called âpregnant extractâ) and the aqueous phase with low metal value (also called âbarren solutionâ). The purified pregnant extract is then introduced to the stripping stage at step <b>7</b>, where it is contacted with another aqueous solution of selected chemical composition, such as sulphuric acid, to promote transfer of the uranium metal into the aqueous phase, and thereby producing a stream called âpregnant solution streamâ. Solvent extraction step <b>6</b> and stripping step <b>7</b> thus produce a pregnant solution stream and a raffinate stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The raffinate stream is then either treated for recovery of other valuable by-products, if any (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), or recycled to a point upstream or downstream of the solvent extraction process (recycling upstream of the solvent extraction process is shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>), or discharged as waste after suitable effluent treatment in neutralization step <b>8</b> (in which the raffinate is neutralized via addition of an appropriate amount of lime).</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As for the pregnant solution stream, it is subjected to metal recovery processing to recover the valuable uranium therein. A first impurity precipitation step <b>9</b> is performed which involves the addition of lime, ferric sulphate, and air to the pregnant process stream. Thereafter, a second impurity precipitation step <b>10</b> is performed, after which the uranium is itself precipitated out in uranium precipitation step <b>11</b>. The uranium metal is dried and packed at step <b>12</b> and is ready for shipping to a refinery or other.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows an improved version <b>20</b> of the process of <figref>FIG. 1</figref> for purposes of extracting uranium from ore. In the simplified schematic of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, two nanofiltration steps <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are employed. (The process steps common to <figref>FIG. 1</figref> are identified with the same numerals.) Here, all the raffinate from solvent extraction step <b>6</b> is supplied as feed stream <b>21</b><i>f </i>and subjected to nanofiltration at step <b>21</b>. The retentate stream <b>21</b><i>r </i>is then disposed of after neutralizing at step <b>8</b>. The permeate stream <b>21</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>21</b> is combined and mixed with the pregnant solution stream at combining/mixing step <b>23</b>, and thereby substantially dilutes the pregnant solution stream to produce a mixture of lower acid and metal contents. Next, the diluted pregnant solution stream is supplied as feed stream <b>22</b><i>f </i>and undergoes nanofiltration at step <b>22</b>. The retentate stream <b>22</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>22</b> continues on to the metal recovery operations while the permeate stream <b>22</b><i>p </i>is recovered and used as fluid in the counter current decanting step <b>4</b> and/or as a supply of sulphuric acid for stripping step <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many variations are possible regarding the simplified schematic of process <b>20</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Either of nanofiltration steps <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> may involve single or multiple pass and/or single or multiple stages of nanofiltration in order to recover acid in the desired quality required and to reject metals like uranium, radium, and other multivalent cations. For instance, <figref>FIGS. 2</figref><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i>depict some of the many potential subsystems which might be used to accomplish nanofiltration step <b>22</b>. For instance, <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows a simplified schematic of an optional second nanofiltration subsystem comprising multiple nanofiltration modules for use in nanofiltration step <b>22</b>. (In <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, like numerals have been used to denote elements in common with <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.) Here, nanofiltration step <b>22</b> (dashed box in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) is accomplished by a somewhat complex array of nanofiltration modules <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>69</b> each having their own respective feed streams <b>67</b><i>f, </i><b>68</b><i>f, </i>and <b>69</b><i>f</i>, their own respective permeate streams <b>67</b><i>p, </i><b>68</b><i>p, </i>and <b>69</b><i>p, </i>and their own respective retentate streams <b>67</b><i>r, </i><b>68</b><i>r, </i>and <b>69</b><i>r. </i>As shown, nanofiltration modules <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> are arranged in a double-pass configuration, and nanofiltration modules <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> are arranged in a double-stage configuration (since retentate stream <b>67</b><i>r </i>is supplied as feed stream <b>68</b><i>f</i>). As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>, permeate stream <b>68</b><i>p, </i>a portion of permeate stream <b>69</b><i>p, </i>and retentate stream <b>69</b><i>r </i>may optionally be recycled to permeate stream <b>21</b><i>p. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Further still, the aforementioned nanofiltration modules can themselves be somewhat complex subsystems, comprising single or multiple pass and/or single or multiple stages of nanofiltration. For instance, <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows a simplified schematic of an optional complex nanofiltration subsystem comprising multiple nanofiltration modules which serve the function of nanofiltration module <b>67</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. (Again in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, like numerals have been used to denote elements in common with <figref>FIGS. 2 and 2</figref><i>a</i>.) Here, nanofiltration module <b>67</b> (dashed box in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>) is a somewhat complex array of nanofiltration modules <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> each having their own respective feed streams <b>71</b><i>f, </i><b>72</b><i>f</i>, and <b>73</b><i>f, </i>their own respective permeate streams <b>71</b><i>p, </i><b>72</b><i>p, </i>and <b>73</b><i>p, </i>and their own respective retentate streams <b>71</b><i>r, </i><b>72</b><i>r, </i>and <b>73</b><i>r. </i>Here, nanofiltration modules <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> can be viewed as arranged in a triple-stage configuration since retentate stream <b>71</b><i>r </i>is supplied as a portion of feed stream <b>72</b><i>f, </i>and retentate stream <b>72</b><i>r </i>is supplied as a portion of feed stream <b>73</b><i>f. </i>However, all three feed streams <b>71</b><i>f </i>(equivalent to <b>220</b>, <b>72</b><i>f, </i>and <b>73</b><i>f </i>also comprise a portion of pregnant solution and a portion of <b>21</b><i>p</i>, thus the nanofiltration modules <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, and <b>73</b> presented here are part of a complex system which could be viewed either as a multi-stage or a multi-pass configuration. In <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>, retentate stream <b>73</b><i>r </i>is equivalent to retentate stream <b>67</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration module <b>67</b> in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. However, permeate streams <b>71</b><i>p, </i><b>72</b><i>p, </i>and <b>73</b><i>p </i>are combined to become permeate stream <b>67</b><i>p </i>in <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that additional steps and associated apparatus may be employed as required or desired in the simplified schematic of process <b>20</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. For instance, in the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, permeate <b>22</b><i>p </i>may have a lower acid concentration than desired and thus a concentration step might be employed to increase the acid concentration of the stream before recycling back to counter current decantation <b>4</b> or stripping step <b>7</b>. <figref>FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>shows a simplified schematic of a portion of the hydrometallurgical process of <figref>FIG. 2</figref> comprising such an optional additional step. Here, the undesirably dilute permeate <b>22</b><i>p </i>is supplied to concentrator <b>82</b> which outputs a higher concentration sulphuric acid stream <b>82</b><i>c </i>to be directed to counter current decantation <b>4</b> or stripping step <b>7</b> and a very dilute stream <b>82</b><i>d </i>(mainly water) which may be returned to the main process as water make-up (e.g. for counter current decantation <b>4</b>) or may be recycled to combining/mixing step <b>23</b> as a diluent stream mixing with the pregnant solution. Concentrator <b>82</b> may for instance be a conventional sulphuric acid concentrator unit or alternatively a water removal subsystem, such as an osmotic membrane distillation or membrane distillation unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Returning to the improved process of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, with regards to operating parameters, it is generally expected that high pressures would not be required for nanofiltration step <b>21</b>, although using increased pressure and/or temperatures would be expected to improve performance. To increase recovery in nanofiltration step <b>22</b> however, the nanofiltration modules or units may be operated at higher pressures than a conventional <b>600</b> psi operating range. Certain chemically stable nanofiltration membrane types may be used for this step which can operate at pressures up to 1070 psi and temperatures up to 80Â° C. Further, one may consider adding a controlled amount of dilute sulphuric acid or water to the pregnant solution stream in different stages of a multiple-stage nanofiltration system in order to generate an acid concentration profile in the permeate stream produced where higher concentrated acid at the initial stages and lower acid concentration at the later stages of the NF system may be produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Instead of merely disposing of the retentate stream <b>21</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration <b>21</b>, steps may be taken to recover valuable components (e.g. metals) therein if their concentration is high enough, such as treating the solids precipitated during neutralizing to recover the valuable solids content before discharging the rest as sludge. Alternatively, it too may be directed back for counter current decanting at step <b>4</b> to improve plant efficiency. If however the retentate stream <b>21</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration <b>21</b> is disposed of as shown, anti-scalant may be added to the raffinate stream upstream of nanofiltration step <b>21</b> in order to increase recovery and reduce the fouling of the nanofiltration membranes. Further, instead of using the permeate stream <b>22</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>22</b> for counter current decanting as shown, this permeate stream may also be used elsewhere in overall process <b>20</b> as desired.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The arrangement in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> thus not only provides for recovery of sulphuric acid and water from the raffinate stream, but also for recovery of sulphuric acid from the pregnant solution stream. Due to the high concentration of uranium and sulphuric acid in the pregnant solution stream after stripping <b>7</b>, and thus the high osmotic pressure of the pregnant solution stream, using nanofiltration on the pregnant solution stream may not hitherto have been considered to be practical. However here, the permeate stream <b>21</b><i>p </i>from raffinate nanofiltration step <b>21</b> is advantageously employed to dilute the pregnant solution stream, thereby reducing the osmotic pressure and thus making nanofiltration of the pregnant solution stream practical.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Further advantages of such an arrangement include the potential for significant reduction in lime usage in neutralization step <b>8</b> and/or impurity precipitation step <b>9</b>, in production of gypsum waste, and in the amount of effluent discharged to the environment. Further still, nanofiltration systems are typically more compact than conventional neutralization and precipitation apparatus. Thus, other advantages of the invention include potential reduction in the size of neutralization and/or precipitation apparatus and hence the overall plant, along with a reduction in associated cost.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Other embodiments of the invention are exemplified in the following. For comparison, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows a simplified schematic of a typical prior art hydrometallurgical process <b>30</b> which involves recovering metal via electrowinning. Specifically, process <b>30</b> involves subjecting an appropriate crushed ore or tailings to acid leaching <b>31</b> using supplied dilute sulphuric acid to create a leach solution comprising dissolved valuable metals and other liquid and solid impurities. The leach solution then undergoes a solvent extraction step <b>32</b>. The solvent extracted leach solution, known as âpregnant extractâ, is then subjected to a stripping step <b>33</b> which again involves the addition of sulphuric acid and creates pregnant solution stream comprising concentrated valuable metals in solution.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As in the prior art process of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a portion of the raffinate from solvent extraction step <b>32</b> may be returned to the leaching step and part to neutralization step <b>34</b> for subsequent effluent treatment and disposal. The raffinate is first neutralized via addition of an appropriate amount of lime at neutralization step <b>34</b>, and results in precipitated solids and an effluent liquid stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">After stripping <b>33</b>, the metals in the pregnant solution stream are recovered via electrowinning <b>35</b>. The products of electrowinning <b>35</b> are the desired product metal and spent pregnant solution stream, also commonly referred to as spent electrolyte. A portion of the spent pregnant solution stream may be recycled for use in stripping step <b>33</b>. And also spent pregnant solution stream may be used as purge or may be treated further in order to recover other metals therefrom.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>
        <i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>show alternative improved versions <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> of the process of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> in which two nanofiltration steps <b>41</b>, <b>42</b> are employed. (The process steps common to <figref>FIG. 3</figref> are identified with the same numerals.) Again here, a portion of the raffinate from solvent extraction step <b>32</b> is supplied as feed stream <b>41</b><i>f </i>and subjected to nanofiltration at step <b>41</b>, while the remaining portion is recycled to leaching step <b>31</b>. The ratio of the raffinate stream portions sent to these two steps may vary depending on the process design and equipment. In <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, the retentate streams <b>41</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> are disposed of after first neutralizing them with lime at step <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, a portion of the permeate stream <b>41</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> is combined and mixed with the spent pregnant solution stream after electrowinning at combining/mixing step <b>45</b>, and thereby substantially dilutes the spent pregnant solution stream. The diluted spent pregnant solution stream then is supplied as feed stream <b>42</b><i>f </i>and undergoes nanofiltration at step <b>42</b>. Another portion of the permeate stream <b>41</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> is combined with the acid supplied to leaching step <b>31</b> and thus is used in leaching step <b>31</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The retentate stream <b>42</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>42</b> is directed back in process <b>40</b> and is combined with the leach solution upstream of solvent extracting step <b>32</b>.

        <figref>FIG. 4</figref>
        <i>b </i>shows an alternative embodiment to that shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>and instead employs multiple nanofiltration steps to treat the diluted spent pregnant solution stream. The embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>differs from that in <figref>FIG. 4</figref><i>a </i>in that the retentate stream <b>42</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>42</b> undergoes a subsequent nanofiltration at step <b>43</b>. Here, the retentate stream <b>43</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>43</b> is directed back in process <b>50</b> and is combined with the leach solution upstream of solvent extracting step <b>32</b>. And, the permeate stream <b>43</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>43</b> is combined with the portion of the permeate stream <b>41</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration <b>41</b> which is being directed back and used in leaching step <b>31</b>. Also here, the permeate stream <b>42</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>42</b> is now combined with the acid supply used in stripping step <b>33</b>. And a final difference is that a portion of the permeate stream <b>41</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> is combined with the retentate stream <b>42</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>42</b> upstream of additional nanofiltration step <b>43</b>. An advantage of this embodiment is that by adding permeate from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> to the spent pregnant solution stream in stages as shown, an acid concentration profile can be generated in the permeates produced. For instance, higher acid concentration can be produced in the initial stage and lower concentrations in the later stage in the multiple nanofiltration process.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Again, other variations are possible with regards to processes <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> exemplified in <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>. implified schematic of process <b>20</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. For instance, the permeate stream <b>41</b><i>p </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> may instead be considered for use in leaching step <b>31</b>. And additional nanofiltration steps downstream of step <b>41</b> may be considered to treat the retentate stream <b>41</b><i>r </i>from nanofiltration step <b>41</b> to recover additional acid and water content therefrom.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The embodiments in <figref>FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>thus provide for recovery of sulphuric acid and water from the raffinate stream and from the spent pregnant solution stream from electrolytic processing and thus reduce the acid requirement for the overall process.
