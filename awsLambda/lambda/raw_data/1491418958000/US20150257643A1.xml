      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to medical monitoring devices and, more particularly, to intermittent operating pulse oximeters.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure, which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In the field of medicine, doctors often desire to monitor certain physiological parameters of their patients. Accordingly, a wide variety of devices have been developed for monitoring physiological parameters. Such devices provide doctors and other healthcare personnel with the information they need to provide the best possible healthcare for their patients. As a result, such monitoring devices have become an indispensable part of modern medicine.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">One technique for monitoring certain physiological parameters of a patient is commonly referred to as pulse oximetry, and the devices built based upon pulse oximetry techniques are commonly referred to as pulse oximeters. Pulse oximetry may be used to measure various blood flow characteristics, such as the blood-oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood (SpO<sub>2</sub>), the volume of individual blood pulsations supplying the tissue, and/or the rate of blood pulsations corresponding to each heartbeat of a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Pulse oximeters typically utilize a non-invasive sensor that is placed on or against a patient's tissue that is well perfused with blood, such as a patient's finger, toe, forehead or earlobe. The pulse oximeter sensor emits light and photoelectrically senses the absorption and/or scattering of the light after passage through the perfused tissue. The data collected by the sensor may then be used to calculate one or more of the above physiological parameters based upon the absorption or scattering of the light. More specifically, the emitted light is typically selected to be of one or more wavelengths that are absorbed and/or scattered in an amount related to the presence of oxygenated versus de-oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood. The amount of light absorbed and/or scattered may then be used to estimate the amount of oxygen in the tissue using various algorithms.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In certain situations it may be desirable to have a pulse oximeter that is small, lightweight, inexpensive, and that uses batteries to operate. For example, such battery powered monitors may be used when conventional monitors may be too heavy and bulky to be moved from one patient to another or when medical treatment is desired in a remote location and access to a conventional power source may not be available. However, the batteries may be drained fairly quickly in such pulse oximeters and, thus, require frequent replacement.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The same is true for wireless sensors. Wireless sensors may be desirable to check a patient's status without encumbering the patient with an additional wire. Typically, due to the fact that there is not a wire powering the sensors, wireless sensors require conventional or rechargeable batteries to operate. During operation, the batteries may be drained from performing measurements and transmitting the data. Consequently, the conventional batteries may require replacement, and the rechargeable batteries may need to be recharged, which may present a problem when drained in a remote location where a conventional power source is not available.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">One or more specific embodiments of the present techniques will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure. Additionally, it should be noted that the term âreadingâ and âmeasurementâ may be used interchangeably when referring to the pulse oximeter gathering physiological data herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Operating a wireless sensor or monitor over a period of time may drain a power source for the wireless sensor or monitor even if such operation is intermittent. However, using certain methods of power generation, a wireless sensor may recharge itself in order to perform desired intermittent operations, such as taking measurements and/or communicating with external devices. For example, in some embodiments, the energy necessary to power a sensor for an intermittent measurement and/or data transmission may be generated in between each check or transmission. As will be discussed below, the energy may be stored by charging an energy storage component, such as a capacitor or inductor, during the time period between the intermittent measurements and/or data transmissions. This provides the advantage of acquiring the energy required to perform the intermittent measurements and/or data transmission from low grade power sources (i.e. power sources that emit ambient light, heat, and kinetic energy). In particular, various energy harvesting techniques may be utilized that turn ambient light, body heat, body movement, and so forth into energy to charge the power source.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In certain embodiments, the wireless sensor or monitor may determine when to perform a reading or transmit data after the power source has stored a sufficient amount of charge. Indeed, the power source may only have enough energy to either perform a reading or transmit data. Thus, the wireless sensor or monitor may determine to perform an intermittent reading based upon one or more of a power source charge level, a determined measurement rate, a determined measurement priority, or a measurement triggering event. Likewise, the wireless sensor or monitor may determine to intermittently transmit data based upon one or more of the power source charge level, a determined transmission rate, a determined transmission priority, or a transmission triggering event. In this way, the present techniques provide the benefit of the wireless sensor or monitor being capable of dynamically deciding whether to perform a measurement or transmit data based on a number of factors (e.g., battery charge level, patient status, last transmission, etc.). With the foregoing in mind, the present techniques are directed towards medical devices that harvest energy and intermittently operate (e.g., take measurements and transmit data), among other things, as discussed in detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Turning to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a perspective view of a medical device is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment. The medical device may be a pulse oximeter <b>100</b>. The pulse oximeter <b>100</b> may include a monitor <b>102</b>, such as those available from Nellcor Puritan Bennett LLC. The monitor <b>102</b> may be wireless and powered by batteries, or the monitor <b>102</b> may be wired and powered by a conventional power source. In either case, the monitor <b>102</b> may be configured to display calculated parameters on a display <b>104</b>. As may be seen, the display <b>104</b> may be integrated into the monitor <b>102</b>. The display <b>104</b> may be configured to display computed physiological data including, for example, an oxygen saturation percentage, a pulse rate, and/or a plethysmographic waveform <b>106</b>. As is known in the art, the oxygen saturation percentage may be a functional arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation measurement in units of percentage SpO<sub>2</sub>, while the pulse rate may indicate a patient's pulse rate in beats per minute. The monitor <b>102</b> may also display information related to alarms, monitor settings, and/or signal quality via indicator lights <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">To facilitate user input, the monitor <b>102</b> may include a plurality of control inputs <b>110</b>. The control inputs <b>110</b> may include fixed function keys, programmable function keys, and soft keys. Specifically, the control inputs <b>110</b> may correspond to soft key icons in the display <b>104</b>. Pressing control inputs <b>110</b> associated with, or adjacent to, an icon in the display may select a corresponding option. The monitor <b>102</b> may also include a casing <b>109</b>. The casing <b>109</b> may aid in the protection of the internal elements of the monitor <b>102</b> from damage.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The monitor <b>102</b> may be configured to transmit data wirelessly via a transceiver <b>112</b> (e.g., wireless communication circuitry) to another system (not shown), such as a clinician notification system. Additionally, the transceiver <b>112</b> may enable for wireless operation signals to be transmitted to and received from a transceiver disposed in a wireless sensor <b>114</b>. The wireless sensor <b>114</b> may be of a disposable or a non-disposable type. The wireless sensor <b>114</b> may obtain readings from a patient that can be used by the monitor <b>102</b> to calculate certain physiological parameters such as the blood-oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood, the volume of individual blood pulsations supplying the tissue, and/or the rate of blood pulsations corresponding to each heartbeat of a patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In certain embodiments, the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may be powered by a non-battery power source, such as a capacitor or inductor. In other words, the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may be battery-less. However, in alternate embodiments the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may be powered by a rechargeable battery or conventional battery. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the sensor <b>114</b> may include a charging device <b>115</b> for harnessing of energy to charge the non-battery power source. The wireless sensor <b>114</b> may also include an indicator <b>111</b> that may provide an audio or visual indication that the sensor has enough charge to perform an intermittent reading and/or data transmission. The wireless sensor <b>114</b> may also include a button/switch <b>113</b> that may be pressed in order to trigger the wireless sensor <b>114</b> to perform an intermittent reading and/or data transmission to the monitor <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, once the wireless sensor <b>114</b> obtains sufficient charge, it may power on and perform an intermittent measurement and/or transmit data according to a power source charge level, a schedule, a priority, a triggering event, or some combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Certain components of the wireless sensor <b>114</b> and the monitor <b>102</b> included in the pulse oximeter <b>100</b> are illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>. Oftentimes, the monitor <b>102</b> may be placed next to a patient's bed in a hospital room, and the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may be attached to a patient's <b>117</b> finger, earlobe, and/or forehead. As mentioned, it may be desirable to check a patient's status over a period of time by taking intermittent measurements with the wireless sensor <b>114</b> attached to the patient <b>117</b>. However, the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may not always have enough energy to perform both a reading and data transmission. Thus, the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may need to be able to recharge itself and determine whether to perform an intermittent measurement and/or transmit data based on a number of factors. To that end, the following description of how the monitor <b>102</b> and wireless sensor <b>114</b> work together serves as a basis for describing how the wireless sensor harnesses energy and how the monitor <b>102</b> and the wireless sensor <b>114</b> determine when measurements and/or data transmissions are performed.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In order for the wireless sensor <b>114</b> to communicate with the monitor <b>102</b>, the wireless sensor <b>114</b> must identify itself to the monitor <b>102</b>. This is achieved by the wireless sensor <b>114</b> sending information stored on an encoder <b>120</b> from transceiver <b>125</b> to transceiver <b>112</b> when the wireless sensor <b>114</b> is first powered on. The encoder <b>120</b> may, for instance, be a memory on which one or more of the following information may be stored for communication to the monitor <b>102</b>: the type of the sensor <b>114</b> (e.g., wireless or wired); the wavelengths of light emitted by an emitter <b>116</b>; the proper calibration coefficients and/or algorithms to be used for calculating the patient's <b>117</b> physiological parameters; and/or information regarding a charging device <b>115</b> for the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. For example, the information regarding the charging device <b>115</b> may be obtained from a charging control circuit <b>162</b> and include information relating to the amount of charge available in a power source <b>160</b>, the amount of energy required to perform a reading and/or a transmission, the types of suitable charging devices <b>115</b> (e.g., kinetic energy harvesting devices, thermoelectric energy harvesting devices, ambient light harvesting devices, etc.), the proper charging of the power source <b>160</b> (e.g., which energy harvesting method is preferred), the type of power source <b>160</b> utilized by the wireless sensor <b>114</b> (e.g., capacitor, inductor, rechargeable battery, etc.), the length of time required to fully charge the power source <b>160</b>, whether the power source <b>160</b> is charging, and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The charging information may be particularly important in certain embodiments where a capacitor or inductor is utilized by the wireless sensor <b>114</b> because it may aid the monitor <b>102</b> in determining when to request measurements or transmissions. For example, if the monitor <b>102</b> is aware that the wireless sensor <b>114</b> is utilizing a capacitor charged by energy harvesting techniques, the monitor <b>102</b> may determine a reading or transmission schedule according to how long it takes a capacitor to charge by harvesting energy in those circumstances. In addition, if the monitor <b>102</b> is aware of the amount of charge available in the wireless sensor <b>114</b> and how much energy is drained from the wireless sensor's <b>114</b> power source <b>160</b> by performing a measurement and/or a transmission, the monitor <b>102</b> may determine that there is a sufficient amount of energy to perform only a measurement or a transmission and request accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Further, the monitor <b>102</b> may be capable of downloading software updates required to operate with the type of battery-less wireless sensor <b>114</b> as needed. In some embodiments, the monitor <b>102</b> may already have the information needed to operate with the type of battery-less wireless sensor <b>114</b> with which it is communicating. That is, if the battery-less wireless sensor <b>114</b> is utilizing a capacitor, the monitor <b>102</b> may have the operational algorithms required to determine when to request readings and/or data transmissions. An example of an operation algorithm includes determining when to issue a request for data transmission to the wireless sensor <b>114</b> based on the type of power source <b>160</b> utilized by the sensor <b>114</b>, the type of energy harvesting technique used, and the amount of charge currently available in the power source <b>160</b>. However, in other embodiments, the monitor <b>102</b> may download the information, such as the operational algorithms, required to operate with the type of battery-less wireless sensor <b>114</b> from an external source. In this way, the monitor <b>102</b> may be reprogrammable.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">After the monitor <b>102</b> receives the identifying information from the wireless sensor <b>114</b>, a detector/decoder <b>155</b> disposed in the monitor<b>102</b> may decode the information and relay it to the microprocessor <b>132</b>, which may make several configurations based on the information. For example, the microprocessor <b>132</b> may select calibration coefficients for use in algorithms for determining physiological parameters when physiological data is eventually received from the wireless sensor <b>114</b>, determine an intermittent measurement and/or data transmission schedule for the wireless sensor <b>114</b>, and so forth.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Once the intermittent measurement schedule is established, the microprocessor <b>132</b> may request a measurement to be taken by the wireless sensor <b>114</b> at a specified time. To achieve this, the microprocessor <b>132</b> may be coupled to an internal bus <b>134</b> that is also connected to a time processing unit (TPU) <b>138</b>. The TPU <b>138</b> may provide timing control signals to the wireless sensor's <b>114</b> light drive circuitry <b>128</b> (e.g., via the transceivers <b>112</b> and <b>125</b>), which controls when an emitter <b>116</b> is activated, and if multiple light sources are used, the multiplexed timing for the different light sources. TPU <b>138</b> may also control the gating-in of signals from a detector <b>118</b> through an amplifier <b>142</b> and a switching circuit <b>144</b>. The amplifier <b>142</b> may amplify, for example, the signals from the detector <b>118</b> received at the transceiver <b>112</b>. The TPU <b>138</b> may control the gating-in of signals to insure that the signals are sampled at the proper time, which may depend at least in part upon which of multiple light sources is activated, if multiple light sources are used. Likewise, once the transmission schedule is established, the processor <b>132</b> may send a request for data transmission to the wireless sensor <b>114</b> via transceivers <b>112</b> and <b>125</b> at a specified time.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">In other embodiments, a microprocessor <b>123</b> on the wireless sensor <b>114</b> may determine when to take an intermittent measurement and/or transmit data based on various factors, which are described in detail below, and send a signal to the light drive circuitry <b>128</b> and/or the transceiver <b>125</b> accordingly. The microprocessor <b>123</b> may make this determination either dynamically or by consulting information (e.g. intermittent measurement schedule, transmission schedule, etc.) in a non-volatile memory <b>127</b>. Thus, it should be noted that intermittent measurements and/or data transmissions may be triggered by either microprocessors <b>123</b> and/or <b>132</b>. It should be further noted that an intermittent measurement may be random, scheduled to occur at specific intervals, or triggered in response to patient and environmental conditions. In other words, the physiological parameters are not continuously being gathered by the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. If an intermittent reading is triggered, the light drive circuitry <b>128</b> will receive a signal from the microprocessor <b>123</b> or the transceiver <b>125</b> and it will activate the emitter <b>116</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The emitter <b>116</b> may be capable of emitting at least two wavelengths of light, e.g., RED and infrared (IR) light, into the tissue of the patient <b>117</b> to enable calculation of the patient's <b>117</b> physiological parameters, such as blood oxygen saturation, where the RED wavelength may be between about 600 nanometers (nm) and about 700 nm, and the IR wavelength may be between about 800 nm and about 1000 nm. Alternative light sources may be used in other embodiments. For example, a single wide-spectrum light source may be used, and the detector <b>118</b> may be capable of detecting certain wavelengths of light. In another example, the detector <b>118</b> may detect a wide spectrum of wavelengths of light, and the monitor <b>102</b> may process only those wavelengths which are of interest for use in measuring, for example, blood oxygen saturation, water fractions, hematocrit, or other physiologic parameters of the patient <b>117</b>. It should be understood that, as used herein, the term âlightâ may refer to one or more of ultrasound, radio, microwave, millimeter wave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, gamma ray or X-ray electromagnetic radiation, and may also include any wavelength within the radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, or X-ray spectra, and that any suitable wavelength of light may be appropriate for use with the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The detector <b>118</b> may generate electrical signals (e.g., analog) in response to the total light detected from the emitter <b>116</b>, i.e., light that has passed through the patient's <b>117</b> tissue and shunted light. However, due to attenuation from passing through the patient's <b>117</b> tissue, the received electrical signals may be amplified by an amplifier <b>122</b>. The signals may then be converted to digital signals by an analog-to-digital converter <b>121</b> and sent to the monitor <b>102</b> via transceivers <b>125</b> and <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, if the power source <b>160</b> lacks sufficient charge to transmit the data, the data may be stored in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> until sufficient charge to transmit is obtained. Therefore, the physiological data collection and the data transmission may be asynchronous because they do not need to occur at the same time. As an example, the intermittent measurement and the wireless transmission of the collected data may be separated by a time period sufficient to recharge the power source <b>160</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Once transmitted to the monitor <b>102</b>, if for some reason the signals received require further amplification and/or digitization, i.e., there are multiple light wavelengths or spectra received, the received signals from the detector <b>118</b> may be passed through an (optional) amplifier <b>146</b>, a low pass filter <b>148</b>, and an analog-to-digital converter <b>150</b> for amplifying, filtering, and digitizing the electrical signals from the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. The digital data may then be stored in a queued serial module (QSM) <b>152</b>, for later downloading to RAM <b>136</b>, which is also connected to the internal bus <b>134</b> along with a display <b>104</b> and control inputs <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In other embodiments, the received signals may be sent to the detector/decoder <b>155</b> that may select the appropriate calibration coefficients according to signals received from encoder <b>120</b>, which may correspond to the wavelengths of light used by the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. The received signals, along with the appropriate calibration coefficients, may be sent to the microprocessor <b>132</b>. The microprocessor <b>132</b> may use the coefficients provided by the detector/decoder <b>155</b> or that were determined earlier when the wireless sensor <b>114</b> first identified itself to determine attenuation of the tissue of interest. Once the attenuation of the tissue of interest is calculated, it may be used in computing physiological parameters, such as blood oxygen saturation, using various algorithms. The algorithms may be stored in a ROM <b>154</b> and accessed and operated according to microprocessor <b>132</b> instructions. The monitor <b>102</b> may also include a power source <b>156</b> that may be used to transmit power to the components located in the monitor <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the power source <b>156</b> may be one or more batteries, such as a rechargeable battery. The battery may be user-removable or may be secured within the housing of the monitor <b>102</b>. Use of a battery may, for example, enable the oximeter <b>100</b> to be highly portable, thus allowing a clinician to carry and use the oximeter <b>100</b> in a variety of situations and locations. Additionally, the power source <b>156</b> may include AC power, such as provided by an electrical outlet, and the power source <b>156</b> may be connected to the AC power via a power adapter through a power cord (not shown). This power adapter may also be used to directly recharge one or more batteries of the power source <b>156</b> and/or to power the pulse oximeter <b>100</b>. In this manner, the power adapter may operate as a charging device <b>158</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The wireless sensor <b>114</b> may also include the charging control circuit <b>162</b>, which may, for example, allow for the adaptive control of wireless energy harvested from the charging device <b>115</b> for use in the power source <b>160</b>. The charging control circuit <b>162</b> may, for example, include a processing circuit that may determine the current level of charge remaining in the power source <b>160</b>, as well as the current amount of power being harvested by the charging device <b>115</b>. For example, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may determine if the charging device <b>115</b> is generating too little power to charge the power source <b>160</b>. In response to determining that the charging device <b>115</b> is generating too little power to charge the power source <b>160</b> and that the power source <b>160</b> is low on power, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may generate an error signal that may be transmitted to the monitor <b>102</b> via the transceivers <b>125</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In response to the error signal, the monitor <b>102</b> may (e.g., via the processor <b>132</b>) display an error on the display <b>104</b> of the monitor <b>102</b>. The error message may indicate to a clinician that the sensor <b>114</b> is low on power and may also direct the clinician to take action, such as changing the power source <b>160</b> (e.g., installing new batteries), charging the power source <b>160</b> (i.e. by shining a light on the sensor <b>114</b>, plugging the sensor <b>114</b> into a charging unit or into an electrical outlet via a power adapter, having the patient <b>117</b> to which the sensor <b>114</b> is attached move, etc.). Alternatively, the error message may indicate to a clinician that the recharging system of the sensor <b>114</b> is potentially malfunctioning, and may direct the clinician, for example, to replace the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. In an embodiment, the error message may be generated when the charging control circuit <b>162</b> determines that the power source <b>160</b> has reached a certain charge level, for example, 20% of the total charge remains in the power source <b>160</b>. Additionally, as described below in greater detail, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may also include conversion translation circuitry, such as a rectifier circuit, for conversion of alternating current generated via the charging device <b>115</b> into direct current.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In other embodiments, in response to determining that the charging device <b>115</b> is generating too little power to charge the power source <b>160</b> and that the power source <b>160</b> is low on power, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may generate an error signal that may be displayed by an indicator <b>111</b> on the wireless sensor <b>114</b>. The indicator may provide audio or visual indications by means of a sound or a color that indicates an error has occurred. The error indication may provide the same warnings as discussed above. Alternatively, when the power source <b>160</b> has received sufficient charge to perform an intermittent measurement or transmit data, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may generate a signal to the indicator <b>111</b> to indicate that the sensor <b>114</b> has enough energy to perform the intermittent measurement or data transmission. As a result, the indicator <b>111</b> may display a visual indication, such as a green light or any suitable color, or emit an audio indication that the power source <b>160</b> has a sufficient charge.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Furthermore, the charging device <b>115</b> may be one of a multitude of energy harvesting components that utilize, for example, inductive energy generation techniques and/or piezoelectric energy generation techniques. Through the use of these techniques, energy may be harvested, for example, through motion of a patient <b>117</b>, body heat of a patient <b>117</b>, and/or ambient light, and utilized to directly recharge the power source <b>160</b> within the sensor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">For example, an embodiment of a charging device that utilizes kinetic energy harvesting techniques is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. The charging device <b>115</b> may include an energy harvester <b>190</b> that may convert vibratory motion along an axis <b>192</b> into electrical energy. One or more energy harvesters <b>190</b> may be utilized in conjunction with one another and the energy harvester <b>190</b> may be sized to be imbedded in the sensor <b>114</b> or attached thereto as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), or as other systems. The energy harvester <b>190</b> may be enclosed by, for example, four partitions <b>194</b>, <b>196</b>, <b>198</b>, and <b>200</b>. As may be seen, partitions <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> may be opposite paired partitions while partitions <b>198</b> and <b>200</b> may also be opposite paired partitions. The energy harvester <b>190</b> may further include one or more attachment devices, such as springs <b>202</b>, which may be utilized to suspend enclosure <b>204</b> from partitions <b>198</b> and <b>200</b>. The springs <b>202</b> may enable for reciprocating movement of the enclosure <b>204</b> relative to partitions <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> only along the axis <b>192</b>. This movement of the enclosure <b>204</b> may be in response to movement by the patient <b>117</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">Additionally, the enclosure <b>204</b> of the energy harvester <b>190</b> may include one or more magnets <b>206</b> attached thereto. Accordingly, the enclosure <b>204</b>, may enable for reciprocating movement of the magnets <b>206</b> relative to the partitions <b>194</b> and <b>196</b>. Indeed, one or more coils <b>208</b> may be attached to the partitions <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> such that the reciprocating movement of the magnets <b>206</b> inductively generates a current in the coils <b>208</b>.

As noted above, the current generated may pass through a rectifier circuit, a transformer, or a phase converter as, for example, part of the charging control circuit <b>162</b>. Accordingly, the energy harvester <b>190</b> may convert input kinetic energy, for example, movement by the patient <b>117</b> causing reciprocating movement of the enclosure <b>204</b> (and thus the magnets <b>206</b> attached thereto), into electricity useable by the pulse oximeter <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">Additionally, <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another example of the charging device <b>115</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. In this embodiment, the charging device <b>115</b> utilizes thermoelectric energy harvesting techniques. The thermoelectric energy harvester <b>218</b> may include one or more substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b>, conductive layers <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>, and one or more thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. Also included are leads <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> coupled to the thermoelectric energy harvester <b>218</b>. Substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> may include a ceramic, aluminum nitride (AlN), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), SiO<sub>2</sub>, or any other electrically insulating and thermally conducting material. The substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> may be, for example, approximately between 100 and 2000 micrometers (Î¼m) in thickness. Coupled to each of the substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> is conductive layer <b>226</b> and <b>228</b>, respectively. These conductive layers <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> may include gold, aluminum, copper, or any other electrically conductive material. The conductive layers <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> may be, for example, approximately between 25 and 500 Î¼m in thickness. As illustrated, leads <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> may be attached to one of the conductive layers, for example, layer <b>228</b>. Additionally coupled to each of the conductive layers <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> are thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. As illustrated, the thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are electrically coupled in series and thermally coupled in parallel. The thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may be, for example, approximately between 1000 and 10,000 Î¼m in thickness and may also be semiconductors.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">For example, thermoelectric material <b>230</b> may include bismuth telluride (Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>), lead telluride (PbTe), cobalt triantimonide (CoSb<sub>3</sub>), Silicon-germanium (SiGe), or La<sub>3</sub>Te<sub>4</sub>. The thermoelectric material <b>230</b> may also be doped by introducing impurities into the thermoelectric material <b>230</b> to change its electrical properties, in this case, to introduce an impurity with a surplus of electrons to generate an N-type thermoelectric material. Thermoelectric material <b>232</b> may include SbTe<sub>3</sub>, PbTe, SiGe, CeFe<sub>4</sub>Sb<sub>12</sub>, or Yb<sub>14</sub>MnSb<sub>11</sub>. The thermoelectric material <b>232</b> may also be doped by introducing an impurity with a surplus of free charge carriers (holes) to generate a P-type thermoelectric material.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As illustrated, the thermoelectric energy harvester <b>218</b> may generate electricity in the presence of temperature differences between substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b>. For example, substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> may be coupled to interface layers. Furthermore, a heat source, such as the skin of a patient <b>117</b>, may be adjacent to substrate layer <b>224</b>, while a heat sink, such as the ambient air surrounding a patient <b>117</b>, may be adjacent to substrate layer <b>225</b>. Accordingly, because substrate layers <b>224</b> and <b>225</b> are thermally conductive, a temperature difference may be experienced at the upper portion <b>234</b> and the lower portion <b>236</b> of the thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In thermoelectric material <b>230</b>, free electrons may carry both charge and heat. Similarly, in thermoelectric material <b>232</b>, holes may carry both charge and heat. Thus, when the portions <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> of thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are exposed to different temperatures, free electrons in thermoelectric material <b>230</b> may flow from the heated portion <b>234</b> of thermoelectric material <b>230</b> to the cooler portion <b>236</b> of thermoelectric material <b>230</b>. This may generate a positive charge at the upper portion <b>234</b> and a negative charge at the lower portion <b>236</b> of thermoelectric material <b>230</b>. Simultaneously, holes in thermoelectric material <b>232</b> may flow from the heated portion <b>234</b> of thermoelectric material <b>232</b> to the cooler portion <b>236</b> of thermoelectric material <b>232</b>, creating a positive charge at the upper portion <b>234</b> and a negative charge at the lower portion <b>236</b> of thermoelectric material <b>232</b>. Furthermore, by connecting conductive layer <b>226</b> between the upper portion <b>234</b> of the thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>, and by connecting leads <b>220</b> and <b>222</b> to the lower portion <b>236</b> of the thermoelectric materials <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> (as well as to the power source <b>160</b>), a circuit may be completed (closed). Closure of this circuit may enable for the flow of current through the thermoelectric energy harvester <b>218</b> to the power source <b>160</b> for charging of the power source <b>160</b> and/or powering of the sensor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In other embodiments, a clinician could carry a means to power the wireless sensor <b>114</b> that harvests energy from ambient light. For example, the clinician may carry a light which the clinician may shine on the sensor <b>114</b>. The sensor may utilize energy harvesting techniques to convert the light into energy and power the sensor <b>114</b> when a sufficient amount of energy has been stored by the power source <b>160</b>. Alternatively, an inducting loop, or power lead from a carried battery may also be employed to power the sensor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Whichever energy harvesting technique is utilized, <figref>FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flowchart describing an embodiment of a method <b>250</b> for utilizing the energy harvesting technique to perform intermittent measurements and data transmissions. As such, the method <b>250</b> depicted begins with step <b>252</b> where the charging device <b>115</b> in the sensor <b>114</b> is harvesting energy. In step <b>254</b>, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> determines a power source energy level of the power source <b>160</b> and microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines whether the power source <b>160</b> energy level (e.g., amount of harvested energy) is sufficient to perform an intermittent measurement or to wirelessly transmit measurement data. If microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines that the amount of harvested energy is not sufficient to perform an intermittent measurement, the method <b>250</b> returns to step <b>252</b> to continue harvesting energy. However, if microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines that the amount of harvested energy is sufficient to perform an intermittent measurement, then microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines a rate for performing intermittent measurements in step <b>256</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">As discussed above, if microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines that there is or is not enough charge to perform the intermittent measurement, it may send a signal to the indicator <b>111</b> to provide a visual and/or audio indication reflecting as such. In certain embodiments, microprocessor <b>123</b> may access the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> where a predetermined rate for intermittent readings has been stored. In another embodiment, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may send a control signal to the transceiver <b>125</b> to communicate with the monitor <b>102</b> to obtain an intermittent reading rate from microprocessor <b>132</b>. As a result, the monitor <b>102</b> may send an intermittent reading rate to the sensor <b>114</b> via transceivers <b>112</b> and <b>125</b>, which the sensor <b>114</b> may then store in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>. In yet another embodiment, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may determine the intermittent reading rate dynamically without consulting the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> or the monitor <b>102</b>. The microprocessor <b>123</b> may consider several factors when determining the intermittent reading rate. Some factors may be similar to the factors for determining the intermittent measurement priority and may include when the last reading was performed, the health of the patient <b>117</b>, previous measurements, and so forth (see <figref>FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">After the rate for performing intermittent readings is determined in step <b>256</b>, microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may send control signals to the light drive circuitry <b>128</b> to activate the emitter <b>116</b> and perform intermittent readings according to the determined rate as indicated in step <b>258</b>. Optionally, in step <b>256</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may store the determined intermittent reading rate in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> for later use. It should be noted that at any time, the clinician may press the button/switch <b>113</b> on the sensor <b>114</b> to perform a reading, assuming that the sensor <b>114</b> has sufficient charge. The intermittent readings may measure any number of targeted physiological parameters including pulse rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, patient temperature, and so forth. In step <b>260</b>, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may determine the power source <b>160</b> energy level (e.g., amount of harvested energy) and the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine whether the power source energy level is sufficient to transmit one or more measurements and/or other data (e.g. amount of charge, and others which will be discussed in detail below). As previously mentioned, in some embodiments, if there is not enough energy to transmit the measurements and/or data to an external device, such as the monitor <b>102</b>, the measurements taken during the reading may be stored in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>. Alternatively, if there is sufficient energy stored in the power source <b>160</b> to transmit, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine a rate at which to transmit the one or more measurements and other data, as shown in step <b>262</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The transmission rate and the intermittent reading rate may vary, meaning intermittent readings and transmissions may occur asynchronously. Similar to determining the rate at which intermittent readings may be performed, determining the rate at which reading measurements or other data is to be transmitted may be based on a stored interval in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>, provided by the monitor <b>102</b>, or may be computed dynamically. The microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine the transmission rate dynamically by evaluating one or more update factors, which may represent various criteria for determining an appropriate quantity and rate of data to send to the monitor <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">For example, the method <b>250</b> described by the flowchart may enable determining that a stored energy level is insufficient to transmit a full dataset of data collected by the sensor <b>114</b>. Thus, the amount of data sent by the sensor <b>114</b> to the monitor <b>102</b> may be reduced as compared to transmitting all collected measurement data. As a result, the amount of power consumed by transmitting the data may be reduced. This is beneficial when the power source only has a limited charge and may not be able to send the entire dataset from the sensor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Any number of suitable update factors <b>280</b> may be considered, many of which may be described with reference to the schematic diagram depicted in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. As should be appreciated, precisely which update factors <b>280</b> may be considered by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may be predetermined or may be selected by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> based on the current condition of the patient <b>117</b> and/or the particular medical application for which the sensor <b>114</b> is being used. It should be noted that the terms âupdate intervalâ and âtransmission rateâ are used interchangeably herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">One factor <b>282</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be the stability of the data of interest obtained by the sensor <b>114</b> for a recent historical period. The sensor <b>114</b> may extract the data of interest (e.g., pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc.) from a raw stream of data (e.g., a raw 16-bit digital stream of photoplethysmographic data sampled at between approximately 50 Hz or less to 2000 Hz or more (e.g., approximately 1211 Hz)). If the data of interest is within a predetermined variability threshold over a recent historical period (e.g., 5 minutes), the factor <b>282</b> may weigh in favor of a relatively longer transmission rate. If the data of interest varies beyond the predetermined variability threshold, the factor <b>282</b> may weigh in favor of a relatively shorter update interval. The factor <b>282</b> may trigger an immediate update when the data of interest is outside the expected variability, such as if a patient's heart rate suddenly changes from a range of 70-75 bpm to 120 bpm. In determining the update interval based at least in part on the factor <b>282</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may further consider how much the data of interest has varied. For example, the greater the variability of the data of interest, the more the factor <b>282</b> may weigh in favor of a shorter update interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">A second factor <b>284</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be an absolute value of the data of interest obtained by the sensor <b>114</b>. If the data of interest is within a predetermined acceptable range of values, the factor <b>284</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively longer update interval. If the data of interest is higher or lower than the predetermined acceptable range of values, the factor <b>284</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively shorter update interval. By way of example, if the data of interest includes a respiration rate, a predetermined acceptable range of values for an adult patient may be a range of 12 to 20 breaths per minute. A respiration rate less than 12 breaths per minute or greater than 20 breaths per minute may be evaluated by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> as weighing in favor of a shorter update interval. In determining the update interval based at least in part on the factor <b>284</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may further consider how much the absolute value of the data of interest varies beyond the predetermined acceptable range. For example, the more the data of interest varies from the predetermined acceptable range, the more the factor <b>284</b> may weigh in favor of a shorter update interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">A third factor <b>286</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be the stability of extraneous sensor data or an absolute value of the extraneous sensor data. Extraneous sensor data may represent data not generally being transmitted as data of interest. By way of example, a current patient temperature may be extraneous sensor data when the data of interest is obtained from a photoplethysmographic measurement (e.g., pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc.). Like the factors <b>282</b> and/or <b>284</b>, if the extraneous sensor data exceeds a predetermined acceptable range of variability over a recent historical period, or if an absolute value of the extraneous sensor data exceeds a predetermined acceptable range of values, the factor <b>286</b> may weigh in favor of a shorter update interval. Similarly, if the extraneous sensor data remains within the predetermined acceptable range of variability over the recent historical period, or if the absolute value of the extraneous sensor data does not exceed the predetermined acceptable range of values, the factor <b>286</b> may weigh in favor of a longer update interval. By way of example, if the current patient temperature falls outside a predetermined acceptable range of values (e.g., a range of between 97.6Â° F. and 99.6Â° F.), the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may interpret the factor <b>286</b> as weighing in favor of a shorter update interval for photoplethysmographic data of interest. Also like the factors <b>282</b> and/or <b>284</b>, in determining the update interval based at least in part on the factor <b>286</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may further consider how much the extraneous sensor data has varied over time or how much the absolute value of the extraneous sensor data varies beyond the predetermined acceptable range. For example, the more the extraneous sensor data exceeds the predetermined acceptable range, the more the factor <b>286</b> may weigh in favor of a shorter update interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">Express instructions received by the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> from the patient monitor <b>102</b> may constitute a fourth factor <b>288</b> of the update factors <b>280</b>. In the course of wireless communication with the sensor <b>114</b>, the patient monitor <b>102</b> may transmit updates to sensor parameters in an acknowledgement, or ACK, packet. These sensor parameter updates from the patient monitor <b>102</b> may instruct the sensor <b>114</b> to send data at a particular interval, to send data in a continuous stream of raw data, or may provide other indications, such as a button press on the monitor <b>102</b>, which may be interrupted by the sensor <b>114</b> and used to determine the update interval. To provide one example, by pressing a button on the patient monitor <b>102</b>, medical personnel may cause the patient monitor <b>102</b> to instruct the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> to transmit the raw stream of data.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">A fifth factor <b>290</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be a press of the button or switch <b>113</b> on the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b>. If the button or switch <b>113</b> is pressed, the factor <b>290</b> may weigh in favor of a shorter update interval. For example, by pressing the button or switch <b>113</b>, the clinician may be requesting updated information at the monitor <b>102</b> and the sensor <b>114</b> may transmit the data immediately.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">A sixth factor <b>292</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be the current location of the patient <b>117</b>, which may be supplied to the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> via parameter updates from the monitor <b>102</b>. Because the amount of data from the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> that should be supplied to the patient monitor <b>102</b> may vary depending on whether the patient <b>117</b> is in surgery, in recovery, or undergoing other tests, the current location of the patient <b>117</b> may be considered as one of the update factors <b>280</b>. Thus, if the patient <b>117</b> is currently located in a medical facility room where the patient <b>117</b> should be kept under especially close scrutiny, such as an operating room, the factor <b>292</b> may weigh in favor of a correspondingly shorter update interval. If the patient <b>117</b> is currently located in a medical facility room where the patient <b>117</b> may be kept under less scrutiny, such as a recovery room, the factor <b>292</b> may weigh in favor of a longer update interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In determining the update interval based at least in part on the factor <b>292</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may give different locations different weights in favor of a shorter or longer update interval. For example, if the current location is a testing room, such as a CT room, or an operating room, the factor <b>292</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively shorter update interval. However, the factor <b>292</b> may weigh more heavily in favor of a shorter update interval if the current location of the patient <b>117</b> is the operating room. Similarly, the sensor <b>114</b> may be instructed to stop transmitting data or use a very long update interval if the patient <b>117</b> is located in close proximity to an instrument which is sensitive to wireless interference. In such a case, if the sensor <b>114</b> includes frequency hopping capabilities, the sensor <b>114</b> may select an alternate frequency or channel which does not interfere with nearby equipment or sensors located on other patients. In this way, data from a critically ill patient or patient in the operating room may be prioritized higher than patients who are relatively stable.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">A seventh factor <b>294</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be the presence or the absence of a clinician proximate to the patient <b>117</b>, which may be supplied to the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> via parameter updates from the patient monitor <b>102</b>. For example, if a clinician enters a room where the patient <b>117</b> is currently located, the factor <b>294</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively shorter update interval. If the clinician exits the room, the factor <b>294</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively longer update interval. In determining the update interval based at least in part on the factor <b>294</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may weigh the factor <b>294</b> more heavily in favor of a shorter or longer update interval based on the number or patient assignment of clinicians present. For example, if a clinician that is not assigned to the patient <b>117</b> enters a room where the patient <b>117</b> is currently located, the factor <b>294</b> may not weigh as heavily in favor of a shorter update interval as when a clinician that is assigned to the patient <b>117</b> enters the room.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">An eighth factor <b>296</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be the movement of the patient <b>117</b>, which may be indicated to the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b> via parameter updates from the patient monitor <b>102</b>. Also, if the charging device <b>115</b> utilizes kinetic energy harvesting techniques, the charging device <b>115</b> may indicate that movement is detected. If the patient <b>117</b> is currently moving, indicating that the patient <b>117</b> is not at rest or is being moved from one room to another, the factor <b>296</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively shorter update interval. If the patient <b>117</b> is not currently moving, the factor <b>296</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively longer update interval. Additionally, the amount of current patient movement may further affect the weight of the factor <b>296</b> in favor of a comparatively shorter or longer update interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">A ninth factor <b>298</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be an initialization status of the sensor <b>114</b>. For a predetermined period of time while the sensor is being initialized (e.g., 5 minutes), the update rate of the sensor <b>114</b> may be temporarily increased dramatically, such that the raw data stream is supplied to the patient monitor <b>102</b>. By supplying a raw data stream during the initialization of the sensor <b>114</b>, a clinician for other medical personnel may properly fit the sensor <b>114</b> to the patient <b>117</b>. In this way, the factor <b>298</b> may weigh very heavily in favor of a shorter update interval when the sensor <b>114</b> has recently been activated.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">A tenth factor <b>300</b> of the update factors <b>280</b> may be an amount of charge the power source <b>160</b> has in the wireless medical sensor <b>114</b>. If the power source <b>160</b> of the sensor <b>114</b> has more than a predetermined amount of sufficient charge to transmit, the factor <b>300</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively shorter update interval. If the power source <b>160</b> has less than the predetermined amount of sufficient charge to transmit, the factor <b>300</b> may weigh in favor of a comparatively longer update interval. This factor <b>300</b> may also account for the transmit power required to send error-free data at the last update. For instance, when the patient <b>117</b> is relatively far from the receiver, more transmit power may be required, so less frequent updates may take place, especially when the power source <b>160</b> is low on charge.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">Returning to <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, after the transmission rate or update interval is determined in step <b>262</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may send signals to the transceiver <b>125</b> to transmit measurement data and/or other data at the determined rate as depicted in step <b>264</b>. Optionally, in step <b>262</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may store the determined transmission rate in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> for later use. Upon transmitting the measurement data and/or other data, the sensor <b>114</b> may return to step <b>252</b> and begin the cycle again by harvesting energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">Another embodiment of a method <b>308</b> for utilizing energy harvesting to perform intermittent measurements and to transmit data is depicted by the flowchart in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. The method <b>308</b> begins at step <b>309</b> by harvesting energy using one of the means discussed above. The harvested energy is used to charge the power source <b>160</b> (e.g., energy storage component, such as a capacitor, or inductor, or rechargeable battery). As the charging device <b>115</b> is harvesting energy, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may determine a power source <b>160</b> energy level (e.g., amount of harvested energy) and the microprocessor <b>123</b> may determine whether there is enough energy to power on the sensor <b>114</b>, as shown in step <b>310</b>. If there is not enough energy stored to power on the sensor <b>114</b>, then the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may send a signal to the charging device <b>115</b> to continue harvesting energy, and the method may return to step <b>309</b>. However, as seen in step <b>312</b>, if there is enough energy to power on the sensor <b>114</b>, then the sensor <b>114</b> may power on. Additionally, if there is sufficient energy to perform an intermittent measurement or a data transmission, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> may send a signal to the indicator <b>111</b> signifying as such. As a result, the indicator <b>111</b> may provide an audio and/or visual indication that there is sufficient charge to perform an operation.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">Once powered on, the microprocessors <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine the priority of intermittent measurement collection and data transmission as show in step <b>314</b>. As previously discussed, the data collection and data transmission may be asynchronous and not occur at the same time. For example, the intermittent measurement and the wireless transmission of the collected data may be separated by a time period sufficient to recharge the power source <b>160</b>. Since there may only be enough energy stored in the power source <b>160</b> to perform either the intermittent measurement or data transmission, the priority of each may be determined by the sensor <b>114</b> or monitor <b>102</b> to decide which action to execute. Priority of the intermittent measurement and the transmission may be computed dynamically by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b>. In one embodiment, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may take into account one or more patient and environmental factors (e.g. intermittent measurement schedule, health of the patient, transmission schedule, etc.) when dynamically deciding the priority to assign the intermittent measurement and the transmission.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Indeed, <figref>FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic diagram of various factors that may be utilized with the method <b>308</b> of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment. It should be noted that none of the factors may be dispositive and the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may take into account one or more of the factors when determining the priority of performing an intermittent measurement or data transmission.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">A first factor <b>332</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be the health status of the patient. The patient's health status may be determined by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> by analyzing previously stored measurements in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b> or by performing a measurement and analyzing the results. If, for example, the patient's pulse rate is abnormally high, this factor <b>332</b> may weigh in favor of transmitting data to the monitor <b>102</b> in order for the monitor <b>102</b> to warn the clinician that the patient may be in danger. Likewise, if the patient's pulse rate is abnormally high, this factor may weigh against performing an intermittent measurement. This may be because the sensor <b>114</b> may only have enough energy to perform a measurement or transmit data and it may be more important to transmit the pulse rate data to the monitor <b>102</b> in order to warn the clinician. Thus, this factor <b>332</b> may increase the transmission's priority and decrease the intermittent measurements's priority. On the other hand, if the patient's measurements are within acceptable ranges, this factor <b>332</b> may weigh in favor of performing an intermittent measurement and weigh against transmitting data because there may not be as big of a need to alert the clinician that the patient <b>117</b> is doing well.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">A second factor <b>334</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be an intermittent measurement schedule. For example, if the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines that the next scheduled intermittent measurement is very near in time, this factor <b>334</b> may weigh in favor of transmitting previous measurements that may have been stored in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>. Thus, the transmission's priority may be increased. However, if the next scheduled intermittent measurement is not for a long time, this may weigh in favor of performing an intermittent measurement and the intermittent measurement's priority may be increased. This is especially important when a patient is on the cusp of being in danger (e.g., increasing pulse rate) and readings closer in time are important to safely monitor the patient's well being.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">A third factor <b>336</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be a transmission schedule. Like the intermittent measurement schedule, the transmission schedule may provide important information for the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> when determining the priority of the intermittent measurement and the transmission. For example, if the last transmission occurred a long time ago, it may be important to transmit the measurements that have since taken place. Thus, this factor <b>336</b> may weigh in favor of increasing the transmission's priority. However, if the last transmission occurred recently, this factor may weigh against transmitting data and in favor of performing an intermittent measurement. Thus, this factor <b>336</b> may increase an intermittent measurement's priority accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">A fourth factor <b>338</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be prior measurements. For example, if prior measurements indicate that the blood oxygen saturation and/or pulse rate are abnormal, it may be more important to transmit that information to the monitor <b>102</b> in order to alert a clinician. Thus, the transmission's priority may be increased. However, if the prior measurements are within acceptable ranges, this factor <b>338</b> may weigh in favor of performing an intermittent measurement and against transmitting data because there is not a need to alert the clinician. Further, there may only be enough energy stored in the power source <b>160</b> to either perform an intermittent measurement or transmit data. In such a case, it may be more beneficial to perform another intermittent measurement to determine whether the measurements remain acceptable.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">A fifth factor <b>340</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be instructions from the monitor <b>102</b>. For example, if a clinician presses a button on the monitor <b>102</b> to update the measurements, the monitor <b>102</b> may send a request to the sensor <b>114</b>. This request may either notify the sensor <b>114</b> to send the most recent measurements or it may request that the sensor <b>114</b> perform an intermittent measurement and transmit the data as soon as possible. Thus, depending on the instructions from the monitor <b>102</b>, the data transmission or intermittent measurement's priority may be increased or decreased accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">A sixth factor <b>342</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be an amount of charge stored in the power source <b>160</b>. Transmitting data may require more energy than performing an intermittent measurement, or vice versa. Thus, if the amount of charge in the power source <b>160</b> is low, this factor <b>342</b> may weigh in favor of performing an intermittent measurement because it may not even be possible to transmit data. On the other hand, if the amount of charge stored in the power source <b>160</b> is sufficient to transmit data, this factor <b>342</b> may weigh in favor of transmitting data and against performing an intermittent measurement. Thus, the data transmission's priority may be increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">As mentioned, this factor <b>342</b>, along with the other factors, may be considered in conjunction with any of the previously mentioned factors. To illustrate, this factor <b>342</b> may weigh against performing data transmission because there is insufficient energy to transmit. However, factor <b>336</b> may weigh in favor of transmission because the last transmission occurred a long time ago. Thus, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine that even though this factor <b>342</b> weighs in favor of performing an intermittent measurement and against transmission, the other factor <b>336</b> that weighs in favor of transmission carries more weight in this scenario. Therefore, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine that it is more important to continue harvesting energy until a sufficient amount is stored to transmit data. Further, postponing performing an intermittent measurement to obtain enough energy to transmit data may become more important when the patient's health status (factor <b>332</b>) is poor and transmitting that information to the monitor <b>102</b> is crucial to alert the clinician.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">A seventh factor <b>344</b> of the priority factors <b>330</b> may be a triggering event. In certain embodiments, there are various triggering events that may increase the priority of the intermittent measurement or data transmission. For example, an intermittent measurement may be triggered when a patient is undergoing a cardiac stress test and is wearing a pulse oximeter sensor <b>114</b> that is measuring the patient's blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Thus, the intermittent measurement's priority may be increased in order to continuously monitor the patient's physiological parameters during the stress test. A triggering event that may increase the transmission's priority may be when an intermittent measurement is performed and abnormal results are obtained by the sensor <b>114</b>. It should be noted that the same event that triggers an intermittent measurement may also generate the energy required to perform the measurement. Take, for example, the cardiac stress test scenario mentioned. An ambulatory sensor <b>114</b> designed to record data during the cardiac stress testing may collect charge and switch on by harvesting the kinetic energy of the patient <b>117</b> undergoing the test.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">Returning to <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, specifically step <b>316</b>, after the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> has determined the priority of performing the intermittent measurement and data transmission, it may determine which has a higher priority. As may be seen, if the transmission of data has a higher priority, the method moves to step <b>318</b> where the charging control circuit <b>162</b> determines the power source <b>160</b> energy level (e.g. amount of harvested energy) and the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines whether there is enough energy to transmit data. If there is not enough energy to transmit, the method <b>308</b> returns to step <b>309</b> to harvest energy. If there is enough energy to transmit, the transceiver <b>125</b> may transmit the measurement data and/or other data in step <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">However, if the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines that the transmission does not have a higher priority than performing an intermittent measurement, the charging control circuit <b>162</b> determines the power source <b>160</b> energy level (e.g. amount of harvested energy) and the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines whether there is enough charged energy to perform an intermittent measurement (step <b>322</b>). If there is not enough energy to perform an intermittent measurement, the method <b>308</b> returns to step <b>309</b> to harvest energy. If there is enough energy to perform an intermittent measurement, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may send a signal to the light drive circuitry <b>128</b> (via transceivers <b>112</b> and <b>125</b>) to operate the emitter <b>116</b> and perform a measurement, as shown in step <b>324</b>. In step <b>326</b>, after the intermittent measurement is performed, the measurement data may be stored in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Once either data is transmitted according to step <b>320</b> or data is stored according to step <b>326</b>, the method <b>308</b> may return to step <b>314</b> to determine the priority of performing an intermittent measurement or transmitting data. As may be appreciated, the priority factors may have changed since the determination was made last time. In particular, the patient's health status may be updated if a measurement was performed, the intermittent measurement schedule may be updated, the transmission schedule may be updated, and so forth. As may be seen, the method <b>308</b> may continue to cycle through appropriate steps until there is insufficient energy to perform an intermittent measurement and/or transmit data. At such time, the method <b>308</b> returns to step <b>309</b> to harvest more energy.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">Turning to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, which is a flowchart describing yet another embodiment of a method <b>348</b> for utilizing energy harvesting to perform intermittent measurements and transmit data. The method <b>348</b> begins at step <b>349</b> by harvesting energy to store in the power source <b>160</b>. In step <b>350</b>, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> determines whether a triggering event is detected. As previously discussed, triggering events may vary for performing intermittent measurements and transmitting data. For example, a cardiac stress test may trigger an intermittent measurement and an abnormal measurement may trigger a transmission. If a triggering event is not detected, the method <b>348</b> returns to step <b>349</b> to continue harvesting energy. However, if a triggering event is detected, the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> may determine whether the event triggers an intermittent measurement in step <b>352</b>. If an intermittent measurement is triggered, a determination may be made by the charging control circuit <b>162</b> of the amount of energy harvested (e.g. power source <b>160</b> energy level) and by the microprocessor <b>123</b> or <b>132</b> of whether there is sufficient energy stored in the power source <b>160</b> to perform the intermittent measurement (step <b>354</b>). If there is insufficient energy stored, the method <b>348</b> returns to step <b>349</b> to harvest energy. However, if there is sufficient energy stored, the method proceeds to step <b>356</b> to perform the intermittent measurement and to step <b>358</b> to store the data in the non-volatile memory <b>127</b>. After the data is stored, the method may return to monitoring whether a triggering event is detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">If an intermittent measurement is not triggered at step <b>352</b>, the method <b>348</b> may proceed to step <b>360</b> to determine whether there is enough energy stored in the power source <b>160</b> to transmit the measurement data and other data. If there is insufficient energy stored, the method <b>348</b> may return to step <b>349</b> to harvest energy. However, if there is sufficient energy stored, the microprocessor <b>123</b> may signal the transceiver <b>125</b> to transmit the measurement data and other data to the monitor <b>102</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Example embodiments of data types that may be transmitted with the methods of <figref>FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>9</b> are depicted in the schematic diagram in <figref>FIG. 10</figref>. A first type of data <b>370</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be physiological measurements. As previously discussed, these measurements may include pulse rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, patient temperature, among others. A second type of data <b>372</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be charge information. For example, the sensor <b>114</b> may communicate wirelessly with the monitor <b>102</b> the degree to which the sensor <b>114</b> is charged, type of battery-less power source <b>160</b>, type of energy harvesting technique utilized, and so forth. This may be useful for the monitor <b>102</b> in determining what instructions to provide to the sensor <b>114</b>. For example, if the sensor <b>114</b> is very low on charge, the monitor <b>102</b> may not issue an instruction to transmit data because transmission may require more energy available in the sensor <b>114</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">A third type of data <b>374</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be an intermittent measurement schedule <b>374</b>. The intermittent measurement schedule may include information such as the next scheduled intermittent measurement, the last measurement time, the rate at which intermittent measurements are being performed, and so forth. The intermittent measurement schedule may be useful to the monitor <b>102</b> in determining whether to send out a request for measurements if the next scheduled intermittent measurement is not due for a while or to wait until the next scheduled intermittent measurement. Further, a fourth type of data <b>376</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be a transmission schedule <b>376</b>. Like the intermittent measurement schedule, the transmission schedule <b>376</b> may be beneficial to the monitor <b>102</b> when it is determining when to send a request to the sensor <b>114</b> to transmit data. For example, if the next scheduled transmission is not to occur for a while, the monitor <b>102</b> may request the sensor <b>114</b> to transmit data before the scheduled time.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">A fifth type of data <b>378</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be event information. As previously discussed there may be various events that trigger an intermittent measurement or data transmission. The information associated with the triggering events may be useful for the monitor <b>102</b> when it is analyzing the measurements. For example, a cardiac stress test may trigger an intermittent measurement, which may record an elevated pulse rate. Instead of determining that the patient is in danger due to the elevated pulse rate, the monitor <b>102</b> may determine that the elevated pulse rate is normal in light of the cardiac stress test and that the patient is fine. A sixth type of data <b>380</b> of the transmitted data types <b>368</b> may be a request for instructions from the monitor <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, a sensor <b>114</b> may request the monitor <b>102</b> to provide it with an intermittent measurement schedule and/or transmission schedule, among other things.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">It should be noted that the above mentioned types of data that may be transmitted <b>368</b> by the sensor <b>114</b> are exemplary only and not exclusive. Each type of data may be transmitted individually or in any combination with the other types discussed.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">Additionally, it should be appreciated that the methods <b>250</b>, <b>308</b>, and <b>348</b> discussed above may be combined in further embodiments. For example, a method may include a charging device <b>115</b> encapsulated in a sensor <b>114</b> harvesting energy and the sensor <b>114</b> performing an intermittent measurement based upon one or more of a power source <b>160</b> charge level, a determined intermittent measurement rate, a determined intermittent measurement priority, or an intermittent measurement triggering event. Likewise, the embodiment may involve the transceiver <b>125</b> transmitting data to the monitor <b>102</b> based upon one more of a power source <b>160</b> charge level, a determined transmission rate, a determined transmission priority, or a transmission triggering event.</p>
