      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a compartment storage device which contains plural connectors securely connected with a plurality of plates so as to form a single cabinet or a multi-cabinet assembly.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A conventional single cabinet or multi-cabinet assembly is employed to store objects and is assembled or dissembled by a user by ways of hand tool(s). However, such an assembly or disassembly is troublesome, for example, it is inconvenient for the user to remove related parts of the single cabinet or the multi-cabinet assembly before discarding the single cabinet or the multi-cabinet assembly, so the user will discard single cabinet or the multi-cabinet assembly directly without removing the related parts, thus damaging environment and increasing the space of garbage.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
