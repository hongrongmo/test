      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This disclosure is related to fire pits in general and, more particularly, to gas a powered fire pit with a retractable burner.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Appliances are available that produce no flames, yet provide adequate heat and light for outdoor activities. However, for aesthetic and other reasons, consumers often prefer to have an arrangement where visible combustion may be observed. Bonfires, campfires, open fire pits, chimineas, and fireplaces are but a few examples of heating and/or lighting implements having open, or at least visible, flames. However, the setup time and maintenance of these devices is inconvenient. Ignition of fires can be frustrating and time consuming. Another inconvenience is finding and maintaining an adequate fuel supply. Wood piles draw pests and unless the wood is kept covered and dry it can be prone to rot. Dealing with ashes from wood fires is yet another hassle. Furthermore, fire appliances may be decorative or attractively constructed, but they may not be considered useful when there is no fire providing heat or light.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">What is needed is a system and device for addressing the above, and related concerns.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The invention of the present disclosure, in one aspect thereof, comprises a base having an open top, an aperture coaxial with the open top of the base, and an actuator. The device includes a cover for the aperture that is moveable between a first closed position and a second open position in response to a first displacement of the actuator, and a platform moveable from a first lower position within the base to a second raised position proximate the tabletop in response to a second displacement of the actuator. In some embodiments, separate actuators may be used to effect movement of the cover and the platform, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In some embodiments, the cover for the aperture further comprises a multi-leaved iris having a first closed position where the leaves are closed over the open top of the base and a second closed position where the leaves are displaced away from the open top of the base.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The actuator may be attached to an upper guide member that receives a follower from each of the plurality of iris leaves and displaces the followers within a plurality of tracks to move the aperture between the open and closed positions. In another embodiment, the actuator is attached to a lower guide member that receives at least one follower from the platform and displaces the at least one follower within at least one track to move the platform between the lower and upper positions.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In further embodiments, the actuator comprises a rim proximate and below an outer edge of a table top surrounding the aperture, an attached upper guide member that receives a plurality of followers attached to the plurality of iris leaves, and an attached lower guide member that receives at least one follower attached to the platform. The upper guide member moves the iris leaves by displacement of the received iris leaf followers in response to the first displacement of the actuator. The lower guide member moves the platform by displacement of the at least one platform follower in response to the second displacement of the actuator.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The upper guide member may have at least one track receiving an iris follower, the track defining a first, translating section adjacent to a second, non-translating section, the translating section providing for displacement of the received iris follower and the non-translating section allowing rotation of the upper guide member without displacement of the received iris follower. The lower guide member may have at least one track receiving the at least one follower attached to the platform, the track defining a first inclined, sloped, or angled section adjacent to a second, level section, the inclined section providing for elevation and lowering of the received follower and the level section allowing rotation of the lower guide member with no elevation change to the received follower. The upper guide member may be affixed to the lower guide member such that the translating section of the upper guide member is positioned atop the level section of the lower guide member and the non-translating section of the upper guide member is positioned atop the included section of the lower guide member.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Some embodiments provide a platform guide member that receives the at least one follower from the platform and substantially restricts rotation of the platform. The platform may comprise a gas burner. A drawer may be contained within the base for retaining an operational fuel container for the gas burner. The device may include a heat shield in the base that shields the fuel container from the gas burner.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The invention of the present disclosure, in another aspect thereof, comprises a device with a base having an open top, a tabletop positioned proximate the open top of the base and having an aperture coaxial with the open top of the base, a cover for the aperture moveable between a first closed position and a second open position in response to a displacement of a first follower, and a platform moveable from a first lower position within the base to a second raised position proximate the tabletop in response to a displacement of a second follower. In some embodiments the cover comprises a multi-bladed iris with the first follower attached to at least one of the blades. The platform may further comprise a gas burner.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The disclosed device may also comprise an upper guide member defining at least one track that receives the first follower and displaces it to effect opening of the aperture in response to rotation of the first guide member relative to the base. The at least one track of the upper guide member may have a first section that displaces the follower from an inner position, corresponding to the closed position of the cover, to an outer position, corresponding to the open position of the cover, and the guide member may have a second section that allows the guide member to rotate but retains the follower in the outer position.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1A</figref>, a perspective view of an outdoor appliance with a retractable platform in a retracted position is shown. The appliance <b>100</b> comprises a multipart pedestal or base <b>102</b> supporting a top <b>104</b>. The top <b>104</b> may serve as a tabletop for dining and other activities. The top <b>104</b> may be circular, as shown, or may have other shapes. In the present embodiment the top <b>104</b> has a cover <b>106</b> proximate a center thereof that covers closes an aperture <b>107</b> in the top <b>104</b>. In the present embodiment the cover <b>106</b> operates in an iris-like fashion to selectively open and close in response to movement of an actuator <b>108</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The particular operation of the cover <b>106</b> and other components of the appliance <b>100</b> will be described in greater detail below. However, it can be seen from the present viewpoint that the actuator <b>108</b> comprises a ledge or rim along an outer portion or periphery of the top <b>104</b>. The actuator <b>108</b> may be grasped and moved in a clockwise manner as shown by the arrow A to open the cover <b>106</b>. The actuator <b>108</b> may be moved in a counterclockwise manner as shown by the arrow B to close the cover <b>106</b>. In the present embodiment, the actuator <b>108</b> is allowed to rotate independently from the pedestal <b>102</b> and the top <b>104</b> such that the appliance <b>100</b> itself does not move or turn when the actuator <b>108</b> is utilized to open or close the cover <b>106</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, a perspective view of the appliance <b>100</b> with the retractable platform <b>110</b> in an elevated position is shown. In the view of <figref>FIG. 1B</figref>, the actuator <b>108</b> has been utilized to retract or open the cover <b>106</b> exposing the fire bowl <b>110</b>. In the present embodiment, the platform <b>110</b> comprises a fire bowl containing rocks, pebbles, glass, water, or other media through which gas or flames escape when the fire pit <b>100</b> is operational.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a side view of the appliance <b>100</b> is shown. In some embodiments, the platform <b>110</b> sits at or slightly above the level of the top <b>104</b> when fully elevated. The top <b>104</b> sits over the separate actuator rim <b>108</b>. These all sit atop the multipart pedestal <b>102</b>. In various embodiments, the pedestal <b>102</b> may provide one or more feet <b>202</b>. Further, the various embodiments described herein are shown with a platform <b>110</b> comprising a fire bowl elevating from, or contained within, the pedestal <b>102</b>. However, it is understood that other desired implements may be substituted or added. For example, a cooler or other storage device may be contained within the pedestal <b>102</b> and accessed as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, an exploded perspective view of the appliance <b>100</b> is shown. In the present embodiment, the top <b>104</b> includes a frame <b>304</b> to which a number of covers <b>302</b> are attached. The covers <b>302</b> form the upper surface of the top <b>104</b> which may be utilized for dining or other purposes. In the present embodiment, the cover <b>106</b> comprises a plurality of iris leaves <b>306</b>. Three leaves <b>306</b> are shown here but more or fewer leaves are also contemplated. It is also understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the particular illustrated shape of the iris leaves <b>306</b>. However, in some embodiments the leaves <b>306</b> are shaped such that the plurality of leaves cooperate to substantially cover or close the entire aperture <b>107</b>. The leaves <b>306</b> selectively open or close to reveal the platform <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the platform <b>110</b> comprises a fire bowl, and although the leaves <b>306</b> may not come into contact with flame, nor be placed over the fire bowl <b>110</b> when it is active, they may be constructed from a metal or heat resistant material in the event that a user closes the fire pit <b>100</b> when the fire bowl <b>110</b> is still hot.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">From the exploded view of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> it can be seen that, in the present embodiment, the pedestal or base <b>102</b> defines an opening under the top <b>104</b>. The top <b>104</b> covers the open-topped pedestal <b>102</b> with the aperture <b>107</b> approximately centered over the pedestal <b>102</b>. The aperture <b>107</b> is opened and closed (via the iris leaves <b>306</b>) to selectively expose the platform <b>110</b>. As explained more thoroughly below, the mechanism for opening and closing the cover <b>106</b> may be a track and follower arrangement. A guide member <b>308</b> may define the tracks that move the iris leaves <b>306</b>. As explained below, the guide member <b>308</b> also provides functionality for elevating and lowering the platform <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The pedestal <b>102</b> comprises a number of additional components, including one or more pedestal sections <b>310</b>. In the present embodiment the pedestal sections <b>310</b> serve as decorative covers to the multipart pedestal <b>102</b>. The sections <b>310</b> may comprise a metal or polymer of any shape and size and may be provided with a decorative surface. It is contemplated that the appliance <b>100</b> is at least somewhat portable in that it may be moved between locations when fully assembled. In the present embodiment, there are two pedestal sections <b>310</b> that cooperate with a third pedestal section operating as a drawer <b>312</b>. The drawer <b>312</b> may provide a shelf <b>314</b> for securely retaining a gas cylinder (not shown) providing gas when the platform <b>110</b> comprises a fire bowl. In some embodiments, standard 20 pound propane cylinders may be utilized.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the present embodiment, the pedestal sections <b>310</b> and the shelf <b>314</b> may be attached to a pedestal frame <b>316</b>. The pedestal frame <b>316</b> also provides a plurality of slides <b>318</b> for receiving the shelf <b>314</b> and/or drawer <b>312</b>. The frame <b>316</b> may be provided with one or more feet <b>202</b> for stabilization. In some embodiments the drawer <b>312</b> and/or pedestal sections <b>310</b> may also be provided with feet <b>202</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As was shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, platform <b>110</b> may comprise a fire bowl filled with fire resistant media such as gravel, stones, glass, or water. From <figref>FIG. 3</figref> it can be seen that the fire bowl <b>110</b> further comprises an elevating and lowering platform in the form of a burner <b>320</b>. In some embodiments the media is placed within the burner <b>320</b> which provides the gas supply for combustion. In addition to providing for opening and closing of the cover <b>106</b>, the guide member <b>308</b> may also provide for timed elevation and lowering of the burner <b>320</b>. As the burner <b>320</b> has no need to rotate, a number of tracks <b>324</b> may be defined in a burner guide <b>322</b> that guides the burner <b>320</b> to allow elevation changes without rotation. In some embodiments a heat shield <b>326</b> is provided and attached to the frame <b>316</b> to isolate the gas cylinder (not shown) from any excess heat coming from the burner <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIGS. 4-7</figref> provide additional detail on various components that are shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. A more thorough understanding of the components discussed below will be helpful in understanding the operation of the appliance <b>100</b>. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a perspective view of an underside of an iris member <b>306</b>. Each of the iris members <b>306</b> has a pivot attachment point <b>402</b> and an attached follower <b>404</b>. One or more of the iris members <b>306</b> may be provided with an attached thermocouple <b>406</b>. The thermocouple <b>406</b> provides a voltage based upon exposure to heat. As explained more fully below, the thermocouple <b>406</b> may be utilized as a safety device for preventing over heating or burning of the iris members <b>306</b> and/or other components of the device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of the burner <b>320</b> showing a gas supply ring <b>502</b> that provides fuel to the burner <b>320</b>. As will be explained more fully below, a thermocouple <b>510</b> may be provided within or attached to the burner <b>320</b>. A protective cover <b>512</b> (shown in cutaway) may be provided for preventing any of the fire resistant media from contaminating or damaging the thermocouple <b>510</b>. A plurality of followers <b>504</b> may also be attached to the burner <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">The guide member <b>308</b> of the present embodiment includes two major subcomponents: an upper guide member <b>602</b>, shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>; and a lower guide member <b>702</b>, shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. In the present embodiment these two components are affixed together but they are shown separated here for clarity and purposes of illustration.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a top down view of the upper guide member <b>602</b>. The upper guide member <b>602</b> is primarily responsible for the opening and closing of the cover <b>106</b> via movement of the iris leaves <b>306</b>. A plurality of tracks <b>604</b> are provided by the upper guide member <b>602</b>. In the present embodiment each of the tracks <b>604</b> comprises two separate sections. A translating section <b>606</b> is provided, along with a non-translating section <b>608</b>. The followers <b>404</b> of the iris leaves <b>306</b> each fit within one of the tracks <b>604</b>. When the guide member <b>308</b> is rotated, the upper guide member <b>602</b> displaces the end of the iris leaves <b>306</b>, to which the follower <b>404</b> is attached. With the pivot point <b>402</b> rigidly affixed to a non-rotating portion of the appliance <b>100</b> (e.g., such as the frame <b>316</b>) the iris leaves <b>306</b> will function to open and close in an iris-like fashion in response to rotation of the upper guide member <b>602</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">It will be appreciated that, due to the configuration of the tracks <b>604</b>, the iris leaves <b>306</b> will only translate (e.g., open or close) when the followers <b>404</b> are within the translating section <b>606</b> of the tracks <b>604</b> of the upper guide member <b>602</b>. This radial section is illustrated for each of the tracks <b>604</b> by the segment marker C. Additional rotation of the upper guide member <b>602</b> relative to the associated followers <b>404</b> of the iris leaves <b>306</b> is allowed by movement of the followers <b>404</b> through the non-translating section <b>608</b> of the tracks <b>604</b>. This radial rotational segment is marked D in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> shows a perspective view of a lower guide member <b>702</b>. In the present embodiment, the lower guide member <b>702</b> may be affixed to the upper guide member <b>602</b> such that the marked segments C and D align. In such case, the lower guide member <b>702</b> will rotate along with the upper guide member <b>602</b> as the unitary guide member <b>308</b>. The lower guide member <b>702</b> is primarily responsible for elevation and/or lowering of the burner <b>320</b>. In the present embodiment, a plurality of tracks <b>704</b> are provided that interact with the plurality of guides <b>504</b> of the burner <b>320</b>. The tracks <b>704</b> each provide a level portion <b>706</b> along the segment C of the lower guide member <b>702</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Segment C of <figref>FIG. 7</figref> corresponds with segment C of <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. Rotating with the guides <b>504</b> in segment C does not provide any elevation change to the burner <b>320</b>. This allows the iris leaves <b>306</b> to be translated away from the burner <b>320</b> by the upper guide member <b>602</b>. In the tracks <b>704</b> adjacent to the level portions <b>706</b> is an inclined, sloped, or angled portion <b>708</b>. The portion <b>708</b> departs in its direction from the plane or the top or bottom of the guide member <b>702</b> (e.g., it moves toward or away from such planes). When lower guide member <b>702</b> is rotated in a clockwise direction, the guides will be elevated by the portion <b>708</b>. The burner <b>320</b> is isolated from the possibility of rotating (rather than, or in addition to, elevating) owing to the fact that the followers <b>504</b> also fit within the slots <b>324</b> of the burner guide <b>322</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">Because there will be at least some amount of load bearing placed on the lower guide member <b>702</b> by the guides <b>504</b>, stops may be machined into the tracks <b>704</b>. For example, a lower stop <b>710</b> may be provided as a bump in the track <b>704</b> such that the fire pit <b>100</b> may be secured against inadvertent opening or rotation. One or more intermediate stops <b>712</b> may be machined in the tracks <b>704</b> such that a user does not have to completely elevate the burner <b>320</b> with one movement, or retain the actuator <b>108</b> against reversal while changing hands. Finally, an upper stop <b>714</b> may be provided as a machined valley near the upper most portion of the inclined portion <b>708</b> such that the burner <b>320</b> may be brought to rest at or near the fully elevated position.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">It will be appreciated that, in operation, the actuator <b>108</b> controls the movement of the entire guide member <b>308</b>, which comprises the upper guide member <b>602</b> in combination with the lower guide member <b>702</b>. In response to a first predetermined amount of clockwise rotation of the actuator <b>108</b>, the cover <b>106</b> will be completely opened. In response to a further rotation of the actuator <b>108</b> in the clockwise direction, the platform <b>110</b> will be elevated into place at or near the top <b>104</b> of the appliance <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Various ignition and extinguishing mechanisms may be employed as are known in the art. Following extinguishing the burner <b>320</b>, the actuator <b>108</b> may be rotated in a counterclockwise direction whereupon the platform <b>110</b> will be retracted into the pedestal <b>102</b>. Upon further counterclockwise rotation, the cover <b>106</b> will return to its closed position and an iris-like fashion. In the present embodiment, a single actuator <b>108</b> controls the opening of the cover <b>106</b> and the elevation of the platform <b>110</b>. However, in other embodiments separate actuators could be utilized. Where separate actuators are utilized, the upper guide member <b>602</b> may be separated from the lower guide member <b>702</b>. In such case, a user may wish to be mindful that the cover <b>106</b> is open prior to elevating the platform <b>110</b> into position. It should also be understood that opening and closing of the cover <b>106</b> and/or elevating and lowering of the platform <b>110</b> could be accomplished by other means, including those that are mechanical or hydraulic in nature. These may be interrelated as in the case of the joined upper guide member <b>602</b> and lower guide member <b>702</b>, or may be separately operable.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 8</figref> a schematic diagram of a thermocouple-based safety system <b>800</b> according to aspects of the present disclosure is shown. It is understood that the system <b>800</b> may be utilized within any of the embodiments described herein. As described above, various embodiments of the present disclosure may be adapted to utilize commercially available gas cylinders that may be stored in the pedestal of base <b>102</b>. One such cylinder <b>802</b> of the 20-pound size is shown for illustration in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. A standard gas fitting <b>804</b> may be used to supply gas into the system <b>800</b>. A magnet valve <b>806</b> may be placed on a supply line <b>807</b> connecting the cylinder <b>802</b> to the burner <b>320</b>. The magnet valve <b>806</b> may be electrically connected via connection <b>808</b> to the thermocouple <b>406</b> affixed to one of the iris leaves <b>306</b>. The thermocouple <b>510</b> may be affixed within, or in close proximity to, the burner <b>320</b>, and electrically connected to the magnet valve <b>806</b> via electrical connection <b>812</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In operation, it may be desirable to ensure that gas is only supplied to the burner <b>320</b> when a flame is still being produced by the burner <b>320</b> (e.g., it has not blown out or otherwise been extinguished). Additionally, gas should only be supplied to the burner <b>320</b> when the device <b>100</b> is in an opened configuration to avoid burning of the iris members <b>306</b> and/or other components of the device <b>100</b>. The thermocouple <b>406</b> produces an electric current in response to application of heat. Hence the electrical connection <b>808</b> will allow the thermocouple <b>406</b> to control the magnetic valve <b>806</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The magnetic valve <b>806</b> may be configured in a normally open configuration if there is no signal from the thermocouple <b>406</b>, but may close in response to such a signal or voltage. The valve <b>806</b> may also close if no signal is received via electrical connection <b>812</b> from the thermocouple <b>510</b>, which would indicate an absence of flame from the burner <b>320</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In other embodiments, the magnetic valve <b>306</b> could be a plurality of valves. In such an embodiment, a first valve may be in a normally open configuration and close in response to a current from the thermocouple <b>306</b>. A second magnetic valve may be in a normally closed configuration that will only remain open in response to a voltage from the thermocouple <b>810</b> which indicates that the flame is still alight.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, a top down view of another embodiment of an appliance <b>900</b> with a retractable platform a retracted position is shown. In this embodiment, a top <b>904</b> itself is the actuator (e.g., the whole table top rotates to actuate opening/closing and elevation/lowering). The top <b>904</b> comprises a number of discrete sections <b>906</b> that cooperate to selectively cover the enclosed fire bowl and burner. Chairs <b>907</b> are shown that correspond to each such section <b>906</b>. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates the change in the configuration when the sections <b>906</b> are rotated and translated relative to one another to reveal the platform <b>910</b>, which may comprise a fire pit or other implement or device. As with previous embodiments, a system of tracks and followers may be used to implement the movement of the sections <b>906</b> and/or any elevation or lowering of the platform <b>910</b>. As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 9B</figref>, each chair retains access to its associated portion of the top <b>904</b>. Even though the configuration of the top <b>904</b> has changed to reveal and accommodate the fire bowl <b>910</b>, the top <b>904</b> remains usable. <figref>FIG. 9C</figref> is a perspective view of the fire pit <b>900</b>.
