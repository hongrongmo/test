    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">The present disclosure provides methods for estimating cancer susceptibility, risk of developing multiple tumor sites, and the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Disclosed are interactions among three polymorphisms: the Acid Phosphatase Locus-1 (ACP1) 228C&gt;T (rs11553742) and 413A&gt;G (Q106R, rs79716074) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and a SNP for the Astrocyte Elevated Gene-1 (AEG1) (rs2438211). Additionally interactions among these polymorphisms are disclosed to modify the underlying quantitative expression of major cancer-related genes, indicating that optimization of these gene products by pharmacologic or gene therapy interventions would be beneficial as a cancer therapy to reduce the risk of tumor metastasis, and would also be beneficial in preventing cancer.</p>

      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to genetic methods of estimating cancer susceptibility, risk among cancer cases of developing multiple tumor sites, and risk among prostate cancer cases of having a more aggressive tumor type requiring either prostatectomy or orchiectomy.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Genetic variants predicting cancer susceptibility are important primarily because they identify molecules and pathways involved in tumorigenesis that may have implications for pharmaceutical development. However, most variants are likely to have only marginal pre-diagnostic relevance and, excepting the rare mutations of BRCA1, BRCA2 and HER2, they have limited post-diagnostic impact on patient care. The greater need in cancer genetics is the identification of variants that distinguish slow-growing tumors from more fast-growing lethal tumors, both to facilitate novel drug therapies and to signal the need for more aggressive treatment regimens.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">A recent review of genetic risk prediction in complex diseases concluded that only a few molecular genetic variables have been found to play an important role in historical risk predictions: BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Jostins, L., and Barrett, J. C., <i>Hum. Mol. Genet. </i>20(R2):R182-8 (2011)). This view is widely held despite large scale studies showing that among incident breast cancer cases only 2.9% carried BRCA1 mutations and 2.2% had BRCA2 mutations (Goodwin, P. J., et al., <i>J. Clin. Oncol</i>. 30(1):19-26 (2012)). Similarly, results from the NCI Breast and Prostate Consortium (Lindström, S., et al. <i>Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. </i>21(3):437-44 (2012)) revealed that the cumulative percent of the variance in prostate cancer risk accounted for by the additive power of 25 of the most common prostate cancer genetic markers was only 4%. These studies serve to underscore the need for a shift away from additive gene-gene model towards a more comprehensive multiplicative model of disease risk profiles.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are defined as genetic variation in a DNA sequence of a particular gene. SNPs are usually considered to be point mutations can occur in coded or non-coded regions. Point mutations have been evolutionarily successful enough to recur in a significant proportion of the population and these variants may or may not affect the function of the gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC was initially identified as a HIV-1-inducible gene in primary human fetal astrocytes (Kang, D. C., et al., Gene 353(1):8-15 (2005); and Su, Z. Z., et al., <i>Oncogene </i>21(22):3592-602 (2002)). Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) over expressed in human brain and prostate cancers promotes angiogenesis and metastasis (Emdad, L., et al., <i>Pharmacol. Ther. </i>114(2):155-70 (2007), erratum in <i>Pharmacol. Ther. </i>115(1):176 (2007); Hu, G., et al., <i>Clin Cancer Res. </i>15(18):5615-20 (2009); and Song, L., et al., <i>J. Pathol. </i>219(3):317-26 (2009)). Astrocyte Elevated Gene-1 (AEG-1) is ubiquitously overexpressed in all or most cancers and plays a regulatory role in diverse and multiple processes of carcinogenesis. AEG1 is a multi-functional regulator of normal and abnormal physiology; it contributes to broad-spectrum resistance to various chemotherapeutics; and it was recently proposed as the first potential ‘pan-cancer’ gene (Byoung, K. Y., et al., <i>Pharmacol. Ther. </i>130(1):1-8 (2011)). However, despite its critical relevance to carcinogenesis, until now genetic polymorphisms for this important gene have not been studied for association with cancer susceptibility. For example, though studies have reported AEG-1 gene expression in animal models and tumor tissues, no studies have been reported in Caucasians on the AEG-1 gene polymorphisms in large samples to establish an association with cancers. A study from China screening variants in the AEG-1 gene detected 3 SNPs rs2438211, rs2449512, and rs1311 in linkage, but showed lack of correlation of the variants to disease progression in breast cancer (Liu, X., et al., <i>PLoS One </i>6(3):e17582 (2011)). However, no studies have been reported screening AEG-1 gene polymorphisms in melanoma and prostate cancer.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Acid phosphatase locus-1 (ACP1) regulates the phosphorylation status of a number of proliferative signaling molecules and is over expressed in high potential metastasis tumor cells (Malentacchi, F., et al. <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. </i>334:875-883 (2005); and Song, D. X., et al., <i>Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi </i>88(17):1197-201 (2008)). Recently, it was found that ACP1 is highly connected with migration and invasion activities of carcinomas, where it is upregulated (Alho, I., et al., <i>Tumour Biol. </i>34(4):1979-89 (2013); and Alho, I., et al., <i>Cancer Genet Cytogenet. </i>181(1):20-4 (2008)). Though these few studies have shown the relevance of ACP to carcinogenesis there have been no large scale studies of ACP1 as a susceptibility marker for cancer.</p>

      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Astrocyte Elevated Gene-1 (AEG1) has recently been described as the first potential “pan-cancer” gene. However, until now polymorphisms for the AEG1 have not been studied. Similarly, several studies have shown that the gene for Acid Phosphatase Locus-1 (ACP1) plays a role in tumorigenesis, but it too has not been studied in large samples.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Studied were AEG1/ACP1 in samples of 758 samples comprised of 366 healthy controls as well as 199 breast cancer cases, 114 prostate cancer cases and 109 cases of malignant melanoma. All analyses were age- and sex-matched comparisons of non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects. Disclosed is the detection of AEG1 gene polymorphisms and the construction of gene-gene risk alleles in combination with ACP1 haplotypes to assess the risk of cancer occurrence test that is simple, reliable, faster and cost effective. <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li>1. Individually, both AEG1 and ACP1 were robustly associated with cancer occurrence. Moreover, the gene-gene combination predicted the occurrence of melanoma (X2=76.611 p&lt;0.00000), prostate cancer (X2=22.146 p&lt;0.00000), and breast cancer (X2=10.687 p&lt;0.001)</li><li>2. AEG1/ACP1 high-risk alleles were in turn associated with having multiple tumor sites (p=0.015).</li><li>3. AEG1/ACP1 risk alleles can be used as a screening device for cancer susceptibility to inform the need for more intensive ongoing cancer surveillance.</li><li>4. AEG1/ACP1 risk alleles can be used in newly diagnosed cancers to estimate the risk of acquiring multiple tumors (typically lethal) to inform the need for more intensive therapies.</li><li>5. Given the unprecedented role of AEG1/ACP1 in tumorigenesis demonstrated by our findings, modification of AEG1/ACP1 substrates may be useful as either a prophylactic treatment to reduce cancer risk or as a pharmacotherapy for the treatment of existing cancers.</li></ul></p>

Since one individual had two cancers and there were 30 individuals (samples) with more than one cancer, the total shows 788 samples; in fact the sample size is only 758. The sample population was split to estimate the risk based on types of cancer and hence 30 cases more. To estimate the risk of cancer which the above table shows has only the actual individuals studied 758 with no sample duplication. All analyses were age- and sex-matched comparisons of non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects. DNA was isolated from all cancer patients and controls using standard procedure. An informed signed consent was obtained from all the study subjects.</p>

The methods of Liu et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, were used to sequence the AEG-1 gene. This is the first study design of PCR-RFLP method screening rs2438211 (3′UTR-C/T) variant. Below a normal sequence is shown and no enzyme is found to recognize the site. A ‘T’ was inserted in the sequence replacing ‘C’ in the sequence and the search found SspI restriction enzyme recognition mutation site ‘T’ in sequence (AATAC/TTTTG) where it cuts the PCR product in individual carrying this mutant ‘T’ (named 2 allele) while the wild type ‘C’ (1-allele) remains uncut. This method is simple, faster and cost effective.</p>
