      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity, and polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods of producing and using the polypeptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Cellulose is a polymer of the simple sugar glucose covalently linked by beta-1,4-bonds. Many microorganisms produce enzymes that hydrolyze beta-linked glucans. These enzymes include endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases. Endoglucanases digest the cellulose polymer at random locations, opening it to attack by cellobiohydrolases. Cellobiohydrolases sequentially release molecules of cellobiose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble beta-1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Beta-glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Another class of enzymes, GH61 polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity has been described in the literature These polypeptides acts together with enzymes that hydrolyze beta-linked glucans with the result that the combined activities results is a significant higher conversion of cellulosic material.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Since cellulose is present in all plants there is a considerable interest in modifying and/or degrading cellulose and due to the diversity in structure and composition of different plant materials there is also a need for a considerable diversity among enzymes for modifying and/or degrading cellulosic material.</p>

      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 7 or a subsequence thereof, as well as the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 8 or a fragment thereof, may be used to design nucleic acid probes to identify and clone DNA encoding polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity from strains of different genera or species according to methods well known in the art. In particular, such probes can be used for hybridization with the genomic DNA or cDNA of a cell of interest, following standard Southern blotting procedures, in order to identify and isolate the corresponding gene therein. Such probes can be considerably shorter than the entire sequence, but should be at least 15, e.g., at least 25, at least 35, or at least 70 nucleotides in length.

In an embodiment, the number of amino acid substitutions, deletions and/or insertions introduced into the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 6 or SEQ ID NO: 8 is not more than 10, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. The amino acid changes may be of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not significantly affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of 1-30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-terminal methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to 20-25 residues; or a small extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function, such as a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0131">Examples of conservative substitutions are within the groups of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspartic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are known in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R. L. Hill, 1979<i>, In, The Proteins</i>, Academic Press, New York. Common substitutions are Ala/Ser, Val/Ile, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Ala/Thr, Ser/Asn, AlaNal, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/Ile, Leu/Val, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0132">Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0133">Essential amino acids in a polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, <i>Science </i>244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for cellulase enhancing activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et al., 1996<i>, J. Biol. Chem. </i>271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, <i>Science </i>255: 306-312; Smith et al., 1992<i>, J. Mol. Biol. </i>224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, <i>FEBS Lett. </i>309: 59-64. The identity of essential amino acids can also be inferred from an alignment with a related polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0134">Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988<i>, Science </i>241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989<i>, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22625. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman et al., 1991<i>, Biochemistry </i>30: 10832-10837; U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46: 145; Ner et al., 1988<i>, DNA </i>7: 127).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0135">Mutagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, <i>Nature Biotechnology </i>17: 893-896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0136">The polypeptide may be a hybrid polypeptide in which a region of one polypeptide is fused at the N-terminus or the C-terminus of a region of another polypeptide.</p>

A fusion polypeptide is produced by fusing a polynucleotide encoding another polypeptide to a polynucleotide of the present invention. Techniques for producing fusion polypeptides are known in the art, and include ligating the coding sequences encoding the polypeptides so that they are in frame and that expression of the fusion polypeptide is under control of the same promoter(s) and terminator. Fusion polypeptides may also be constructed using intein technology in which fusion polypeptides are created post-translationally (Cooper et al., 1993, <i>EMBO J. </i>12: 2575-2583; Dawson et al., 1994, <i>Science </i>266: 776-779).</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">A fusion polypeptide can further comprise a cleavage site between the two polypeptides. Upon secretion of the fusion protein, the site is cleaved releasing the two polypeptides. Examples of cleavage sites include, but are not limited to, the sites disclosed in Martin et al., 2003, <i>J.

The cloning of the polynucleotides from genomic DNA can be effected, e.g., by using the well known polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antibody screening of expression libraries to detect cloned DNA fragments with shared structural features. See, e.g., Innis et al., 1990, <i>PCR: A Guide to Methods and Application</i>, Academic Press, New York. Other nucleic acid amplification procedures such as ligase chain reaction (LCR), ligation activated transcription (LAT) and polynucleotide-based amplification (NASBA) may be used.

The 5â²-end of the coding sequence of the polynucleotide may inherently contain a signal peptide coding sequence naturally linked in translation reading frame with the segment of the coding sequence that encodes the polypeptide. Alternatively, the 5â²-end of the coding sequence may contain a signal peptide coding sequence that is foreign to the coding sequence. A foreign signal peptide coding sequence may be required where the coding sequence does not naturally contain a signal peptide coding sequence. Alternatively, a foreign signal peptide coding sequence may simply replace the natural signal peptide coding sequence in order to enhance secretion of the polypeptide.

The resultant polypeptide is known as a proenzyme or propolypeptide (or a zymogen in some cases). A propolypeptide is generally inactive and can be converted to an active polypeptide by catalytic or autocatalytic cleavage of the propeptide from the propolypeptide. The propeptide coding sequence may be obtained from the genes for <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>alkaline protease (aprE), <i>Bacillus subtilis </i>neutral protease (nprT), <i>Myceliophthora thermophila </i>laccase (WO 95/33836), <i>Rhizomucor miehei </i>aspartic proteinase, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>alpha-factor.</p>

Examples of regulatory systems are those that cause expression of the gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus, including the presence of a regulatory compound. Regulatory systems in prokaryotic systems include the lac, tac, and trp operator systems. In yeast, the ADH2 system or GAL1 system may be used. In filamentous fungi, the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>glucoamylase promoter, <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>TAKA alpha-amylase promoter, and <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>glucoamylase promoter may be used. Other examples of regulatory sequences are those that allow for gene amplification. In eukaryotic systems, these regulatory sequences include the dihydrofolate reductase gene that is amplified in the presence of methotrexate, and the metallothionein genes that are amplified with heavy metals. In these cases, the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide would be operably linked with the regulatory sequence.</p>

Alternatively, the polynucleotide may be expressed by inserting the polynucleotide or a nucleic acid construct comprising the polynucleotide into an appropriate vector for expression. In creating the expression vector, the coding sequence is located in the vector so that the coding sequence is operably linked with the appropriate control sequences for expression.</p>

The vector may contain any means for assuring self-replication. Alternatively, the vector may be one that, when introduced into the host cell, is integrated into the genome and replicated together with the chromosome(s) into which it has been integrated. Furthermore, a single vector or plasmid or two or more vectors or plasmids that together contain the total DNA to be introduced into the genome of the host cell, or a transposon, may be used.</p>

Alternatively, the vector may contain additional polynucleotides for directing integration by homologous recombination into the genome of the host cell at a precise location(s) in the chromosome(s). To increase the likelihood of integration at a precise location, the integrational elements should contain a sufficient number of nucleic acids, such as 100 to 10,000 base pairs, 400 to 10,000 base pairs, and 800 to 10,000 base pairs, which have a high degree of sequence identity to the corresponding target sequence to enhance the probability of homologous recombination. The integrational elements may be any sequence that is homologous with the target sequence in the genome of the host cell. Furthermore, the integrational elements may be non-encoding or encoding polynucleotides. On the other hand, the vector may be integrated into the genome of the host cell by non-homologous recombination.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0181">For autonomous replication, the vector may further comprise an origin of replication enabling the vector to replicate autonomously in the host cell in question.

      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0202">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising (a) cultivating a cell, which in its wild-type form produces the polypeptide, under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide. In a preferred aspect, the cell is a <i>Lentinus </i>cell. In a more preferred aspect, the cell is a <i>Lentinus similis </i>cell. The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide of the present invention, comprising (a) cultivating a recombinant host cell of the present invention under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide; and (b) recovering the polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0203">The host cells are cultivated in a nutrient medium suitable for production of the polypeptide using methods known in the art. For example, the cell may be cultivated by shake flask cultivation, or small-scale or large-scale fermentation (including continuous, batch, fed-batch, or solid state fermentations) in laboratory or industrial fermentors performed in a suitable medium and under conditions allowing the polypeptide to be expressed and/or isolated. The cultivation takes place in a suitable nutrient medium comprising carbon and nitrogen sources and inorganic salts, using procedures known in the art. Suitable media are available from commercial suppliers or may be prepared according to published compositions (e.g., in catalogues of the American Type Culture Collection). If the polypeptide is secreted into the nutrient medium, the polypeptide can be recovered directly from the medium. If the polypeptide is not secreted, it can be recovered from cell lysates.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0204">The polypeptide may be detected using methods known in the art that are specific for the polypeptides. These detection methods include, but are not limited to, use of specific antibodies, formation of an enzyme product, or disappearance of an enzyme substrate. For example, an enzyme assay may be used to determine the activity of the polypeptide.</p>
      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0205">The polypeptide may be recovered using methods known in the art. For example, the polypeptide may be recovered from the nutrient medium by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, collection, centrifugation, filtration, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, or precipitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0206">The polypeptide may be purified by a variety of procedures known in the art including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, hydrophobic, chromatofocusing, and size exclusion), electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), SDS-PAGE, or extraction (see, e.g., <i>Protein Purification</i>, Janson and Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989) to obtain substantially pure polypeptides.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0207">In an alternative aspect, the polypeptide is not recovered, but rather a host cell of the present invention expressing the polypeptide is used as a source of the polypeptide.</p>
      <heading id="h-00013-en" level="2">Plants</heading>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0208">The present invention also relates to isolated plants, e.g., a transgenic plant, plant part, or plant cell, comprising a polynucleotide of the present invention so as to express and produce a polypeptide or domain in recoverable quantities. The polypeptide or domain may be recovered from the plant or plant part. Alternatively, the plant or plant part containing the polypeptide or domain may be used as such for improving the quality of a food or feed, e.g., improving nutritional value, palatability, and rheological properties, or to destroy an antinutritive factor.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0209">The transgenic plant can be dicotyledonous (a dicot) or monocotyledonous (a monocot). Examples of monocot plants are grasses, such as meadow grass (blue grass, <i>Poa</i>), forage grass such as <i>Festuca, Lolium</i>, temperate grass, such as <i>Agrostis</i>, and cereals, e.g., wheat, oats, rye, barley, rice, sorghum, and maize (corn).</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0210">Examples of dicot plants are tobacco, legumes, such as lupins, potato, sugar beet, pea, bean and soybean, and cruciferous plants (family Brassicaceae), such as cauliflower, rape seed, and the closely related model organism <i>Arabidopsis thaliana. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0211">Examples of plant parts are stem, callus, leaves, root, fruits, seeds, and tubers as well as the individual tissues comprising these parts, e.g., epidermis, mesophyll, parenchyme, vascular tissues, meristems. Specific plant cell compartments, such as chloroplasts, apoplasts, mitochondria, vacuoles, peroxisomes and cytoplasm are also considered to be a plant part. Furthermore, any plant cell, whatever the tissue origin, is considered to be a plant part. Likewise, plant parts such as specific tissues and cells isolated to facilitate the utilization of the invention are also considered plant parts, e.g., embryos, endosperms, aleurone and seed coats.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0212">Also included within the scope of the present invention are the progeny of such plants, plant parts, and plant cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0213">The transgenic plant or plant cell expressing the polypeptide or domain may be constructed in accordance with methods known in the art. In short, the plant or plant cell is constructed by incorporating one or more expression constructs encoding the polypeptide or domain into the plant host genome or chloroplast genome and propagating the resulting modified plant or plant cell into a transgenic plant or plant cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00216-en" num="0214">The expression construct is conveniently a nucleic acid construct that comprises a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or domain operably linked with appropriate regulatory sequences required for expression of the polynucleotide in the plant or plant part of choice. Furthermore, the expression construct may comprise a selectable marker useful for identifying plant cells into which the expression construct has been integrated and DNA sequences necessary for introduction of the construct into the plant in question (the latter depends on the DNA introduction method to be used).</p>
      <p id="p-00217-en" num="0215">The choice of regulatory sequences, such as promoter and terminator sequences and optionally signal or transit sequences, is determined, for example, on the basis of when, where, and how the polypeptide or domain is desired to be expressed. For instance, the expression of the gene encoding a polypeptide or domain may be constitutive or inducible, or may be developmental, stage or tissue specific, and the gene product may be targeted to a specific tissue or plant part such as seeds or leaves. Regulatory sequences are, for example, described by Tague et al., 1988, <i>Plant Physiology </i>86: 506.</p>
      <p id="p-00218-en" num="0216">For constitutive expression, the 35S-CaMV, the maize ubiquitin 1, or the rice actin 1 promoter may be used (Franck et al., 1980<i>, Cell </i>21: 285-294; Christensen et al., 1992, <i>Plant Mol. Biol</i>. 18: 675-689; Zhang et al., 1991, <i>Plant Cell </i>3: 1155-1165). Organ-specific promoters may be, for example, a promoter from storage sink tissues such as seeds, potato tubers, and fruits (Edwards and Coruzzi, 1990<i>, Ann. Rev. Genet. </i>24: 275-303), or from metabolic sink tissues such as meristems (Ito et al., 1994, <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>24: 863-878), a seed specific promoter such as the glutelin, prolamin, globulin, or albumin promoter from rice (Wu et al., 1998, <i>Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 885-889), a <i>Vicia faba </i>promoter from the legumin B4 and the unknown seed protein gene from <i>Vicia faba </i>(Conrad et al., 1998, <i>J. Plant Physiol. </i>152: 708-711), a promoter from a seed oil body protein (Chen et al., 1998, <i>Plant Cell Physiol. </i>39: 935-941), the storage protein napA promoter from <i>Brassica napus</i>, or any other seed specific promoter known in the art, e.g., as described in WO 91/14772. Furthermore, the promoter may be a leaf specific promoter such as the rbcs promoter from rice or tomato (Kyozuka et al., 1993, <i>Plant Physiol. </i>102: 991-1000), the chlorella virus adenine methyltransferase gene promoter (Mitra and Higgins, 1994, <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>26: 85-93), the aldP gene promoter from rice (Kagaya et al., 1995<i>, Mol. Gen. Genet. </i>248: 668-674), or a wound inducible promoter such as the potato pin2 promoter (Xu et al., 1993, <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>22: 573-588). Likewise, the promoter may be induced by abiotic treatments such as temperature, drought, or alterations in salinity or induced by exogenously applied substances that activate the promoter, e.g., ethanol, oestrogens, plant hormones such as ethylene, abscisic acid, and gibberellic acid, and heavy metals.</p>
      <p id="p-00219-en" num="0217">A promoter enhancer element may also be used to achieve higher expression of a polypeptide or domain in the plant. For instance, the promoter enhancer element may be an intron that is placed between the promoter and the polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide or domain. For instance, Xu et al., 1993, supra, disclose the use of the first intron of the rice actin 1 gene to enhance expression.</p>
      <p id="p-00220-en" num="0218">The selectable marker gene and any other parts of the expression construct may be chosen from those available in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00221-en" num="0219">The nucleic acid construct is incorporated into the plant genome according to conventional techniques known in the art, including <i>Agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation, virus-mediated transformation, microinjection, particle bombardment, biolistic transformation, and electroporation (Gasser et al., 1990, <i>Science </i>244: 1293; Potrykus, 1990, <i>Bio/Technology </i>8: 535; Shimamoto et al., 1989, <i>Nature </i>338: 274).</p>
      <p id="p-00222-en" num="0220">
        <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated gene transfer is a method for generating transgenic dicots (for a review, see Hooykas and Schilperoort, 1992, <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>19: 15-38) and for transforming monocots, although other transformation methods may be used for these plants. A method for generating transgenic monocots is particle bombardment (microscopic gold or tungsten particles coated with the transforming DNA) of embryonic calli or developing embryos (Christou, 1992, <i>Plant J. </i>2: 275-281; Shimamoto, 1994, <i>Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. </i>5: 158-162; Vasil et al., 1992, <i>Bio/Technology </i>10: 667-674). An alternative method for transformation of monocots is based on protoplast transformation as described by Omirulleh et al., 1993, <i>Plant Mol. Biol. </i>21: 415-428. Additional transformation methods include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,395,966 and 7,151,204 (both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety).</p>
      <p id="p-00223-en" num="0221">Following transformation, the transformants having incorporated the expression construct are selected and regenerated into whole plants according to methods well known in the art. Often the transformation procedure is designed for the selective elimination of selection genes either during regeneration or in the following generations by using, for example, co-transformation with two separate T-DNA constructs or site specific excision of the selection gene by a specific recombinase.</p>
      <p id="p-00224-en" num="0222">In addition to direct transformation of a particular plant genotype with a construct of the present invention, transgenic plants may be made by crossing a plant having the construct to a second plant lacking the construct. For example, a construct encoding a polypeptide or domain can be introduced into a particular plant variety by crossing, without the need for ever directly transforming a plant of that given variety. Therefore, the present invention encompasses not only a plant directly regenerated from cells which have been transformed in accordance with the present invention, but also the progeny of such plants. As used herein, progeny may refer to the offspring of any generation of a parent plant prepared in accordance with the present invention. Such progeny may include a DNA construct prepared in accordance with the present invention. Crossing results in the introduction of a transgene into a plant line by cross pollinating a starting line with a donor plant line. Non-limiting examples of such steps are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,151,204.</p>
      <p id="p-00225-en" num="0223">Plants may be generated through a process of backcross conversion. For example, plants include plants referred to as a backcross converted genotype, line, inbred, or hybrid.</p>
      <p id="p-00226-en" num="0224">Genetic markers may be used to assist in the introgression of one or more transgenes of the invention from one genetic background into another. Marker assisted selection offers advantages relative to conventional breeding in that it can be used to avoid errors caused by phenotypic variations. Further, genetic markers may provide data regarding the relative degree of elite germplasm in the individual progeny of a particular cross. For example, when a plant with a desired trait which otherwise has a non-agronomically desirable genetic background is crossed to an elite parent, genetic markers may be used to select progeny which not only possess the trait of interest, but also have a relatively large proportion of the desired germplasm. In this way, the number of generations required to introgress one or more traits into a particular genetic background is minimized.</p>
      <p id="p-00227-en" num="0225">The present invention also relates to methods of producing a polypeptide or domain of the present invention comprising (a) cultivating a transgenic plant or a plant cell comprising a polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide or domain under conditions conducive for production of the polypeptide or domain; and (b) recovering the polypeptide or domain.</p>
      <heading id="h-00014-en" level="2">Compositions</heading>
      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0226">The present invention also relates to compositions comprising a polypeptide of the present invention.

The fungal material from the above culture was harvested by centrifugation at 14,000Ãg for 2 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the 0.5 g of the pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen with quartz sand and grinded to a fine powder in a pre-chilled mortar. The powder was transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and added 5 ml buffer AP1 (preheated to 65Â° C.) and 10 Î¼l RNase A stock solution (100 mg/ml) followed by vigorous vortexing. After incubation for 10 minutes at 65Â° C. with regular inverting of the tube, 1.8 ml buffer AP2 was added to the lysate by gentle mixing followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. The lysate was then centrifugated at 3000Ãg for 5 minutes at room temperature and the supernatant was decanted into a QIAshredder maxi spin column placed in a 50 ml collection tube. This was followed by centrifugation at 3000Ãg for 5 minutes at room temperature.

      <p id="p-00287-en" num="0281">An MJ Research PTC-200 DNA engine (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, Mass., USA) was used to perform the PCR reactions. A PhusionÂ® High-Fidelity PCR Kit (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland) was used for the PCR amplification. The PCR reactions were composed of 5 Î¼l of 5ÃHF buffer (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 0.5 Î¼l of dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 Î¼l of PhusionÂ® DNA polymerase (0.2 units/Î¼l) (Finnzymes Oy, Espoo, Finland), 5 Î¼M of each primer, 0.5 Î¼l of <i>L. similis </i>genomic DNA (100 ng/Î¼l), and 16.5 Î¼l of deionized water in a total volume of 25 Î¼l. The PCR conditions were 1 cycle at 95Â° C. for 2 minutes. 35 cycles each at 98Â° C. for 10 seconds, 60Â° C. for 30 seconds, and 72Â° C. for 2 minutes; and 1 cycle at 72Â° C. for 10 minutes. The samples were then held at 12Â° C. until removed from the PCR machine.</p>
      <p id="p-00288-en" num="0282">The reaction products were isolated by 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis using 40 mM Tris base, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM disodium EDTA (TAE) buffer where product bands of approximately 1200-1400 bp were excised from the gel and purified using an illustra GFXÂ® PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Brondby, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fragments were then cloned into Bam HI and Xho I digested pDau109 using an IN-FUSIONâ¢ Cloning Kit resulting in the plasmids pGH61-1, pGH61-3, pGH61-5 and pGH61-7 respectively. Cloning of the genes into Bam HI-Xho I digested pDau109 resulted in the transcription of the Lentinis <i>similis </i>GH61 genes under the control of a NA2-tpi double promoter. NA2-tpi is a modified promoter from the gene encoding the <i>Aspergillus niger </i>neutral alpha-amylase in which the untranslated leader has been replaced by an untranslated leader from the gene encoding the <i>Aspergillus nidulans </i>triose phosphate isomerase.</p>

After incubating at 37Â° C. overnight, colonies were seen growing under selection on the LB ampicillin plates. Colonies of each transformation were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with 0.1 mg of ampicillin per ml and plasmids were isolated with a QlAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.</p>
