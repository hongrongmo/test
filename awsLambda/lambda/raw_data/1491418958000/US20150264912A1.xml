    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an insecticide-carrying device for treating livestock and in particular to a multi-piece insecticide-carrying device.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">It is well known in the livestock industry to impregnate articles such as tags with an insecticide. Generally, such tags are attached to the livestock in order to control biting and nuisance flies, and other ectoparasites. For example, an insecticide-carrying tag may be applied to one or both ears of the animal. As such, conventional insecticide-carrying tags typically include a tag and a tag hanger. An example of a known insecticide tag is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,834.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Insecticide-carrying devices are also used in and around livestock feeders and other locations where livestock might otherwise congregate to likewise control ectoparasites. For example, an insecticide-carrying bag may be hung from, or otherwise fastened to, a livestock feeder. While such bags adequately support and position an insecticide material near livestock feeders and other locations where livestock congregate, such bags are cumbersome and often are formed from materials that are susceptible to weather conditions, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the device.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">An insecticide-carrying device is provided and may include a first insecticide-carrying strip and a second insecticide carrying strip. The second insecticide carrying strip may be rotatably coupled to the first insecticide-carrying strip to permit relative movement between the first insecticide-carrying strip and the second insecticide-carrying strip.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In another configuration, an insecticide-carrying device is provided and may include a first insecticide-carrying strip and a second insecticide carrying strip. The second insecticide carrying strip may be moveably attached to the first insecticide-carrying strip to permit relative movement between the first insecticide-carrying strip and the second insecticide-carrying strip.</p>

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “including,” and “having,” are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">When an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “engaged to,” “connected to,” or “coupled to” another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly engaged to,” “directly connected to,” or “directly coupled to” another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., “between” versus “directly between,” “adjacent” versus “directly adjacent,” etc.). As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as “first,” “second,” and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Spatially relative terms, such as “inner,” “outer,” “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper,” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the example term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a perspective view of a hinged insecticide-carrying device <b>10</b> is provided. The device <b>10</b> may include a first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, a second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a hinge assembly <b>14</b>, and a clip or hanger <b>16</b>. While the device <b>10</b> is generally shown and described herein as including first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the device <b>10</b> may include more than two insecticide-carrying strips.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In one configuration, the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be similar to the insecticide-carrying strip described in assignee's commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13/799,685 and 13/799,468, filed on Mar. 13, 2013, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Further, the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be substantially similar to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and preferably identical thereto. Accordingly, references herein to the strip <b>12</b> will be understood to apply equally to the first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and like reference numerals will be used to describe like features.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The strip <b>12</b> includes an elongated substantially flat strap having first and second rounded end portions <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. With reference to <figref>FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the first and second rounded end portions <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may define a radius of curvature R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, respectively, extending from an axis <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively. The first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be an upper-end portion, and the second end portion <b>22</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be a lower-end portion. Conversely, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be a lower-end portion, and the second end portion <b>22</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>may be an upper-end portion. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, in the assembled configuration, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be pivotably coupled to the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>, for rotation about an axis <b>24</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the strip <b>12</b> generally defines a central longitudinal axis <b>29</b> extending between the end portions <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. In one configuration, the strip <b>12</b> is injection molded as a monolithic member that is approximately six (6) inches in length, one and one quarter (1.25) inches in width, and approximately one sixteenth ( 1/16) of an inch thick. The strip <b>12</b> can be made of a flexible, relatively soft material such as, for example, polyvinyl chloride, that is suitable for being impregnated with an insecticide. While polyvinyl chloride is disclosed for use in manufacturing the strip <b>12</b>, other suitable materials may be used. The resulting large surface area of the strip <b>12</b> allows the strip <b>12</b> to carry a relatively large quantity of insecticide, thereby improving long term efficacy of the strip <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the strip <b>12</b> may include an aperture <b>30</b>. In one configuration, the aperture <b>30</b> is substantially circular, having a diameter D<b>1</b> and defining an axis of rotation <b>32</b>. The diameter D<b>1</b> may be between approximately three (3) millimeters and eleven (11) millimeters. In one configuration, the diameter D<b>1</b> may be substantially equal to approximately eight (8) millimeters. The axis of rotation <b>32</b> may be substantially aligned with the axis <b>24</b> of the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The second end portion <b>22</b> of the strip <b>12</b> may include a “key-hole” shaped aperture <b>34</b> having a circular hole <b>36</b> and a downwardly extending slit <b>38</b> that is in communication with the circular hole <b>36</b>. Note, the strip <b>12</b> may be formed during the injection molding process with a thin frangible web connecting the adjoining sides of the slit <b>38</b> of aperture <b>34</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">The circular hole <b>36</b> of the aperture <b>34</b> may be centered on the longitudinal axis <b>29</b> of the strip <b>12</b> with the slit <b>38</b> extending along the axis <b>29</b>. A diameter of the hole <b>36</b> may be sized to be slightly larger than a diameter of an attachment feature <b>39</b> of the hanger <b>16</b> (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>), such that the strip <b>12</b> can pivot or otherwise rotate relative to the hanger <b>16</b>, as will be described in more detail below. In addition, a length of the slit <b>38</b> along the axis <b>29</b> may be designed so that, when combined with the diameter of the hole <b>36</b>, the combined length L<b>2</b> is approximately equal to or slightly greater than a dimension (e.g., a diameter) of the flange portion of a male component of a standard two-piece livestock ID tag (not shown). In this way, the strip <b>12</b> can be made with the same tooling used to manufacture the insecticide-carrying strip described in Assignee's above-identified applications, Ser. No. 13/799,685 and Ser. No. 13/799,468, which as described therein, is designed for attachment to standard one-piece and two-piece livestock ID tags.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Alternatively, the aperture <b>34</b> in the second end portion <b>22</b> of the strip <b>12</b> may comprise a circular hole <b>36</b> only, without an adjoining slit portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The boundary of the key-hole shaped aperture <b>34</b> is completely closed and may be reinforced by the formation of a thickened border area <b>40</b> immediately surrounding the entire boundary of the aperture <b>34</b>. The reinforced border area <b>40</b> may be formed on both sides of the strip <b>12</b> so that the overall thickness of the plastic material in the border area <b>40</b> is approximately twice the thickness of the remainder of the strip <b>12</b>. The increased thickness of the strip <b>12</b> at the boundary of the aperture <b>34</b> reinforces the strip <b>12</b> and therefore protects against tearing of the strip <b>12</b> at the aperture <b>34</b>. In addition, the boundary of the aperture <b>30</b> in the first end portion <b>20</b> of the strip <b>12</b> may be similarly reinforced with a thickened border area (not shown) to further protect against tearing of the strip <b>12</b> at aperture <b>30</b> as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The strip <b>12</b> may be impregnated with insecticide compounds having a variety of EPA-approved active ingredients, including without limitation, pyrethroid, permethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, ivermectin, avermectin, abamectin, milbemectin, diazinon and chlorpyrifos, or any combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The hinge assembly <b>14</b> may include a male component <b>44</b> and a female component <b>46</b>. The male component <b>44</b> may include a first flange portion <b>48</b>, a stem portion <b>50</b>, and a head portion <b>52</b>. The first flange portion <b>48</b> may define a substantially circular disk having a diameter D<b>2</b> and including a first or inner surface <b>49</b> and a second or outer surface <b>51</b>. The diameter D<b>2</b> is substantially greater than the diameter D<b>1</b> of the aperture <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The stem portion <b>50</b> may be integrally and monolithically formed with the first flange portion <b>48</b>. The stem portion <b>50</b> may be substantially cylindrical and may include an outer diameter D<b>3</b>. Further, the stem portion <b>50</b> may be concentrically located relative to the first flange portion <b>48</b>. The head portion <b>52</b> may extend from the stem portion <b>50</b> such that the stem portion <b>50</b> extends between the first flange portion <b>48</b> and the head portion <b>52</b>. In one configuration, the head portion <b>52</b> includes a frustoconical shape, defining a base diameter D<b>4</b> and a tip diameter D<b>5</b>. The diameter D<b>4</b> is larger than the tip diameter D<b>5</b> and is larger than the diameter D<b>3</b> of the stem portion <b>50</b>, such that the head portion <b>52</b> defines a stop surface <b>57</b> that is substantially parallel to the inner surface <b>49</b> of the first flange portion <b>48</b>. In this regard, the tip diameter D<b>5</b> may be substantially equal to the diameter D<b>3</b> of the stem portion <b>50</b>, and the diameter D<b>4</b> may be between approximately twenty percent and fifty percent larger than each of the diameters D<b>3</b> and D<b>5</b>. As will be explained in more detail below, the foregoing configuration of the male component <b>44</b> allows for easier assembly and coupling of the male component <b>44</b> to the female component <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The female component <b>46</b> may include a second flange portion <b>56</b> and a mounting portion <b>58</b>. The second flange portion <b>56</b> may define a substantially circular disk including a first or inner surface <b>60</b>, a second or outer surface <b>62</b>, and a substantially circular through-hole or aperture <b>64</b>. The aperture <b>64</b> may define a diameter D<b>6</b> and may be concentrically located relative to the second flange portion <b>56</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The mounting portion <b>58</b> may define a substantially cylindrical hub, including a plurality of flexible locking elements <b>68</b>. In one configuration, the mounting portion <b>58</b> may be integrally and monolithically formed with the second flange portion <b>56</b>. In this regard, the mounting portion <b>58</b> may be concentrically located relative to the second flange portion <b>56</b> and may extend from the inner surface <b>60</b> of the second flange portion <b>56</b> along a second longitudinal axis <b>70</b>. The mounting portion <b>58</b> may include an outer surface <b>74</b> defining a diameter D<b>7</b> that is slightly less than the diameter D<b>1</b> of the aperture <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">The locking elements <b>68</b> may extend from an inner surface <b>72</b> of the mounting portion <b>58</b>. In one configuration, the locking elements <b>68</b> define a profile having a wide base <b>76</b> that narrows down to a tip <b>78</b>. The locking elements <b>68</b> may include a concave surface <b>77</b> generally facing the second longitudinal axis <b>70</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the concave surface <b>77</b> defines an angle α with the second longitudinal axis <b>70</b>. The angle α may be between ten degrees (10°) and sixty degrees (60°). In one configuration, the angle α may be substantially equal to forty-five degrees (45°). The concave surfaces <b>77</b> of the locking elements <b>68</b> may collectively define a frustoconical shape, and the tips <b>78</b> of the locking elements <b>68</b> may collectively define a substantially circular opening having a diameter D<b>8</b>. The diameter D<b>8</b> may be less than the base diameter D<b>4</b> of the head portion <b>52</b> and substantially equal to or slightly less than diameter D<b>3</b> of the stem portion <b>50</b>. While the mounting portion <b>58</b> is shown and described herein as including three locking elements <b>68</b>, the mounting portion <b>58</b> may include more or less than three locking elements within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">The hanger <b>16</b> may be used for pivotably supporting the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>relative to a feeding apparatus or other suitable structure. In this regard, as will be described in more detail below, the hanger <b>16</b> may be pivotably coupled to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>. One example of a hanger <b>16</b> is described in assignee's commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/707,154 filed on Dec. 6, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">To assemble the device <b>10</b>, the mounting portion <b>58</b> of the female component <b>46</b> may be positioned within the apertures <b>30</b> of the first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>when the apertures <b>30</b> of the respective strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are aligned with one another. The male component <b>44</b> may positioned relative to the female component <b>46</b> such that the inner surface <b>49</b> of the male component <b>44</b> faces the inner surface <b>60</b> of the female component <b>46</b>. The male component <b>44</b> may be coupled to the female component <b>46</b> by extending the head portion <b>52</b> through and between the locking elements <b>68</b>, and into the aperture <b>64</b>. In this way, the locking elements <b>68</b> flex or otherwise bend to receive the base diameter D<b>4</b> of the head portion <b>52</b> until the tips <b>78</b> of the locking elements <b>68</b> are adjacent the stop surface <b>57</b> of the head portion. The stop surface <b>57</b> and the diameter D<b>4</b> of the head portion <b>52</b> cooperate to restrict the male component <b>44</b> from dislodging or otherwise uncoupling from the female component <b>46</b>. In so doing, the insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are retained between the first flange portion <b>48</b> and the second flange portion <b>56</b> and are permitted to rotate relative to one another about the outer surface <b>74</b> of the mounting portion <b>58</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The attachment feature <b>39</b> of the hanger <b>16</b> may be positioned within the hole <b>36</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>is rotatably coupled to the hanger <b>16</b> and the first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>are rotatably or otherwise movably coupled to one another via the hinge assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As discussed above and illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, in the assembled configuration, the axis of rotation <b>32</b> may be substantially aligned with the axis <b>24</b> and with the axis <b>70</b> of the second mounting portion <b>58</b>. Accordingly, as the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>rotates or pivots relative to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the rounded first end portion <b>20</b> may define portions of a substantially circular shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, in a first position, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>can collectively define approximately three hundred sixty degrees (360°) of a circle. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in a second position, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>can collectively define approximately two hundred seventy degrees (270°) of a circle. Finally, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, in a third position, the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>can collectively define approximately one hundred eighty degrees (180°) of a circle. Stated another way, in an assembled configuration, a peripheral surface or edge <b>80</b> of the first end portion <b>20</b> of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>does not extend beyond, or otherwise overhang, a peripheral surface or edge <b>82</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the first end portion <b>20</b> of the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>does not extend beyond, or otherwise overhang, the perimeter of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the device <b>10</b> is able to reduce the tendency for objects, such as livestock fur or another device <b>10</b>, to snag on, or otherwise get caught between, the edges <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> of the first and second insecticide-carrying strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, as the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>rotates relative to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In operation, the device <b>10</b> may be attached to an external structure <b>100</b> such as a livestock feeding apparatus or the like. Namely, the hanger <b>16</b> may be attached to the external structure <b>100</b> to attach the device <b>10</b> to the external structure <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">As described above, the device <b>10</b> is rotatably attached to the hanger <b>16</b> such that the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>is permitted to rotate about axis <b>26</b> and relative to the attachment feature <b>39</b> of the hanger <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>is likewise rotatably attached to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>to permit the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>to rotate about axis <b>24</b> relative to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Namely, the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>is rotatably attached to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>via the hinge assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">When an animal uses the feeding apparatus, the animal inserts its head into the feeding apparatus and, in so doing, encounters the device <b>10</b>. For example, the head of the animal may engage one or both of the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Contacting one or both of the strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>causes the insecticide impregnated in the strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>to be transferred onto the animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The forces associated with the animal's head contacting one or both of the strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>may cause one or both of the strips <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>to move relative to one another and relative to the external structure <b>100</b> and/or hanger <b>16</b>. For example, if the head of the animal contacts the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, a force may be applied to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, thereby causing the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>to rotate relative to the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>, as the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>is rotatably attached to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>at the hinge assembly <b>14</b>. The foregoing operation of the device <b>10</b> is shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, whereby the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>is rotated relative to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>about the hinge assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">If the force exerted on the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>is sufficient and/or is likewise applied to the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may likewise rotate relative to the external structure <b>100</b> via the hanger <b>16</b>. Namely, the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>may rotate about the attachment feature <b>39</b> of the hanger <b>16</b>, thereby causing the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b </i>to rotate relative to the hanger <b>16</b> and relative to the external device <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Allowing relative movement between the first insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the second insecticide-carrying strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the hanger <b>16</b>, and the external device <b>100</b> allows the device <b>10</b> to contact an animal's head when using the feeding apparatus while concurrently permitting the device <b>10</b> to flex and move in response to forces received from the animal's head. Allowing the device <b>10</b> to rotate and move in response to a force applied thereto protects the device <b>10</b> and decreases the likelihood that any portion of the device <b>10</b> will tear in response to receipt of such a force. In addition, the pivoting action of the device <b>10</b> also enhances the effectiveness of insecticide transfer from the strips <b>12</b> to the animal.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Furthermore, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the configuration of the device <b>10</b> as two identical strips <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>12</b><i>b </i>hinged together, each of which approximately 6 inches in length, is significantly easier and less expensive to mold than a comparable single strip approximately 10-11 inches in length. Moreover, the hinged design of the present device <b>10</b> also simplifies packaging for the device <b>10</b>. In particular, the present device <b>10</b> can be placed into the orientation shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, wherein the first strip <b>12</b><i>a </i>overlays the second strip <b>12</b><i>b</i>. In this configuration, the overall size of the device <b>10</b> is minimized which in turn reduces the packaging costs for the device <b>10</b>.</p>
