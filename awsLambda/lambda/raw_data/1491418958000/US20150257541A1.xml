      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A pressure variable thermal adaptive microclimate surface is provided. The microclimate surface may be a pad, pillow, mattress or the like. The microclimate surface is especially suitable for providing optimal heating and/or cooling of a person. The device has a pressure variable thermal adaptation function which is embodied in three possible system types. In all three types the pressure thermal adaptivity is produced by the partial compression of the sculpted resilient foam cushioning which (while generally maintaining its skin protecting resilience) reduces the foam's insulation properties (by collapsing the internal air bubbles) and thereby increasing its thermal conductivity proportionally where pressure is applied. Because the location where the greatest pressure is applied is also the area which needs the greatest thermal therapy, the device optimizes the effectiveness of the thermal delivery system. For example, pressure ulcers can form in hospitalized people due to localized persistent pressure and high temperatures under bony prominences such as the sacral (tailbone) region. Healthcare mattresses are made using fluid impervious coated covers to enhance disinfectability. These covers, however also almost completely eliminate the flow of air necessary for our skin's temperature management system, which relies on evaporative cooling from our sweat glands. Without constant airflow these parts of the body become warmer and the un-evaporated perspiration can further reduce skin integrity due to maceration, leading to potential damage such as infections and pressure ulcers. In the current state of the art, liquid or air circulating channels collapse proportionally with applied pressure thereby reducing or eliminating the thermal transfer where it is most needed. With the greater thermal conductivity the invention provides, cooling or heating from the system is efficiently directed to the areas with higher pressure which need the thermal therapy most.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The heating or cooling is provided through a heating or cooling delivery system located in the sculpted polyurethane foam microclimate surface. The microclimate surface has a plurality of independently moving pillars which is optimal in reducing pressure ulcers on the skin of a person caused by the person spending extended periods of time on a typical surface, such as a hospital mattress. The heating or cooling delivery system may be provided through three possible configurations: I) Fluid (cooled or heated) is circulated through a tubing matrix which is placed within the sculpted foam surface using a connected thermoelectric device. The electrically powered device consists of one or more thermoelectric cells, a power supply, a pump, a heat exchanger, a fan, electronic thermostatic controller, and a control panel with a user interface (temperature readout, power on/off, set temp, it may or may not have a timer function); II) Fluid (cooled or warmed) is circulated through a tubing matrix which is placed within the sculpted foam surface using a radiator device. The electrically powered radiator device may be integrated within the mattress or in a separate tubing connected component. The radiator device consists of a pump, a heat exchanger with or without fan, and a user interface; III) The third embodiment incorporates a plurality of small thermoelectric cells which are connected by wiring and inserted into chambers cut into the sculpted foam. These thermoelectric cells are placed so that the thermal therapy side (cooling in this instance) come in closer contact to the patient's body presenting the greatest pressure to the surface. A circulating system of fluid (gas or liquid) is used to draw heat away from the warm side of the thermoelectric cells. This system incorporates a heat exchanger, fluid pump or blower, a controller and a user interface. All three systems may also incorporate one or more separate sensors which can be placed to detect the temperature in localized areas to optimize the setting.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Pressure ulcers, also known as decubitus ulcers or bedsores, are lesions caused by unrelieved pressure on soft tissues overlying a bony prominence which reduces or completely obstructs the blood flow to the superficial tissues. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the occurrence of pressure ulcers in patients has risen 63% over the last ten years. Accordingly, attempts to maximize temperature exchange and reduce pressure while a patient is on a mattress have been made over the years.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,874,185 to Phillips et al discloses a foam core cushion mattress assembly having semi-independent foam pillars on the upper surface of the mattress. The mattress may be unitary, or comprise multiple cushioning components, possibly base, body support and foot cushions. The body support cushion is constructed from a flat, rectangular solid, foam element whose upper surface is cut into an array of rectangular solid pillars, preferably by a hot wire cutting method. The array of rectangular solid pillars is grouped into a central array comprising pillars with generally square top surfaces and edge rows of rectangular solid pillars having rectangular top surfaces. The depth of the hot wire cuts into the surface of the body support cushion is preferably approximately one-half the overall thickness of the body support cushion or approximately three fourths of the length of the shortest face of the pillar. A zippered fabric cover removeably envelops the assembled cushioning components. The resultant structure defines a plurality of semi-independently compressible pillars that support a reclining, or supine patient. The pillars may also be cut into the top and bottom surfaces of the cushion for enhanced pressure relieving effects. Methods of manufacture, and treatment and alleviation of decubitus ulcer formation are also presented.</p>

No. 6,375,674 to Carson discloses a medical pad having a thermal exchange layer capable of absorbing and/or releasing heat to a patient and an adhesive surface disposed on a skin-contacting side of the thermal exchange layer for adhering the pad to the skin of the patient. The thermal exchange layer may comprise a fluid containing layer for containing a thermal exchange fluid capable of absorbing thermal energy from and/or releasing thermal energy to the patient. The pad may also include a conformable, thermally conductive layer between the adhesive surface and the fluid containing layer and an insulating layer on the non-skin contacting side of the fluid containing layer. In some arrangements, transverse members or dimples on insulating base member are provided to define tortuous fluid passageways in fluid containing layer. A fluid circulating system including a pump connected downstream from a fluid outlet and a fluid reservoir connected upstream from a fluid inlet may be employed to circulate the fluid though the fluid containing layer. The fluid is drawn from a reservoir into the fluid containing layer through the inlet and out of the fluid containing layer through the outlet under negative pressure by the pump. When the pad is adhered by the adhesive surface to the skin of the patient, thermal energy is exchangeable between the patient and the fluid circulated within the fluid containing layer to cool and/or warm the patient.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">A pressure variable thermal adaptive microclimate surface is provided. The microclimate surface may be a pad, pillow, mattress or the like. The microclimate surface is especially suitable for providing optimal heating and/or cooling of a person. The heating or cooling is provided through heating or cooling delivery system located in the sculpted polyurethane foam microclimate surface. The microclimate surface has a plurality of independently moving pillars which is optimal in reducing pressure ulcers on the skin of a person caused by the person spending extended periods of time on a typical surface, such as a hospital mattress. The heating or cooling delivery system may be provided through three possible configurations: I) Fluid (cooled or heated) is circulated through a tubing matrix which is placed within the sculpted foam surface using a connected thermoelectric device. The electrically powered device consists of one or more thermoelectric cells, a power supply, a pump, a heat exchanger, a fan, electronic thermostatic controller, and a control panel with a user interface (temperature readout, power on/off, set temp, it may or may not have a timer function); II) Fluid (cooled or warmed) is circulated through a tubing matrix which is placed within the sculpted foam surface using a radiator device. The electrically powered radiator device may be integrated within the mattress or in a separate tubing connected component. The radiator device consists of a pump, a heat exchanger with or without fan, and a user interface; or III) The third embodiment incorporates a plurality of small thermoelectric cells which are connected by wiring and inserted into chambers cut into the sculpted foam. These thermoelectric cells are placed so that the thermal therapy side (cooling in this instance) come in closer contact to the patient's body presenting the greatest pressure to the surface. A circulating system of fluid (air or water) is used to draw heat away from the warm side of the thermoelectric cells. This system incorporates a heat exchanger, fluid pump or blower, a controller and a user interface. All three systems may also incorporate one or more separate sensors which can be placed to detect the temperature in localized areas to optimize the setting.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A pressure variable thermal adaptive microclimate surface is provided. The microclimate surface may be a pad, pillow, mattress or the like. The microclimate surface is especially suitable for providing optimal heating and/or cooling of a person. The heating or cooling is provided through a heating or cooling agent passing through a tube matrix which may be located in the sculpted foam microclimate surface. The microclimate surface has a plurality of independently moving pillars which is optimal in reducing pressure ulcers on the skin of a person caused by the person spending extended periods of time on a typical surface, such as a hospital mattress. The heating or cooling is also provided through a plurality of thermoelectric cells connected to metallic wires wherein the metallic wires pass through a matrix located in the sculpted polyurethane foam microclimate surface. The metallic wire has a cool loop portion and a warm loop portion wherein the cool loop portion may be located on the patient side of the mattress and the warm loop portion located within a cooling agent (such as a gas or a liquid) environment wherein the heat is removed by a circulating cooling fluid agent.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Referring now to <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a pressure variable thermal conductive adaptive microclimate surface <b>1</b> is provided. The microclimate surface <b>1</b> may be made largely of, for example, polyurethane memory foam which may be suitable for efficient thermal exchange. The microclimate surface <b>1</b> may have a base <b>95</b> having a top <b>2</b>, a bottom <b>3</b>, a front <b>4</b>, a back <b>5</b>, a first side <b>6</b> and a second side <b>7</b>. In an embodiment, a cover <b>10</b> may be placed over at least the top <b>2</b> (and top <b>31</b> of a plurality of pillars <b>30</b> as described below) of the microclimate surface <b>1</b> so as to keep the microclimate surface <b>1</b> clean and functioning properly. When the cover <b>10</b> is inserted over the top <b>2</b> (and top <b>31</b> of the pillars <b>30</b>) of the microclimate surface <b>1</b>, an interior space <b>20</b> is created between the cover <b>10</b> and the microclimate surface <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As stated above, the microclimate surface <b>1</b> may have a plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. The plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be elastic (and in an embodiment made of the same material as the base <b>95</b>) so as to be comfortable and to allow the insertion and removal of a tube <b>75</b> (as defined below). Further, in an embodiment, the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be made as a single unit with the base <b>95</b> wherein a solid piece of, for example, polyurethane is cut to form the base <b>95</b> and connected pillars <b>30</b> of the device <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may have a top <b>31</b> (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>), a bottom <b>32</b>, a front <b>33</b>, a back <b>34</b>, a first side <b>35</b>, a second side <b>36</b> and, in an embodiment, an interior <b>38</b>. The front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> may each have a length <b>39</b> (<figref>FIG. 1</figref>). In an embodiment, the length <b>39</b> of the front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> may all be substantially similar so that each of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> are roughly square in shape (at the bottom <b>32</b>). The top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be generally domed-shaped. More specifically, the front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> may all arc inward toward the top/center of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. As a result, the pressure exerted on a body by the pillars <b>30</b> is reduced and the device <b>1</b> is more comfortable.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may further have a height <b>40</b> (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>). The height <b>40</b> of the front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> may be substantially similar and may be substantially similar to the length <b>39</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> such that each of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is generally in the shape of a cube (with the exception of the arced top <b>31</b> in an embodiment as described above). Because the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is only secured (at the bottom <b>32</b> of the pillars <b>30</b>) to the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b>, the top <b>31</b> and sides of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may move largely independently from one another while the bottom <b>32</b> of the pillars <b>30</b> remain generally stationary. More specifically, the bottom <b>32</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is secured to the top <b>2</b> of the microclimate surface <b>1</b>. The bottom <b>32</b> of the pillars <b>30</b> is secured directly to the top <b>2</b> of the microclimate surface <b>1</b> wherein the top <b>31</b>, front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> are unsecured and may move with respect to the microclimate surface <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">The front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may have an indentation <b>50</b>. The indentation <b>50</b> may be generally rectangular in shape (or in an embodiment not shown semi-circular) and may have a length which extends the entire length <b>39</b> of the front <b>33</b>, back <b>34</b>, first side <b>35</b> and second side <b>36</b> of the pillars <b>30</b> (surrounding each of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>). In an embodiment, the indentation <b>50</b> is located substantially near the bottom <b>32</b> of each of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> so that a tube <b>75</b> (as described below) remains secure and protected by the top <b>31</b> of the pillars <b>30</b> when a person is lying on the device <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In an embodiment, a first pillar <b>30</b>A is located directly next to a second pillar <b>30</b>B. As a result of at least two of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B being located directly next to each other, the indentation <b>50</b> of the first pillar <b>30</b>A aligns with the indentation <b>50</b> of the second pillar <b>30</b>B such that the two indentations <b>50</b> come together to form a generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> between the two pillars <b>30</b>. The generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> may have a width <b>413</b> which is greater than a width <b>412</b> of the tube <b>75</b> such that the tube <b>75</b> fits snugly within the generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> (as further described below).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The first pillar <b>30</b>A may be secured to the second pillar <b>30</b>B just below the indentation <b>50</b>. The generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> formed from two of the indentations <b>50</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may have a single slit <b>80</b> (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) facing upward (away from the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> of the device <b>1</b>). More specifically, the single slit <b>80</b> may be created from two of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> being aligned directly adjacent to each other.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Locating the indentation <b>50</b> near the bottom <b>32</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> greatly reduces the stress on the tubes <b>75</b> while the device <b>1</b> is in use. More specifically, as the weight of the person presses down upon the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>, the tubes <b>75</b> remain largely unaffected as they are located near the protected bottom <b>32</b> of the pillars <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">As stated above, the tube(s) <b>75</b> may be secured within the generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> of the device <b>1</b>. The tube <b>75</b> may have a first end <b>76</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>), a second end <b>77</b>, a length and a generally hollow interior <b>79</b> (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). The tube <b>75</b> may be flexible so as to allow the tube <b>75</b> to bend at various angles (generally ninety degrees) through the generally rectangular passageways <b>60</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. The first end <b>76</b> may be an inlet wherein a warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> (such as hot or cold gas or a hot or cold liquid) may be pumped through the tube <b>75</b>. The second end <b>77</b> may be a return end wherein the warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> is reheated or re-cooled and then returned through the system. As a result of pumping a warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> through the tube <b>75</b>, the temperature of the device <b>1</b> (and therein the person located on the device <b>1</b>) may be easily controlled.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In an embodiment, a manufacturer or user may elect which of the generally rectangular passageways <b>60</b> to insert the tube <b>75</b> through so that temperature may be controlled properly. For example, a manufacturer may elect to place the tube(s) <b>75</b> just under the area of the device <b>1</b> wherein most of the weight of the person would be concentrated. In an embodiment, a manufacturer may elect to have two or more separate tubes <b>75</b> such that one tube <b>75</b>A circulars a warming agent and a second tube <b>75</b>B circulates a cooling agent <b>90</b> (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, to insert the tube <b>75</b> into the generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b>, the manufacturer or user slightly pulls two of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> away from each other; therein increasing the size of the slit <b>80</b>. As the slit <b>80</b> size is increased enough to accept the tube <b>75</b>, the tube <b>75</b> may be placed into the generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> and the pillars <b>30</b> therein allowed to relax back to their normal state. Preferably, the tubes <b>75</b> remain secured within the generally rectangular passageways <b>60</b> by, for example, only friction. As a result, a user may pull two of the pillars <b>30</b> away from each other to repair, replace or entirely remove the tube <b>75</b>. It should be noted that in an embodiment, an adhesive <b>100</b> (such as sprayed-on glue) may be placed in the generally rectangular passageway to better secure the tube <b>75</b> through the pillars <b>30</b>. Of course, the addition of the adhesive <b>100</b> reduces the ease of later removing the tube <b>75</b> from the device <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In an embodiment, the interior <b>38</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may have an electronic heating and cooling chip <b>250</b> (thermoelectric chip shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>) which is in electrical communication with a power source <b>260</b>. The electronic heating and cooling chip <b>250</b> may have a first side <b>251</b> and a second side <b>252</b> wherein the first side <b>251</b> may be electrically powered to produce a cooling effect while the second side <b>252</b> produces heat. In an embodiment, the first side <b>251</b> faces upward, toward the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. As a result, the top <b>31</b> of numerous of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may produce a cooling effect which is transferred to an individual lying on the microclimate surface <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">As stated above, the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is domed-shaped. Providing a plurality of pillars <b>30</b> which has domed-shaped tops <b>31</b>, along with the protective generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> between the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> allows the exterior surface of the tube <b>75</b> carrying the warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> to remain protected and generally cylindrical in shape (largely unchanged even under the weight of the person). More specifically, when weight (pressure) is applied to existing warming or cooling mattresses by a person, the weight of the person is transferred to the exterior surface of the warming or cooling tube causing the tube to adopt an elliptical shape rather than the desired cylindrical shape maintained by the present device. When the tube of other devices is compressed into the elliptical shape, the warming or cooling agent does not flow properly and the device is not as effective at transferring the warming or cooling agent (air or water) throughout the mattress. Because the tube(s) <b>75</b> of the present device <b>1</b> maintains a generally cylindrical exterior surface as a result of the domed-shape tops <b>31</b> and the protective generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b>, the warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> of the present device <b>1</b> may be properly transferred through the tube <b>75</b> and the desired temperature may be maintained on the skin of the person.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In addition to the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> having domed-shaped tops <b>31</b> and the generally rectangular passageway <b>60</b> both protecting tube <b>75</b>, the air spaces/bubbles in the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be reduced upon compression. Therefore, the insulating capability (r value) of the present device <b>1</b> is reduced and the thermal transfer rate (conduction) from the circulated warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> through the compressed plurality of pillars <b>30</b> to the person's skin is highest where the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is most compressed. This high pressure area is the location where pressure ulcers would normally form and where the warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> can provide the greatest benefit. This process is effective on both memory foam (closed cells) and conventional foam (open cells) microclimate surfaces. More specifically, the process reduces the skin surface temperature at high pressure sites. Normally, high skin surface temperature is aggravated by the lack of airflow between the patient and the mattress surface, which is typically covered in a moisture impermeable fabric to reduce the risk of infection. The body (endocrine system) senses high temperatures at the site and increases sweat production in an effort to create evaporative cooling. Without airflow there is no evaporation and the skin gets waterlogged (macerated). Macerated skin is weakened and can be damaged more easily leading to infection and pressure ulcers. These problems are reduced or eliminated by the present device <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">The primary therapeutic benefit of the device <b>1</b> is that the device <b>1</b> helps keep skin temperatures in a normal range. This means that in most all cases, the device <b>1</b> provides cooling rather than heating due to the construction of most healthcare surfaces. Most healthcare surfaces, are made using a fluid proof top surface to facilitate cleaning and help reduce the spread of infections. The fluid proof surfaces do not allow heat which is normally generated by the human body to dissipate. The heat builds up and causes two problems: (1) The body's endocrine system senses high temperatures and then triggers the localized sweat glands to secrete perspiration in an effort to provide evaporative cooling. Since there is no air movement between a patient and the mattress surface the moisture is trapped, there is no cooling and even more sweat accumulates and causes the skin to become macerated and much more subject to damage due to pressure and friction. Affected patients can eventually become dehydrated and exhibit other symptoms that can be hard to diagnose and treat. (2) Higher than normal temperatures alone also increase the biological demand of the skin in the affected areas. This causes the skin cells to operate at a reduced level of performance leading to higher susceptibility to damage and reduced healing rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">One published study showed that cellular biological demand (the energy needed to properly function) was increased 10% for every degree c above normal. Another study noted that a 5 degree c reduction was comparable to the therapeutic benefit of the highest technology mattresses versus a standard mattress.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In an embodiment, the device <b>1</b> may be cooling only. The overall construction and design of cooling versus heating and cooling units may be identical. The heat/cool designs just add electrical components to change the polarity of the DC power (from positive to negative) to the thermoelectric modules and this changes them from cold to hot.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, in an embodiment, the microclimate surface <b>1</b> may further have at least one thermoelectric cell (also referred to as a cooling chip) <b>150</b> connected to a power source <b>260</b>. It should be noted that the device <b>1</b> preferably has numerous thermoelectric cells <b>150</b> and that the term thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> in the present application may be read as plural. The thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may be electrically and mechanically secured to a metallic strip (or wire) <b>250</b>. In an embodiment, the metallic strip <b>250</b> may take the form of a braided metallic strip. Alternatively, in an embodiment, the metallic strip <b>250</b> may be generally flat and may have a first loop portion <b>251</b> and a second loop portion <b>252</b>. The thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may power and control the metallic strip <b>250</b>. When energy is added to the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b>, the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may control the temperature of the first loop portion <b>251</b> and second loop portion <b>252</b>. In an embodiment, the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may make the first loop portion <b>251</b> generally cool and may make the second loop portion <b>252</b> generally warm. The energy source may be, for example, DC or 110-250 VAC which is then converted to 12-24 Volts DC, 3-6 Amps to power the thermoelectric cells <b>150</b> and/or ancillary pump and blowers.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">More specifically, the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> consists of a number of p- and n-type pairs (couples) connected electrically in series and sandwiched between two ceramic plates. When connected to a, for example, DC power source, current causes heat to move from one side of the thermoelectric cell to the other. This creates a hot side and a cold side on the thermoelectric cell. As a result, the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may allow the first loop portion <b>251</b> to remain at approximately sixty-five degrees F. whereas the second loop portion <b>252</b> remains at approximately eighty-five degrees F.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In an embodiment, the first loop portion <b>251</b> is located on the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) and the second loop portion <b>252</b> is located beneath the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b>. The thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> may be located between the first loop portion <b>251</b> and the second loop portion <b>252</b> so that when the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> is activated, the first loop portion <b>251</b> cools down and the second loop portion <b>252</b> warms up. An opening <b>300</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>) may be present extending from the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> through toward the bottom <b>3</b> of the base <b>95</b>. The opening <b>300</b> may create a channel allowing the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> to be located both on the top <b>2</b> and within the interior (or in an embodiment the bottom <b>3</b>) of the base <b>95</b> wherein the first loop portion <b>251</b> extends to and remains substantially on the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> and the second loop portion <b>252</b> extends to and remains substantially within the interior of the base <b>95</b>. As a result, the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> (the side which a patient rests on) remains cools and the heat is transferred to the interior of the base <b>95</b> and away from the patient. Further, in an embodiment, the first loop portion <b>251</b> rests around the pillars <b>30</b> in a substantially parallel position with respect to the base <b>95</b> whereas the second loop portion <b>252</b> rest within the interior of the base <b>95</b> in a substantially perpendicular position with respect to the base <b>95</b>. Further, in an embodiment, the first loop portion <b>251</b> is located in the generally rectangular passageways <b>60</b> surrounding a single pillar <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In an embodiment, the base <b>95</b> has a plurality of openings <b>300</b> such that numerous thermoelectric cells <b>150</b>, each having a first loop portion <b>251</b> and second loop portion <b>252</b>) are used throughout the base <b>95</b>. More specifically, the device <b>1</b> may have, for example, approximately one thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> for every one and a half pillars <b>30</b> such that one thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> is located between a quadrant of four pillars <b>30</b>. As a result, the first loop portion <b>251</b> covers a substantial portion of the entire top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> therein insuring that the patient remains cool regardless of where on the surface the patient is located.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In an embodiment, the second loop portion <b>252</b> may be substantially located in a cooling agent containment <b>315</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). More specifically, in this embodiment, the base portion <b>95</b> may be hollow and may contain a cooling agent <b>316</b>. The cooling agent containment <b>315</b> may be a generally rectangular durable bag or other securing mechanism wherein the cooling agent <b>316</b> is present. Preferably the cooling agent <b>316</b> is liquid water; however, the cooling agent <b>316</b> may be any suitable agent including other liquids, a gas or a liquid combination. The cooling agent <b>316</b> may allow the heat from the second loop portion <b>252</b> to escape from the metallic strip <b>250</b> into the cooling agent <b>316</b>. As the cooling agent <b>316</b> is circulated throughout the cooling agent containment <b>315</b> by means of a pump <b>320</b>, the heat may be removed from the system so as to allow the top <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b> (and therefore the patient) to remain cool. Further, an antibacterial agent may be added to the cooling agent <b>316</b> to prevent the spread of pathogens. A waterproof seal may be located within or near the plurality of openings <b>300</b> such that cooling agent <b>316</b> located within the cooling agent containment <b>315</b> may not escape the cooling agent containment <b>315</b>. An embodiment, the cooling agent containment <b>315</b> may have partial separating walls <b>340</b> (<figref>FIG. 8</figref>) which may force the cooling agent <b>316</b> to move in a predetermined direction (for example, in a spiral manner or in a zigzag pattern).</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In an alternative embodiment, the device <b>1</b> may utilize a flexible tubing system to carry the cooling agent <b>316</b> as opposed to the above-mentioned cooling agent <b>316</b> flowing through a cooling agent containment <b>315</b>. In this embodiment, the flexible tubing may reduce restriction of the assembly from the flexing and conforming to the body of the user thus aiding pressure redistribution. In this embodiment, the flexible tubing may be located below the bottom <b>3</b> of the base <b>95</b> of the microclimate surface <b>1</b> and may be placed in proximity to the warm second loop portion <b>252</b> (which may be braided) so as to cool the thermoelectric cells <b>150</b> rather than carrying the cooling agent <b>316</b> close to the top surface <b>2</b> of the base <b>95</b>. With respect to the pressure redistribution, by allowing the base <b>95</b> to flex freely, the present device may reduce a âhammockingâ effect which often concentrates vertical forces rather than allowing them to be dissipated. As stated above, the microclimate surface <b>1</b> may have a plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. The plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be elastic (and made of the same material as the base <b>95</b>) so as to be comfortable and to allow the insertion and removal of the first loop portion <b>251</b>. Further, the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may be made as a single unit with the base <b>95</b> wherein a solid piece of, for example, polyurethane is cut to form the base <b>95</b> and connected pillars <b>30</b> of the device <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">As stated above, the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is domed-shaped. Providing a plurality of pillars <b>30</b> which has domed-shaped tops <b>31</b>, along with the protective generally cylindrical passageway <b>60</b> between the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> allows the first loop portion <b>251</b> (the cool portion) of the metallic strip <b>250</b> to not only remain protected by the pillars <b>30</b>, but the protective generally cylindrical passageways <b>60</b> and pillars <b>30</b> also increases the comfort for the user by providing a buffer between the user and the metallic strip <b>250</b>. More specifically, the device increases patient comfort when weight (pressure) is applied to plurality of pillars <b>30</b> as opposed to being applied to the first loop portion <b>251</b> of the metallic strip <b>250</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, in an embodiment, the domed-shaped tops <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> may have a generally cross-shaped channel <b>330</b> for which the first loop portion <b>251</b> of the metallic strip <b>250</b> may pass through. The cross-shaped channel <b>330</b> may allow the first loop portion <b>251</b> to reach over the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> and remain secured to the top <b>31</b> of the pillars <b>30</b> without the first loop portion <b>251</b> accidently sliding off the top <b>31</b> of the pillars <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The insulating capability (r value) of the present device <b>1</b> is reduced and the thermal transfer rate (conduction) from the first loop portion <b>251</b> to the person's skin is highest where the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> is most compressed. This process is effective on both memory foam (closed cells) and conventional foam (open cells) microclimate surfaces.

      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">In an embodiment, the device <b>1</b> may have a generally flat conductive layer <b>500</b> (<figref>FIG. 7</figref>). The generally flat flexible conductive layer <b>500</b> may be placed over the top <b>31</b> of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b> (and beneath the cover <b>10</b>). The generally flat conductive layer <b>500</b> may be grounded such that any electrical charge from the thermoelectric cells <b>150</b> which may improperly otherwise contact the patient would be grounded rendering the device <b>1</b> safe and harmless.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In an embodiment, the top <b>2</b> of the microclimate surface <b>1</b> may be zoned such that specific predetermined areas may be selectively heated, cooled or not activated.

Further, in this embodiment, a computer monitor may display different areas of the microclimate surface <b>1</b> or the computer monitor may illustrate representations of different areas of a user's body to allow the user to independently select different temperatures for different areas.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In an embodiment, the microclimate surface <b>1</b> of the present device may be used in conjunction with other mattresses wherein the other mattresses may have alternating pressurized areas. As a result, one may control not only the temperature, but also the pressure exerted on him/herself.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Referring now to <figref>FIG. 10</figref>, in an embodiment, an additional opening <b>177</b> may be located on the bottom <b>3</b> of the base <b>95</b>. The opening <b>177</b> at the bottom <b>3</b> of the base <b>95</b> is preferably located directly below the center of each of the plurality of pillars <b>30</b>. The opening <b>177</b> is preferably slightly greater in width than the width <b>412</b> of the tube <b>75</b> such that the tube <b>75</b> may snugly fit within the opening <b>177</b> at the bottom <b>3</b> of the base <b>75</b>. In this alternative embodiment, the device <b>1</b> may utilize not only the tube <b>75</b> circulating the warming or cooling agent <b>90</b> but also the thermoelectric cell <b>150</b> having the first loop <b>251</b> and the second loop <b>252</b>. In this embodiment, the user may wish, for example, the first loop <b>251</b> to provide a cool surface for the top of the device <b>1</b>. When the first loop <b>251</b> is cool, the second loop <b>252</b> becomes conversely warm.
