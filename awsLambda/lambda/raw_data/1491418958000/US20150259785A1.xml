      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of fabricating a sample support membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Sample support membranes used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and other similar applications are made of carbon film, silicon nitride film (SiN), and Formvar (polyvinyl formal resin). Preferably, sample support membranes satisfy various conditions including electron beam transmittance, ease of manufacturability, invulnerability to electron beam irradiation, and surface smoothness. A related art method of fabricating a sample support membrane is described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Where a carbon film is used as a sample support membrane, it can be fabricated by depositing carbon on a cleavage face of mica or rock salt using a vacuum evaporator, peeling off the evaporated carbon film on a water surface, and scooping the water using a finely apertured mesh or a microgrid.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Where a sample support membrane is made of Formvar, a clean slide glass or a cleavage face of mica is first set on equipment for fabricating a Formvar membrane. The slide glass is immersed in dissolved Formvar, forming a membrane on the slide glass. Then, in order to peel off the membrane from the slide glass surface, a cut is formed in the surface of the membrane with a razor. The slide glass is slowly sunk in the liquid at an angle of about 10 degrees to the water surface while holding one end of the slide glass with one hand. Consequently, water enters between the membrane and the glass, peeling off the membrane. The membrane floats on the water surface. The membrane is scooped with a mesh or microgrid, thus fabricating a sample support membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Patent document 1 discloses a method of fabricating an ultrathin carbon support membrane for high-resolution TEM analysis, the method involving four phases. The first phase consists of placing a clean, hydrophobic slide glass on an ice pack located in a cooled refrigerator or freezer, picking up the slide glass with tweezers, and exposing the glass to the atmosphere to form liquid droplets. The second phase consists of dissolving Formvar in chloroform solvent to form a solution, immersing the slide glass having the liquid droplets thereon in the solution, picking up the glass out of the solution after several seconds, applying moisture absorbing paper to the bottom, and placing the glass vertically within the atmosphere to dry the glass. The third phase consists of setting the polymer film formed on the slide glass afloat on the surface of distilled water using the surface tension of the distilled water and placing a Cu grid being one type of metal mesh grid on the polymer film that has been placed on the surface of the distilled water. The fourth phase consists of taking out the polymer film from the distilled water using a hydrophobic support stage such as paraffin film, then placing the polymer film in a higher position, and coating the film with carbon.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In the above-described method of fabricating a sample support membrane, the membrane is formed using peeling at a water surface. However, this peeling must be done manually. Furthermore, if peeling is done at a water surface or when the membrane is placed on a mesh, the membrane might be destroyed. In this way, with the method of fabricating a sample support membrane using peeling at a water surface, it is not easy to fabricate a sample support membrane.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In view of the foregoing problems, the present invention has been made. One object associated with some aspects of the invention is to offer a method capable of fabricating a sample support membrane easily.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">(1) A method associated with the present invention to fabricate a sample support membrane is adapted to support an electron microscope sample and comprises the steps of: forming a first layer on a first surface of a substrate; etching a second surface of the substrate that faces away from the first surface to form an opening which exposes the first layer; forming a second layer on the first layer; and removing a region of the first layer that overlaps the opening as viewed within a plane to expose the second layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, a sample support membrane can be easily fabricated.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">(2) In one feature of this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, during the step of forming the second layer, the second layer may be formed by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, it is easy to control the thickness of the second layer. A sample support membrane of a desired thickness can be easily formed. Furthermore, in this method, a cleaner membrane can be fabricated, for example, as compared to the case where peeling at a water surface is employed because a less amount of foreign matter is introduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">(3) In another feature of this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, there may be further provided the step of forming a conductive layer on a region of the second layer that has been exposed by the step of exposing the second layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, the conductive layer can suppress the second layer from being charged up.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">(4) In a further feature of this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, there may be further provided the steps of:</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">forming a third layer on the second layer; and</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">removing a region of the second layer that overlaps the opening as viewed within a plane to expose the third layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, a membrane material forming the sample support membrane can be selected from a wider range of choices.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">(5) In a yet other feature of the first-mentioned method associated with the present invention to fabricate a sample support membrane, the first layer may be made of silicon nitride.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In this method of fabricating a sample support membrane, the first layer is made of silicon nitride and so the first layer can be fabricated as a thin and uniform film on the substrate.

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The preferred embodiments of the present invention are hereinafter described in detail with reference to the drawings. It is to be understood that the embodiments provided below do not unduly restrict the scope and content of the present invention delineated by the appended claims and that not all the configurations described below are essential constituent components of the invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">1. First Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">A method associated with a first embodiment of the present invention to fabricate a sample support membrane is first described by referring to <figref>FIGS. 1-8</figref>. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a flowchart illustrating one example of the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane. <figref>FIGS. 2-5</figref>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> are schematic cross sections of the sample support membrane, illustrating steps of fabricating the membrane in accordance with the first embodiment. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic plan view of the sample support membrane, illustrating one step of fabricating it in accordance with the first embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a first layer <b>10</b> is first deposited on a first surface (top surface in the illustrated example) <b>3</b><i>a </i>of a substrate <b>2</b> (step S<b>100</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">A semiconductor substrate such as a silicon substrate can be used as the substrate <b>2</b>. Any one of various kinds of substrates such as ceramic substrate, glass substrate, sapphire substrate, and synthetic resin substrate can be used as the substrate <b>2</b>. Preferably, the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> is a mirror surface. This assures that a film formed on the substrate <b>2</b> can be made uniform in thickness. Also, the front surface of the film formed on the substrate <b>2</b> can be smoothed. The thickness of the substrate <b>2</b> is, for example, between 100 Î¼m and 200 Î¼m, inclusively. The material of the first layer <b>10</b> is silicon nitride (SiN), for example. The material of the first layer <b>10</b> is not restricted to silicon nitride. The material may also be an insulator such as silicon oxide (SiO2). The first layer <b>10</b> is formed, for example, by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD (chemical vapor deposition). The first layer <b>10</b> is formed over the whole first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">A mask layer <b>12</b> is then formed on a second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>(bottom surface in the illustrated example) of the substrate <b>2</b>. The second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> faces away from the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>2</b>. For instance, the mask layer <b>12</b> is made of the same material as the first layer <b>10</b>. The mask layer <b>12</b> and the first layer <b>10</b> may be formed at the same time or by separate processing steps. The mask layer <b>12</b> is formed over the whole bottom surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, for example, by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Then, as shown in <figref>FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> is etched to form an opening <b>4</b> that exposes the first layer <b>10</b> (step S<b>102</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In particular, as shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, resist R is spin coated on the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> and patterned using a lithography technique or other technique. Subsequently, as shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the mask layer <b>12</b> is patterned while using the resist R as a mask by reactive ion etching (RIE), plasma etching (PE), ion milling, or other technique. Then, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the substrate <b>2</b> is etched from the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>while using the mask layer <b>12</b> as a mask to form the opening <b>4</b> that exposes the first layer <b>10</b>. This etching is carried out by anisotropically etching the substrate <b>2</b> using aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide or TMAH (tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide). As a result, the width of the opening <b>4</b> decreases from the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> toward the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>as viewed in a cross section through it as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. The surfaces of the substrate <b>2</b> which define the lateral sides of the opening <b>4</b> are tilted relative to the direction of thickness of the substrate <b>2</b>. The opening <b>4</b> may be formed by dry etching the substrate <b>2</b>. As a result of the present processing step, a part of the bottom surface of the first layer <b>10</b> is exposed by the opening <b>4</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In the present step S<b>102</b>, if foreign matter such as organic matter or metals adheres to the first layer <b>10</b>, the first layer <b>10</b> can be cleaned with O2 plasma, mixture liquid of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, or mixture liquid of hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide. As a result, the first layer <b>10</b> that is clean is obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic plan view of the opening <b>4</b>, taken during the present step S<b>102</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, the two-dimensional shape of the opening <b>4</b> as viewed from the direction of thickness of the substrate <b>2</b> is a rectangle having shorter and longer sides. The length of each longer side is 500 Î¼m to 600 Î¼m, for example. The length of each shorter side is 100 Î¼m, for example. The two-dimensional shape of the opening <b>4</b> is not restricted to rectangles. The shape may also be a polygon or a circle.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Then, as shown in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, a second layer <b>20</b> is deposited on the first layer <b>10</b> (step S<b>104</b>). A material that can withstand etching used in step S<b>106</b> (described later) of removing the first layer <b>10</b> to expose the second layer <b>20</b>, i.e., a material showing a lower etch rate than the first layer <b>10</b> during this etching, is selected as the material of the second layer <b>20</b>. For example, where the material of the first layer <b>10</b> is silicon nitride or silicon oxide, it is possible to use chromium (Cr), IGZO, or tantalum (Ta) as the material of the second layer <b>20</b>. IGZO is an oxide semiconductor to which crystallinity has been imparted by oxidizing indium (In), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn). The second layer <b>20</b> is deposited, for example, by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD. The thickness of the second layer <b>20</b> is, for example, between 5 nm and 30 nm, inclusively.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">In the present step, the second layer <b>20</b> is preferably formed while the internal stress is relaxed as much as possible. If the internal stress is large, it is highly likely that the second layer <b>20</b> will be broken or deformed. Accordingly, in the present step, the second layer <b>20</b> is preferably deposited under growth conditions where the internal stress is relaxed.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">It is now assumed that the second layer <b>20</b> is made of tantalum. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> is a graph illustrating a relationship between the internal stress of a membrane of tantalum and growth pressure. As can be seen from this graph, the internal stress of the membrane can be relaxed by increasing the chamber pressure at which the membrane is deposited.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Then, as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, the region of the first layer <b>10</b> that overlaps the opening <b>4</b> as viewed within a plane (i.e., as viewed from the direction of thickness of the substrate <b>2</b>) is removed to expose the second layer <b>20</b> (step S<b>106</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The removal of the region of the first layer <b>10</b> overlapping the opening <b>4</b> is carried out by plasma etching using a gas such as CF4 or SF6. Consequently, the first layer <b>10</b> can be selectively removed while leaving the second layer <b>20</b> behind. The removal of the region of the first layer <b>10</b> overlapping the opening <b>4</b> may be carried out by wet etching using hot phosphoric acid. Also, in this case, the first layer <b>10</b> can be selectively removed while leaving the second layer <b>20</b> behind. As a result of the present step, a part of the bottom surface of the second layer <b>20</b> is exposed as shown in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>. The second layer <b>20</b> is formed as a membrane for supporting an electron microscope sample. During the present step, the mask layer <b>12</b> may be removed simultaneously with the first layer <b>10</b>. Because of the steps described so far, a sample support membrane can be fabricated.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane has the following features. This method is adapted to fabricate a sample support membrane providing support of an electron microscope sample. This method includes the step S<b>100</b> for depositing the first layer <b>10</b> on the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>2</b>, the step S<b>102</b> for etching the second surface <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>2</b> facing away from the first surface <b>3</b><i>a </i>to form the opening <b>4</b> that exposes the first layer <b>10</b>, the step S<b>104</b> for depositing the second layer <b>20</b> on the first layer <b>10</b>, and the step S<b>106</b> for removing the region of the first layer <b>10</b> that overlaps the opening <b>4</b> as viewed within a plane to expose the second layer <b>20</b>. Therefore, in the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, a sample support membrane can be easily fabricated using a semiconductor fabrication technique such as the MEMS (microelectromechanical system) technology. Furthermore, sample support membranes can be mass-produced economically using a semiconductor fabrication technique. Where the substrate <b>2</b> is a 2-inch wafer, if one chip has an outside dimension that measures 3 mm by 3 mm, approximately 100 sample support membranes can be produced at once.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">In the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, during the step S<b>104</b> for depositing the second layer <b>20</b>, this second layer <b>20</b> is formed by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD. Therefore, the thickness of the second layer <b>20</b> that is used as a sample support membrane can be controlled easily. A sample support membrane of a desired thickness can be produced easily. Furthermore, in the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, a cleaner membrane can be fabricated, for example, as compared to the case where peeling at a wafer surface is used because a less amount of foreign matter is introduced. In addition, in this method, a thinner membrane can be produced, for example, as compared to the case where peeling at a water surface is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Additionally, in the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, the production yield can be improved by controlling the internal stress of the membrane during deposition of the second layer <b>20</b>. Further, in this method, it is possible to control whether creases appear on a membrane acting as a sample support membrane by controlling the internal stress of the membrane during deposition of the second layer <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">In the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, the substrate <b>2</b> is a silicon substrate and so a sample support membrane can be fabricated easily, for example, using a semiconductor fabrication technique.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">In the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, the material of the first layer <b>10</b> is silicon nitride. Therefore, the first layer <b>10</b> can be formed as a uniform membrane on the substrate <b>2</b>. If the opening <b>4</b> has been formed, the first layer <b>10</b> neither deforms nor becomes torn. Rather, the shape can be maintained.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">In the method associated with the first embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, the material of the second layer <b>20</b> is chromium, IGZO, or tantalum. Where silicon nitride is used as the material of the first layer <b>10</b>, the first layer <b>10</b> can be selectively removed during the step of removing the first layer <b>10</b> by using chromium, IGZO, or tantalum as the material of the second layer <b>20</b>.</p>
      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">2. Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">A method associated with a second embodiment of the present invention to fabricate a sample support membrane is next described by referring to <figref>FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart illustrating one example of a method associated with the second embodiment.

Additionally, in the method associated with the seventh embodiment, a cleaner membrane can be formed, for example, as compared to the case where peeling at a water surface is employed because a less amount of foreign matter is introduced. Further, in this method associated with the seventh embodiment, a thinner membrane can be formed, for example, as compared to the case where peeling at a water surface is employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">Additionally, in the method associated with the seventh embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, the production yield can be improved by controlling the internal stress in the membrane during deposition of the first layer <b>10</b>. Further, it is possible to control the presence or absence of creases appearing on the membrane that becomes a sample support membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">Further, in the method associated with the seventh embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane, during the step S<b>704</b> of forming the opening <b>9</b>, the etching of the bottom surface of the recess <b>8</b> is carried out by dry etching using XeF2 gas. Therefore, a cleaner membrane can be obtained, for example, as compared to the case where the bottom surface of the recess is wet etched. Furthermore, in <figref>FIG. 29</figref>, where the adhesiveness between the first layer <b>10</b> (such as a carbon layer) and the substrate <b>2</b> (such as a silicon substrate) is low, if the bottom surface of the recess <b>8</b> is etched using an alkaline etchant (such as aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide), the first layer <b>10</b> may peel off from the substrate <b>2</b>. This peeling of the first layer <b>10</b> from the substrate <b>2</b> can be prevented by dry etching using XeF2 gas.</p>

      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">A method associated with an eighth embodiment of the present invention is next described by referring to <figref>FIGS. 35 and 36</figref>. <figref>FIG. 35</figref> is a flowchart illustrating one example of the method associated with the eighth embodiment. Those processing steps of the method associated with the eighth embodiment and shown in <figref>FIG. 35</figref> which are similar to the steps of the method associated with the seventh embodiment and shown in <figref>FIG. 23</figref> are indicated by the same reference numerals as in <figref>FIG. 23</figref> and a description thereof is omitted. <figref>FIG. 36</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a sample support membrane, illustrating one step of fabricating it in accordance with the eighth embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">The method associated with the eighth embodiment to fabricate a sample support membrane includes step S<b>800</b> of forming the conductive layer <b>6</b> on the region of the first layer <b>10</b> which has been exposed by the step S<b>704</b> of forming the opening <b>9</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 35</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">The conductive layer <b>6</b> has electrical conductivity. Preferably, the conductive layer <b>6</b> does not affect observation of TEM images.

The conductive layer <b>6</b> is formed, for example, by vacuum evaporation, sputtering, ion plating, or CVD. The conductive layer <b>6</b> can suppress the first layer <b>10</b> from being charged up. Because of the processing steps described so far, the sample support membrane can be produced.</p>
