      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Various chemical compounds of interest, such as biofuels, can be produced via metabolically enhanced cyanobacteria. One of these compounds is ethanol. In this context, the PCT patent application WO 2009/098089 A2 discloses the use of ethanologenic genes, for example pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes for the production of ethanol with cyanobacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Despite a generally promising concept, the practical implementation of ethanol production with metabolically enhanced cyanobacteria still faces critical problems which have made it so far difficult to achieve economical production rates per production volume and area.</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0155">All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0156">The following definitions and explanations are provided to better describe the present invention disclosure and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the understanding, interpretation and practice in the present invention. Unless explained otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0157">Cyanobacteria are small, prokaryotic, generally aquatic organisms that can be genetically manipulated to be capable of utilizing light and CO<sub>2 </sub>to produce compounds of interest, such as biofuels. Cyanobacterial cells are capable of fixing carbon dioxide as a carbon source for autotrophic growth, and therefore do not require any costly input of organic carbon as a growth substrate. Furthermore, the CO<sub>2 </sub>that is utilized by the cyanobacterial culture can be derived from any source, such as a waste byproduct of industrial production. In this way, cyanobacteria can be used to recycle CO<sub>2 </sub>to desired products, such as biofuels.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0158">The term â<i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp.â means an unspecified cyanobacterial member of the genus <i>Cyanobacterium</i>, which was among other characterized by Rippka and Cohen-Bazire (Ann. Microbiol. (Inst. Pasteur), 1983, 134B:32).</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0159">As used herein the term âmetabolically enhancedâ refers to any change in the endogenous genome of a wild type host cell, or to the addition of endogenous and non-endogenous, exogenous genetic code to a wild type host cell, for example a wild type cyanobacterial cell. One example is the introduction of a heterologous gene. In particular, such changes are made by the hand of man through the use of recombinant DNA technology or mutagenesis. The changes can involve protein coding sequences and/or non-protein coding sequences in the genome such as regulatory sequences, non-coding RNA, antisense RNA, promoters or enhancers. Aspects of the invention utilize techniques and methods common to the fields of molecular biology, microbiology and cell culture. Useful laboratory references for these types of methodologies are readily available to those skilled in the art, see for example âMolecular Cloning: A laboratory Manualâ (3rd edition), Sambrook, J. et al. (2001) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; âCurrent Protocols in Microbiologyâ (2007) edited by Coico, R. et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.; âThe Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteriaâ (1994), Donald Bryant (Ed.), Springer Netherlands; âHandbook of Microalgal Culture: Biotechnology and Applied Phycologyâ (2003) Richmond, A.

      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0160">Various cyanobacterial species have been metabolically enhanced to produce compounds of interest. The transformation of the cyanobacterial genus <i>Synechococcus </i>with genes that encode enzymes that can produce ethanol for biofuel production has been described (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,699,696 and 6,306,639). The transformation of the cyanobacterial genus <i>Synechocystis </i>has been described, for example, in WO 2009/098089 A2 and in WO 2011/018116 A1.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0161">The Michaelis-Menten model is useful for determining kinetic parameters for enzymatically catalyzed reactions and is well known in the art (Michaelis and Menten, (1913), âDie Kinetik der Invertinwirkung,â Biochem. Z. 49, 333-369). It is a model that describes the rate of enzymatic reactions by relating the reaction rate to the concentration of a substrate or substrates.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0162">K<sub>m </sub>values of ADH enzymes were determined herein by varying concentrations of one substrate only while keeping all other substrates at saturated levels. The kinetic parameters of the ADH enzymes were determined herein on cellular extracts, and not on pure enzyme. K<sub>m </sub>was determined herein using a nonlinear regression algorithm for the single-substrate version of the Michaelis-Menten model by using GraphPad Prism Software (version 5). The detailed description of the algorithm is available on the world wide web at âgraphpad.com/guides/prism/6/curve-fitting/index.htm?reg_kcat.htmâ.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0163">As used herein, the K<sub>m </sub>value was measured according to the method described in Example 4. The Km was measured using a crude cell extract, or a partially clarified extract, in 30 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT at a temperature of 30Â° C. For the forward reaction measurement, 0.15 mM NADPH was added, and acetaldehyde was added in differing amounts ranging from 1 Î¼m to 50 mM. The NADPH oxidation was measured at a wavelength of 340 nm. For the back reaction, 0.15 mM NADP<sup>+</sup> was added, with ethanol in differing amounts ranging from 1 mM to 2.5 M.</p>

      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0165">It is well known to a person of ordinary skill in the art that large plasmids can be produced using techniques such as the ones described in the U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,184 B1 titled âMethod for producing nucleic acid polymersâ and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,380 titled âDNA polymerase mediated synthesis of double stranded nucleic acid moleculesâ, which are hereby incorporated in their entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0166">Denominations of genes are in the following presented in a three letter lower case name followed by a capitalized letter if more than one related gene exists, for example ziaA for the gene encoding a zinc transporting ATPase. The respective protein encoded by that gene is denominated by the same name with the first letter capitalized, such as ZiaA.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0167">Denominations for promoter sequences, which control the transcription of a certain gene in their natural environment are given by a capitalized letter âPâ followed by the gene name according to the above described nomenclature, for example âPziaAâ for the promoter controlling the transcription of the ziaA gene.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0168">Denominations for enzyme names can be given in a two or three letter code indicating the origin of the enzyme, followed by the above mentioned three letter code for the enzyme itself, such as SynAdh (Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from <i>Synechocystis </i>PCC6803), ZmPdc (pyruvate decarboxylase from <i>Zymomonas mobilis</i>).</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0169">The term ânucleic acidâ is intended to include nucleic acid molecules, such as polynucleotides which include an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequence of genes, such as promoters and enhancers as well as non-coding RNAs. In addition, the terms are intended to include one or more genes that are part of a functional operon. In addition, the terms are intended to include a specific gene for a selected purpose. The gene can be endogenous to the host cell or can be recombinantly introduced into the host cell. Likewise, the term âamino acid sequenceâ is intended to include polypeptides and proteins, such as enzymes. Such amino acid sequences can be endogenous to the host cell or can be recombinantly introduced into the host cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0170">The percentage of identity of two nucleic acid sequences or two amino acid sequences, respectively, can be determined using the algorithm of Thompson et al. (ClustalW, 1994, Nucleic Acid Research, 22:4673-4680). A nucleotide sequence or an amino acid sequence can also be used as a so-called query sequence to perform a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence search against public nucleic acid or protein sequence databases in order to, for example, identify further homologous protein sequences and/or nucleic acid sequences which can also be used in embodiments of this invention. In addition, any nucleic acid sequence or protein sequence disclosed in this patent application can also be used as a query sequence in order to identify yet unknown sequences in public databases, which can encode for example new enzymes which could be useful in this invention. Such searches can be performed using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 1990, 87:2264-2268), modified as in Karlin and Altschul (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 1993, 90:5873-5877). Such an algorithm is incorporated in the nblast and xblast programs of Altschul et al. (Journal of Molecular Biology 1990, 215:403-410). Suitable parameters for these database searches with these programs are, for example, a score of 100 and a word length of 12 for BLAST nucleotide searches as performed with the NBLAST program. BLAST protein searches are performed with the XBLAST program with a score of 50 and a word length of 3. Where gaps exist between two sequences, the gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. (Nucleic Acid Research, 1997, 25:3389-3402).</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0171">The term âgenomeâ refers to the chromosomal genome as well to extra chromosomal plasmids which are normally present in the wild type <i>cyanobacterium </i>without having performing recombinant DNA technology. For example, cyanobacteria can include at least up to six extrachromosomal plasmids in their wild type form.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0172">The term âterminatorâ refers to a nucleic acid sequence, which is able to terminate the transcription of an mRNA. The terminators can exert their function in various ways including, but not limited to forming a hairpin structure in the mRNA transcript, which disrupts the mRNA-DNA RNA polymerase complex during transcription or via forming a recognition site for a transcription termination factor. Non-limiting examples are dsrA from <i>E. coli</i>, the oop terminator or the rho terminator.</p>

      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0191">In the above aspects, the Km-values represent the Km-values of the native, i.e. non-recombinant, form of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. A Km-value as used herein can be determined from the endogenously expressed alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme of a wild-type cyanobacterial cell. For example, a cell extract of the wild-type cyanobacterial cell which includes a minor portion of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and a major portion which is larger than the minor portion of other proteins can be used for determination of the Km-value of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. A suitable method for determining the Km-value of a native alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme within the meaning of the present invention is described further below in example 4. Accordingly, the Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde and the Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol shall be understood with NADPH or NADP+, respectively, as co-factor of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0192">Further information with regard to the assignment of the SEQ ID NOs of the present invention to their corresponding strains of origin can be found in the section âBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCESâ above.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0193">The inventors of the present invention discovered that the type of Adh enzyme and its specific kinetic properties in terms of its forward reaction, i.e. the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol, and its back reaction, i.e. the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol, are of at least similar importance as its activity level for the ethanol production characteristic and performance of a metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0194">On the one hand, a relatively low affinity for acetaldehyde of a recombinant Adh enzyme can lead to a transient acetaldehyde accumulation in the initial phase of the cultivation of a metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell. First of all, this causes economically unfavorable production downtimes from the start of the cultivation. Secondly, the acetaldehyde accumulation can cause acetaldehyde-related toxic effects which harm the cyanobacterial cells, leading for example to reduced cell vitality and metabolic turnover, and shortening the total exploitable phase of ethanol production.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0195">On the other hand, a low affinity for the product ethanol of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme can be of particular importance. The inventors discovered that conventional alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes often exhibit Michaelis constants K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol, and in particular combinations of Michaelis constants K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol and Michaelis constants K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde, which tend to favor the back reaction from ethanol to acetaldehyde at increasing ethanol concentrations. The observed effect resembles a product inhibition of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme at higher ethanol concentrations which significantly impairs achieving profitable ethanol concentrations with conventional metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells known in the art. As above, a concomitant effect is again the accumulation of acetaldehyde which harms the cyanobacterial cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0196">In contrast, by incorporating an Adh enzyme having Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde which is lower than 0.08Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, preferably lower than 0.07Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, most preferred lower than 0.06Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M; or having a Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde which is higher than 0.65Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, higher than 0.7Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M or higher than 0.73Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M but lower than 10Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, preferably lower than 9Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, most preferred lower than 8Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M in combination with a Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol which is higher than 20Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, preferably higher than 25Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, most preferred higher than 30Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M, the inventors achieved a metabolic enhancement of a cyanobacterial cell that leads to an enhanced level of ethanol formation due to the fact that the recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme is capable of maintaining a low acetaldehyde level in the culture and/or tolerates high ethanol product concentrations with substantially reduced back-reaction. For at least the same reasons, the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell of the present invention exhibits a higher vitality, maintains a high metabolic turnover during cultivation and achieves a timely extended phase of ethanol production in comparison to conventionally metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0197">The acetaldehyde and/or ethanol that is produced by a metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell can be quantified by several methods. In one method, gas chromatography is used, following methods similar to blood alcohol quantification methods, as described in example 7 of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0198">A useful indicator of the vitality of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell is, for example, the pigmentation of the cell during or after ethanol production. A reduction in the chlorophyll and/or phycocyanin pigmentation of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell in comparison to the wild type cyanobacterial cell can be an indicator of reduced cell vitality and stress. Another indicator for impaired cell vitality can be a reduction in the phycocyanin/chlorophyll ratio of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell in comparison to the wild type cyanobacterial cell. Reduced cell vitality can also be accompanied by an increased carotenoid/phycocyanin ratio of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell in comparison to the wild type cyanobacterial cell. The relative phycocyanin (PC) pigmentation can be photometrically measured at 620 nm wavelength. The relative chlorophyll (Chl) pigmentation can be photometrically measured at 680 nm wavelength. The relative carotenoid (Car) pigmentation can be photometrically measured in the range of 490 nm (+/â5 nm) wavelength. For example, the reduction in the relative phycocyanin/chlorophyll ratio of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell is less than 25%, preferably less than 20% in comparison to the wild type cyanobacterial cell. In another example, the increment in the relative carotenoid/phycocyanin ratio of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell is less than 100%, preferably less that 50%, most preferred less than 40% in comparison to the wild type cyanobacterial cell. Metabolically enhanced, ethanol-producing cyanobacterial cells exhibiting a relative phycocyanin/chlorophyll ratio and/or a carotenoid/phycocyanin ratio in these ranges are typically less affected by the ethanol production and have a vitality that is closer to that of a corresponding wild type <i>cyanobacterium. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0199">Furthermore, in many photoautotrophic cells, for example cyanobacterial cells, the level of total NAD+ and NADH to total NADP+ and NADPH is around 1:10. The inventors found that due to this pivotal imbalance of NADH to NADPH, an enhanced level of ethanol formation is achieved with metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells when the recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme has a Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for NADPH which is lower than the Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for NADH, thus having a higher affinity to the co-factor NADP+/NADPH than to the co-factor NAD+/NADH. An alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme having a higher affinity to the co-factor NADP+/NADPH than to the co-factor NAD+/NADH may in the following also be referred to as NADPH-dependent.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0200">The inventors of the present invention developed a powerful forward-genetic screening method to analyze a plurality of wild-type strains, for example several cyanobacterial wild-type strains, for the presence of NADPH-dependent native Adh function of genes in the wild-type strains by analysing the wild-type strains in vivo for the phenotypic effect of acetaldehyde conversion into ethanol in dependence of light. The screening method proceeds in the opposite direction of so-called reverse genetic screens which start from a particular gene and seek to find what phenotype arises from this gene. In contrast, the present screening method does not require prior knowledge of the corresponding Adh-encoding genes and therefore allows particularly fast and cost-efficient discovery of native alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes from a large number of newly isolated and/or uncharacterised candidate strains. This method is also applicable without having any sequence information about the genomic DNA sequence of the candidate strain. The screening method comprises the following steps:</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0201">A1) preparing a first and a second sample from each of the plurality of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial strains, <ul id="ul-00007-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00008-en" list-style="none"><li>A2) adding acetaldehyde to the first and second sample from each of the plurality of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial strains,</li><li>A3) keeping the first sample from each of the plurality of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial strains under illumination and the second sample without illumination,</li><li>A4) comparing the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol in the first and second sample of each of the plurality of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial strains,</li><li>A5) selecting cyanobacterial strains having a higher acetaldehyde conversion rate under illumination than without illumination for further characterization.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0206">The illumination in method step A3) can be between 50 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1 </sup>and 180 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>, 80 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1 </sup>and 150 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>, preferably between 110 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1 </sup>and 130 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0207">The acetaldehyde conversion into ethanol may, for example, be determined by gas chromatography. For instance, the method described in example 6 of the present invention may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0208">The inventors of the present invention discovered that an enhanced in vivo acetaldehyde conversion into ethanol in the illuminated sample in comparison to the sample without illumination indicates a light-dependent acetaldehyde conversion which is a sign of NADPH-dependent ADH activity in the corresponding alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial strain. Accordingly, the method is particularly advantageous to efficiently and economically pre-select candidate cyanobacterial strains prior to performing more detailed ex vivo analyses of Adh activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0209">Moreover, after identification and selection of candidate strains which have a higher acetaldehyde conversion rate under illumination than without illumination in step A5), the screening method can be further developed to easily determine important kinetic properties of a plurality of Adh enzymes, such as Km-values for acetaldehyde, NADPH and/or ethanol, by including the following additional steps: <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>A6) preparing cell extracts from the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial selected in step A5),</li><li>A7) contacting each of the cell extracts with a predetermined concentration of acetaldehyde and NADPH, or with a predetermined concentration of ethanol and NADP<sup>+</sup>,</li><li>A8) detecting conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol or of ethanol into acetaldehyde in each of the cell extracts.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0213">Typically, each of the cell extracts will contain a minor portion of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and a major portion of other cellular proteins being larger than the minor portion that are generally present in said alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme expressing cyanobacterial cell. For example, the portion of alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme is typically less than 1% of the cellular proteins. It is therefore a particular advantage of the screening method that a purification of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme from the cell extract is not necessary, resulting in considerable labor and cost savings in comparison to other methods. However, in certain variants, the method step A6) can also further comprise removal of molecules with a molecular size smaller than 1000 Da from the cell extracts, for instance by size exclusion chromatography.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0214">In a further variant of the screening method, the method step A6) further comprises the substep A6â²) separating each of the cell extracts into a plurality of portions. In this way, a plurality of measurements can be made with each of the cell extracts. For example, method step A7) can further comprise the substep A7â²) contacting the plurality of portions of each of the cell extracts with a plurality of predetermined concentrations of acetaldehyde and NADPH, or with a plurality of predetermined concentrations of ethanol and NADP+. Typically, the plurality of predetermined concentrations comprises a plurality of different concentrations. For example, different concentrations of acetaldehyde can be used together with one concentration of NADPH. In another example, different concentrations of NADPH can be used together with one concentration of acetaldehyde. In a further example, different concentrations of ethanol can be used together with one concentration of NADP+. In this way, a concentration-dependent conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol or of ethanol into acetaldehyde can be obtained. For example, the concentration-dependent conversion can be used in a further method step A9) for deriving the Km-value for acetaldehyde or the Km-value for ethanol of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme.</p>

At this wavelength range the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ can be detected as a decrease in absorption, and the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH can be detected as an increase in absorption, respectively, which is proportional to the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol or of ethanol into acetaldehyde, respectively.</p>

For example, the inventors found that a high K<sub>m </sub>(ethanol)/K<sub>m </sub>(acetaldehyde) ratio allows to quickly achieve a low steady state ratio between acetaldehyde and ethanol which is essentially maintained throughout the cultivation. Therefore, in a further embodiment, the ratio of the Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol and the Michaelis constant Km for acetaldehyde, K<sub>m </sub>(ethanol)/K<sub>m </sub>(acetaldehyde), of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme is higher than 55, preferably higher than 60, more preferred higher than 80, most preferred higher than 100.

      <p id="p-00203-en" num="0235">The recombinant gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme can be under the transcriptional control of a constitutive promoter. In this way, a certain level of transcription and, therefore, enzymatic activity of the corresponding Adh enzyme can be maintained during the whole period of cultivation. This is, for example, advantageous to maintain continuous conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol by the cell and avoid harmful accumulation of acetaldehyde in higher amounts. In particular, this is important for the initial phase of ethanol production when the Pdc activity is induced and is strongly increasing.</p>
      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0236">For example, the constitutive promoter can be endogenous to the cyanobacterial cell. This has the advantage that no recombinant transcription factor has to be present in the host cell. The endogenous promoter is usually well-recognized by the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell without the need to introduce further genetic modifications.

      <p id="p-00208-en" num="0239">The inventors found that in this preferred variant the promoter guarantees a particularly strong and reliable expression of the adh gene in the cyanobacterial cells of the present invention. In this way, particularly low acetaldehyde accumulation and high ethanol production rates are achieved, while long ethanol production periods can be maintained. At the same time, it was surprisingly discovered that a combination of this preferred promoter with a conventional adh gene, such as the synAdh from <i>Synechocystis </i>sp. PCC 6803, does not lead to the beneficial effect of high ethanol production and long production periods, because in this combination the cyanobacterial cells tend to suppress the expression of the conventional adh gene by genetic alteration of the adh gene after a few days of cultivation.</p>
      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0240">In a preferred embodiment, the cyanobacterial cell is capable of producing ethanol for at least 20 days, preferably at least 30 days, most preferred at least 40 days.</p>

The average ethanol production rate can for example be achieved with illumination at a photon flux density of 230 Î¼E/m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>. The illumination is preferably provided from one side to a culture of the cyanobacterial cell, for instance one side of a bioreactor in which the cyanobacterial cell is cultured. Furthermore, the illumination is preferably provided in 12 h/12 h day/night cycles.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0242">According to another embodiment of the invention, the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme is under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter. In this way, the ethanol production can be decoupled from metabolic pathways of the cell which are essential for growth and proliferation, thereby allowing accumulation of high cell densities in the culture and large amounts of precursor substrates prior to induction of the Pdc and, thus, the ethanol formation. In this way, significantly increased amounts of ethanol can be produced.</p>
      <p id="p-00212-en" num="0243">In a further variant, the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme and the recombinant gene encoding the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme are under the transcriptional control of different promoters. For example, the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme can be under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter and the recombinant gene encoding the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme can be under the transcriptional control of a constitutive promoter. Preferably, a transcription terminator is present between the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme and the recombinant gene encoding the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. The separate transcriptional control of both genes and the corresponding translation from separate mRNAs leads to significantly improved ethanol yields with the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00213-en" num="0244">In certain other embodiments, the transcription of both the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme and the recombinant gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes are controlled by the same single promoter. For these embodiments, an inducible promoter is preferred. In this way, the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde by action of the pyruvate decarboxylase and the subsequent conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol by action of the alcohol dehydrogenase can be directly coupled. Hence, accumulation of harmful concentrations of the acetaldehyde intermediate is effectively prevented. In certain variants, the recombinant gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase is arranged upstream of the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme, so that transcription of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene occurs before transcription of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene. In this way, a delay in Adh expression relative to Pdc expression can be avoided and a sufficiently high Adh expression level of Adh can be accomplished, so that transient acetaldehyde accumulation is effectively reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00214-en" num="0245">In a further preferred embodiment, at least a first recombinant gene encoding a pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme under the transcriptional control of a first inducible promoter and a second recombinant gene encoding a pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme under the transcriptional control of a second inducible promoter are present, wherein the first and the second promoter are separately inducible under different conditions. For a more full description of this embodiment, the applicant's international application WO 2013/098262 is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The inventors found that the separately inducible Pdc enzymes in combination with the Adh enzymes of the present invention allow maintaining a particularly long ethanol production phase of several weeks with at the same time high average ethanol production rates.</p>
      <p id="p-00215-en" num="0246">In a further embodiment, the inducible promoter is inducible by a change of a metal-ion concentration. Such a change of metal-ion concentration includes for instance the addition or depletion of certain metal ions. Suitable inducible promoters include, without limitation, the PziaA promoter, the PsmtA promoter, PaztA promoter, the PcorT promoter, the PnrsB promoter, the PpetJ promoter, the Porf0316 promoter, the Porf0221 promoter, the Porf0223 promoter, the Porf3126 promoter, the PmntC promoter, and variations thereof</p>

Such an activity-enhancing mutation can, for example, improve promoter recognition by the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell, tailor or improve the promoter strength and/or its induction conditions such as the required inductor concentration. Suitable genetic modifications of promoters include, for instance, truncated versions of promoters including only a small portion of the native promoter upstream of the transcription start point, such as the region ranging from â35 to the transcription start. Furthermore, nucleotide changes can be introduced into the promoter sequence, for example into the TATA box, the operator sequence and/or the ribosomal binding site (RBS).</p>

The extrachromosomal plasmid can, for example, replicate independently from the chromosome of the cyanobacterial cell. Moreover, the extrachromosomal plasmid can be present in a high copy number in the cyanobacterial cell. In this way, a high copy number of the gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme and/or the gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme can be present in the cell, in turn leading to high expression rates of the Pdc and/or Adh so that particularly high ethanol production rates can be achieved. The extrachromosomal plasmid preferably contains genes endogenous to the cyanobacterial host cell. For example, the plasmid can be derived from an endogenous plasmid of the cyanobacterial cell.</p>

      <p id="p-00228-en" num="0258">In a further variant of the invention, the extrachromosomal plasmid comprises an origin of replication with a nucleotide sequence having at least 80%, 90%, preferably at least 95% identity to the sequence deposited under SEQ ID NO: 12. This origin of replication is particularly suitable for replication in <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. with the accession number PTA-13311.</p>
      <p id="p-00229-en" num="0259">In a further variant the cyanobacterial cell further comprises a gene having at least 80%, 90%, preferably at least 95% sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence deposited under SEQ ID NO: 13 which codes for a replication initiation factor binding to the above-mentioned origin of replication. The gene coding for the replication initiation factor binding to the origin of replication can, for instance, be present on the extrachromosomal plasmid itself which also harbors the origin of replication. Alternatively, the gene coding for the replication initiation factor can be present in the chromosomes or other extrachromosomal plasmids of the cyanobacterial cell. The origin of replication and the gene coding for the replication initiation protein binding to said origin of replication are particularly suitable for replication of the extrachromosomal plasmid in <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. with the accession number PTA-13311, and ensure stable replication of the plasmid in the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00230-en" num="0260">In a further variant of the invention, the extrachromosomal plasmid comprises a sequence having at least 90% identity, preferably at least 95% identity to the sequence deposited under SEQ ID NO: 14. This plasmid is endogenous to the species <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. with the accession number PTA-13311 and is therefore more stable when transformed to the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell than plasmids derived from completely different organisms. In some embodiments, the entire endogenous plasmid may be inserted in a vector.</p>
      <p id="p-00231-en" num="0261">The extrachromosomal plasmid can also be part of a shuttle vector which is characterized by being replicable in both <i>Escherichia coli </i>and cyanobacterial species. To this end, the shuttle vector can comprise a promoter functioning in cyanobacteria and <i>E. coli </i>and a DNA sequence encoding a protein functioning as a selective marker for both <i>Escherichia coli </i>and cyanobacteria. Alternatively, the shuttle vector can include two different promoter systems, one functioning in cyanobacteria and the other one functioning in <i>E. coli</i>. With such a shuttle vector the efficient transformation of cyanobacteria and the expression of recombinant genes of interest are enabled. The shuttle vector can further contain a replication unit that functions in a broad range of cyanobacterial genera. The shuttle vector can also contain a replication unit for propagation in <i>E. coli </i>for ease of cloning and genetic manipulation in <i>E. coli </i>prior to the transformation of the shuttle vector into cyanobacteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00232-en" num="0262">In a further embodiment, the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell comprises at least one further recombinant gene encoding a second Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence of the recombinant gene encoding the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme differs from the nucleic acid sequence of the recombinant gene encoding the second Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. Differences in the nucleic acid sequence of the adh gene can, for example, include degenerated gene sequences due to changes in the wobble bases in the triplet codon which do not change the amino acid encoded by this triplet. Another example of non-identical adh gene sequences comprises gene sequences comprising conservative mutations. In some further embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme differs from the amino acid sequence of the second Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. Adh enzymes with different amino acid sequences can include, for example, neutral amino acid substitutions or enzyme isoforms. In this way, the gene copy number of alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes can be increased in the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell to ensure an advantageously high expression level. At the same time, the risk of homologous recombination between the adh genes is avoided, which could otherwise lead to gene inactivation, for instance by an adh gene knock-out. As a result, the genetic stability of the metabolically enhanced <i>cyanobacterium </i>is improved so that a stable ethanol production can be maintained for a long cultivation time.</p>
      <p id="p-00233-en" num="0263">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the recombinant gene encoding the first Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and the recombinant gene encoding the second Zn<sup>2+</sup> dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme are both under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter or are both under the transcriptional control of inducible promoters which are inducible under the same conditions. In this way, particularly high Adh activity levels can be achieved in the cyanobacterial cell and high ethanol production rates can be accomplished.</p>
      <p id="p-00234-en" num="0264">In particular, the inducible promoters of any of the above embodiments may be selected from the endogenous inducible promoters identified in <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. with the ATCC accession number PTA-13311 listed in Table 2, and variants thereof.</p>

      <p id="p-00240-en" num="0278">This method provides enhanced ethanol yields due to the principle features and associated advantageous properties of the above-described metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial host cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00241-en" num="0279">In one embodiment, the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme is under the transcriptional control of an inducible promoter which can be induced by an exogenous stimulus. In this case, method step b) comprises providing or enhancing the exogenous stimulus, thereby inducing or enhancing ethanol production. In this way, the ethanol production can be decoupled from metabolic pathways of the cell which are essential for growth and proliferation, thereby allowing accumulation of high cell densities in the culture and large amounts of precursor substrates prior to induction of the Pdc and, thus, the ethanol formation. In this way, significantly increased amounts of ethanol can be produced.</p>

In this way, particularly high ethanol production rates are achieved.</p>

At least two GC vials per wild-type strain were prepared. The GC vials were incubated at 37Â° C. on the GC's autosampler sample tray, wherein at least one GC vial per wild-type strain was incubated under constant illumination at a light intensity between 50 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1 </sup>and 180 Î¼E m<sup>â2 </sup>s<sup>â1</sup>.

The measurements were repeated in intervals of 10 min and ethanol production rates and acetaldehyde consumption rates were calculated on the basis of total protein concentration in the sample. Total protein in the sample was determined as described further below in example 3.

The pellets were redissolved in 30 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5 with 150 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT, hereinafter referred to as lysis buffer. One milliliter of the cell slurry was transferred into a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and 500 microliter of glass beads with 100 Î¼m diameter were added. Cells were then disintegrated on a Retch mill bead mill at the highest frequency setting in two cycles of 10 minutes each with a break of 10 minutes between the cycles wherein the samples were kept on ice. Afterwards, cell debris and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 22350 rcf for 10 minutes at 4Â° C. on a Micro 200R table top centrifuge from Hettich. Cell extract in the supernatant was transferred into a fresh Eppendorf tube. An aliquot of the cell extract was withdrawn for measuring the total protein concentration in the cell extract. For this purpose, a protein precipitation with DOC/TCA (Bensadoun, A. and Weinstein, D.: Assay of Proteins in the Presence of Interfering Materials, Analytical Biochemistry 1976, 70, 241-245) was performed in the aliquot. Afterwards, the protein precipitate was redissolved and the total protein concentration was measured with the method of Lowry (Lowry, O. H. et al.: Protein Measurement with the Folin Phenol Reagent, Journal of Biological Chemistry 1951, 193, 265-275). Typically, the proportion of adh enzyme amounts to less than 1% of the total protein content in the cell extract. The cell extracts were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare) which was equilibrated and eluted with lysis buffer according to the protocol provided by manufacturer. Accordingly, the first 3-6 ml of eluate contain the proteins including the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and were collected. Other fractions without proteins were discarded.</p>

      <p id="p-00305-en" num="0373">The <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 has a significant layer of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) outside the cell. The following method was used to decrease the EPS layer prior to conjugation. The method involves several steps: treatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC); washing steps that utilize NaCl; a treatment with lysozyme and subsequent washing. Firstly, 200 ml of an exponentially growing culture (0.5&lt;OD<sub>750 nm</sub>&lt;1) was incubated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 2 days at 16Â° C. at 0.1 mg/ml final concentration without shaking Afterwards, the culture was pelleted at 4400 rpm and washed with 0.9% NaCl containing 8 mM EDTA. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 M sucrose and incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature (RT) with slow shaking at 85 rpm. Then, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 40 ml of a solution containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 4% sucrose, and 20-40 Î¼g/ml lysozyme. After incubation at RT for 10-15 minutes, cells were centrifuged and washed three times using different washing solutions, namely i) with 30 mM Tris containing 4% sucrose and 1 mM EDTA, ii) with 100 mM Tris containing 2% sucrose and iii) with BG11 medium. All centrifugation steps before lysozyme treatment were performed at 4400 rpm for 10 min at 10Â° C., all centrifugations after the lysozyme treatment were performed at 2400 rpm for 5 minutes at 4Â° C.</p>
      <p id="p-00306-en" num="0374">Next, the cells were resuspended in 400 Î¼l BG11 culture medium containing Tris/sucrose buffer and used for gene transfer via conjugation. Triparental mating was performed as follows. <i>E. coli </i>strain J53 bearing a conjugative RP4 plasmid and <i>E. coli </i>strain HB101 bearing the plasmid cargo to be introduced into <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 and the pRL528 helper plasmid for in vivo methylation were used. <i>E. coli </i>strains were grown in LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics overnight at 37Â° C. with shaking at 100 rpm.

      <p id="p-00307-en" num="0375">GC headspace measurements were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionization detector. The instrument is connected in line with a Shimadzu PAL LHS2-SHIM/AOC-5000 autosampler, comprising a gas-tight syringe for transfer of headspace aliquots from the culture samples to the analytical unit. For illumination of the culture samples in the autosampler, each sample tray is exposed with a LED acrylic sheet (length: 230 mm, width: 120 mm, diameter: 8 mm, 24 Chip, S4, 5300K), equipped with a dimmer (Stingl GmbH; Germany). Mixing of the samples in the autosampler was accomplished with the IKA RO5 power magnetic stirrer. A heating mat KM-SM3 of Mohr &amp; Co. in combination with the JUMO dTRON 316 temperature regulator was used for thermostatization of the culture samples in the autosampler. The gas chromatograph was connected to helium carrier gas as well as hydrogen and artificial air as fuel gas and oxidizer gas, respectively, for the flame ionization detector. Oxidizer air was generated with the generator WGAZA50 from Science Support. The gas chromatograph was equipped with an FS-CS-624 medium bore capillary with a length of 30 m, internal diameter of 0.32 mm and film thickness of 1.8 Î¼m from the GC supplier Chromatographie Service GmbH.</p>
      <p id="p-00308-en" num="0376">For sample preparation, the hybrid clones were grown on BG11 plates supplemented with 2 mM ammonia and 2 mM urea containing medium but without nitrate, since for nirA promoter constructs nitrate is the inducer. The sample was prepared by scratching an individual clone from the BG11 plate and resuspending the corresponding clone in marine BG11 liquid medium (mBG11) containing 50 mM TES pH 7.3 and 20 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Addition of inducing agent, e.g. nitrate or specific metal-salts, triggered acetaldehyde and ethanol production, respectively, in the sample by induction of the inducible promoter driving expression of the recombinant gene encoding the pyruvate decarboxylase enzyme and the recombinant gene encoding the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. The cell density in the sample was then adjusted to an optical density of approximately 0.7 at 750 nm wavelength. Two milliliters of sample were then filled into a gas-tight GC vial for headspace autosampling with a nominal volume of 20 ml. The sample headspace was supplemented with 5 ml CO<sub>2</sub>. The vial was tightly closed with a cap with self-sealing silicon septum and placed into the autosampler which was temperature-controlled at 37Â° C. The illumination was set to 120 Î¼E. The magnetic stirrer was configured for interval mixing of the samples, with cycles of two minutes mixing at 400 rpm, followed by 90 minutes without mixing. An automated process followed, wherein after given times aliquots of 500 Î¼l of the headspace of the sample were automatically drawn with the gas-tight syringe and injected via the injection port into the gas chromatograph for analysis. Before each headspace autosampling, the mixing is changed for 10 minutes to continuous mixing with 750 rpm at 37Â° C. incubation temperature. The syringe temperature was set to 70Â° C. The fill speed was 250 Î¼l per second, following an initial lag time of 1 second after the septum of the samples had been pierced by the syringe needle. The injection of the aliquot into the gas chromatograph happened with an injection speed of 500 Î¼l per second. Afterwards, the syringe flushed for 3 minutes with air to prevent sample carryover between two injections. The gas chromatograph runtime was 4 minutes 30 seconds. The injection temperature on the gas chromatograph was 230Â° C. The column temperature was 60Â° C. Detection was accomplished with the flame ionization detector at 250Â° C. process temperature. The makeup gas was nitrogen at 30 ml per minute, the fuel gas was hydrogen at 35 ml per minute and the oxidizer gas was artificial air at 400 ml per minute.</p>
      <p id="p-00309-en" num="0377">After the final measurement, the final optical density of the samples was measured at 750 nm wavelength and an average cell density for each sample was determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the optical density at the starting point and the optical density at the end point of the process, divided by two. Afterwards, the average ethanol production per cell density was calculated.</p>

PCC6803. In addition, the Adh activity of these hybrid strains was determined under acetaldehyde-saturating conditions after the GC vial experiments were completed. <figref>FIG. 10A</figref> is a column diagram showing the corresponding Adh activity in Î¼mol/minÂ·mg protein for the specified hybrid strains. Data represent mean values and standard deviations of two independent samples. A significantly higher Adh activity of approximately 0.37 Î¼mol/minÂ·mg protein was observed with the comparative hybrid expressing the synADH enzyme. The hybrids expressing the <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>Adh enzymes, respectively, exhibited significantly lower Adh activities between about 0.27 and 0.05 Î¼mol/minÂ·mg protein. <figref>FIG. 10B</figref> is a column diagram showing the acetaldehyde to ethanol ratio during cultivation of the corresponding hybrid strains averaged over at least three consecutive timepoints between cultivation hours 15-35. It was surprisingly found that, despite the significantly lower Adh activity levels of the hybrids expressing the <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>Adh enzymes in comparison to the synAdh activity of the comparative strain, a significantly lower acetaldehyde to ethanol ratio of about 0.4-0.5% was achieved with the hybrid strains #1646, #1753 and #1754 compared to the acetaldehyde to ethanol ratio of about 0.95% observed with the comparative strain. Remarkably, hybrid #1735 exhibiting an at least 7-fold lower Adh activity than the comparative strain still achieved an acetaldehyde to ethanol ratio that was with about 1.05% only marginally higher than that of the comparative strain. A low acetaldehyde to ethanol ratio is generally desirable because it indicates an efficient conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol, translating into high ethanol production rates and at the same time avoiding acetaldehyde accumulation with toxic effects to the cyanobacterial cells.</p>

Ethanologenic <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 hybrids harboring the #1606, #1578, #1646, #1652, #1754 and #1760 plasmid constructs as well as a wild-type <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 for comparative purposes were cultivated in GC vials as described before in example 7. After measurement of the optical density at 750 nm, needed for calculation of the cell normalized ethanol production (EtOH/OD) cell suspensions were adjusted to an OD<sub>750 nm </sub>of 1.4 and the whole cell absorption spectra from 400 nm-750 nm was recorded using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2450) and an integrating sphere (Shimadzu ISR-2200). From the recorded spectra, the relative phycocyanin pigmentation was determined at 620 nm wavelength, the relative chlorophyll pigmentation was determined at 680 nm wavelength and the relative carotenoid pigmentation was determined at 490 nm wavelength. From the relative pigment contents the corresponding PC/Chl and Car/PC ratios were calculated. A reduced relative PC/Chl ratio and a significantly increased relative Car/PC ratio in comparison to a corresponding wild-type cell are typical indicators of reduced cell viability and increased stress. The results are shown in <figref>FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>. The hybrid strains #1646 and #1652 expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. and the hybrid strains #1754 and #1760 expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>exhibited a relative PC/Chl ratio which was essentially identical with that of the wild type strain and higher than that of the comparative hybrid strains #1606 and #1578 expressing the state-of-the-art synAdh enzyme (<figref>FIG. 16A</figref>). These results confirmed a superior viability of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells for the production of ethanol of the present invention in comparison to a conventionally enhanced cyanobacterial cell. The hybrid strain #1645 expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Synechococcus </i>sp. exhibited a PC/Chl ratio which is about 13% lower than that of the wild-type strain and shows that the vitality of this hybrid was also little affected by the ethanol production. Likewise, the relative Car/PC ratio (<figref>FIG. 16B</figref>) that was determined for hybrid strains #1646 and #1652 expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. and the hybrid strain #1760 expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>was essentially identical to that of the wild-type strain, confirming the superior viability of these metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells of the present invention in comparison to the comparative hybrid strains expressing the synAdh enzyme which exhibited an increase in the relative Car/PC ratio between about 11% and 43% in comparison to the wild type strain. The relative Car/PC ratio of the hybrid strain #1754 was about 10% increased in comparison to the wild-type cell, demonstrating a vitality that was still close to that of the wild type <i>cyanobacterium </i>and little affected by the ethanol production.</p>
      <p id="p-00332-en" num="0400">The cell viability results correlated well with an enhanced relative ethanol production rate per cell density (<figref>FIG. 18A</figref>) and a reduced acetaldehyde/ethanol ratio (<figref>FIG. 18B</figref>) achieved with the hybrids #1646, #1652, #1754 and #1760 of the present invention expressing the alcohol dehydrogenase gene from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or <i>Arthrospira platensis</i>, respectively. With all of these strains a significantly higher relative ethanol production rate per cell density was achieved in comparison to the comparative strains expressing the synAdh enzyme. While all of the tested hybrid strains exhibited essentially comparable Pdc activities (<figref>FIG. 19A</figref>), it is a remarkable and surprising result that the favorable effects achieved with the metabolically enhanced hybrids of the present invention were already achieved at relatively low Adh activity levels (<figref>FIG. 19B</figref>). In particular the lower Adh activity levels of constructs #1646, #1754 and #1760 in comparison to the comparative hybrids #1606 or #1578 demonstrated that the specific K<sub>m </sub>values for acetaldehyde and ethanol of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell of the present invention can have an even higher positive impact on the cell viability and ethanol production performance of the <i>cyanobacterium </i>than the gross Adh activity, i.e. the sum of expression level and turnover rate, of a conventionally enhanced cyanobacterial cell. Therefore, it can be concluded that even further improved effects can be achieved when the gross activity of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme of the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cell of the present invention is further increased, for example by increasing the Adh expression level.</p>

      <heading id="h-00039-en" level="1">Influence of the Promoter Type on Adh Activity and Acetaldehyde/Ethanol Accumulation in Different Ethanologenic <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 Hybrids</heading>
      <p id="p-00333-en" num="0401">The GC vial online method was used to investigate the acetaldehyde accumulation and ethanol production during cultivation of <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 hybrid strains harboring the ethanologenic plasmids #1646, #1750 and #1791 with the Adh enzyme from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. under the control of the Prbc, PrpsL and PcpcB promoter, respectively. Hybrid strains harboring the ethanologenic plasmids TK293, #1578 and #1792 with the synADH gene from <i>Synechocystis </i>sp. PCC6803 under the control of the Prbc, PrpsL and PcpcB promoter, respectively, served as comparative examples. In addition, the Adh and Pdc activity of these hybrid strains was determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00334-en" num="0402">
        <figref>FIG. 26B</figref> shows the development of the ethanol content per OD in the cultures over the cultivation time. Data represent mean values and standard deviations of four independent samples. Over the monitored period of about 32 hours, similar ethanol productions rates were observed with strains harboring plasmids #1646, #1750 and #1791 as well as the reference strain harboring plasmid #1578, with slightly better rates of the former strains expressing the Adh enzyme from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. The reference strain with plasmid #1792 and, in particular, the reference strain with plasmid TK293 expressing the synADH gene from <i>Synechocystis </i>sp. exhibited comparatively lower ethanol productivity.</p>
      <p id="p-00335-en" num="0403">
        <figref>FIG. 27A</figref> shows the corresponding acetaldehyde accumulation results. The comparative strains expressing the synADH enzyme under the control of the PrpsL or Prbc promoter accumulated between about 200-500% more acetaldehyde than the strains expressing the Adh enzyme from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or the reference strain expressing the synADH enzyme under the control of the PcpcB promoter. As noted above, a low acetaldehyde level is desirable because it indicates an efficient conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol and, at the same time, avoids toxic effects of acetaldehyde to the cyanobacterial cells.</p>
      <p id="p-00336-en" num="0404">
        <figref>FIG. 27B</figref> is a column diagram showing the corresponding Adh activity in Î¼mol/minÂ·mg protein for the specified hybrid strains. Relatively low activity levels were observed when the strains expressed either the Adh from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or the synAdh under the control of the PrpsL or the Prbc promoter. Significantly increased Adh activity was observed when the hybrid strains expressed the Adh enzyme under the transcriptional control of the PcpcB promoter. Notably, the expression of synAdh under control of the PcpcB promoter in the reference strain harboring plasmid #1792 still resulted in about 700% higher Adh activity than the expression of the <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. Adh enzyme under control of the same PcpcB promoter in the strain harboring plasmid #1791, i.e. 8.54 Î¼mol/minÂ·mg versus 1.2 Î¼mol/minÂ·mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00337-en" num="0405">Thus, due to the low K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde of the Adh enzymes of the present invention, a comparatively low gross Adh activity is already sufficient to maintain lower acetaldehyde accumulation in the culture, while at the same time a higher level of ethanol production is achieved. Conversely, conventional Adh enzymes such as the synAdh require much higher gross Adh activity in order to compensate for their lower substrate affinity to acetaldehyde. Thus, a very high expression of the conventional Adh enzymes is required to achieve similar low acetaldehyde accumulation and high ethanol production as with the Adh enzymes of the present invention. This may for instance be achieved by driving the expression of the conventional Adh enzyme with a strong promoter such as the PcpcB promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00338-en" num="0406">However, a very high expression of a recombinant Adh enzyme imposes a tremendous metabolic burden on the ethanol-producing cyanobacterial host cell. For example, 3-5% of the total cell protein may be directed towards the overexpression of the Adh enzyme, to the expense and imbalance of other important anabolic and catabolic pathways. Moreover, the overabundance of the recombinant Adh enzyme can further undesirable side reactions in which the enzyme unspecifically reduces substrates other than acetaldehyde. All of these effects can be detrimental to the viability, longevity and productivity of the ethanol producing cyanobacterial host cell.</p>
      <p id="p-00339-en" num="0407">It is therefore a particular advantage that with the Adh enzymes of the present invention favorable acetaldehyde accumulation and ethanol production properties are achieved already at low Adh activity levels, because in this way the host cell's metabolic burden and the risk of undesirable side reactions can also be kept low without dispensing with ethanol yield.</p>

      <p id="p-00340-en" num="0408">The GC vial online method was used to investigate the acetaldehyde accumulation and ethanol production during cultivation of <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 hybrid strains harboring the ethanologenic plasmid #1790 with the Adh enzyme from <i>Arthrospira platensis</i>, #1791 with the Adh enzyme from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp., #1792 with the synAdh as a reference, #1793 with the Adh enzyme from <i>Synechococcus </i>sp. and #1795 with the Adh enzyme from <i>Cyanothece </i>sp., all of which have the respective adh gene under transcriptional control of the PcpcB promoter. A hybrid strain harboring the plasmid #1578 with the synadh gene under control of the Prbc promoter was used as an additional reference. In addition, the Adh activity of these hybrid strains was determined.</p>
      <p id="p-00341-en" num="0409">The Adh activity measurements (<figref>FIG. 28A</figref>) show that the highest Adh activity was again detected in the reference hybrid harboring the plasmid #1792 with the synAdh under control of the strong PcpcB promoter. Medium Adh activity levels were detected in the hybrids harboring the plasmid #1791 and #1793 with the Adh enzymes from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. and <i>Synechococcus </i>sp., respectively. The Adh enzymes from <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>(#1790) and <i>Cyanothece </i>sp. (#1795) exhibited the lowest activity levels of the PcpcB controlled enzymes, which was comparable to that of the reference strain harboring the plasmid #1578 with the synadh gene under control of the Prbc promoter.</p>
      <p id="p-00342-en" num="0410">
        <figref>FIG. 28B</figref> shows the corresponding ethanol production per OD over the cultivation time. Despite the big differences in the Adh activity (see above), all strains exhibited essentially comparable ethanol production during the monitored 40 hours of cultivation.</p>
      <p id="p-00343-en" num="0411">The observed acetaldehyde accumulation with the hybrid strains is shown in <figref>FIG. 29A</figref>. The acetaldehyde accumulation is substantially lower for the strains expressing the Adh enzyme under the control of the PcpcB promoter than for the reference strain expressing the synAdh under control of the Prbc promoter. The lowest acetaldehyde levels were observed in the strains expressing the <i>Arthrospira platensis </i>and <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. Adh enzymes (#1790, #1791).</p>
      <p id="p-00344-en" num="0412">These results demonstrate that metabolic enhancement of cyanobacterial cells according to the present invention by incorporating an Adh enzyme having Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde which is lower than 0.08Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M (e.g. from <i>Arthrospira platensis, Lyngbya </i>sp. or <i>Cyanothece </i>sp.; #1790, #1791, #1795), or having a Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for acetaldehyde which is higher than 0.65Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M but lower than 10Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M in combination with a Michaelis constant K<sub>m </sub>for ethanol which is higher than 20Â·10<sup>â3 </sup>M (e.g. from <i>Synechococcus </i>sp.; #1793) leads to a high level of ethanol formation. This is due to the fact that the recombinant alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes of the present invention are capable of maintaining a low acetaldehyde level in the culture and/or tolerate high ethanol product concentrations with substantially reduced back-reaction already at comparatively low activity levels.</p>

      <heading id="h-00046-en" level="1">Genetic Integrity of Adh Enzyme Expression Cassettes in Ethanologenic <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 Hybrids</heading>
      <p id="p-00349-en" num="0416">Long-term cultivation of <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311 hybrids harboring the reference plasmids #1792, #1784 and #1835, each containing an expression cassette with the synAdh gene under transcriptional control of the PcpcB promoter, unexpectedly showed a loss of Adh activity and ethanol production after a only few days of cultivation. For example, the recovery and subsequent PCR analysis of the plasmid #1784 from the cultures after loss of the Adh activity initially indicated that gene deletions of various lengths occurred in the synAdh gene (<figref>FIG. 29B</figref>). While the full length PCR product of the synAdh has a size of about 1400 bp (bold arrow), specific synAdh PCR amplificates of smaller size due to deletions of about 490 bp and 680 bp (thin arrows) were obtained after the observed Adh activity loss.</p>
      <p id="p-00350-en" num="0417">Subsequently, the genetic integrity of the Adh enzymes from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. and <i>Synechococcus </i>sp. of the present invention (plasmids #1791, #1793 and #1938) and, as a representative comparative example, of the synAdh enzyme (plasmid #1835) were studied in more detail during ethanologenic cultivation in 1.2 L vertical vPBRs.</p>
      <p id="p-00351-en" num="0418">The results are shown in <figref>FIGS. 30A through 32A</figref>. <figref>FIG. 30A</figref> depicts the cell density in the different cultures in relation to the cultivation time. The cyanobacteria expressing the Adh enzymes of the present invention (i.e. plasmids #1791, #1793 and #1938) exhibited an essentially constant growth over the monitored 35 days of cultivation. In contrast, the cell growth was significantly impaired in cyanobacteria harboring the plasmid #1835 with the synAdh enzyme under the control of the strong PcpcB promoter, presumably due to the high metabolic strain imposed on the cells by the overexpression of the synAdh. The cell viability of the cells was so defective that the cultivation of the cells harboring the plasmid #1835 had to be terminated on day 12. <figref>FIG. 30B</figref> shows the corresponding ethanol accumulation during the cultivation. After about 3-4 days of cultivation, the ethanol accumulation deteriorated in the cell culture harboring the plasmid #1835, whereas the cell cultures expressing the Adh enzymes of the present invention continued to accumulate ethanol at a constant rate until the end of the cultivation after 34 days. Determination of the chlorophyll/OD ratio of cyanobacterial cells during the cultivation (<figref>FIG. 31A</figref>) confirmed a strongly decreasing pigmentation of the cells expressing the synAdh under control of the PcpcB promoter, which is characteristic of a rapid loss of cell vitality. In contrast, relatively constant chlorophyll/OD ratios were present in the cells expressing the Adh enzymes of the present invention under the control of the PcpcB promoter, confirming that with these Adh enzymes the cells are less affected by the recombinant Adh expression and ethanol production and have a vitality that is closer to that of a corresponding wild type <i>cyanobacterium</i>. The measured Adh activity in the cultures is shown in <figref>FIG. 31B</figref>. The Adh activity in cells harboring the plasmid #1835 was almost completely lost after only about 8 days of cultivation, whereas only a comparatively moderate decrease in Adh activity was observed in the strains harboring the plasmids #1791, #1793 and #1938 with the Adh enzymes of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00352-en" num="0419">PCR analysis of the recovered #1835 plasmids after cultivation confirmed genetic deletions in the synAdh gene of about 800 and 400 base pairs in length (<figref>FIG. 32A</figref>). Subsequent sequencing of the defective synAdh genes showed that the deletions comprised the region from bases 2671-2923 and 2725-3371 of the synAdh gene, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00353-en" num="0420">In conclusion, ethanol production with cyanobacterial cells harboring a recombinant PcpcB-synAdh expression cassette suffers from a rapid loss and/or inactivation of the synAdh gene due to partial gene deletions. The gene deletions are likely to occur due to the genetic pressure imposed on the cells as a result of the metabolic burden and harmful unspecific side reactions caused by the overexpression and overabundance of the synAdh enzyme. Accordingly, it is an unexpected and surprising effect that the metabolically enhanced cyanobacterial cells according to the present invention have improved genetic stability with respect to the recombinantly overexpressed adh gene in comparison to conventionally enhanced cyanobacterial cells overexpressing the state of the art synAdh enzyme. In particular, it is a favorable effect of the present invention that the expression of the Adh enzyme (e.g. from <i>Lyngbya </i>sp. or <i>Synechococcus </i>sp.) can be controlled by the PcpcB promoter, because this promoter is a particularly strong and reliable promoter in cyanobacteria such as the <i>Cyanobacterium </i>sp. PTA-13311.</p>
