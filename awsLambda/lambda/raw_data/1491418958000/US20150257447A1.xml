    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to electronic cigarettes and more specifically to a configuration for introduction of chemical species into an atomized fluid airstream provided thereby.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In the use of electronic cigarettes, users often prefer an atomized liquid that is flavored and or combined with physiologically active chemicals, such as nicotine, over one that is not. Prior art achieves the delivery of such a fluid by way of an atomizing a mixture of propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, or other suitable chemicals that are mixed with chemical species that provide a flavor or physiological effect, or both simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">There are several shortcomings of the prior art that utilizes this approach. In prior art utilizing a tank for storage of the liquid for atomization, the tank volumes are often relatively large. Given that users often prefer to fill a tank with a large volume of liquid, it is inconvenient in the sense that a user must completely consume the liquid or must remove the liquid manually and replace it with a different liquid if they desire a different mixture. Furthermore, since it is difficult to completely remove a previous mixture from the internal components of a tank and atomizing apparatus, the mixtures can interact and create combinations that may be undesirable. Therefore an improvement upon prior art would be to make it more convenient for a user to exchange the flavoring or physiological active species with ease and without mixing of previously loaded mixtures.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Additionally, prior art utilizing a heating element for atomization of a said mixture present the possibility of degradation and pyrolysis of chemical species residing in the mixture. Therefore there exists a need to improve upon the prior art so as to create a system whereby the chemical species desired for consumption of the user may not undergo excessive pyrolysis or degradation.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present invention, breathable fluid delivery device (or inhalation device) components are presented. In one aspect, the disclosure presents an auxiliary conduit attachment for coupling with electronic cigarettes whereby chemical species can be introduced into a fluid stream provided by a coupled parent electronic cigarette or apparatus capable of forming such a fluid stream as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to another aspect of the present invention, a complete inhalation device, such as an electronic cigarette device, for delivery of atomized liquid and other functional chemical species is provided. The device is preferably a handheld assembly of components including a battery assembly, an electronic control circuit, at least one atomizing element, and a series of fluid conduits. The atomizing element may comprise any suitable mechanism for atomizing a liquid to be introduced into a breathable (generally interchangeable with âinhalableâ for purposes of this description and claims) fluid stream.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The fluid conduits include an atomization liquid storage chamber, an atomization chamber, a suitable exchangeable fluid-permeable body, illustrated and described herein as a âcartridgeâ comprising a porous packing material for containing a functional liquid, and a mouthpiece. Cartridges generally referred to herein include a casing for containing the porous packing material, which is desirable for retaining functional liquid within the cartridge and/or imparting a shape to certain packing materials. However, if the packing material is a solid, stiff, unitary mass, which may be termed a âpodâ in the context of the invention, the casing is not essential to hold the shape of the pod, and may optionally be omitted despite the possible increased tendency of leaking or evaporation of functional liquid therefrom. In some embodiments, the device includes an atomizing element associated with the cartridge itself, to atomize and facilitate the introduction of the functional liquid contained in the cartridge into the breathable fluid stream, either in lieu of or in addition to an atomizer tank assembly connected in line with the cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The device further includes electronic components such as a battery, an electronic controller for directing a controlled voltage and current to other electronic components, a user display and/or input interface, a signal receiver component, electrically powered atomizing elements, a button/switch/other manual actuator, and conductive wires or other circuit elements. The electronic controller may include a processor, a memory, and/or one or more sensors, which enable the device to perform functions such as storing, recalling, and presenting to a user historical device state data or usage data, adjusting current or voltage in response to detected overheating of components or other predetermined device states, automatically actuating atomizing elements in response to sensing a user drawing breath from a mouthpiece, and actuating or âunlockingâ atomizing elements in response to a passcode input.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">Illustrative embodiments and exemplary applications will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings to disclose the advantageous teachings of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In this disclosure, relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom, proximal and distal, upper and lower, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. In this disclosure, the use of the term âproximalâ with relation to the anatomy of the present invention may be used to distinguish the end of the disclosed assembly that is at the farthest end of the mouthpiece, while the âdistalâ end refers to the farthest end of the battery enclosure. However, the relative positions and orientations of components or features of an inhalation device are described and depicted for illustrative purposes and are not required unless expressly stated.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">In this disclosure, the terms âfluid,â âfluid stream,â and âfluid flowâ may refer to any suitable fluid composition, including but not limited to pure air or air mixed with an atomized, volatilized, nebulized, discharged, or otherwise gaseous phase or colloidal aerosol form of a functional liquid or atomizing liquid described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">In this disclosure, the term âfunctional liquidâ shall be understood to represent a chemical species, composition, or mixture thereof, which is intended to be volatilized, atomized, or otherwise introduced into a fluid stream that is in communication with said liquid. The functional liquid may be comprised of any single chemical species or combination of chemical species having desirable properties for enhancing an inhaled fluid stream and being suitable for adsorption upon or absorption into media suitable for use in the present invention. Furthermore, a functional substance in non-liquid form, which may for example be crystalline or otherwise solid, may be substituted for a functional liquid without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In this disclosure, the term âatomizing liquidâ shall be understood to represent a chemical species, or mixture thereof, which is intended to be vaporized, nebulized, or otherwise introduced into and carried with a said fluid stream passing through the present invention. Furthermore, in extension of previous discussion, the atomizing liquid may emulate various physical characteristics of tobacco smoke upon atomization, such as a visible plume and/or the temperature, bulk, flavor, or other organoleptic qualities of the inhaled stream. Furthermore the atomizing liquid may also act to enhance the solvation characteristics of the fluid stream or act to deliver heat energy to another material or substance, such as through condensation. According to the present invention, the atomizing liquid may include propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin, for example. Transition of a chemical species from liquid form to a gaseous phase or nebulized phase is commonly facilitated by rapid heating on a resistive coil, or nebulization via a vibrating film, plate, or reed. It is to be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to utilization of the stated methods and/or chemicals, but may employ any suitable mechanism capable of transitioning a liquid into a gaseous or nebulized phase to be carried in a fluid stream providing the desired functions as stated or implied.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The present invention relates to breathable fluid delivery apparatuses, such as electronic cigarettes and other inhalation devices, including an exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge containing a liquid mixture of chemical species to be introduced into a breathable fluid stream passing through the cartridge, which may comprise air in combination with atomized liquid, vapor, or both. With respect to the phrase âintroduced into a breathable fluid stream,â one skilled in the art will understand the term âbreathableâ in a broad sense of being comfortable for a human user to inhale intermittently, as in the ordinary use of electronic cigarettes, vaping pens, and similar devices. In the context of the invention, the term âbreathable fluid streamâ includes but is by no means limited to pure air and substances similarly suitable for breathing continuously for extended time periods. The exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge may be disposed in an auxiliary conduit attachment substituting for the mouthpiece of an atomized liquid delivery system (such as an existing electronic cigarette).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In particular, in accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for delivering a functional liquid in a breathable fluid stream for inhalation is provided. The apparatus may be an attachment for a breathable fluid delivery device, comprising a mouthpiece, which may be removable, including a distal opening in fluid communication with a proximal opening; and a cartridge comprising a fluid-permeable packing material, configured for drawing a breathable fluid through the packing material by inhaling through the mouthpiece. The phrase âin fluid communicationâ will be understood to refer broadly to components or features of the device disposed in the path of a common fluid channel or conduit, without limitation to components that are necessarily directly adjacent to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The packing material contains a functional liquid disposed to be introduced into the fluid stream as the fluid stream passes through the packing material and to be carried in the fluid stream in a breathable form when the fluid stream passes out of the mouthpiece through the distal opening. The functional fluid may provide a flavor, a recreational and/or medicinal drug effect, or other desired effect when the breathable fluid stream is inhaled.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">A cartridge suitable for use with embodiments of the invention may consist solely of a fluid permeable packing, or may further comprise additional elements. For example, the cartridge may include a casing covering at least a portion of the packing. Where present, the casing may include open ends or fluid permeable ends that nonetheless provide support to prevent the packing from falling out of or being removed from the casing. Whether the casing includes open ends or fluid-permeable ends that support/retain the packing, the ends of the casing may be sealable for storage or shipping by a removably adhered film. The packing itself may also take different forms, including a single solid porous body or pod, or a mass of fibers, particles, or grains having spaces therebetween, functioning to permit fluid passage, similarly to the pores of a single porous body.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The cartridge may be manually removably retained in a housing, which in turn may be retained supported, and/or enclosed by a housing cover. The cartridge housing includes a proximal opening in fluid communication with the breathable base fluid and a distal opening in fluid communication with the proximal mouthpiece opening, and the housing including structure to support the cartridge in a position in which a portion, such as a proximal end, of the cartridge is in fluid communication with the proximal housing opening and a portion, such as a distal end, of the cartridge is in fluid communication with the distal housing opening. The housing may be removably connected to a fluid delivery device, for example via a coupling adaptor, the fluid delivery device being configured to deliver a stream of the breathable base fluid into the proximal housing opening. Coupling adaptors according to the invention may or may not be interchangeable with existing mouthpieces of existing breathable fluid devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">When an apparatus according to the invention includes a cartridge housing cover, the housing cover may comprise two separate cover sections removably connected together to at least substantially surround the housing but for a proximal housing cover opening in fluid communication with the proximal housing opening and a distal housing cover opening in fluid communication with the distal housing opening. The two housing cover sections may be threaded together, or, for example, mated together by an insertable portion of one of the sections being slidingly inserted into a receiving portion of the other section. Whether slidingly mated or threaded together, the housing cover sections preferably comprise a resilient member disposed on at least one of the insertable portion and the receiving portion to seal the connection between the housing sections and to frictionally retain the housing sections in a mated configuration.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">Preferably, the apparatus or attachment includes a flow channel in which the packing is disposed, the flow channel including a wider portion adjacent at least one of the distal and the proximal end of the cartridge, and a narrower portion adjacent the wider portion and extending therefrom in a direction away from the cartridge. Advantageously, to maximize the surface area available for inflow of breathable fluid through the cartridge, a spacer feature abuts the cartridge to maintain an axial distance between the cartridge and the narrower channel portion. The spacer feature may comprise a separate annular member, or it may be integrated into, for example, a cartridge casing or housing. The spacer may have a uniform longitudinal dimension, or it may have a tapered dimension, so that no part of the proximal/upstream/inlet area of the cartridge is covered so as to block inflow of breathable fluid.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a fluid-permeable cartridge for breathable delivery of a functional liquid is provided as a stand-alone product. The cartridge comprises a fluid-permeable packing material containing an absorbed or adsorbed quantity of a functional liquid configured to be introduced into a breathable fluid stream flowing through the cartridge. The cartridge may further include a fluid-impermeable covering disposed over at least a portion of the outer surface area of the packing material. Such a covering may comprise a wall structure generally surrounding the packing material, with or without one or two fluid-permeable ends joined to the wall structure to fully retain/cover/encase the packing. To facilitate shipping and/or extended storage, the covering may include a fluid-impermeable film material removably fixed over the ends of the covering to seal the packing material and functional liquid within the covering for storage and/or transport prior to use of the cartridge. Alternatively, the covering may also accept sealing caps that may be compressed onto the ends, such as plastic caps, which could act to seal the cartridge when it is not in use or in storage.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Suitable film materials may include, without limitation, metal foil, BoPET (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate), and plastics, and the film may be affixed by adhesive and/or heat-fused wax. Packing materials may be selected from among cotton, foam, fibrous media, stacked thread, stone, synthetic porous media, and any other materials having the desired adsorption/absorption and fluid permeability properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, a conduit assembly for a breathable fluid delivery device is provided. In particular, a fluid-permeable cartridge is disposed in a main fluid channel for inhalation delivery of a breathable fluid stream, the cartridge containing a functional liquid disposed to be introduced in a breathable form into a breathable base fluid flowing in the main fluid channel through the cartridge. A source of the breathable base fluid is connected in fluid communication with an upstream end of the cartridgeâthis may be any reservoir of or component or system for delivering a breathable base fluid, including but not limited to a fluid tank and a heating coil or vibration element, for example, where such a tank and atomizing element are sometimes collectively termed a âcartomizer.â A mouthpiece is connected in fluid communication with a downstream end of the cartridge, and an adjustable valve system is incorporated in the assembly for adjusting the flow impedance of a bypass channel passing around the cartridge relative to the flow impedance of a portion of the main channel extending through the cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In a particular embodiment, the adjustable valve system comprises a tube in fluid communication with the breathable base fluid source, and a tube in fluid communication with the upstream end of the cartridge, one of the tubes being an insertable tube comprising a tapered tip narrowing to a smallest exterior cross section at an open end of the tube, at least a portion of the tapered tip being insertable into an open end of the other tube, the other tube being a receiving tube. The insertable and receiving tubes are relatively movable for insertion and withdrawal of the tapered tip into and out of the receiving tube to vary the cross-sectional area of a clearance between the receiving tube opening and the tapered tip. The bypass channel is in fluid communication with the breathable base fluid source only by way of a passage extending through a clearance between the receiving tube opening and the tapered tip. Preferably, the insertion tube includes a structural feature configured to seal off the receiving tube opening when fully inserted to a closed valve position, to cut off all flow through the bypass channel.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, breathable fluid delivery device components are presented. In one aspect, the disclosure presents an auxiliary conduit attachment for coupling with electronic cigarettes whereby chemical species can be introduced into a fluid stream provided by a coupled parent electronic cigarette or apparatus capable of forming such a fluid stream as described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, with reference to an embodiment thereof illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, an auxiliary conduit attachment <b>10</b> for coupling with breathable fluid delivery devices such as electronic cigarettes will now be described. Attachment <b>10</b> may substitute for a mouthpiece of an existing fluid delivery device, and thus includes a coupling adaptor <b>12</b> for attaching to the fluid delivery device as would an existing mouthpiece.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, a cartridge housing <b>14</b> and a coupling adaptor <b>12</b> fit together to retain and support between them an exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge <b>16</b>, capable of containing a functional liquid disposed to be readily picked up and carried in a breathable fluid stream passing therethrough. The proximal end of housing <b>14</b> may for example be threaded onto coupling adaptor <b>12</b>, or attached thereto in any other suitable manner. Housing <b>14</b> and adaptor <b>12</b> cooperate to provide a defined slot for cartridge <b>16</b> to rest in, to prevent cartridge <b>16</b> from easily sliding or falling out of housing <b>14</b> when being exchanged by a user. Additionally, the housing slot does not severely obstruct access to cartridge <b>16</b>, so as to make it relatively easy for a user to exchange cartridge <b>16</b> by grasping it with one's fingers.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">To permit the passage of a breathable fluid through attachment <b>10</b>, coupling adaptor <b>12</b> includes an open channel <b>18</b> spanning its internal length, which may or may not have a similar inner diameter to that of a mouthpiece for which attachment <b>10</b> substitutes, and housing <b>14</b> also includes a channel for receiving a mouthpiece <b>15</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the housing cover includes a distal end wall with a channel <b>19</b> passing through it designed to accept mouthpiece <b>15</b>. Alternatively, the housing cover may comprise an integrated mouthpiece (not shown). Various embodiments could adapt to various mouthpieces. In the illustrated embodiment, mouthpiece <b>15</b> has the same dimensions as coupling adaptor <b>12</b>. In other various embodiments, the dimension of the coupler and the dimension of the channel could vary and do not necessarily need to be compatible in terms of mouthpiece attachment male and female fittings.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">Attachment <b>10</b> may be constructed with various fluid delivery device coupling adaptors to permit use of attachment <b>10</b> with said devices at a connection point where a mouthpiece of an existing type would normally fit, although coupling adaptor <b>12</b> may alternatively comprise a different type of connector</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">The proximal end of the slot for cartridge <b>16</b> includes a structural spacer feature, illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> as a stepped profile <b>20</b> of coupling adaptor <b>12</b>. The spacer feature acts to lift the exchangeable cartridge off of the proximal base of the housing slot where a fluid enters from an opening, illustrated as the distal end of channel <b>18</b>, having a cross-sectional area smaller than the area of an volume <b>22</b> defined by the riser of the stepped profile of coupling adaptor <b>12</b>. Thus, the spacer feature functions to increase the cross-sectional area where a breathable fluid stream may enter cartridge <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">Cartridge <b>16</b> may comprise a casing <b>24</b>, fluid permeable ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and a fluid permeable packing <b>30</b>, which may for example be a single porous body or a mass of fibers, coarse grains, or particles of material including spaces therebetween, even if the individual fibers, grains, or particles are themselves non-porous. Casing <b>24</b> is preferably a tube-like structure having a hollow channel spanning its length and open ends. At the ends of casing <b>24</b>, fluid permeable ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are connected or attached to allow the passage of a fluid through the casing channel and packing <b>30</b>, while providing containment of packing <b>30</b> inside casing <b>24</b>. Fluid permeable ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be, but are not limited to, mesh screens or perforated sheets having arrayed apertures <b>32</b>, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 6</figref>. As an additional aspect, one or both of ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be constructed from the same piece of material as the casing <b>24</b>, but with fluid permeable properties. Ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> may be constructed to permit sealing with a thin film or the like (not shown) for storage and packaging of cartridge <b>16</b>. This film may for example be metal foil, plastic, or other comparable materials that could be fixed to ends <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> via an adhesive, heat fused wax, or other comparable method.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Packing <b>30</b> may be composed of any suitable material that is fluid permeable and does not pose an inhalation health risk. Suitable materials for packing <b>30</b> include cotton, foam, stacked thread, porous stone, synthetic porous media, or any other material which is capable of adsorbing or absorbing the desired chemical species in liquid phase. Packing <b>30</b> is configured to accept a functional liquid, while still maintaining fluid permeable properties. In particular, packing <b>30</b> should be capable of holding a reasonable quantity of the functional liquid before becoming saturated, to avoid the need for frequent replacement of cartridge <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">In certain preferred pairings of a packing material of packing <b>30</b> with a functional liquid, the surface chemistry of the packing material favors the adsorption of the functional liquid in order to improve saturation and functional liquid load. For example, a porous media having a surface chemistry that is hydrophilic may better saturate with hydrophilic functional liquids. A sintered porous plastic has proven to be a particularly effective porous medium, due to its tendency to force an air flow to spread generally evenly across its entire cross-sectional area, thereby exposing a greater volume of air to the functional liquid. This widening/dispersion of the air stream is believed to be largely due to a significant flow resistance produced by the material, as evidenced by a noticeable pressure drop across the length of cartridge <b>16</b> when packed and saturated. Other media may exhibit similar flow properties with similar effects.</p>

      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">As an alternative to cartridge <b>16</b> as illustrated, a cartridge within the scope of the invention may consist of only an open ended casing and a fluid permeable packing material residing inside the casing, such as a porous body, a quantity of particulate material, or a mass of fibers.

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">Individual parts of attachments or fluid delivery devices according to the invention may be constructed out of any suitable material that permits ease of use thereof, durability, safety, and ease of manufacturing. In preferred embodiments, components are generally composed of a relatively hard, durable, and non-corrosive material, such as stainless steel, aluminum, brass, graphite, ceramics, silicon carbide, certain plastics or other suitable materials. Plastics used for components of an inhalation device according to the invention should generally be highly chemically resistant, as some functional fluids, such as certain alcohols, have been shown to cause degradation of certain existing plastic mouthpieces and polycarbonate parts. Suitable plastics may include silicones, thermoplastic elastomers/TPEs, SantopreneÂ®, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyaryletherketone family plastics, such as PEEK (polyether ether ketone), PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride), NylonÂ®, TeflonÂ®, HDPE (high density polyethylene), LDPE (low density polyethylene), Acetal, ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), HalarÂ®, FluorosintÂ®, Polypropylene, Polysulfone, PPS (polyphenylene sulfide), TorlonÂ®, UHMW (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene), CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), ErtalyteÂ®, NylatronÂ®, AcetronÂ®, TIVARÂ®, ProteusÂ®, and SanaliteÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">In preferred embodiments, materials used do not pose a significant health risk to users under normal use conditions, and should be selected to be compatible with the functional fluids used. For example, some functional fluids suitable for use according to the invention, including alcohols and terpenes, are corrosive to certain materials that are otherwise desirable for use in the devices of the invention. Polycarbonate is an example of a clear, hard plastic that may be advantageously used for device components, so long as it is not exposed to certain functional fluids that may damage it. Coupling adaptor <b>12</b> may be coated in a protective coating such as a paint, powder coating, film coating, electroplated coating, or any other suitable coating compatible with the material of construction.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, with reference to a first embodiment thereof illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 8-10</figref>, a variable flow attachment <b>34</b> is provided for coupling with breathable fluid delivery devices such as electronic cigarettes. Attachment <b>34</b> comprises a coupling adaptor <b>36</b> for attachment to the fluid delivery device (not shown), a variable valve <b>47</b> comprising a valve needle <b>49</b> cooperating with a valve seat <b>51</b> to throttle the portion of fluid passing through or around an exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge <b>38</b>, a cartridge housing <b>40</b> for retaining and supporting cartridge <b>38</b>, and a housing cover <b>42</b> comprising mating sections <b>44</b> and <b>46</b> for locking a fluid permeable cartridge into housing <b>40</b>, having also a channel <b>48</b> for receiving a mouthpiece <b>50</b>. Cartridge housing <b>40</b> is illustrated as integrally incorporating valve seat <b>51</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0091">Attachment <b>34</b> may be constructed with various fluid delivery device coupling adaptors to permit use of attachment <b>34</b> with said devices at a connection point where a mouthpiece of existing such devices would normally be fitted, although not exclusively limited to such existing connection types. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, coupling adaptor includes the same type of connection as mouthpiece <b>50</b>. To permit the passage of a fluid through attachment <b>34</b>, coupling adaptor <b>36</b> includes an open channel <b>52</b> spanning its internal length. The inner diameter of channel <b>52</b> is optionally but preferably similar to that of a mouthpiece for which the herein described auxiliary conduit assembly is substituted. The coupling adaptor may include attachment to an assembly for receiving multiple breathable fluid streams.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0092">Attachment <b>34</b> may take on various embodiments. Preferably, the valve system is able to partition a fluid flow either through or around cartridge <b>38</b>, allowing a user to select what portion of the total fluid flow is exposed to the functional fluid and what portion is not, to vary the intensity of the flavor or other functional effect in the inhaled stream. In the illustrated embodiment, a maximum intensity is delivered by fully seating valve needle <b>49</b> into valve seat <b>51</b> to close a bypass channel <b>54</b>, and a minimum intensity is delivered by withdrawing valve needle <b>49</b> to the farthest extent permitted by the device construction to provide the freest access to bypass channel <b>54</b>. The illustrated valve is adjusted by twisting a threaded connection between proximal housing cover section <b>44</b> and a valve housing <b>56</b>. Such a threaded connection is a convenient way to provide fine adjustment control, but other valve adjustment mechanisms, including relatively sliding components, may be alternatively provided.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0093">In other embodiments not shown, it may also be possible for a user to fully close the main channel that passes through the cartridge to reduce the intensity of the functional effect to essentially zero. For example, such a feature could be used to produce a âchaserâ effect, if the functional liquid has an unpleasant taste, by a user quickly following a breath containing the functional fluid with a breath containing the base breathable fluid only, which may contain an agent that desirably masks or alters the flavor of the functional fluid. This throttling of fluid flow between the two flow paths would preferably be achieved by a valve system between the fluid entering through the open ended channel in the said fluid delivery device coupling adaptor and a housing associated with the coupling adaptor that is proximal to the valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0094">In still other embodiments not shown, a plurality of cartridges may be arranged in a device, either in parallel or in series, being disposed in one or more fluid flow pathways leading to one or more mouthpieces. Valve systems of such a device may include one or more valves similar to that of the illustrated embodiment, such as one valve for each cartridge, for example. The valve or valves may simply partition the inhaled fluid stream through or around a single one of the cartridges, or may variably distribute the stream between or among two or more of the cartridges, for variable selection of flavors, functions, or combinations thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0095">For example, one or more cartridges as described and illustrated herein, optionally together with an electrically powered atomizer tank assembly, may be advantageously connected to each of a plurality of outlet lines of an otherwise conventional hookah (not shown). Thus, a breathable stream of air and smoke generated by the hookah may be passed through the cartridge, optionally together with atomized liquid from an atomizer tank assembly connected in line with the hookah, or in parallel with the hookah, such as via a lateral port of the hookah outlet line or via an additional parallel inlet to the cartridge.)</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">Returning to the valve assembly illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the illustrated valve is somewhat similar to a needle valve, but with valve needle <b>49</b> including an open ended channel <b>58</b> spanning its interior length. Interacting with valve needle <b>49</b> is valve seat <b>51</b>, which is illustrated as a tube into and out of which valve needle <b>49</b> can be drawn. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 8-10</figref>, valve needle <b>49</b> is positioned adjacent coupling adaptor <b>36</b> and positioned upstream of valve seat <b>51</b>, while valve seat <b>51</b> is integral to cartridge housing <b>40</b>. This arrangement could also be reversed, generally as in the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 11</figref> as attachment <b>34</b>â², including a valve needle <b>67</b> associated with a cartridge housing <b>69</b> and configured to insert in the proximal direction into a valve seat <b>71</b> associated with a coupling adaptor, or in the illustrated case, integrally formed in a coupling adaptor. However, the upstream/proximal position of valve needle <b>49</b> is believed to be slightly preferable for multiple reasons. For instance, baffling the bypass flow pathway to double back on itself, as illustrated by the arrows provides additional flow resistance and thus a finer adjustment of the bypass flow for a given amount of twist of the threaded valve assembly. Also, the doubled back bypass flow arrangement makes the parts easier to machine and injection mold, as well as improving the ease of handling of the fluid permeable cartridges, since they are larger and easier to manipulate with one's fingers. A long cartridge tube also makes it easy to load and unload the cartridge.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">An exchangeable cartridge porous packing, containing a functional fluid, impedes the flow of fluid through it to some extent. This flow impedance may be significant without departing from the scope of the invention, but it should not completely block the flow of fluid through the packing when a pressure differential is applied across its length. With respect to the measure of the pressure differential across the packing, in the preferred embodiment the pressure differential considered for intended function would correspond to a vacuum which could be comfortably provided by the intended user drawing in a breath through the device in normal atmospheric conditions. In certain variations and embodiments which could be envisioned by someone skilled in the art provided in this disclosure, the pressure differential measurement may be a value dependent upon other parameters and it is to be understood that various pressure differentials could be considered for design of the flow impedance of the packing to permit intended function of the variable valve system.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">With reference to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, valve seat <b>51</b> is docked in a collar portion of section <b>44</b>, the collar portion including bypass channel inlet apertures <b>64</b> for permitting the free flow of fluid diverted around cartridge <b>38</b>. Under a pressure differential across the combined length of valve housing <b>56</b> and cartridge housing <b>42</b>, variable valve <b>47</b> facilitates the partitioning of fluid flow between the two flow paths in relation to the flow impedance of the cartridge packing and the cross-sectional area of a gap <b>61</b> that is present between valve needle <b>49</b> and valve seat <b>51</b> in partially open and fully open valve positions, as illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 8</figref><i>b </i>and <b>8</b><i>c</i>. As a further aspect of variable flow attachments according to the invention, a structural relationship is provided to allow a user to draw the valve seat away from or onto the valve needle. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, this is embodied as a movable connection between proximal cartridge housing cover section <b>44</b> and valve housing <b>56</b>, which may include a threaded connection between valve housing <b>56</b> and a proximal threaded end <b>60</b> of section <b>44</b>. Preferably the gap between the section <b>44</b> and valve housing <b>56</b> is sealed from fluid flow such as air leaks, by an O-ring or analogous suitable sealing structure mounted in a gasket seat <b>62</b> of proximal cartridge housing cover section <b>44</b>. Preferably, the O-ring or substituted structure would consist of a resilient material or any other suitable material that would be chemically compatible with the chemicals being passed through the channel between the needle valve, housing, and sleeve.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Cartridge housing <b>40</b> cooperates with the interior of housing cover <b>42</b> to define bypass channel <b>54</b> to permit the flow of fluid around cartridge <b>38</b> to mouthpiece <b>50</b>. More specifically, the cartridge housing has an exterior diameter less than that of the interior diameter of the housing cover. Mixing of the bypass fluid stream with the fluid stream that passes through cartridge <b>38</b> occurs in a widened channel area <b>66</b> in fluid connection with the distal end of cartridge <b>38</b> and with bypass channel <b>54</b> via a reentry passage <b>68</b> formed in a portion of distal cartridge housing cover section <b>46</b>.</p>

Attachment <b>34</b>â³ includes a cartridge <b>70</b> including an integral casing <b>71</b> with an integrally attached, tubular valve seat <b>72</b>, having a smaller bore diameter, extending proximally therefrom. Instead of a perpendicularly stepped profile as illustrated for cartridge housing <b>40</b> of attachment <b>34</b> described above, cartridge casing <b>71</b> includes an oblique tapered section <b>74</b> transitioning between its wider and narrower channels, so that essentially no portion of the proximal face of a circular cylindrical packing <b>73</b> inserted contained therein is blocked to flow of the breathable fluid in the distal direction.</p>

Section <b>76</b> includes a distal channel <b>82</b> for carrying breathable fluid flow exiting from a cartridge <b>70</b> and for receiving a mouthpiece <b>84</b> inserted into its distal end.

When the threads (not shown) of section <b>78</b>â² engage those of needle valve component <b>86</b>â² and a user begins to twist the two together, a tactilely pleasing and informative clicking sound and sensation will occur each time a clicking protrusion snaps into one of slots <b>118</b>, corresponding in the illustrated embodiment to a quarter turn of rotatable ring portion <b>96</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">In light of the present disclosure of the invention, one skilled in the art will appreciate that exchangeable porous cartridges as described above may be advantageously connected, attached, or incorporated into a wide range of inhalation devices, including medical or therapeutic devices as well as leisure/recreational devices, and including vapor-based inhalation devices but also smoke-based inhalation devices such as hookahs.</p>

The disclosure presents an electronic cigarette assembly designed to emulate the sensory experience of smoking a tobacco cigarette, while also being equipped with a system for introducing a functional liquid into the fluid stream passing through the assembly. Illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 20-24</figref> is one example of a complete inhalation device incorporating a cartridge according to the invention. A preferred embodiment of a complete inhalation device further incorporating an adjustable, snap-locking throttle valve is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 25-28</figref> and <b>35</b>. <figref>FIGS. 34</figref>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b> illustrate in greater detail the electrical and atomizer tank components common to throttled and unthrottled embodiments of a complete device according to the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">Turning to <figref>FIGS. 20-24</figref>, an illustrative electronic cigarette device <b>130</b> according to the invention includes an electrical control circuit comprising a battery <b>132</b>, an electronic controller <b>134</b>, a battery/controller housing <b>136</b>, and suitable connecting wires or other conductive elements (such as portions of a housing structure of the device or its individual components) that complete a circuit to permit current to flow through powered device components; an atomizer housing <b>138</b> defining an atomizing liquid storage chamber <b>140</b>, and an atomizing chamber <b>142</b> having an aperture <b>143</b>, which collectively define an atomizer tank assembly <b>145</b>, an exchangeable fluid permeable and porous cartridge <b>144</b>, a cartridge housing cover <b>146</b>, and a cartridge housing <b>148</b> for locking cartridge <b>144</b> into cartridge housing cover <b>146</b>. Cartridge housing cover <b>146</b> also includes a distal channel <b>150</b> for receiving a mouthpiece <b>152</b>, although a suitable cartridge housing cover may alternatively comprise an integrally formed mouthpiece. Cartridge <b>144</b> may advantageously take the form of any of the embodiments of an exchangeable porous cartridge described and illustrated above with reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-18</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Battery <b>132</b> is preferably rechargeable and stores enough energy to power device <b>130</b> for many atomization cycles, avoiding the need to recharge with a frequency that a typical user would find inconvenient. Battery/controller housing <b>136</b> is preferably of a size to be comfortably held in an average adult hand, but by no means would be restricted to such a size.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">Electrical controller <b>134</b> controls the current and voltage delivered to an atomizing element <b>154</b> associated with atomizing chamber <b>142</b>. Voltage and current delivered may either be preset or user-defined, for example by user input entered via a display/control panel <b>156</b>, which may include a touch sensor and/or one or more buttons. In alternative embodiments, voltage and current may be supplied to more than one atomizing mechanism individually or simultaneously, such as when more than one atomizer tank analogous to an atomizer tank <b>158</b> (which comprises atomizer housing <b>138</b>, atomizing chamber <b>145</b>, and atomizing element <b>154</b>) is included in a single device, or when the device includes an additional atomizing element associated with cartridge <b>144</b>. Voltage and current delivered may be the same or different for different atomizing mechanisms. Alternatively, an inhalation device according to the invention may include only one atomizing element associated with any suitable exchangeable, fluid permeable cartridge as described herein. In one example, atomizing liquid and functional liquid could be combined and atomized together from a single cotton wick surrounding an atomizing element.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">Current and voltage to the atomizing mechanisms may be actuated by a manual actuator <b>160</b>, preferably mounted to battery/controller housing <b>136</b>. Manual actuator <b>160</b> may comprise any type of mechanical switch, such as a push button as shown, or a slider, twist knob or collar; or an electro-mechanical switch, such as a touch screen or other touch sensor which may for example be comprised in display/control panel <b>156</b>. On the other hand, current and voltage actuation may be initiated automatically in response to a user drawing breath through the device, such as by a sensor (not shown) in line with fluid flow through the device detecting a fluid velocity, volumetric or mass flow rate, or pressure drop at or above a preset threshold, in response to which a control component causes the current and voltage to be delivered. Preferably, the sensor actuates the electrical current flow under a pressure drop that may be comfortably generated by a user drawing breath through the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">The electrical control circuit of the device may control an electronic user display, preferably mounted in the housing. Preferably, the electronic display is configured to display certain numerical values or other data relevant to the device settings, such as voltage, current, temperature of particular elements (such as atomizing elements for atomization liquids or functional liquids), usage data (such as times, dates, and durations of usage, stored settings, and power consumption history), battery charge levels, warnings, or other data of potential interest to a user.</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">In one embodiment, the control circuit includes a memory storage element capable of recording and storing usage data relevant to the user, as well as any other information delivered to the device by means of electrical communication by either a direct wire connection or a wireless communication mechanism. This data may include, for example, cumulative consumption of the atomization liquid or functional component over a given time period; time period of fluid draw by the user; time periods between uses; temperature profiles of one or more components; power consumption history; stored preferences or settings; and alternate modes of use, such as previous combinations of components connected in the device assembly, and in what order they were connected, and/or particular encoded information identifying attributes of a component, such as its part or serial number, a flavor or substance that it contains or may contain, for example. Furthermore, the data stored may be used by processing units to control the mechanisms of the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that these types of data are disclosed by way of example and should not be considered to limit the scope of information that may be stored in the memory storage element within the scope of the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">Preferably, electronic controller <b>134</b> includes one or more processing elements/processors. For example, the processors could be used to determine what is displayed on display/control panel <b>156</b> and/or to actuate automatically atomizing element <b>154</b> or elements in accordance with data and logic processed by the processors. One skilled in the art will appreciate the diverse extensions of the use of processors in the present invention, which are by no means restricted to the processing examples disclosed herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">As an alternative to simple manual actuation or actuation triggered by a flow or pressure sensor, actuation of atomizing element <b>154</b> may occur automatically in response to the input of a passcode matching a valid passcode stored in a memory of controller <b>134</b>. Alternatively, a correct passcode entry may only âunlockâ the atomization function of the device, without automatically initiating atomization, but instead permitting a user to actuate atomization manually. For instance, after the passcode is successfully validated, a user may press a simple button or switch to initiate atomization. The atomization element may respond to a single manual actuation following passcode validation, a predetermined plural number of manual actuations, for a predetermined amount of time elapsed after passcode validation, or until the processor receives an affirmative user command to âlockâ the device again, such as by re-entry of a passcode to toggle back to a locked state, or by a simple manual switch or button. The password may be input by a user directly into display/control panel <b>156</b> or communicated to controller <b>134</b> from a separate input device or token, such as a user's personal smartphone, magnetic key card, bar code image, via a Wi-Fi, infrared, BluetoothÂ®, RFID, or optical connection, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">In one embodiment, controller <b>134</b> may also include or be operatively linked to a wireless communication element (not shown) capable of transmitting to another wireless communication device or receive information from said wireless communication device. In general, many wireless network types are contemplated in this disclosure and may include, but are not necessarily limited to WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network), WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), or any other suitable wireless network and communication types. Advantageously, wireless network connectivity enables inhalation devices according to the invention to be controlled by a personal electronic device such as a smartphone, for purposes of passcode-enabled actuation or locking/unlocking of one or more functions of the inhalation device (obviating the need for a multi-key user interface on the inhalation device itself), as well as facilitating monitoring/tracking, storage, and analysis of usage data on the personal electronic device.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">Furthermore as an additional aspect of the electrical control circuit, preferably the circuit would be designed so as to be able to receive and transmit to battery <b>132</b> an electrical current from a charging lead, as well as including electrical communication elements for transmission of data between device <b>130</b> and external computation and/or data storage devices. In one embodiment, a connection port (not shown) at the proximal end of a battery/controller housing can be mated with other elements extending proximally therefrom. When included, such a connection port may also permit electrical communication from the circuitry to one or more atomizing elements.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Advantageously, electrical controller <b>134</b> may be designed to regulate battery charge rate with respect to voltage and current and could prevent battery overcharge. Furthermore, preferably the electrical control element would prevent reverse polarity damage to the circuit elements or battery, by incorporating appropriately configured elements such as diodes, PNP Transistors, or a P-channel FET.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">As best seen in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>, atomizer housing <b>138</b> is connected between battery/controller housing <b>136</b> and cartridge housing cover <b>146</b> and contains a single atomizing element <b>154</b>. However, multiple atomizing elements may optionally be housed within a single atomizer housing. Other alternative embodiments of an atomizer housing may accept (or consist of) single or multiple exchangeable fluid permeable cartridges. Alternatively, an inhalation device may employ multiple atomization chambers and mechanisms, each adapted for atomization either of an atomizing liquid by itself or of an atomizing liquid and a functional liquid exclusively or simultaneously. Furthermore, the atomization of one or both of these liquid types may occur in distinct and separate atomization chambers, or in a combined atomization chamber. In other possible variations, an atomizing liquid and a functional liquid may undergo atomization in one chamber, a plurality of distinct chambers, in separate and distinct chambers simultaneously, in separate and distinct chambers at different times, both together in distinct chambers in addition to a separate chamber having one or both liquids, or both together combined and simultaneously atomized in separate and distinct chambers.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">Wherever an exchangeable cartridge is provided in one of the illustrated complete devices of the invention, at atomizing element may be incorporated into the exchangeable cartridge within the scope of the invention, with the benefit of promoting more complete or faster atomization of the functional liquid to be carried in the breathable fluid stream than may be achieved by simply passing the fluid stream through the cartridge. In effect, an atomizer cartridge <b>161</b>, as illustrated schematically in <figref>FIG. 41</figref>, or an atomizer cartridge <b>163</b>, as illustrated schematically in <figref>FIG. 42</figref>, may in general be used in place of any other exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge disclosed herein. Atomizer cartridge <b>161</b> includes a casing <b>165</b> holding a packing material <b>167</b> and supporting an atomizing element <b>169</b> in contact therewith, atomizing element <b>169</b> including electrical leads <b>171</b> and <b>173</b> for completing a circuit connecting atomizing element <b>169</b> to a battery generally through the interior of the inhalation device via lead <b>171</b> and along the conductive walls of one or more housing components via lead <b>173</b>. Atomizer cartridge <b>163</b> includes similar elements to those of cartridge <b>161</b>, its casing <b>165</b>â² further including a functional liquid reservoir chamber <b>175</b> in fluid communication with a packing material <b>167</b>â² via an aperture <b>180</b> for replenishing the functional fluid contained in packing material <b>167</b>â² at a restrained rate, an aspect of certain fluid permeable cartridges according to the invention that will be described in more detail below, with reference to <figref>FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">Atomizing element <b>154</b> is electrically connected to battery <b>132</b> by a contact pin <b>162</b> associated with atomizer housing <b>138</b> and atomizing element <b>154</b> contacting controller <b>134</b>, thus providing a controlled amount of current and voltage to atomizing element <b>154</b>. In turn, current flows from atomizing element <b>154</b> through conductive portions of atomizer housing <b>138</b> and of battery/controller housing <b>136</b> to return to battery <b>132</b>, completing a circuit.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">Atomizer housing <b>138</b> and neighboring components preferably define at least one atomizing liquid storage chamber, illustrated as storage chamber <b>140</b>, and at least one atomizing chamber, illustrated as atomizing chamber <b>142</b>. Liquid storage chamber <b>140</b> stores an atomizing liquid, to provide a consistent supply of the liquid to atomizing chamber <b>142</b> (at a restrained rate, through aperture <b>143</b>), where the liquid enters into operative atomizing contact with atomizing element <b>154</b>. Atomizing chamber <b>142</b> is a fluid conduit assembly designed to receive a supply of fluid, deliver it to atomizing element <b>154</b> in a reliable fashion, and integrate a certain portion of the atomized liquid into the fluid stream passing through the conduit by way of atomizing chamber <b>142</b>. The path of breathable fluid flow through atomizer tank assembly <b>145</b> passes through the atomization element <b>154</b> and atomization chamber <b>142</b>, where it then is introduced into the flow paths entering the exchangeable cartridge and the diversion path, as illustrated by the arrows in <figref>FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">Liquid storage chamber is preferably constructed so as to prevent or inhibit unintended liquid leakage, but also to permit disassembly or alteration to allow a user to refill the atomizing liquid reserve. Desirable properties for materials of the chamber include chemical resistance, transparency, and structural strength and durability. Thus, one preferred material is polycarbonate. However, liquid storage chamber <b>140</b> may be constructed from any suitable material or materials chosen according to design specific parameters.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">A liquid storage chamber and an atomizing chamber may alternatively combined into a single conduit element wherein a liquid retaining material (e.g. an absorbing or adsorbing material), such as a fibrous material, stores an atomizing liquid, releasing the atomizing liquid into contact with an atomizing element over a controlled area of the atomizing element for introduction into a breathable fluid stream at a restrained rate. Furthermore in contact with the liquid storage material would be an element for delivery of the stored liquid to a single atomizing mechanism or multiple atomizing mechanisms.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">Atomizing element <b>154</b> may comprise electrically resistive wire, such as platinum, nichrome, or any other suitable metal alloy or material that may emit heat via electrical resistance, electrical induction, or any other comparable method for heat generation using a flow of electrons. Alternatively, atomizing element <b>154</b> may be a piezo-resistive nebulizer, pneumatic nebulizer, thin-film nebulizer, or any other mechanism whereby a said atomizing liquid and/or functional fluid may be aerosolized, nebulized, atomized, or otherwise introduced into a fluid air stream passing through the conduit channels of an inhalation device of the present invention. One or more of such atomizing mechanisms may be included within an atomizing chamber or elsewhere within the device.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">Variations are also possible in the manner in which the atomizing mechanism interacts with the atomizing liquid, and the accompanying structures that cooperate with the atomizing mechanism. For example, when the atomizing mechanism comprises an atomizing element such as a hot wire coil, a cotton or fiberglass wick may be associated with the coil in order to draw atomizing liquid into the coil for atomization via capillary action. Also, in such embodiments, a rolled sheet of fiberglass or similar material may be packed into the chamber to assist in wicking atomizing liquid to the coil. In piezo-resistive or thin film nebulizers, often a pool of atomizing liquid is associated with the nebulizer in order to supply the liquid to it. In some cases, the nebulizer may not be in direct contact with the atomizing liquid, but may act upon the liquid by way of a pulse wave carrier fluid or media, which then interacts with a thin flexible film which then transfers the pulse wave energy to the atomizing liquid and in turn nebulizes the liquid. Any of these exemplary mechanistic approaches may be incorporated into devices according to the present invention, but by no means is the present invention limited to these designs. In summary, said atomizing chambers are not limited to any particular atomizing mechanism or any particular cooperating structures or materials required for the proper function thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">Advantageously, atomizer housing <b>138</b> is configured to connect in line with exchangeable porous cartridge <b>144</b> containing a functional liquid. Thus, the atomizer housing <b>138</b> preferably mates with cartridge housing cover <b>146</b> for receiving the cartridge, in which the cartridge is disposed in line with the fluid flow channel of the device, so as to expose the atomized fluid to the cartridge before the atomized fluid reaches a user. Preferably, a cartridge in housing cover <b>146</b> is retained in an easily accessible slot for toolless removal and replacement. A connecting feature for connecting cartridge housing cover <b>146</b> to atomizer housing <b>138</b> may be a threaded connection as shown, a tight fitting sliding connection, lined with one or more O-rings, permitting the housings to be pushed together and pulled apart by a user, or any other suitable connection. Preferably the housing cover would act to cover and fix into place the exchangeable porous cartridge as well as define a space for attachment of a mouthpiece, if a mouthpiece is not integrated into the housing or housing cover.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">In alternative embodiments of the exchangeable porous cartridge aspect of the invention, multiple cartridge pods, each pod comprising a packing material containing an absorbed or adsorbed functional liquid substantially as described with respect to the foregoing embodiments, may be incorporated into a single device. This may be done in many different ways, including, for example, by stacking multiple cartridges according to the foregoing embodiments, or by providing a single cartridge that houses multiple pods in a single casing. Thus, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 38</figref>, a cartridge <b>164</b>, comprises a casing <b>166</b> housing a pod <b>168</b> and a pod <b>170</b>, each pod preferable comprising a porous, fluid permeable packing material containing an absorbed or adsorbed functional liquid. Pods <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> are hatched differently in <figref>FIG. 38</figref> to emphasize that they are separate bodiesâthey may or may not comprise a different packing material, and they may or may not contain a different functional liquid in their respective packing material. Although pods <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> are shown as stacked in line with the direction of fluid flow, two or more pods may alternatively be arranged in parallel, one benefit of a parallel arrangement being a lesser tendency of cross-contamination of functional liquids between the pods, particularly if the multiple pods are separated by a longitudinal barrier. The overall combined structure of cartridge <b>164</b> is fluid permeable, and its fluid mechanical functionality as a conduit element is similar to that of cartridges of the foregoing embodiments that include only a single pod or single mass of fluid permeable material, providing some resistance to a breathable fluid flow, but not so much as to prevent a user from comfortably inhaling breathable fluid through cartridge <b>164</b>. In other embodiments not shown, a plurality of exchangeable porous cartridges, each including its own corresponding throttle valve subassembly, may be stacked upon one another in the housing, to allow a user to integrate multiple functional liquids into the fluid flow in adjustable ratios.</p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0130">According to yet another embodiment of the fluid permeable cartridge aspect of the invention, illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>, cartridges according to the invention may comprise separate chambers, including a reservoir chamber for retaining a reservoir of unabsorbed functional liquid, a functional fluid delivery chamber retaining a packing material for absorbing or adsorbing the functional liquid from the reservoir chamber for introduction into a breathable fluid stream flowing through the packing material, and a partition between the chambers, the partition permitting limited exposure of the liquid in the reservoir chamber to the packing material, to permit liquid in the reservoir chamber to traverse, penetrate, or bypass the partition at a restrained rate for gradual absorption or adsorption into or onto the packing material.</p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0131">Thus, in the example illustrated in <figref>FIG. 32</figref>, an exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge <b>172</b> includes an annular reservoir chamber <b>174</b> and a functional fluid delivery chamber <b>176</b> retaining packing material <b>177</b>, and a partition between chambers <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> is provided in the form of an impermeable barrier <b>178</b>, including a small aperture <b>180</b>. The illustrated arrangement permits fluid in reservoir chamber <b>174</b> to flow into fluid delivery chamber <b>176</b> by capillary action, so as to maintain saturation of packing material <b>177</b>, to enhance the performance of cartridge <b>172</b> by extending its usable lifetime and ensuring maximum saturation for as long as possible. Aperture <b>180</b> is illustrated as being located near an end of impermeable barrier <b>178</b> closest to a valve needle component <b>182</b> integrally formed in a casing <b>184</b> of cartridge <b>172</b>, which is characteristic of the proximal end of cartridges described in preceding embodiments, but not necessarily limited to being the proximal end of cartridge <b>172</b>. This position of aperture <b>180</b> is preferred to take advantage of a gravity feed of atomizing liquid into packing material <b>177</b> provided by a user holding cartridge <b>172</b> (or an inhalation device, attachment, or assembly incorporating cartridge <b>172</b>) with its distal end pointing up. However, aperture <b>180</b> may be alternatively located elsewhere in barrier <b>178</b> within the scope of the invention. Also, in lieu of a single aperture <b>180</b> of a given size, a plurality of smaller apertures may be provided, distributed evenly or unevenly in any fashion along or around barrier <b>178</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0132">In another aspect of multi-chambered, self-replenishing cartridges according to the invention, such a cartridge may include multiple porous materials having different porosities and wicking abilities. In particular, an intermediate material of lower permeability may be interposed between the liquid reservoir and a more highly permeable packing material. Advantageously, this arrangement inhibits overflow of the more highly permeable material by restraining the rate of absorption/adsorption of functional liquid into or onto the packing material. As an additional benefit, functional liquid may spread through the intermediate material in directions tangential to its interface with the packing material before entering the packing material, thus promoting more uniform absorption/absorption compared to an arrangement in which a smaller inlet area (for example, that corresponding to the area of aperture <b>180</b> in cartridge <b>172</b>) of the packing material is exposed directly to the packing material. An example to illustrate this further aspect of a multi-chambered, self-replenishing cartridge according to the invention is shown in <figref>FIG. 33</figref>, wherein an exchangeable fluid-permeable cartridge <b>186</b> includes an annular reservoir chamber <b>188</b> and a functional fluid delivery chamber <b>190</b> retaining packing material <b>192</b>, a multi-layer partition between chambers <b>188</b> and <b>198</b> being provided in the form of an outer impermeable barrier <b>194</b> having an aperture <b>196</b> and an inner fluid-permeable skin <b>200</b>, skin <b>200</b> being less permeable than packing material <b>192</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0133">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 25-28</figref>, in preferred embodiments of the present invention, housing components may be âlockedâ together so as to restrain or wholly prevent their separation. For instance, a movement to separate the components may be blocked by one or more opposed obstructing surfaces, which may or may not be oriented obliquely to the direction of separating movement, so that at least one of them cams the other out of the path of the separating movement when sufficient force is applied, depending on whether or not it is desired to permit manual separation of the components once they are connected together.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">For example, another embodiment of a complete inhalation device with a variable valve system is illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 25</figref> (transverse cross-sectional elevation view) and <b>28</b> (exploded view) as inhalation device <b>199</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, housing components that are moved relative to each other to adjust a valve position may âlockâ together at a position of maximum relative separation defined for normal use, from which position it is relatively easy to draw the components closer together, up to a fully engaged position in which abutting end faces prevent further approaching movement. Drawing the components apart from the maximum separation position may be either restrained (as illustrated in the figures) or prevented outright.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">Thus, in <figref>FIG. 26</figref> a throttle valve assembly <b>201</b> is shown in which a cartridge housing <b>202</b> is slidingly received by a collar <b>204</b> disposed between cartridge housing <b>202</b> and an atomizer tank subassembly <b>208</b>. Collar <b>204</b> incorporates a valve seat <b>210</b> mating with a valve needle component <b>212</b> integral to a cartridge casing <b>214</b> retained within a cartridge assembly comprised of housing <b>202</b> and a cartridge housing cover <b>215</b>. Housing <b>202</b> includes a first o-ring seat <b>216</b> for seating a snap o-ring <b>218</b> and a second o-ring seat <b>220</b> for seating a compressible o-ring <b>222</b>. An interior annular surface of collar <b>204</b> includes a smaller diameter skid region <b>224</b> for slidingly engaging o-rings <b>218</b> and <b>222</b> and a larger diameter retaining groove <b>226</b> into which snap o-ring <b>218</b> snaps when it reaches the lower/proximal end of skid region <b>224</b> as a user slides housing <b>202</b> into collar <b>204</b>. The snapping mechanism may comprise, for example, snap o-ring <b>218</b> being a relatively stiff collar (of a material such as spring steel or a similar or equivalent material) that is less than a complete annulus, permitting it to compress to a smaller diameter and spring back to a larger diameter. A user will feel and/or hear the snap of o-ring <b>218</b> into retaining groove <b>226</b>, in addition to feeling reduced resistance to inserting movement of housing <b>202</b> into collar <b>204</b>, from compressible o-ring <b>222</b> alone sliding over skid region <b>224</b>, thus providing multiple sensory indications that valve assembly is properly connected and within its normal range of adjusting movement. Conversely, a user will also feel an increased resistance to pulling the components of throttle valve subassembly <b>201</b> apart past the most open valve position in the freely adjustable range, in which snap o-ring <b>218</b> makes contact with a proximal edge of skid region <b>224</b>, as most clearly shown in <figref>FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">Turning to <figref>FIG. 27</figref>, an alternative threaded snap-locking throttle valve subassembly <b>201</b>â² is depicted, corresponding to an alternative inhalation device <b>199</b>â² shown in exploded view in <figref>FIG. 28</figref>, including a threaded cartridge housing <b>202</b>â² that threads into a threaded collar <b>204</b>â² linking to atomizer tank subassembly <b>208</b>. Threaded collar <b>204</b>â² incorporates valve seat <b>210</b> mating with valve needle component <b>212</b> of cartridge casing <b>214</b>.

        <figref>FIGS. 29-31</figref> illustrate further aspects of exchangeable fluid-permeable cartridges according to the invention, embodied in cartridges <b>256</b>â², <b>256</b>â³, and <b>256</b>â²â³ respectively, each of which includes an integral valve needle portion <b>258</b>â², <b>258</b>â³, <b>258</b>â²â³.

Cartridge <b>256</b>â³, shown in <figref>FIG. 30</figref>, houses a packing material <b>260</b>â³ in a casing <b>262</b>â³ having a cover with a small-diameter aperture <b>266</b> at its distal end. Small-diameter aperture <b>266</b> advantageously restrains functional fluid from leaking or evaporating through the distal end of casing <b>262</b>â³, while also limiting the distal end face area of packing material <b>260</b>â³ that is exposed to open air and possibly contaminants while being inserted into or removed from an inhalation device, handled, or stored by a user. Relatedly, end sealing films, preferably with pull tabs for easy removal, such as films <b>267</b> and <b>269</b> depicted in <figref>FIG. 31</figref>, may be applied to a cartridge <b>271</b>, as a further measure to retain functional fluid, prevent contamination, and maintain freshness prior to commencement of use.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 39 and 40</figref> depict alternative embodiments of exchangeable atomizer tanks, with separable and built-in atomizing elements, respectively. Advantageously, exchangeable atomizer tanks facilitates alternation between atomizing liquids (such as liquids having different flavors, for example) by switching out one partially used tank for another, as well as permitting disposal and replacement of relatively cheap to manufacture tank components, typically made of plastic, of an atomization system with new, optionally prefilled components.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">Referring to <figref>FIG. 39</figref>, an exchangeable atomizer tank assembly <b>274</b> is depicted, arranged between a battery/controller connector <b>275</b> and another assembly component <b>277</b> (which may for example be an exchangeable fluid-permeable cartridge housing), in which two distinct atomizing elements <b>276</b> and <b>278</b> are placed in line and in electrical communication with each other. Exchangeable atomization reservoirs <b>280</b> and <b>282</b> can slidingly fit over atomization chamber <b>284</b> and provide atomization liquid to the individual atomization elements. Flow of the liquid to the atomization elements may be initiated by piercing a liquid tight septum (not shown) in atomization reservoirs <b>280</b>, <b>282</b>, for which a suitable piercing tool (not shown) may be movably incorporated into a component of or otherwise provided with assembly <b>274</b>. The septum may for example be any suitable film or membrane composed of a suitable material such as silicone, rubber, plastic, or metal foil, covering a flow channel inside the reservoir. Reservoirs <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> may be exchangeable and disposable to allow a user to exchange atomization liquids without the need to clean or remove residues from previous liquids used in reservoirs <b>280</b>, <b>282</b>. Additionally, reservoirs <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> preferably employ a mechanism for liquid delivery to the atomization elements that permits a user to remove an atomization reservoir without liquid leaking at any reservoir liquid level or state, such as by a spring-loaded valve mechanism (not shown) that is biased to a closed state when <b>280</b>, <b>282</b> are removed from the assembly.</p>

In such an arrangement, atomization reservoirs <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> may be assembled adjacent each other in series as depicted, or alternatively, having one or more other components disposed between them (not shown), such as an exchangeable fluid permeable cartridge according to the invention, with or without an associated atomizing element. Reservoirs <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> are electrically connected in series or in parallel as desired. Electrically resistive elements associated with reservoirs <b>288</b> and <b>290</b>, or interposed between them, may be provided to permit a user to selectively choose the amount of electrical current permitted through each atomization element in each reservoir. Such resistive elements (not depicted) could be separate and exchangeable elements that are placed in between each reservoir in order to permit a user to selectively control the atomization quantities provided from each atomization element. Reservoirs <b>288</b> and <b>290</b> are preferably in fluid communication with each other, either in series or parallel, to deliver atomized liquid from each reservoir into a breathable fluid stream passing through an inhalation device according to the invention.</p>
