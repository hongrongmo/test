      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Taiwan Patent Application No. 103109882, filed on Mar. 17, 2014, in the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein its entirety by reference.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention relates to a supply system which is applicable to metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), in particular with respect to a liquid-metal organic compound supply system is applicable to a large scale processing apparatus for metal organic chemical vapor deposition.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">High purity trimethyl gallium is essential for producing photoelectron material while in the process of metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and is widely applied to produce semiconductor thin film material, such as compounds of GaN, GaAs, AlGaInp and so on. As high purity trimethyl gallium is characterized in better electricity, optics and magnetism, it can perform higher frequency, faster speed, lower noise and better power in semiconductor and integrated circuits. Therefore, the production techniques of the new material have been greatly applying to the fields of LED, solar cell, aviation and aerospace technology . . . etc. Pure trimethyl gallium is shaped as liquid and of high chemical activity in room temperature and will cause spontaneous combustion in the air and spontaneous explosion when contacting to water; as a result, it has to be accommodated in a tailor-made steel bottle while performing metal organic chemical vapor deposition, and the trimethyl gallium steam can reach to a desirable value by controlling the temperature of the steel bottle, and the saturated vapor pressure of trimethyl gallium in the specific temperature can be brought into the photoelectron material production system via the floating carrying gas.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">However, as the growing development of metal organic chemical vapor deposition, the scale of processing apparatus which is applied to the technique gets gradually larger, and the relative stable vapor pressure for Metal Organics (MO) source is needed while being used, so that MO source steel bottle is normally placed in a thermostat for use, and because the capacity of thermostat of the existing apparatus is limited, the current trimethyl gallium packaging container is usually under 4 kg in capacity, and type of the packaging container will occur certain problems while being used, the problems mainly comprise: 1. the type of the packaging container is of relatively smaller capacity which leads to the higher finished cost as well as causes that the manufacturer of MO source keeps the packing cost up; 2. because the type of the packaging container can accommodate the relatively smaller amount of trimethyl gallium, when being applied to a large scale apparatus (e.g. Max Bright of Veeco), the usage period of single bottle can only last about 20 days, and thus, it has to make a replacement for the MO source packing container frequently, and the replacement for that will result in idle mode of the apparatus for hours and therefore decrease the productivity of MOCVD apparatus, as well as increase the percentage of incidence because of the malfunction caused by operating personnel; 3. as far as the large scale MO apparatus using a great MO source consumption is concerned, each packing container will remain a few valuable MO source which cannot be completely used. Therefore, a liquid-metal organic compound packing container customized towards a larger scale apparatus in the art has been regarding as an ultimate desire.</p>

      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">With reference to the following relevant drawings, it will describe the embodiment of a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention, and for the sake of easily understanding, the same element stated in following embodiments will be described with reference to the same symbol denotation.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">Please refer to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, which is a block schematic diagram of an embodiment of a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention. The present invention discloses a liquid-metal organic compound supply system which aims at customizing a large scale apparatus applied to MOVCD processing apparatus for that which becomes large gradually.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention comprises a first bottle body <b>11</b>, a second bottle body <b>12</b> and a three-way valve <b>13</b>. The first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies are steel bottles which are used to accommodate a high purity liquid-metal organic compound, and preferably, trimethyl gallium is equivalent to or higher than 99.9999% in purity. Wherein, the first bottle body <b>11</b> has a first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and a first outlet pipe <b>112</b>, and the first outlet pipe <b>112</b> connects to the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b>; and the second bottle body <b>12</b> has a second inlet pipe <b>121</b> and a second outlet pipe <b>122</b>. Moreover, the three-way valve <b>13</b> has a first connecting end <b>131</b>, a second connecting end <b>132</b> and a third connecting end <b>133</b>; wherein the first connecting end <b>131</b> connects to the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b>, the second connecting end <b>132</b> connects to the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> and the third connecting end <b>133</b> connects to the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">That is to say, the first bottle body <b>11</b>, the second bottle body <b>12</b> and the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> are indirectly connected with each other via the three-way valve <b>13</b>, and the three-way valve <b>13</b> connects the first connecting end <b>131</b> with the second connecting end <b>132</b> or the first connecting end <b>131</b> with the third connecting end <b>133</b> selectively under the specific condition. If the first connecting end <b>131</b> and the second connecting end <b>132</b> are connected, carrying gas of the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> is supplied to the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> for entering the second bottle body <b>12</b>; and then, the carrying gas enters the first bottle body <b>11</b> via the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> and the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> and finally, enters the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> via the first outlet pipe <b>112</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b>. If the first connecting end <b>131</b> and the third connecting end <b>133</b> are connected, the carrying gas of the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> is supplied to the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> to enter the first bottle body <b>11</b>, and to the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> via the first outlet pipe <b>112</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b>, wherein, the carrying gas may be hydrogen, nitrogen, argon or helium. By the assemblage of the three-way valve <b>13</b>, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention can selectively use the steam of high purity liquid-metal organic compound accommodated in the first bottle body <b>11</b> or the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second bottle body <b>12</b> floating into the MOVCD process via the carrying gas so as to produce compound semiconductor thin film material.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Please refer to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of arrangement for a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">More specifically, the first bottle body <b>11</b> is disposed in a thermostat <b>91</b> (e.g. thermostatic tank) of the metal organic chemical vapor deposition processing apparatus <b>9</b> and is used in 5Â° C. temperature, and as the capacity corresponding to current thermostat <b>91</b> is limited, the capacity of the first bottle body <b>11</b> can therefore be set under 4 kg. On the other hand, the second bottle body <b>12</b> is disposed in a predetermined position in room temperature for use, and as the second bottle body <b>12</b> is not disposed in the thermostat <b>91</b>, so it is free from the capacity limitation of the thermostat <b>91</b> and the capacity of the second bottle body <b>12</b> can be set above 4 kg, such as 10 kg or larger. In other words, the first bottle body <b>11</b> of a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention is disposed in the thermostat <b>91</b> having a first temperature which is used to maintain in a lower temperature, and the second bottle body <b>12</b> is disposed in room temperature (i.e. in a second environmental temperature that is higher a first temperature) and capacity of the second bottle body <b>12</b> is larger than that of the first bottle body <b>11</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Moreover, the first bottle body <b>11</b> further comprises a first inlet valve <b>113</b>, a first outlet valve <b>114</b> and a first transverse valve <b>115</b>. Wherein the first inlet valve <b>113</b> and the first outlet valve <b>114</b> are respectively disposed on the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and the first outlet pipe <b>112</b>, respectively to control the floating gas in the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and the first outlet pipe <b>112</b>, individually; and the first transverse valve <b>115</b> is connected between the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and the first outlet pipe <b>112</b>. Similarly, the second bottle body <b>12</b> further comprises a second inlet valve <b>123</b>, a second outlet valve <b>124</b> and a second transverse valve <b>125</b>. Wherein, the second inlet valve <b>123</b> and the second outlet valve <b>124</b> are respectively disposed on the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b>, respectively to control the floating gas in the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b>, individually; and the second transverse valve <b>125</b> is connected between the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b>. Namely, the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies both belong to a steel bottle having the three-way valve.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">When the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies are connected or replaced, the first inlet valve <b>113</b> and the first outlet valve <b>114</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second inlet valve <b>123</b> and the second outlet valve <b>124</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> are turned off, and then to connect the bottle bodies <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the three-way valve <b>13</b>. Next, the first transverse valve <b>115</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second transverse valve <b>125</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> are turned on to completely eliminate the air contained in the pipes via the carrying gas to ensure that there is no oxygen and water therein, and finally, turning on the first inlet valve <b>113</b> and the first out valve <b>114</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second inlet valve <b>123</b> and the second outlet valve <b>124</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b>, and it can be used as usual. That is to say, the purpose of disposing a three-way valve on the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies is to eliminate the air contained in the pipes while connecting the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the second bottle body <b>12</b> in series. Because MO source is high purity electronic material and is sensitive to water and oxygen and other impurities, it has to completely eliminate the air contained in the connected pipes to avoid the MO source from being polluted by the impurity in the air. If without the three-way valve, the pipes connected between the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> and the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> are not able to eliminate the air contained in therein. Simply speaking, while turning on the transverse valves <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> of the two steel bottles and turning off the other valves <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, the pipes which connect to the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies are conducted so as to proceed with vacuum exchange and thus the gas is not able to enter the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies. When the elimination of air is completed, it can turn off the two transverse valves <b>115</b>, <b>125</b> and turn on the other valves <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, and it can therefore be used as usual.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">Besides, as the temperature for using MO source is 5Â° C., that is, the first bottle body <b>11</b> is used in that temperature and the second bottle body <b>12</b> is used in room temperature. And as the vapor pressure is of higher difference in the two temperatures, while the first <b>11</b> and second <b>12</b> bottle bodies are used simultaneously, the first bottle body <b>11</b> will cause condensation as the lower temperature, so that the MO source will be condensed as liquid in the first bottle body <b>11</b> gradually and overflows. Therefore, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention further comprises a liquid level gauge <b>14</b> and a control module <b>15</b>. The liquid level gauge <b>14</b> is disposed on the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the control module <b>15</b> is electrically connected between the three-way valve <b>13</b> and the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> to control the three-way valve <b>13</b> connecting the first connecting end <b>13</b> with the second connecting end <b>132</b> of the three-way valve <b>13</b> or the first connecting end <b>131</b> with the third connecting end <b>133</b> of the three-way valve <b>13</b>, selectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">More specifically, the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> has a first predetermined value (lower liquid level value) and a second predetermined value (higher liquid level value). When the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> detects that the liquid level in the first bottle body <b>11</b> is lower than the first predetermined value, the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> feedbacks a first control signal to the control module <b>15</b> so that the control module <b>15</b> can control the three-way valve <b>13</b> connecting the first connecting end <b>131</b> with the second connecting end <b>132</b> to supply the carrying gas to the second bottle body <b>12</b> for connecting the two bottle bodies <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> in series. Because of the condensation, the liquid level in the first bottle body <b>11</b> will rise gradually in the process of utilization. When the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> detects that the liquid level in the first bottle body <b>11</b> is higher than the second predetermined value, the second control signal is therefore transmitted to the control module <b>15</b> so that the control module <b>15</b> can control the three-way valve <b>13</b> connecting the first connecting end <b>131</b> with the third connecting end <b>133</b>. Under the circumstance of the first connecting end <b>131</b> and the third connecting end <b>133</b> are connected, the carrying gas which is supplied to the second bottle body <b>12</b> will be cut off and turns into supplying gas to the first bottle body <b>11</b>, directly; and only while in the process of using the first bottle body <b>11</b>, the liquid level of the liquid in the first bottle body <b>11</b> is gradually lowered because of the lack of condensation. When the liquid level in the first bottle body <b>11</b> is lower than the first predetermined value, the carrying gas is supplied to the second bottle body <b>12</b>. That is, by the liquid level gauge <b>14</b>, the three-way valve <b>13</b> can switch repeatedly corresponding to the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b>. In addition, it is noticeable that the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> further comprises a third predetermined value which is lower than the first predetermined value. Namely, when the second bottle body <b>12</b> runs out of MO source, the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b> will keep decreasing, and when the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> detects that the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b> is lower than the third predetermined value (the lowest liquid level), the control module <b>15</b> controls a display unit <b>16</b> or the control module <b>15</b> itself sending information to notify the operating personnel to replace the bottle body, such as the replacement for the second bottle body <b>12</b>. According to the aforementioned description, preferably, the control module <b>15</b> can be Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Besides, a fourth predetermined value is also included. The fourth predetermined is used to keep notifying the operating personnel turning the valve off manually to stop the supplement while the liquid level reaches to the second predetermined value but fails to stop supplying because of the malfunction.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">By means of a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention, it can wholly change or break the inherent though which indicates that MO source steel bottle has to be disposed in the thermostat <b>91</b>, such that the second bottle body <b>12</b> is free from the limitation of capacity of the thermostat <b>91</b> and proceeds to make a larger size manufacture. It is noteworthy that a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention further comprises the display unit <b>16</b> which is electrically connected to the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> to display the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b> for benefiting the user from observing.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In addition, the following is the exemplary explanation of an aspect of the present embodiment based on the display unit <b>16</b>. Wherein point A that the display unit <b>16</b> displays is the fourth predetermined value, point B is the second predetermined value, point C is the first predetermined value and point D indicates the third predetermined value. As <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows, when the display unit <b>16</b> displays that the liquid level reaches to point C (the first predetermined value), the liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> executes the supplement automatically, and while the display unit <b>16</b> displays that the liquid level reaches to point B (the second predetermined value), the liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> stops supplying automatically.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">Please refer to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of another embodiment of arrangement for a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention. The correlation and assemblage with each element of the same symbol stated in the present embodiment are similar to the former embodiment, and the unnecessary detailed description of similarity thereof is no longer given.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">As <figref>FIG. 3</figref> shows, the main difference between the present embodiment and the former depends on the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b>. In the former embodiment, the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> are adjacent to a bottom of an accommodating space inside the second bottle body <b>12</b> where is an end of the second inlet pipe <b>121</b> (as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>), and an end of the second outlet pipe <b>122</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> stated in the present embodiment is adjacent to the bottom of the accommodating space inside the second bottle body <b>12</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">More specifically, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system <b>1</b> of the present invention comprises the first bottle body <b>11</b>, the second bottle body <b>12</b>, the connecting pipe <b>17</b> and a liquid level detecting module comprising the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> and the display unit <b>16</b>. Wherein, the connecting pipe <b>17</b> is Â¼â³ VCR connecting pipe which is connected between the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b>. Besides, both ends of the connecting pipe <b>17</b> is a female connector corresponding to ports of the first inlet pipe <b>111</b> and the second outlet pipe <b>122</b>, but it shall not be subject to this restriction. In addition, the display unit <b>16</b> is electrically connected to the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> for displaying the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b>, for example, data line RS <b>232</b> of the liquid level gauge <b>14</b> is connected to the display unit <b>16</b>. Similarly, the display unit <b>16</b> displays the liquid level of the first bottle body <b>11</b> by <b>4</b> graduations (A, B, C, D) in the present embodiment, but it shall not be subject to this restriction.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In the practical application and normal situation, the second transverse valve <b>125</b> of the second bottle body <b>12</b> is turned on and the second inlet valve <b>123</b> and the second outlet valve <b>124</b> are turned off, and then the first transverse valve <b>125</b> of the first bottle body <b>11</b> is turned off and the first inlet valve <b>113</b> and the first outlet valve <b>114</b> are turned on. At this time, the carrying gas floats directly to the first bottle body <b>11</b> via the second transverse valve <b>125</b> without entering the second bottle body <b>12</b>; namely, only the first bottle body is used. In the aspect of the present embodiment, because there is no the control module <b>15</b>, when the display unit <b>16</b> displays that the liquid level reaches to point C (the first predetermined value), the operating personnel shall make the supplement when the apparatus is turned off, and the display unit <b>16</b> displays that the liquid level reaches to point B (the second predetermined value) after the supplement is completed, the supplement to liquid is therefore stopped.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">It is noteworthy to mention that the first bottle body <b>11</b> and the thermostat <b>91</b> are a thermostatic tank originally assembled in a MOCVD apparatus and a steel bottle used under normal circumstance (usually is 4 kg or 2.5 kg). Because the current MOCVD apparatuses become larger, and the usage amount of MO source raises which causes that the usage time for the regular size MO source steel bottle is shortened and the frequency of the replacement for MO source steel bottle is therefore increased. It takes time to replace the empty steel bottle with a full one in which the production is ceased temporarily, such that the production efficiency is degraded and therefore increases the unit cost of epitaxial wafer indirectly. However, as the usage amount of MO source brought out by the carrying gas used in the MOCVD apparatus needs to be maintained in stability, consequently, if a steel bottle of larger size is desirable, once it exceeds in the original accommodating capacity of the thermostatic tank, another thermostatic tank corresponding to the larger steel bottle is necessitated to ensure the temperature of the steel bottle, so that the usage amount of MO source brought out by the carrying gas can stay in stability. Making a thermostatic tank corresponding to the steel bottle belongs to an expensive engineering project and will cost hugely, and it also has to relocate the arrangement of MO source steel bottle and the thermostatic tank used in the MOCVD apparatus because that the thermostatic tank's area is modified. As to the present invention, only via a simple and fast assemblage, it thereby connects the original steel bottle of normal size with a steel bottle of larger capacity in series, i.e. the second bottle body <b>12</b> (capacity size of the second bottle body can be customized based on inner space of apparatus), and the second bottle body <b>12</b> is used in room temperature without using the thermostatic tank according to the aforementioned arrangement. The design used in room temperature is a breakthrough in the art (using steel bottle is necessitated). The saturated vapor of MO source brought out by the second bottle body <b>12</b> is in constant temperature while floating through a small steel bottle; at this time, the saturated vapor pressure is that used in the temperature of the small steel bottle (usage temperature of trimethyl gallium is usually in 5Â° C.).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In summary, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention is characterized of simple structural configuration, easy to manufacture and assemble and convenient for transporting and so on and so forth. In addition, the main feature of the present invention lies in that user can keep using MO source in a long duration without modifying MOCVD apparatus and working environment so as to lower the non-production time because of the replacement for the empty MO source steel bottle, so the production efficiency can be promoted and the production cost can be decreased. Moreover, as the arrangement of the liquid level gauge, the three-way valve can switch automatically without being interfered with manpower, and the second bottle body is free from capacity limitation of the thermostat, steel bottle of larger size can be manufactured to lower the replacement times for steel bottle greatly so as to promote production efficiency of apparatus and decrease the failure rate caused by operating personnel. As a result, a liquid-metal organic compound supply system of the present invention is not only of prominent economic benefits, but also with fine practical applicability.</p>
