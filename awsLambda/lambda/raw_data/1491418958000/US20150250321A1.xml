      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to support devices in general and in particular to a method and apparatus for supporting and assisting a user to get into and out of a kneeling position.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Kneeling is a position which is frequently difficult or uncomfortable for many people. Many people have difficulty with the act of getting into and staying in a kneeling position. In particular, many people find remaining in a kneeling position to be hard on the outer surface of their knees. This is particularly the case where the person is kneeling on rough or hard surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">A further difficulty many people experience is the act of lowering themselves into a kneeling position from a standing position. It will also be appreciated that the movement of returning to standing from a kneeling position is likewise similarly difficult for such people. Such movements may be difficult for people either due to reduced muscular strength or due to injury or weakness within their knees themselves. For other people, the movement into and out of a kneeling position places a painful level of strain on their back.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Previous attempts have been made to provide knee supports for a user so as to reduce the difficulty required to get into and out of as well as remain in a kneeling position. Some attempts have been made to provide a padded surface on which the user may kneel. Such devices have located such surface at a fixed position which does not however aid the user in getting into and out of the kneeling position. Examples of such devices may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,763,756 issued Aug. 16, 1988 to Horan.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to a first embodiment of the present invention there is disclosed an apparatus for supporting and assisting a user to get into and out of a kneeling position comprising a platform extending between first and second edges, each edge having two corners, a frame accommodating the platform therebetween and at least one biased arm extending between the platform and the frame, the biased arm being adapted to bias the platform from a first position located proximate to a ground surface to a second position vertically spaced above the first position.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The apparatus may further comprise an upright located proximate to each of the corners of the first and second edges of the platform wherein the uprights located proximate to two corners of a common edge of the platform are connected by a top connecting portion.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The platform may be supported at the second position at an angle with a rear edge of the platform being lower than a corresponding front edge. The angle may be selected to be between 0 and 30 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The frame may include stoppers for supporting the platform in the first position. The arm may be collapsible. The arm may comprise first and second arm portions with a pivot therebetween. The pivot may be biased to extend the arm. The pivot may include a spring. The spring may comprise a torsion spring.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Referring to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, an apparatus for supporting the knees of a user according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown generally at <b>10</b>. The apparatus comprises a platform <b>12</b> slidably supported within a frame <b>30</b> and having a top surface <b>14</b> to receive and support the knees of a user thereon. The platform <b>12</b> is moveable between lowered and raised positions and is biased by a biasing arms <b>100</b> to the raised position as will be more fully described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The platform <b>12</b> extends between first and second side edges, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, respectively and front and rear edges <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively. The platform <b>12</b> may optionally include padded portions <b>24</b> on the top surface <b>14</b> thereof sized and positioned to receive the knees of a user thereon which may comprise a portion or the entire top surface of the platform. The platform <b>12</b> may be substantially rectangular as illustrated or any other suitable outline, such as, by way of non-limiting example, square, oval, circular, octagonal, hexagonal or irregular. The platform may be formed of any suitable material, such as, by way of non-limiting example wood, metal, plastic or composite materials and may have a thickness sufficient to support the weight of the user thereon. The platform <b>12</b> will further have a size selected to be able to receive a user thereon while permitting such a user to grasp the top portions of the frame for support. In practice, it has been found that a width of between 6 and 12 inches (152 and 305 mm) and a length of between 18 and 30 inches (457 and 762 mm) has been useful although it will be appreciated that other dimensions for the platform may be useful as well. The platform <b>12</b> may be angularly oriented, by an angle, generally indicated at <b>25</b> such that the front edge <b>20</b> is higher than the rear edge <b>22</b>. The angle <b>25</b> assists in providing a more comfortable position for the user and may be selected to be any angle between 0 and 30 degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The frame <b>30</b> comprises a pair of parallel space spaced apart inverted u-shaped members <b>32</b> each comprising front and rear uprights, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, respectively with a top connecting portion <b>38</b> between the top ends thereof. As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the front and rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> and the top connecting portions <b>38</b> may be formed of substantially tubular members as are commonly known although non-hollow or solid members may also be utilized. As illustrated the front and rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> and the top connecting portions <b>38</b> may be substantially tubular, although it will be appreciated that other cross-sectional shapes may be useful as well, such as, by way of non-limiting example, square, oval, rectangular, or irregular. The front and rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are substantially parallel to each other so as to support the platform therebetween at a plurality of locations therealong. Optionally, the frame may include bottom braces <b>44</b> extending between bottom portions of the front and rear uprights and a front brace <b>46</b> extending between the two u-shaped members <b>32</b> to provide additional stability to the apparatus. Furthermore, the frame <b>30</b> may optionally include selectably connectable extensions extending from the bottom end thereof so as to permit a user to adjust the height of the apparatus <b>10</b> as are commonly known in the art. The front and rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> will be selected to have a height sufficient to position the top connecting portion <b>38</b> at a height that may be grasped by a user. In practice it has been found that a height of between 18 and 30 inches (457 and 762 mm) has been useful although it will be appreciated that other heights dimensions may be useful as well. The frame <b>30</b> may be formed of any suitable material, such as, by way of non-limiting example, metal, wood, plastic, or composite materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The front brace <b>46</b> may extend between first and second collars <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>, respectively surrounding a portion of the front uprights <b>34</b>. The first and second collars <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> may be rotatable around the front uprights so as to permit the u-shaped members <b>32</b> to be rotated relative thereto in a direction generally indicated at <b>96</b>. It will be appreciated that such rotation will permit the apparatus <b>10</b> to be folded substantially flat for ease of storage and transportation as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>. It will be appreciated that the frame <b>30</b> may be useful for hanging other objects, such as, by way of non-limiting example, tool trays or holders as are commonly known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">The collapsible arms <b>100</b> extend between the front brace <b>46</b> and the platform <b>12</b>. Each arm <b>100</b> comprises a first and a second arm portion, <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respective with a center hinge <b>106</b> therebetween. The center hinge <b>106</b> will include a biasing element, such as, by way of non-limiting example, a torsion spring therein adapted to bias the first and second arms <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to the extended or second position illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The second arm portions <b>104</b> are rotatably attached to the platform <b>12</b> by first end hinges <b>108</b>. The first arm portions <b>102</b> are rotatably attached to the front brace <b>46</b> by second end hinges <b>110</b>. Optionally, the first and second end hinges <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may also include torsion springs or other rotational biasing or resistive devices therein. When the user <b>8</b> presses down the platform <b>12</b> by the knees <b>6</b>, the platform <b>12</b> is slowly brought down to the down or first position as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> while biasing the torsion springs within the hinge connection <b>106</b>. In this position, the arms <b>100</b> collapse with the aids of the hinge connection and first and second end hinges <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>. When the user <b>8</b> attempts to stand up, the platform <b>12</b> is urged to slowly return to the up or second position under the bias of the torsion springs within the center hinge <b>106</b> and/or first and second end hinges <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Although two arms <b>100</b> are shown herein, according to other embodiments a single arm or more than two arms may be used as well. The arms shown in this embodiment has a single fold at a center thereof. Multiple folds may be useful as well, such as with an arm arranged in a zigzag shape. The center hinge <b>106</b> and first and second end hinges <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> may also be adapted to have range of a range of motion limited to position the platform <b>12</b> at providing the desirable angle <b>25</b> when in the up-position as shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, for the convenience of the user <b>8</b> as set out above.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The arms <b>100</b> may be formed of any suitable material, such as, by way of non-limiting example, metal, plastic or composite materials. The arms have sufficient resilience to permit the platform <b>12</b> to be brought down to the down-position from the up-position under the weight of the knees <b>6</b> of the user <b>8</b> and to permit the platform <b>12</b> to be brought back to the up-position when the user <b>8</b> tends to stand up. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, stoppers <b>112</b> may be provided on the bottom of the first arm portions <b>102</b> for resting the platform <b>12</b> in the down-position.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In operation, a user approaches the apparatus from the rear and places their knees <b>6</b> upon the pads <b>24</b>. The user then permits their weight to press the platform downward to the position illustrated in <figref>FIG. 3</figref> which may be utilized for working in any location for which kneeling is required. When the user is completed with their kneeling task, they may slowly stand up such that the arms <b>100</b> urge the platform to the topmost position shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> and thereby assisting the user in standing. Optionally, the user may grasp the top connecting portions <b>38</b> of the u-shaped members to provide them with additional stability during such movements</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The arms <b>100</b> may be selected to provide a suitable bias based upon the intended user <b>8</b> and the amount of assistance required by such person to return to the standing position. In practice, it has been found that arms <b>100</b> providing between 10 and 200 pounds of lift to the platform <b>12</b> will be sufficient although other biasing forces will be useful as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The pair of the inverted u-shaped members <b>32</b> are connected by at least one front brace <b>46</b> preferably towards the bottom for better stability. Additional front braces <b>46</b> may be used as well. Optionally, the frame <b>30</b> may include more bottom braces <b>44</b> extending between the bottom portions of the front and the rear uprights <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> to provide additional stability to the apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
