    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A blanket-like covering for an infant or child, intended for use over safety restraints, when the infant or child is being transported in a car seat, stroller, or similar transportation device. The device provides protection from the elements while being easily installed and removed when necessary, to prevent overheating of the infant or child. The covering is blanket-like, in that it is laid over the infant or child, to completely cover the torso. There are openings to bring the infant or child's hands and arms through the structure, to allow for free and easy movement, and provides for the infant or child to hold or play with toys while remaining covered. There is an opening at the top of the device in order to fit the covering around the child's neck and shoulders.</p>

      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of infant and child coverings, specifically those used with car seats, strollers, and any other child transportation devices where the child is strapped in.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Parents and caregivers of infants and children are charged with protecting infants and children from cold temperatures, windy conditions, precipitation, and UV rays. Bundling children and infants against the elements can be time consuming, difficult, uncomfortable for the child, and frustrating for the parent or caregiver.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Infants and children are transported via various methods, including car seats, strollers, carriages, carriers, wagons, and sleds. All of these methods require securing the child to the apparatus with varying styles and types of safety belts.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Bundling children or infants into safety harnesses installed over the outerwear, layers of clothing or blankets can be time consuming, frustrating for both the parent or caregiver and infant or child, uncomfortable for the infant or child, and can require the adjustment to many safety straps, thus reducing the effectiveness of the safety apparatus.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The process of bundling and unbundling, strapping, unstrapping, and readjusting straps, can become exponentially more frustrating to the infant or child and the parent or caregiver when multiple trips indoors or outdoors are called for. As an example, shopping in a strip mall, or running multiple errands that require repeatedly entering and exiting a vehicle. In either case, the infant or child's layers of bundling need to be removed and/or loosened to avoid overheating of the infant or child, then replaced upon returning outdoors.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">It is then desired and necessary to have a method of covering of the infant or child that would not require movement of the safety harness, safety belt, or equivalent mechanism, would keep the infant or child protected from the elements, and would be quickly and easily installed and removed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">This invention is a covering for an infant or child, intended to be worn over safety restraints, harnesses, or the like. The covering contains three openings: one for each arm to be slipped through, and one for the apparatus to be molded against the neck and shoulders. Arm openings are located in varying degrees from the base of the neck opening, depending upon the size of the wearer. The covering completely covers the feet and torso of the wearer, such that the wearer is protected from the elements and body heat is retained within.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The invention is designed for easy removal and reinstallation to allow for convenience and flexibility to both parents/caregivers and infants/children. This invention could alternately be created with a more rounded bottom to have less material overflow outside of the transportation device. The covering could optionally have sleeves attached where the arm openings are located, and further, could have flip over material pockets that encompass hands to provide additional protection against the elements. The option also exists for a pouch installed at the bottom area of the device for an infant/child's feet to be inserted, thus securing the covering to the child further. As an alternative, Velcro dots or strips could be installed to secure the device to a car seat or stroller, or other item of transport.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Many inventions and products exist to keep a baby or child protected and warm. No prior inventions or products could be located that are installed over safety belts, and are easily removable and installable in that they cover the front of the child/infant only.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The majority of the other inventions and products located were attached to the wearer (infant or child), and worn under the safety belt. Some were designed for the safety belts to pass through the structure of the invention. Some were designed to be installed within the safety seat itself, then wrapped around the infant or child. Some were designed to be installed over the entire carseat or stroller, thus not attached to the child, but enveloping the child.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Only a handful were installed over the safety belts, and only two were remotely similar to this invention. U.S. Pat. No. 5,437,061A, is a poncho styled child covering, with a hood, and music, that fits over the entire child as well as their method of transport (i.e. carseat, stroller, etc). U.S. Pat. No. 8,118,364B2 is a device that covers the infant/child, and has arms, but attaches to the stroller. Both devices are very different from this invention, as this invention is not intended to cover the entire traveling apparatus, nor to be attached to an apparatus, but only the child/infant within the apparatus. Some overflow material is intended to keep the child/infant warm and provide for coziness, but this invention is intended to be worn to cover the front of the child/infant as the rear of the child/infant is assumed to be covered by the mode of transport.</p>
      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">This invention is a covering to securely protect an infant or child from the elements, while maintaining easy installation and removal, and allowing infant or children's safety harnesses to maintain secure adjustment. This invention is intended primarily for use in car seats, strollers, carriages, and for additional warmth for older children in vehicular booster seats.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The item this invention would closest resemble is a blanket, though with openings at the appropriate areas for arms and head to secure the covering to the child. There may be elastic to facilitate a more fitted garment at the arm openings and neck opening, with or without a removable hood; or there may be sleeves with hand coverings at the ends, as well as a detachable hood, with or without a flip over pocket that would serve to keep the bottom securely covering the infant or child's feet in windy weather.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, this invention has similar features to a blanket in its shape and ability to give warmth to the wearer, but is further intended to create a secure yet easily removable covering for infants and children when shopped into a safety harness, as in a car seat, stroller, or the like.</p>
