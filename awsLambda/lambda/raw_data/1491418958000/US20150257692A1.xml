    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Particular medical conditions require periodic monitoring by the individual with the condition. With respect to diabetics, they must monitor their blood glucose level. Depending upon the type (Type I or Type II) of diabetes and severity, an individual may monitor his/her insulin level several times per day (particularly before and/or after meals), daily, weekly or monthly. To monitor one's glucose level a person typically lances a fingertip or thumb tip (collectively, âfingertipâ) to draw a drop of blood, place the blood on a test strip and insert the test strip into a device programmed to measure the glucose level (also referred to herein as âblood sugarâ or âBSâ). Depending upon the glucose level measured the person may inject him or herself with insulin, the amount of insulin being dependent upon the glucose measurement, or alternatively take an oral medication.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Figures A and B depict typical kits currently used by diabetics. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows a kit with, among other things, lances, swabs, test strips and a glucose reader and <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows a kit that includes insulin pens (each of which contains insulin and can be adjusted to dispense a predetermined amount of insulin) and needles. Each kit is approximately 4â³Ã5â³Ã1Â½â³ and many diabetics must carry both kits when traveling, or even when going to a restaurant. Hence, there is a need for a smaller, more compact manner for a diabetic to carry necessary testing and treatment supplies. There is also a need for a fast and simple way to effectuate the measurement of one's blood glucose level and for administering insulin (if required).</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Diabetics can also benefit from a system and method that provides an historical record of blood sugar level and can correspond the history of blood glucose measurement to different meals and/or dining at particular restaurants. With this information a diabetic can select different restaurants and/or meals in the future. Further, a diabetic can quickly review, for example, in a graphical format his or her glucose level over a period of hours, days, a week, a month or any given period, to see and evaluate a history of how well he or she is controlling glucose levels.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention are directed to systems and methods for the management of a medical condition, and more particularly to the management of a medical condition that requires periodic monitoring. References herein are made to specific examples wherein the medical condition is diabetes. However, the concepts described herein are applicable to other medical conditions, including, but not limited to managing, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate or function, sodium levels, potassium levels, creatinine levels, liver function, or other medical conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Thus, the most preferred embodiments of the present disclosure variously address the monitoring and testing of blood glucose levels, the administration of insulin (if required), and a system and method for a diabetic to quickly see his/her glucose history, compare the history with restaurants and/or meals, and, if desired, to share information with others to form a support group.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">A kit (also referred to herein sometimes as a âdeviceâ) according to aspects of the invention is self-contained and approximately 5â³-6â³ in length, 1â³-1Â½â³ wide and 1â³-1Â½â³ deep. The kit may include a first compartment that includes lances to lance a fingertip and test strips upon which blood is placed. The kit may have a second compartment that includes needles. The kit also includes a lancing apparatus, an insulin pen that preferably can be manually adjusted to administer a desired amount of insulin and a needle mount that communicates with the insulin pen. The kit also includes a glucose meter that determines the blood glucose level from the blood placed on a test strip.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A kit according to aspects of the invention replaces the two prior art kits described above, is small enough to fit in a pocket or a purse, and at some major components, such as the insulin pen, glucose meter and lancing apparatus, are self-contained within the kit and are not removed during use. During use a test strip is removed from a compartment of the kit and is positioned in a slot (or part) in the kit housing. The slot communicates with an opening in the glucose meter and when the test strip is inserted the glucose meter is activated. The person then exposes an end of the lancing apparatus (if not already exposed), which is preferably an opening in the kit housing, inside of which is a spring-loaded lance. The user presses a fingertip to the opening and presses a button on the kit housing. The button releases the lance for a predetermined distance so the lance slightly pricks the fingertip to draw blood.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">When the fingertip is lanced the user places a drop of blood on the test strip and the glucose meter measures and provides the blood glucose level, preferably by a digital, electronic display. To conserve power, the glucose meter is preferably only activated when a test strip is inserted.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Depending on the blood glucose level, the user may wish to inject him or herself with insulin. The user would first adjust (or select) the amount of insulin to be injected by an adjustment device connected to the insulin pen. Then a needle is removed from the second compartment. In the embodiments shown, the insulin pen has an end opposite the adjustment device and this end receives a needle. Once the needle is received (or mounted) to the end of the insulin pen the user can inject insulin in a standard manner. Afterwards, the needle is removed and discarded and the kit is put away.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In another embodiment in the kit includes either a wired or wireless communication device to communicate with a mobile device (such as a smart phone) or a computer. Alternatively, the kit itself may have a processor and data storage to retain data. In either mode, the user's glucose readings can be automatically stored and/or transmitted. The information transmitted from the kit can include the glucose reading, time and date the reading was made, the amount of insulin injected, the glucose reading after the insulin injection, and environmental information, such as the location where the reading was taken, whether it was before or after a meal, the type of meal consumed, and the name of restaurant or other establishment where the meal was consumed. This information can be stored and utilized by a software program (either in the kit, a smart phone, computer, or one that is accessed via the internet by any such device): (a) to create a chart or graphical display of glucose readings over a given time period, and/or (b) correlate readings with different meals at different places to create a history for the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">This data allows user to interactively track history and enter information about each blood sugar test/result. If the data is stored in a central location, such as a website, the user/medical professionals can access the information and track progress and adjust the user's treatment plan as necessary. A system or method according to the invention may also alert user/medical professional of problems or irregularities, and can be updated with additional test results such as blood results/A1C results to better gain the overall health of the user. The application may also learn the habits of the user such as meals/testing times and send out reminders to users.

      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0123">The system can use the device or information available via a network such as the Internet to determine the date and time for the announcement. As an example, upon launching the system application, display screen <b>300</b> will turn green or blue (depending on the user selection) and the system will cause the device to state and/or display: âGood morning âJohnnieâ (or other user name). Your blood sugar levels are in good shape today.â Or, for a different time of day with poor results, display green <b>300</b> will turn red or back and the system will cause the device to state and/or display: âGood evening âJohnnieâ Your blood sugar levels have gone above acceptable ranges. Please ensure to take immediate action.â Then, depending upon the user's setup for the system, the system will remind the user to test their blood sugar again, within a set time period, such as one or two hours to ensure that their blood sugar level is back within tolerable range.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Example 1</heading>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0124">The following is one example of how an electronic, computer system and method could function according to the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0125">Main Screen:</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0126">In this example, the software is either loaded onto a mobile device or computer, is downloaded from a server when a request is sent, or operates on a separate server. Preferably, an icon for the software application is visible on a home screen of any suitable device or computer.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0127">In this example, when a user clicks on the icon the screen first goes black and a clear white sugar cube slowly resolves and becomes granular looking. It then tilts on a slight angle and a small drop of red blood will appear and slowly get larger until it drips off the lower right corner of the cube down the screen and highlights the log-in button in red. During this time the software, if not permanently loaded onto the hard drive of the device, will load from a remote source, such as a server accessible via the internet.</p>
      <p id="p-00128-en" num="0128">The user must then log into the application with a valid email address and password. This will also create an account for the user, if the user does not already have an account. Once the log in is completed, the application opens up on the settings page. At that point, the user can enter personal information such as: Age; race; A1C levels and dates of test; daily testing times and reminders for testing. The user may also select a color scheme that appeals to him/her, such as: green or blue for positive results; orange or yellow for modest or mild results; and red or black for negative or poor results.</p>
      <p id="p-00129-en" num="0129">The next aspect of this example of the application is the greeting screen. After the initial set up, when a user logs into the application, the system will review the history of the user's test results and compile the results to inform the user of his/her average results. The user may set the time range of his/her history, for example, as follows: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>The past 24 hr. testing results (e.g., 4 test results average a BS of 130). The past week (e.g., average BS of 145) or the past month (e.g., average BS of 125). A user may select one time frame at a time or view them in a single frame.</li><li>The application background may turn color to reflect the past results and announce (such as via Siri fxn) in a voice how the user has done.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0132">Next, the application can determine the date and time for announcements, such as set forth in the following example: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>Ex. 1: the screen turns green or blue and states: âgood morning Johnnie Your BS levels are in good shape today.â</li><li>Ex 2: the screen turns red or black and states: âGood evening Johnnie Your BS levels have gone above acceptable ranges please ensure to take immediate action.â The application can also ask/remind the user to test BS again within an hour or two to ensure that the range is within a tolerable limit.</li><li>The application may also send emergency indicators to the user and/or to a medical professional if the blood sugar results are dangerously high or low or have been high or low for an extended period. For example, the indicator may be a text or email message or a flashing screen on the user's device.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00131-en" num="0136">The main screen appears after the greeting screen. The exemplary following icons may appear on the main screen, and they may be touch icons or ones that are selected and clicked, or activated in any suitable manner: (1) testing glucose levels; (2) data matrix; (3) location matrix; (4) community tracker; (5) medical professionals; (6) calendar; (7) web application; (8) link to American Diabetic Association; (9) setting; and (10) history option.</p>
      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0137">The application may learn which aspects a user uses the most and sort icons accordingly from top to bottom.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0138">Testing:</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0139">In this example, where a user's blood sugar level is being measured, the testing apparatus can physically communicate with the computing device, such as by being plugged into it, or may communicate with via any satisfactory wireless method. The icon for testing may look like a finger and blood droplet, as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0140">If the testing apparatus is physically connected (e.g., by a wired connection), it can be placed into an AUX jack on the device (which is shown in <figref>FIGS. 14-17</figref>). Regardless of how it communicates with the device on which the application is run, a test strip is inserted into the testing apparatus. The light may turn orange on the screen running the application to show that system is calibrating. Once the system has completed calibrating, the light on the screen may turn green/blue and the application screen may show a picture of a blood droplet falling into the top of a test strip. This can appear/flash over and over until blood is applied to the test strip, in order to remind the user to add blood to the test strip.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0141">Next, the user utilizes a lancet to obtain his/her blood sample, which is placed on the test strip. The blood sugar reading will appear on the display screen of the device running the application (e.g., 130 Mg/dl 6/6/2012 at 6:35 PM). Then information about the results may be entered, via the device, such as by a rolling wheel (for a touch screen) displayed by the application. The wheel would allow the user to scroll through a list of items such as: before/after meal; too much food; not enough food; exercise; not enough exercise; carbohydrates; and others (there may be several other options including remarks such as fatty or skinny/chilling at home/on the road; also, large amount of younger adults and children are being diagnosed with Diabetes daily so having options that appeal to a younger demographic could make the application more user friendly).</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0142">The application may also include a mapping option that would work with the tracking matrix. For example, after the BS results are shown the application may also store the location of that reading via the device's GPS system (if it has one) which could allow the user to link previously entered data (such as the last meal) to a location on a map. For example: a location (which could be indicated visually by push pins) would be red, which means poor BS. An orange push pin=moderate BS results, and a green push pin=good BS results.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0143">As an example, when the user looks at his map while trying to locate a restaurant, he/she could click on a green push pin location. Once selected the information about that location would be provided, e.g., Vinnie's Pizza Monday 5/20/12 6:35 PM: Â½ slice of pizza and a diet coke, BS results 135 Test 1.5 hours after meal. The application could also store a photograph of the location, and using a GPS locator, could identify the results from a prior location or meal by typing in the name of the establishment/meal, the address of the establishment, or using GPS coordinates to identify the establishment.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0144">Tracking Matrix:</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0145">The application can utilize meal data and BS results to provide reminders to users of what they ate and the test results for a specific location. The application would notify the user when the GPS recognizes previous locations visited, for example: <ul id="ul-00005-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00006-en" list-style="none"><li>The application could display the map and show locations via color-coded push pins or other indictors. The application could load all previous visits to that location, preferably in chronological order, starting with the most recent visit to that location as the first displayed.</li><li>The application could show date/time/meal info/photo (optional)/description of the location and meal. This would provide the user a reminder of what they eat and what impact it had on them at the time of testing.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0148">In this manner, the application allows a user to make better decisions about new meals at the same locations. An example of the tracking matrix function follows:</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0149">MAP Example A: Spike hillâWilliamsburg Brooklyn, N.Y.: <ul id="ul-00007-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00008-en" list-style="none"><li>(a) 5/06/12 9:00 PM 2 slices 1 sodaâ185MG/DL-RED.</li><li>(b) 4/30/12 12:45 PM 1 Slice 1 diet sodaâ156 MG/DL-Orange/Red.</li><li>(c) 4/15/12 3:35 PM 3 slices Â½ sodaâ176MG/DL-Orange/Red.</li><li>(d) 2/06/12 7:45 PM 1 Slice 1 diet Cokeâ135 MG/DL-Green.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0154">Thus, when the user enters a location the application will provide the average BS result for that location. Further, it may provide an audio message such as: <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>âJohnnie Your Blood Sugar has been above its normal range at this location the past 3 times you eaten here.â Or, the screen may turn a color to show the overall impact for the meals a user has eaten at that location, or both.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0156">As time passes and the user completes the meal information while eating and logs test results for different locations the user will have a map that shows locations that promote good diabetic management. Using the GPS functionality of devices and/or stored photographic information, a user may point a device to a restaurant, and results form that restaurant would automatically be displayed.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0157">Viral Community:</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0158">The benefit of this feature is to create an environment that allows users to interface with other users on one or more topics, such as: diet; stress control; carbohydrate intake; exercise; medication (side effects and benefits); and provide an open discussion forum. A user could also seek medical professionals to answer questions.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0159">An example of forum queries might be: <ul id="ul-00011-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00012-en" list-style="none"><li>User name: Johnnie Bloodâ5/5/12 4:55 PM anyone eat kidney beans? If so what effect do they have on your BS?</li><li>User name: Olga Hyper sugarâYeah, they have a low GI index.</li><li>User Name: Dr. Bâyes they are good for your diabetic diet.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0163">Chats may be saved by date with the possibility of linking a chat to GPS so a user has a full history when he/she selects a location to identify a restaurant.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0164">Medical Professionals:</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0165">This portion of the application, if used, would allow users to add information about medical professionals, such as: address; contact information; and past results.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0166">A user could set up parameters on the system that the medical professional provides, such as: (a) fasting ranges 88 to 130; and (b) after-meal ranges 120 to 180. Further, a user could provide updates with the medical professional's office. The updates could be provided once weekly or monthly. If the acceptable range of blood sugar level for a user is surpassed the professional is notified (such as via email or text) that the user is over the acceptable range and must set up an appointment.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0167">Calendar:</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0168">This portion of the application would allow the user to view information about doctor appointments, meals/locations and BS test results. It also allows the user to visually review the past few days, weeks or months to see how his/her results have been. Graphs and any other visuals would be accessible at this point for a better viewing of their results.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0169">As an example, the user could review the month of June. In this example, during the first three days of the month, the user's BS are within the acceptable BS range. But, on the first weekend of the month, the results are poor. The user could click on each day of the week to see what and where he/she ate. Each day/location will have all previous meal and BS results available for display and the user could review the information on a map or in list results, such as follows: <ul id="ul-00013-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00014-en" list-style="none"><li>6/5/2012âRed         <ul id="ul-00015-en" list-style="none"><li>Mom's house breakfastâ9 AMâpancakes, OJâBSâ160âtesting 1.5 hrs after meal.</li><li>InâNâOut burgerâ12:45 PMâdouble cheeseburger coke and friesâBS <b>220</b>âtesting 2 hours after meal.</li><li>Meatball shopâ9:30 PMâpasta and meat ballsâBS <b>175</b>âtesting 1.5 hours after meal.</li><li>The GPS location of each location could be shown in the appropriate color code.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0175">When the user has X number of days âGreenâ in a row, a congratulation email or pop-up window may be sent to the user.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0176">Settings:</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0177">For this function, a user could input medical info/history/records, medicine type into the application, such as: blood pressure; A1C level; cholesterol; carbohydrates; LDL; HDL; triglycerides; abdominal girth; and foot/eye exam results as well as future medical appointments. Further, the user or doctor could add goals so the system or application can gauge results over the course of a given period, such as a day, week or month. As an example: âJohnnie your BS results have been very elevated over the past nine days. Please correct your diet or exercise more.â An email could also be sent to medical professionals if the results have been out of range for too long.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0178">The application may also have a child setting so parents can remind a child to enter meal data and test daily. The system could send texts or emails to parents if the child does not test himself within a certain time frame for the day. An alarm may sound if data is not entered within a certain time frame. The application may also be used with seniors as well to ensure that they are entering data into the system within certain time frames.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0179">History of Diabetes:</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0180">This would provide a history and up-to-date information about diabetes. The system could load new information to the application, daily, monthly or weekly as it becomes available. The information could include: classification of Diabetes; signs and symptoms; causes; pathology; diagnosis; management; epidemiology; history; society and culture; and references.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0181">Emergency Contact:</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0182">The user's emergency contact could be listed on the mobile device and/or computer, for example: <ul id="ul-00016-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00017-en" list-style="none"><li>Johnnie R         <ul id="ul-00018-en" list-style="none"><li>Type 1 Diabetic and carry insulin on person 24/7.</li><li>Emergency contact Mandy âThe bossâ Gagedeen 917 555 5555.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></p>
