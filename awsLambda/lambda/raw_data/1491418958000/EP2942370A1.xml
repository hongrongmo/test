    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Among thermoplastic elastomers, styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers such as a styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), a styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymer (SIS), and hydrogenated products thereof are widely used from the viewpoints of excellent flexibility, rubber elasticity, recyclability, and the like with low cost.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Studies have been conducted so as to improve various physical properties of the styrene-based thermoplastic elastomers. For example, a thermoplastic elastomer resin composition for molding powder, which is used so as to obtain a molded article with soft texture and excellent scratch resistance, and includes a styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer, a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer, and the like (see PTL 1); and a composition having excellent flexibility, mold processability, and scratch resistance, which is a thermoplastic elastomer composition obtained by adding a copolymer having units exhibiting compatibility with both of a styrene-based thermoplastic elastomer (a hydrogenated block copolymer) and a methacryl-based resin to a composition including both (see PTL 2) have been proposed.</p>
    <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Furthermore, there have been proposed a thermoplastic resin composition retaining surface characteristics such as surface hardness exhibited by an acryl-based resin, weather resistance, transparency, and the like, and also having properties such as flexibility and low-temperature characteristics, which is an acryl-based thermoplastic resin composition obtained by blending a hydrogenated product of a block copolymer including a polymer block (a) containing an aromatic vinyl compound having a specific molecular weight, and a polymer block (b) containing isoprene, or isoprene and butadiene, with an acryl-based resin having a specific intrinsic viscosity at a specific ratio (see PTL 3); and a thermoplastic resin composition having a block containing an a-b-a structure (a: a block containing aromatic vinyl monomers and b: a block containing isoprene and/or butadiene) with respect to an acryl-based resin, and containing a hydrogenated product of 3-component block copolymers having a specific number average molecular weight at a specific ratio (see PTL 4).</p>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There has been proposed a composition having superior flexibility, weather resistance, and good appearance characteristics, which is a thermoplastic resin composition including a polyolefin-based resin (A), a hydrogenated product (B) of a thermoplastic block copolymer consisting of a block containing aromatic vinyl monomers and a block containing isoprene and/or butadiene, an acryl-based resin (C), a hydrocarbon-based softening agent (D), and a hydrogenated product (E) of a thermoplastic block copolymer consisting of a block containing aromatic vinyl monomers and a block containing isoprene and/or butadiene, having a polymerized product of an acryl-based monomer in a side chain thereof (see PTL 5).</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The composition of PTL 1 has been tentatively improved due to its inferiority to a polyurethane-based thermoplastic elastomer with respect to scratch resistance, but it still has problems such as deteriorated performance and yellowing in a case of being formed into a molded article from the viewpoints of insufficient hydrolysis resistance and weather resistance. The compositions of PTLs 2 to 5 retain surface characteristics such as surface hardness exhibited by an acryl-based resin, weather resistance, transparency, and the like, and also have excellent properties of mold processability, transparency, and the like due to their sufficient flexibility. However, the scratch resistance and the abrasion resistance of the compositions were evaluated, and as a result, they are not sufficiently satisfactory.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Under these circumstances, there remains a demand for a thermoplastic polymer composition which can be effectively used in sites where the composition is subjected to frequent friction and applications where aesthetic appearance is important, for example.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In order to solve the above problems, PTL 6 proposes the following polymer composition.</p>

    <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Specifically, first, all the components to be mixed are melt-kneaded by a method known in the related art to produce pellets. For example, the respective constituents are melt-kneaded using a kneading device such as a single screw extruder, a twin screw extruder, a Banbury mixer, a brabender, an open roll, and a kneader to obtain pellets of the thermoplastic polymer composition. At this time, the kneading temperature is generally preferably 160Â°C to 280Â°C, and more preferably 190Â°C to 260Â°C.</p>

    <p id="p-00188-en" num="0188">From Tables 2 to 4, it can be seen that the thermoplastic polymer compositions and sheets or films thereof in Examples 1 to 14 have both good flexibility and rubber elasticity, and have both high transparency and excellent mechanical properties. In addition, the thermoplastic resin compositions of Examples 1 to 14 are also excellent in mold processability, in addition to the above characteristics.</p>
    <p id="p-00189-en" num="0189">In the thermoplastic polymer composition of the present Example, the dispersed particles of the acryl polymer (II) were finely dispersed, as compared with the thermoplastic polymer compositions of Comparative Examples, and as a result, the compatibility with printing inks having polar groups, that is, the ease of coating, was usually further improved. In fact, the results of the evaluation of ease of coating were superior to those in Comparative Example.</p>
    <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1, in which the block copolymer (I')-3 having a too high number average molecular weight was used, the average dispersed particle diameter of the dispersed particles of the acryl-based polymer (II) was increased, and further, the ratio of the dispersed particles having a dispersed particle diameter of 40 nm or more and less than 60 nm was significantly reduced. Therefore, the transparency and the mechanical properties were evaluated to be deteriorated.</p>
    <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">Furthermore, in Comparative Example 2, in which the molding device having no static mixer was used, the ratio of the dispersed particles having a dispersed particle diameter of 40 nm or more and less than 60 nm in the acryl-based polymer (II) was significantly reduced. Therefore, as compared with Example 1, the transparency was not at a satisfactory level, the ease of coating under a high-temperature and high-humidity environment was reduced, and thus, the mechanical properties were also slightly reduced. Further, in Comparative Example 3, in which the block copolymer (I')-5 having no Î±-methylstyrene unit was used, and Comparative Example 4, in which the block copolymer (I')-5 and the molding device having no static mixer were used, the average dispersed particle diameter of the dispersed particles of the acryl-based polymer (II) was increased, and further, the ratio of the dispersed particles having a dispersed particle diameter of 40 nm or more and less than 60 nm was significantly reduced. Therefore, the transparency was very poor and the mechanical properties (in particular, thrust strength) are also significantly low. In addition, in any of a normal environment and a high-temperature and high-humidity environment, the ease of coating was poor.</p>
    <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">From <figref>Fig. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the film produced using the thermoplastic polymer composition obtained in Example 1 has a sea-island structure in which the block copolymer (I) forms a sea and the acryl-based polymer (II) forms an island, and further, the ratio of the dispersed particles having a dispersed particle diameter of 40 nm or more and less than 60 nm in the acryl-based polymer (II) is high. On the other hand, it is found that the film produced using the thermoplastic polymer composition obtained in Comparative Example 2 as shown in <figref>Fig. 2</figref> has a large dispersed particle diameter of the acryl-based polymer (II) and does not have a fine dispersed structure as in the present invention.</p>

    <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">In Examples 15 to 19, the thermoplastic polymer composition (A-1), (A-5), or (A-6) obtained in Example 1, 5, or 6 was used as an intermediate layer, while in Comparative Examples 5 to 7, TPU, TPAE, or TPEE was used as an intermediate layer, so as to prepare a trilayer film provided with the top layer and the bottom layer shown in Table 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">For the production of a trilayer film, the material of the intermediate layer in Table 5 was inserted between the materials of the top and bottom layers shown in Table 5 (overlapped area: 10 mm x 10 mm), pre-heated at 150Â°C for 4.5 minutes, and then compressed at a pressure of 2 MPa for 30 seconds.</p>
    <p id="p-00195-en" num="0195">Further, the top layer and the bottom layer are positioned for the sake of convenience in such a manner, and even the reverse position of the top and bottom layers also leads to a trilayer film.</p>
