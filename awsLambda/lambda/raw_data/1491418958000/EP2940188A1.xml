    <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a trivalent chromium corrosion resistant chemical conversion treatment coating film from which hexavalent chromium is not substantially eluted, the coating film being formed on zinc plating or zinc alloy plating, and a trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment solution and a post-treatment solution after chemical conversion treatment used to form such a chemical conversion treatment coating film.</p>

      <u>BACKGROUND ART</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">A method using zinc plating has been relatively widely employed as a method for inhibiting corrosion of the surface of a metal. However, the plating by itself does not provide a sufficient corrosion resistance, and thus a chromate treatment using hexavalent chromium after plating has been widely employed in industry. However, it has been pointed out in recent years that hexavalent chromium harms human bodies and the environment, and, as a result, the use of hexavalent chromium has been regulated.</p>
    <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In this connection, a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film using trivalent chromium has been developed as an alternative technology to a coating film formed with hexavalent chromium, and has started to be used. For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. <patcit id="pcit-00001" dnum="JP2000509434A"><text>2000-509434</text></patcit> discloses a treatment method in which 5 to 100 g/L of trivalent chromium, nitrate, an organic acid and a salt of a metal such as cobalt are used. This method is to obtain a good corrosion resistance by carrying out the treatment at an elevated temperature in high concentration of chromium to form a thick trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film. However, the method has disadvantage in wastewater treatment, because the concentration of chromium and the concentration of the organic acid in the treatment bath are high.</p>

      <u>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</u>
    </heading>
    <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In addition, it has been found out that there is a problem that, when such a conventional hexavalent chromium-free trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment coating film is left for a long period in a natural environment, trivalent chromium in the coating film is oxidized, and harmful hexavalent chromium is detected in the coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a trivalent chromium corrosion resistant chemical conversion treatment coating film being formed on zinc or zinc-based alloy plating, and having a corrosion resistance equal to or more than a conventional coating film with a low chromium content. Moreover, in consideration of effect on human bodies and the environment, hexavalent chromium is not substantially detected in the coating film even after the coating film is left. In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide a trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment solution and a post-treatment solution used after chemical conversion treatment, the treatment solution and the post-treatment solution being capable of forming such a chemical conversion treatment coating film.</p>
    <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present inventors have made a thorough examination and found that a chemical conversion coating film that has a high corrosion resistance and from which hexavalent chromium is substantially not eluted even after the coating film is left can be obtained from a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film having low trivalent chromium concentration if the coating film itself is provided with a function of suppressing oxidation from trivalent chromium in the coating film to hexavalent chromium. In addition, the present inventors also found that such a chemical conversion coating film can be obtained by using a chemical conversion treatment liquid having a specific composition.</p>
    <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Accordingly, the present invention is a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film formed on a surface of zinc or zinc alloy plating characterized in that a corrosion resistance (a time required for the formation of white rust) in a salt spray test is 96 hours or more, a concentration of hexavalent chromium in terms of metal atoms in the chemical conversion coating film is less than 0.01 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and an amount of hexavalent chromium eluted from the coating film left for 30 days in a constant temperature and humidity chamber at a temperature of 80Â°C and at a humidity of 95% (an amount eluted by immersion of the coating film into hot water at a temperature of 100Â°C for 10 minutes) is less than 0.05 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">A preferred aspect of the present invention is the above-descried trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film, in which a concentration of trivalent chromium in terms of metal atoms in the chemical conversion coating film is 2 to 20 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In addition, the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film, in which a cobalt concentration in the chemical conversion coating film is 0.2 to 3.5 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>, is an aspect of the present invention. In this aspect, a preferable cobalt concentration is 0.3 to 3 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Furthermore, the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film, in which a cobalt concentration in the chemical conversion coating film is less than 0.2 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>, is an aspect of the present invention. In this aspect, a preferable cobalt concentration is 0 to 0.17 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The reason why the chemical conversion coating film that have a high corrosion resistance and from which hexavalent chromium is substantially not eluted even after the coating film is left can be obtained by providing the coating film itself with a function of suppressing oxidation from trivalent chromium in the coating film to hexavalent chromium is not clear. However, through the investigation in the present invention, the present inventors assume that the reason is as follows. Specifically, it is assumed that detection of hexavalent chromium from a generally used trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film which is being left is caused because Co<sup>3+</sup> in the chemical conversion coating film acts as an oxidizing agent to oxidize trivalent chromium.</p>
    <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Formation of a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film and an assumed generation mechanism of Cr<sup>6+</sup> by action of Co<sup>3+</sup> will be described below. <ol><li>(i) Zinc is dissolved in an acidic treatment liquid, and electrons are released. ââââââââ Zn â Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup></li><li>(ii) Hydrogen ions are consumed at the interface between the zinc and the treatment liquid, and the pH of the treatment liquid rises. ââââââââ 2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>-</sup> â H<sub>2</sub>â</li><li>(iii) Chromium hydroxide is generated by the rise of pH of the treatment liquid. ââââââââ 2Cr<sup>3+</sup> + 6 (OH<sup>-</sup>) â 2Cr(OH)<sub>3</sub>â</li><li>(iv) Also from Co<sup>2+</sup> that is used for improving the corrosion resistance in the treatment liquid, cobalt(II) hydroxide is generated in the vicinity of the interface with the zinc with the rise of pH. However, Co<sup>2+</sup> is converted to stable Co<sup>3+</sup> with time, because Co<sup>2+</sup> is unstable on the alkaline side. ââââââââ Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> â Co(OH)<sub>3</sub></li><li>(v) Other insoluble substances (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and a small amount of the treatment liquid are also adsorbed and impregnated to be taken into the coating film, with gelation and deposition of chromium hydroxide and cobalt hydroxide (Co<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>3+</sup>).</li><li>(vi) The coating film is hardened in drying processes by deposition, dewatering of adsorbed substances and solidification. However, the coating film is not hardened when the drying is insufficient, and it is expected that chemical reactions will proceed in the coating film.</li><li>(vii) Since the chemical conversion coating film containing the treatment liquid is in a slightly acidic atmosphere, cobalt (III) hydroxide in the coating film is gradually liberated and dissolved, and Co<sup>3+</sup> is converted to Co<sup>2+</sup> that is stable in an acidic condition. In addition, it is considered that chromium hydroxide is also liberated and dissolved to cause the following reactions. ââââââââ 3Co<sup>3+</sup> + 3e<sup>-</sup> â 3Co<sup>2+</sup> ââââââââ Cr<sup>3+</sup> â Cr<sup>6+</sup> + 3e<sup>-</sup></li></ol></p>
    <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Combination of these formulae gives the following. ââââââââ Cr<sup>3+</sup> + 3Co<sup>3+</sup> â Cr<sup>6+</sup> + 3Co<sup>2+</sup></p>
    <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In short, it is considered that trivalent cobalt in the coating film oxidizes trivalent chromium to generate hexavalent chromium.</p>
    <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Meanwhile, it is considered that, even when Co<sup>3+</sup> is not contained or even when the coating film is formed from a chemical conversion treatment liquid having a strong oxidizing effect caused by a combination of chloric acid-nitric acid, or the like, hexavalent chromium is generated. Therefore, it is assumed that reduction of nitrate ion concentration in the treatment liquid is also helps to suppress the generation of hexavalent chromium. It is considered that, in a chemical conversion coating film containing a manganese compound such as manganese dioxide, and in a chemical conversion coating film containing, in the coating film, a large amount of ions of an element other than Co whose valence can vary, hexavalent chromium is generated by oxidation of trivalent chromium in a similar manner.</p>
    <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In addition, the present invention is achieved on the basis of the following discovery. Specifically, by adding a hexavalent chromium generation suppressing agent having an effect of suppressing hexavalent chromium generation to any one of a trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment liquid, washing water for a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film and a finishing liquid therefor, hexavalent chromium which is otherwise generated in the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film can be suppressed, and an amount of hexavalent chromium eluted from the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film (an amount eluted when the coating film is immersed in a hot water at a temperature of 100Â°C for 10 minutes) can be less than 0.05 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup> even after the coating film is left.</p>
    <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Therefore, the present invention provides a chemical conversion treatment liquid for forming, on zinc or zinc alloy plating, a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film from which hexavalent chromium is substantially not eluted even after the coating film is left. The chemical conversion treatment liquid is characterized in that a content of trivalent chromium ions in the treatment liquid is 0. 002 to 0.5 mol/l, a concentration of hexavalent chromium ions is 1 ppm or less, a content of cobalt ions is 0.1 mol/l or less, a hexavalent chromium generation suppressing agent that can suppress generation of hexavalent chromium which is generated in the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film is contained in said liquid, and a pH of the chemical conversion treatment liquid is 0.5 to 5.</p>
    <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In addition, the present invention provides washing water or a finishing liquid for a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film formed on zinc or zinc alloy plating, for suppressing hexavalent chromium which is otherwise generated in the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film. The washing water or the finishing liquid is characterized by containing a hexavalent chromium generation suppressing agent that can suppress generation of hexavalent chromium which is generated in the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film at 0.1 to 10 g/l, and characterized in that a pH of the washing water or the finishing liquid is 2 to 10.</p>
    <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In addition, the present invention is achieved on the basis of the following discovery. Specifically, a trivalent chromate coating film is formed by use of a trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment liquid in which a content of cobalt ions is 250 ppm or less and a content of a sulfur compound is in the range of 100 to 1000 ppm in terms of sulfur atoms. As a result, hexavalent chromium which is otherwise generated in the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film can be suppressed, and an amount of hexavalent chromium eluted from the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film can be less than 0.05 Âµg/cm<sup>2</sup> even after the coating film is left (an amount eluted when the coating film is immersed in hot water at a temperature of 100Â°C for 10 minutes).</p>
    <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Therefore, the present invention provides a chemical conversion treatment liquid for forming a trivalent chromate coating film from which hexavalent chromium is not substantially eluted after the coating film is left, the trivalent chromate coating film being formed on zinc or zinc alloy plating. The chemical conversion treatment liquid is characterized in that a content of trivalent chromium ions in the treatment liquid is 0.002 to 0.5 mol/l, a concentration of hexavalent chromium ions is 1 ppm or less, a content of cobalt ions is 250 ppm or less, and a sulfur compound is contained in the range of 100 to 1500 ppm in terms of sulfur atoms.</p>
    <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film according to the present invention further has an excellent corrosion resistance of the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film, in addition to a corrosion resistance of zinc plating itself. In addition, the coating film obtained by forming the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film directly on zinc plating undergoes no substantial elution of hexavalent chromium after the coating film is left, has a corrosion resistance and a salt water resistance equal to or higher than those of conventional hexavalent chromate, and can be applied in various colors. In addition, in the chemical conversion treatment liquid according to the present invention that can form such a chemical conversion coating film, the trivalent chromium concentration in the treatment liquid is low, and an organic acid concentration or nitrogen concentration can also further be reduced. Therefore, the treatment liquid is advantageous in wastewater treatment and thus has excellent cost performance.</p>

    <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In the chemical conversion treatment liquid, any chromium compound containing trivalent chromium ions may be used as a source of trivalent chromium ions. For example, the sources of trivalent chromium salts such as chromium chloride, chromium sulfate, chromium nitrate, chromium phosphate or chromium acetate can be used, or, alternatively, trivalent chromium ions can be obtained by the reduction of hexavalent chromium ions of chromic acid, a dichromate, or the like with a reducing agent.

In order to find out additives that can suppress generation of hexavalent chromium, various additives are added to chemical conversion treatment liquids for forming the trivalent chromate coating film and effect of the additives is examined by experiments. As a result, organic reducing compounds such as ascorbate ions, citrate ions, tannate ions, gallate ions, tartrate ions, hydroxy(iso)quinolines, phenols and thiourea, and inorganic or metal reducing compounds such as phosphate ions, chromium phosphate ions, vanadium ions and titanium ions show the effect.

    <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Usually, a nitrogen-containing compound, mainly nitrate ions, is used in large amount in a trivalent chromium chemical conversion treatment liquid, for improving the corrosion resistance of a trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film. Consequently, the nitrogen atom concentration in the treatment liquid is high, for example 3 to 9 g/l, and there is a problem in terms of the wastewater treatment. In the chemical conversion treatment liquid according to the present invention, nitrate ions may be used in an amount similar to a conventional treatment liquid. However, even when nitrate ions are considerably decreased, and a nitrogen atom concentration, in the chemical conversion treatment liquid, mainly derived from nitrate ions is considerably reduced to 500 ppm/l or less, the trivalent chromium chemical conversion coating film that has an excellent corrosion resistance and from which elution of hexavalent chromium is suppressed when the coating film is left can be obtained from the chemical conversion treatment liquid. In the above treatment liquid, a content is specifically 500 ppm or less in terms of nitrogen atoms, should preferably be in the range of 30 to 400 ppm and should more preferably be in the range of 50 to 300 ppm, for example. A metal reducing compound is preferable as the hexavalent chromium generation suppressing agent.
