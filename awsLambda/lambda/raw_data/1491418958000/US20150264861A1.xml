    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Example embodiments generally relate to an outdoor power device that employ trimmer line and, more particularly, relate to a mechanism for providing relatively easy loading of trimmer line.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Handheld outdoor power devices such as trimmers, blowers, chainsaws, and/or the like, are often used to perform tasks relating to yard/grounds maintenance or even commercial resource harvesting activities that require them to be mobile. Although there are several options for powering such devices, including combustion engines, corded electric motors, or battery powered electric motors, each option may be viewed as having advantages in certain environments and for certain users.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Some trimming devices employ a trimmer line and are referred to as string trimmers. Alternatively, such devices may be known as edge trimmers, line trimmers, weed whips and/or the like. The trimmer line, which may be a monofilament line, is quite effective at cutting when rotated at high speed. Such a trimmer line is extended and held somewhat rigid by centrifugal forces while being rotated. In some cases, the trimmer line is wound upon a reel or spool and the trimmer line can be released by bumping the trimmer head on the ground during operation. However, it has been common for such devices to be somewhat difficult to load trimmer line into. Thus, operators may find it frustrating and/or difficult to replace the trimmer line. Accordingly, the user experience associated with employing such devices may suffer.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Some example embodiments may therefore provide a trimmer device that can accommodate a structure that is relatively quick and easy to load with trimmer line. The structure may provide a spool that is substantially fixed to prevent any substantial movement in the axial (or vertical) direction, but can move in the rotational direction responsive to operation of a power unit. As such, for example, the spool may be mated with a core that can be âbumpedâ to release line from the spool in a manner that permits the core to move in the axial (or vertical) direction, while the spool releases line but does not substantially move in the axial (or vertical direction). The structure may provide a line channel through the core that is much longer than the portion of the spool through which line is fed in the radial direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">In one example embodiment, a trimmer head for a hand-held cutting device is provided. The trimmer head may include a first housing portion, a line holding assembly to hold and selectively release trimmer line, and a second housing portion operably coupled to the first housing portion to house the line holding assembly. The line holding assembly may include a spool configured to hold the trimmer line and a core operably coupled to the spool. The line holding assembly may be configured such that rotational movement of the core causes corresponding movement of the spool, but movement of the core in an axial direction does not cause corresponding movement of the spool.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In another example embodiment, a hand-held cutting device is provided. The device may include an elongated member graspable along a portion thereof by an operator, a trimmer head disposed at one end of the elongated member and configured to be rotatable to perform a cutting function using trimmer line held at a portion of the trimmer head, and a power unit operably coupled to the trimmer head to selectively cause rotation of the trimmer head via turning a shaft. The trimmer head may include a first housing portion, a line holding assembly to hold and selectively release the trimmer line, and a second housing portion operably coupled to the first housing portion to house the line holding assembly. The line holding assembly may include a spool configured to hold the trimmer line and a core operably coupled to the spool. The line holding assembly may be configured such that rotational movement of the core causes corresponding movement of the spool, but movement of the core in an axial direction does not cause corresponding movement of the spool.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Some example embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all example embodiments are shown. Indeed, the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as being limiting as to the scope, applicability or configuration of the present disclosure. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. Furthermore, as used herein, the term âorâ is to be interpreted as a logical operator that results in true whenever one or more of its operands are true. As used herein, operable coupling should be understood to relate to direct or indirect connection that, in either case, enables functional interconnection of components that are operably coupled to each other. One of skill in the art will appreciate the normal position in which devices of example embodiments are held for operation and that the working assembly represents the front of such devices. All other directional references should be understood in this general context.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Some example embodiments described herein provide a line holding assembly that can be easily molded and assembled, and that allows an operator to quickly and easily load trimmer line onto a trimmer head. In particular, some example embodiments provide a two-piece line holding assembly in which the spool and core are separate pieces to permit easy construction. In some cases, to further increase the ease of manufacturing, even the core may be split into two pieces. The parts may then be assembled, and the resultant assembly may permit movement of the core in the axial direction (e.g., to let out more line), but may prevent movement of the spool in the axial direction. Meanwhile, the core and spool may move together for rotational movements.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Referring to the drawings, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows an electric powered trimmer <b>10</b> that may be configured in accordance with an example embodiment. However, it should be appreciated that the trimmer <b>10</b> is merely one example of an electric powered, outdoor power device that may be configured in accordance with an example embodiment. However, example embodiments could alternatively be employed in connection with corded versions of various electric powered, outdoor power devices. Moreover, in some cases, example embodiments could also be practiced in connection with combustion engines that are configured to turn an output shaft. Thus, although an example embodiment will be described hereinafter with specific reference to the battery powered trimmer <b>10</b> of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the applicability of alternative embodiments relative to other types of devices should be well understood.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">As shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the trimmer <b>10</b> may include a working implement or working assembly <b>20</b>, which in this example includes a rotatable trimmer head <b>25</b>. The working assembly <b>20</b> may further include a motor (e.g., an electric motor) disposed in a housing <b>28</b> of the working assembly <b>20</b>. However, for gas powered embodiments and for some electrically powered embodiments, the motor is often disposed remotely with respect to the trimmer head <b>25</b>, and power is transferred to the trimmer head <b>25</b> via couplings provided in the housing <b>28</b>. The motor of the trimmer <b>10</b> may be powered, according to this example, by a battery pack <b>30</b>. The battery pack <b>30</b> is received into a battery compartment of the trimmer <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated that the battery pack <b>30</b> and/or motor of this example form a power unit that can turn the working assembly <b>20</b>. However, in other examples, the power unit may include a combustion engine or other suitable power source.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The battery compartment may be a recess or cavity formed in a casing <b>40</b> of the trimmer <b>10</b> disposed at one end of an elongated member <b>45</b> that may further include the working assembly <b>20</b> at an opposite end thereof. The elongated member <b>45</b> may be a hollow tube, pipe, rod or other such member that may be straight or curved in different embodiments. The elongated member <b>45</b> may provide operable communication between the working assembly <b>20</b> and the battery pack <b>30</b> so that the battery pack <b>30</b> can power the working assembly <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the casing <b>40</b> may be formed from one or more plastic or other rigid components that may be molded to have a desired shape. The casing <b>40</b> may substantially enclose the battery compartment, control circuitry and/or other components associated with powering and/or controlling the operation of the trimmer <b>10</b>. However, it should also be appreciated that the battery pack of some alternative embodiments may be housed within a backpack that may be worn on the operator's back. In such an example, the battery pack may be connected to the trimmer <b>10</b> via a cord or other adaptor.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">In an example embodiment, the trimmer <b>10</b> may include a rear handle <b>50</b> and a front handle <b>60</b>. The rear handle <b>50</b> may be disposed in-line with the elongated member <b>45</b> proximate to the casing <b>40</b>, while the front handle <b>60</b> may be disposed between the casing <b>40</b> and the working assembly <b>20</b> at an intermediate portion of the elongated member <b>45</b>. An operator of the trimmer <b>10</b> may use one hand to hold the front handle <b>60</b> and the other hand to hold the rear handle <b>50</b> while operating the trimmer <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the rear handle <b>50</b> may include a trigger <b>52</b> or other control mechanism for engaging operation of the motor to power the working assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Although <figref>FIG. 1</figref> shows the front handle <b>60</b> being positioned forward of the rear handle <b>50</b> along the elongated member <b>45</b>, it should also be appreciated that other arrangements for holding and operating the trimmer <b>10</b> may be provided. For example, in some cases, a âhandlebarâ embodiment may be provided in which the front and rear handles <b>60</b>/<b>50</b> are replaced by a single handle assembly attached to the elongated member <b>45</b> where both handles on the handle assembly are substantially equidistant from the working assembly <b>20</b> and disposed spaced apart from the elongated member <b>45</b> on opposites sides thereof on a handlebar assembly. Other arrangements are also possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">The trimmer <b>10</b> may further employ a trim shield <b>65</b> that is configured to prevent cut materials and/or debris from coming back at the operator. The operator may actuate the trigger <b>52</b> to power the working assembly and turn the trimmer head <b>25</b>. The trimmer head <b>25</b> may include trimmer line <b>70</b> that may extend outwardly (e.g., in a radial direction relative to a shaft forming an axis about which the trimmer head <b>25</b> rotates) from the trimmer head <b>25</b> to cut vegetation encountered thereby. The trim shield <b>65</b> may employ at least one knife element (not shown) to cut the trimmer line <b>70</b> to a length slightly less than the distance from the external periphery of the trimmer head <b>25</b> to the internal periphery of the trim shield <b>65</b> responsive to rotation of the trimmer head <b>25</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In an example embodiment, the motor may be a DC motor or a brushless DC motor (BLDC) that is powered by the battery pack <b>30</b>. The motor may be configured to turn in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction when a power switch <b>72</b> is powered on. In the example of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the power switch <b>72</b> may be provided at a control panel or control assembly <b>80</b> that may be positioned proximate to the rear handle <b>50</b>. However, the control assembly <b>80</b> could be positioned at any of a number of other locations on the trimmer <b>10</b> in alternative embodiments. Moreover, it should be appreciated that gasoline powered embodiments may replace the trigger <b>52</b> with a throttle and may replace the battery pack with a gasoline engine. The general structure, however, of even such gasoline powered embodiments may generally be similar and, as indicated above, the power unit may therefore be electric or gas powered.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The rotation of the trimmer head <b>25</b> may cause the trimmer line <b>70</b> (which may be monofilament line) to stiffen extensively based on centrifugal forces applied to the trimmer line <b>70</b> during rotation. The faster the rotation, the stiffer the trimmer line <b>70</b> generally becomes. The trimmer line <b>70</b> can therefore make a good cutting tool for the cutting or trimming of most vegetation that is not substantially woody. However, it is typically inevitable that the trimmer line <b>70</b> will be worn during use. The wearing forces acting on the trimmer line <b>70</b> may cause the line to break, abrade or otherwise shorten in length over time. To re-extend the trimmer line <b>70</b> to full length, the trimmer head <b>25</b> may be âbumpedâ on the ground to release more trimmer line <b>70</b> (and cut it to length, if appropriate).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">To provide sufficient additional trimmer line <b>70</b> to allow the âbumpâ operation to release line, the trimmer head <b>25</b> may be provided with a trimmer line spool upon which extra trimmer line <b>70</b> may be wound. However, even this spool would eventually run out of trimmer line <b>70</b> over time and need replenishment. In the past, the winding of more trimmer line <b>70</b> onto the spool has required some level of disassembly of the trimmer head <b>25</b>. This disassembly and winding of trimmer line <b>70</b> can be cumbersome, and may be difficult to accomplish in a quick and easy manner. Accordingly, some example embodiments have been provided to improve the capability of the operator to easily and quickly replenish trimmer line <b>70</b> onto the trimmer head <b>25</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, which includes <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the trimmer head <b>25</b> of an example embodiment from above (<figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) and below (<figref>FIG. 2B</figref>) perspectives. <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, which includes <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, illustrates a side view and cross section view of the trimmer head <b>25</b> of an example embodiment. The orientation of the trimmer head <b>25</b> in <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> is such that the observer is looking into a line channel <b>90</b> through which trimmer line is passed prior to being wound onto a spool <b>130</b> of the device. <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, which includes <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, illustrates cross section views taking along a line that bisects the line channel <b>90</b>. <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows the trimmer head <b>25</b> in a normal position and <figref>FIG. 4B</figref> shows the trimmer head <b>25</b> in a âbumpedâ condition. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the spool <b>130</b> in accordance with an example embodiment, and <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a core <b>140</b> in accordance with an example embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">As shown in <figref>FIGS. 2-6</figref>, the trimmer head <b>25</b> may include a first housing portion <b>100</b>, a line holding assembly <b>110</b> to hold and selectively release trimmer line (not shown in <figref>FIG. 2-6</figref>), and a second housing portion <b>120</b>. The second housing portion <b>120</b> may be operably coupled to the first housing portion <b>100</b> to house the line holding assembly <b>110</b>. In an example embodiment, the first and second housing portions <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> may be snap fit together, fastened with one or more screws or other fastening members, and/or latched together. In the example of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the first housing portion <b>100</b> may include tabs <b>102</b> that snap fit into corresponding tab receivers <b>122</b> of the second housing portion <b>120</b>. Generally speaking, the first housing portion <b>100</b> may be disposed on top of the second housing portion <b>120</b>, which may be disposed on the bottom of the assembly. The terms top and bottom in this context are relative to the normal way the trimmer <b>10</b> is held with the bottom being closest to the ground.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The line holding assembly may include the spool <b>130</b> configured to hold the trimmer line and the core <b>140</b> operably coupled to the spool <b>130</b> such that rotational movement of the core <b>140</b> causes corresponding movement of the spool <b>130</b>, but movement of the core in an axial direction (indicated by arrow <b>124</b>) does not cause corresponding movement of the spool <b>130</b>. The first housing <b>100</b> may include a coupling portion <b>104</b> that may be operably coupled to a shaft that is turned by the power unit. However, in some embodiments, the shaft may be operably coupled to the core <b>140</b>. In either case, the power unit may ultimately cause the core <b>140</b> to turn and, relative to rotational movement, the core <b>140</b> may then turn the spool <b>130</b> as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">A biasing element (e.g., spring <b>150</b>) may be provided between the first housing portion <b>100</b> and the core <b>140</b> to bias the core <b>140</b> downward in the axial direction. When a âbumpâ operation is conducted by tapping the core <b>140</b> on the ground, the core <b>140</b> may move upward against the force of the spring <b>150</b> to enable the centrifugal force on the trimmer line during the rotation of the spool <b>130</b> relative to the second housing portion <b>120</b> to cause the spool <b>130</b> to release trimmer line. In particular, the second housing portion <b>120</b> may include one or more detents <b>126</b> that may lie in registration with one or more corresponding slide projections <b>142</b> on the core <b>140</b>. Meanwhile, the first housing portion <b>100</b> may include similar detents <b>106</b> that may lie in registration with slide projections <b>143</b> disposed facing upwardly from the external periphery of the core <b>140</b>. However, it should be appreciated that in alternative structures, the locations of the detents (<b>106</b> and <b>126</b>) and slide projections (<b>142</b> and <b>143</b>) could be reversed. The slide projections <b>142</b> may typically engage the detents <b>126</b> to prevent movement of the core <b>140</b> relative to the second housing portion <b>120</b> while the spring <b>150</b> pushes the slide projections <b>142</b> and the detents <b>126</b> into contact with each other. When the operator taps the core <b>140</b> on the ground, the force of the spring <b>150</b> may be overcome momentarily to enable the slide projections <b>142</b> to disengage the detents <b>126</b> and rotate the core <b>140</b> (and spool <b>130</b>) relative to the second housing portion <b>120</b> to allow trimmer line to be released from the spool <b>130</b> through orifices <b>128</b> on the second housing portion <b>120</b>. Meanwhile, the slide projections <b>143</b> may catch the next set of detents <b>106</b> to limit the amount of relative motion between the housings and the core <b>140</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As can be seen in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, the first housing portion <b>100</b> may include spool stays <b>105</b> disposed above the spool <b>130</b>. Similarly, the second housing portion <b>120</b> may include spool stays <b>125</b> to combine with the spool stays <b>105</b> on the first housing portion <b>100</b> to limit movement of the spool <b>130</b> in the axial direction. Meanwhile, the core <b>140</b> may fit inside the spool <b>130</b> and have room to move in the axial direction within a core channel <b>155</b> that is shown to have room at the top to accommodate upward movement of the core <b>140</b> in the axial direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Referring specifically to <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the line channel <b>90</b> may extend through the core <b>140</b> in a radial direction to receive the trimmer line fed therethrough. Although it should be appreciated that in some embodiments, the line channel <b>90</b> may be part of the spool <b>130</b>. Regardless, in some cases, the line channel <b>90</b> may include at least one bend along a length thereof The bend may extend in the axial direction away from the spring <b>150</b>. In some cases, the line channel <b>90</b> may have a same width in the axial direction over an entirety of the line channel <b>90</b>. However, in some embodiments, the line channel <b>90</b> has a first width in the axial direction over a mid portion of the line channel <b>90</b>, and the line channel may expand to a second width in the axial direction proximate to each of the opposing ends of the line channel <b>90</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the core <b>140</b> may have additional hollow channels <b>144</b> that serve to reduce the overall weight of the core <b>140</b>. When the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> is âbumpedâ, the core channel <b>155</b> enables the core <b>140</b> to move upward to reduce the free volume at the top of the core channel <b>155</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In some embodiments, the spool <b>130</b> may include a first flange <b>132</b> and a second flange <b>134</b> that extend in respective planes that are substantially parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the axial direction. The trimmer line extending out from opposing ends of the line channel <b>90</b> may be fed through channel portions <b>136</b> disposed to pass through the spool <b>130</b> in the radial direction. The channel portions <b>136</b> may terminate at the internal periphery of the spool <b>130</b> at respective line orifices <b>188</b>. The line orifices <b>188</b> may be aligned in registration with the ends of the line channel <b>90</b>. Trimmer line fed through the line channel <b>90</b>, the line orifices <b>188</b> and the channel portions <b>136</b> may then be wound onto the spool between the first and second flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> responsive to rotation of the core <b>140</b> about the axis of the core by the operator. For example, the core <b>140</b> may have grip portions to allow the operator to grasp the grip portions and manually turn the core <b>140</b> (and therefore also turn the spool <b>130</b>) to wind trimmer line onto the spool <b>130</b>. The spool <b>130</b> of some embodiments may also include a third flange <b>138</b> disposed between the first and second flanges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> to divide the spool <b>130</b> into a top line receiving portion and a bottom line receiving portion. In such an example, the top line receiving portion may receive the trimmer line exiting one end of the line channel <b>90</b> and the bottom line receiving portion may receive trimmer line exiting the other end of the line channel <b>90</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">As mentioned above, the core <b>140</b> may be movable in the axial direction to release trimmer line from the spool <b>130</b>, but the spool <b>130</b> does not substantially move in the axial direction when the core <b>140</b> moves in the axial direction. Thus, although the spool <b>130</b> is affixed to the core <b>140</b> to move in registration therewith responsive to rotational movement of the core <b>140</b>, the spool <b>130</b> is enabled to slide over the surface of the core <b>140</b> when the core <b>140</b> moves in the axial direction. The channel portions <b>136</b> of the spool <b>130</b> that are proximate to the ends of the line channel <b>90</b> (i.e., at location of the line orifices <b>188</b>) may be wider to ensure that some portion of the channel portions <b>136</b> stays in alignment with the line channel <b>90</b> even when the core <b>140</b> moves axially (e.g., responsive to a bump operation).</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">To maintain the spool <b>130</b> and core <b>140</b> in registration with each other for rotational movement, while still permitting relative motion between the two in the axial direction, the spool <b>130</b> may be annularly shaped to define an inner periphery that is slightly larger than the external periphery of the core <b>140</b> (which may be generally cylindrical in shape at the area of overlap with the spool <b>130</b>). The spool <b>130</b> may therefore slidably engage the outer periphery of a portion of the core <b>140</b> to permit relative movement of the core <b>140</b> in the axial direction. However, it should be appreciated that the spool <b>130</b> and the core <b>140</b> could alternatively have other shapes that are substantially matched to permit slidable engagement in the axial direction. For example, hexagonal, octagonal or other shapes may be employed. In an example embodiment, the inner periphery of the spool <b>130</b> may be provided with a vertical protrusion <b>180</b>. Meanwhile, the external periphery of the core <b>140</b> may be provided with a vertical channel <b>185</b> that is slightly larger in size (but substantially similarly shaped) compared to the vertical protrusion <b>180</b>. When the core <b>140</b> is bumped to move in the axial direction, the vertical protrusion <b>180</b> may be configured to ride in the vertical channel <b>185</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In some embodiments, a length of the line channel LC may be longer than a combined length of extension of the channel portions <b>136</b> on each respective opposing side of the spool. Thus, the length of each channel portion <b>136</b> may be a length CP and LC may be greater than 2ÃCP.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In some embodiments, the core <b>140</b>, the spool <b>130</b>, and/or the first and second housing portions <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> may be made of hard plastic or some other rigid material. Thus, in some cases, the core <b>140</b>, the spool <b>130</b>, and/or the first and second housing portions <b>100</b> and <b>120</b> may be molded components. However, to facilitate easier formation of the line channel <b>90</b>, the core may sometimes be formed in two parts. Thus, for example, a core base <b>190</b> may be molded as one piece and a core insert <b>195</b> may be separately molded to fit into the core base <b>190</b> to define the line channel <b>90</b>. In particular, the core insert <b>195</b> may form top portion of the line channel <b>90</b> and may be separable from the core base <b>190</b>, which may form the bottom portion of the line channel <b>90</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">The specific structures shown in <figref>FIGS. 2-6</figref> illustrate one example embodiment. However, other specific structures may be used to embody the same inventive concepts. In this regard, <figref>FIGS. 7-12</figref> illustrate an alternative core and/or spool structure that could be employed in some embodiments. As such, the example of <figref>FIGS. 7-12</figref> represents an alternative line holding assembly <b>110</b>â². <figref>FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> represent exploded perspective views of the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² from opposing perspectives and <figref>FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an exploded side view of the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â². <figref>FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a perspective view of the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² in an assembled state, and <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate an assembled state, side view and cross section view, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² may generally be inserted into the first housing portion <b>100</b> and second housing portion <b>120</b> described above, and the operation of the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² may be substantially similar to the operations described above. However, the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² of this example may include a two-piece core <b>140</b>â². If desired, the line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² may employ a spool <b>130</b>â² having only two flanges (and therefore only one line receiving portion). The spool <b>130</b>â² may still include a line orifice <b>188</b>â² formed in a vertical protrusion <b>180</b>â² on the internal periphery of the spool <b>130</b>â² Moreover, the vertical protrusion <b>180</b>â² may be configured to ride in a vertical channel <b>185</b>â² on a portion of the core <b>140</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The line holding assembly <b>110</b>â² may also include a line channel <b>90</b>â². However, the line channel <b>90</b>â² may be formed by a top part (i.e., core insert <b>195</b>â²) that defines sidewalls <b>250</b> and a top for the line channel <b>90</b>â² and a bottom part (i.e., core base <b>190</b>â²) that defines a base <b>255</b> of the line channel <b>90</b>â². The core insert <b>195</b>â² may further include protrusions <b>260</b> that may be configured to snap into corresponding receivers <b>265</b> disposed in the core base <b>190</b>â². In some cases, the external periphery of the core insert <b>195</b>â² may further include one or more stabilizer channels <b>270</b> that may be configured to mate with corresponding one or more stabilizer protrusions <b>275</b> at an internal periphery of the spool <b>130</b>â². The mating of the stabilizer channels and protrusions may prevent the spool from wobbling relative to the core <b>140</b>â².</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In accordance with an example embodiment, a hand-held cutting device is provided. The device may include an elongated member graspable along a portion thereof by an operator, a trimmer head disposed at one end of the elongated member and configured to be rotatable to perform a cutting function using trimmer line held at a portion of the trimmer head, and a power unit operably coupled to the trimmer head to selectively cause rotation of the trimmer head via turning a shaft. The trimmer head may include a first housing portion, a line holding assembly to hold and selectively release the trimmer line, and a second housing portion operably coupled to the first housing portion to house the line holding assembly. The line holding assembly may include a spool configured to hold the trimmer line and a core operably coupled to the spool. The line holding assembly may be configured such that rotational movement of the core causes corresponding movement of the spool, but movement of the core in an axial direction does not cause corresponding movement of the spool. In other words, the line holding assembly may be configured such that the spool is affixed to the core to move responsive to rotational movement of the core and the spool is enabled to slide over the surface of the core when the core moves in the axial direction. Some example embodiments may allow loading of trimmer line without opening the trimmer head in a simple and fast manner. Still example embodiments may generally not require a significant increase in part count, and may be useable regardless of the direction of rotation of the trimmer head (or even for dual direction trimmer heads). Example embodiments may be useful for holding line of different diameters and prevent axial movement of the spool (and the trimmer line) relative to the eyelets (i.e., orifices <b>128</b> on the second housing portion <b>120</b>) on the trimmer head when a bump operation occurs or during reloading. Thus, the line may be less likely to be caught between the spool and the eyelet, and the line is also less likely to end up on the wrong side of a middle flange of the spool.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The device or trimmer head of some embodiments may include additional features that may be optionally added. For example, in some embodiments, (1) the first housing portion is operably coupled to the shaft and turns responsive to operation of the power unit. In an example embodiment, (2) the core comprises a line channel extending through the core in a radial direction to receive the trimmer line fed therethrough. In some embodiments, (3) the spool comprises a first flange and a second flange that extend in respective planes that are substantially parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the axial direction, and wherein the trimmer line extends out from opposing ends of the line channel and through channel portions in the spool to be wound onto the spool between the first and second flanges responsive to rotation of the core about the axial direction by the operator. In some cases, (4) the spool comprises a third flange disposed between the first and second flanges to divide the spool into a top line receiving portion and a bottom line receiving portion, and wherein the top line receiving portion receives trimmer line exiting one end of the line channel and the bottom line receiving portion receives trimmer line exiting the other end of the line channel. In an exemplary embodiment, (5) the line channel has a first width in the axial direction over a mid portion of the line channel, and wherein the line channel expands to a second width in the axial direction proximate to each of the opposing ends of the line channel. In some embodiments, (6) the line channel has a same width in the axial direction over an entirety of the line channel. In some examples, (7) the core is movable in the axial direction to release trimmer line from the spool, but the spool does not substantially move in the axial direction responsive to movement of the core in the axial direction. In some cases, (8) the spool is annularly shaped defining an inner periphery that slidably engages an outer periphery of a portion of the core relative to movement of the core in the axial direction. In an example embodiment, (9) the inner periphery of the spool comprises a vertical protrusion configured to ride in a corresponding vertical channel formed at the outer periphery of the core.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In some embodiments, any or all of (1) to (9) may be employed in addition to the optional modifications or augmentations described below. For example, in some embodiments, ends of the line channel are aligned with a line orifice on each respective opposing side of the spool. Alternatively or additionally, a length of the line channel is longer than a combined length of extension of the line orifice on each respective opposing side of the spool. Alternatively or additionally, the core comprises a top portion forming a top of the line channel and a separable bottom portion forming a bottom of the line channel. Alternatively or additionally, the device is a trimmer or edger. Alternatively or additionally, the power unit comprises an electric motor or a gasoline engine. Alternatively or additionally, the line channel includes at least one bend along a length thereof, the bend extending in the axial direction.</p>
