      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">A biosensor is an analytical device that employs biological elements such as enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, and microorganisms for their specific biological interactions with target items. For detection, various methods such as colorimetric detection, fluorescent detection, and electrochemical detection have been used. Colorimetric detection is the easiest and the most convenient method because detection can be done using the naked eye. Biosensors offer advantages as alternatives to conventional analytical methods because of their inherent specificity, simplicity, and quick response.</p>

      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">Discussion:</heading>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for biosensors that include a material, such as polydiacetylene (PDA) material, where the material is used for detection of a microbe or microbial product present in a fluid present in the container. Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for biosensors that include a material such as PDA material, where the material is used for detection of a microbe or microbial product present in a fluid present in the container. In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides for containers, or structures used in conjunction with the containers, that include a PDA material, where the PDA material is used for detection of a microbe or microbial product present in a fluid present in the container. In an embodiment, a change of PDA color (e.g., blue to red) indicates detection of the microbe or microbial product in the fluid within the container. In an embodiment, the PDA material can be selected and/or the container or structure designed so that only certain types of microbes can be detected or so that a plurality of types of microbes is detected.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0044">Although many of the embodiments refer to PDA, other chemicals can be used that undergo a color change upon interaction with a microbe or microbe products. Also, many embodiments refer to a container, but those descriptions can refer to biosensors, and are not limited to containers. A portion of the discussion describes containers and PDA materials, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to either containers or PDA materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0045">PDA materials can be used since a color change occurs when the PDA monomers crosslink. In particular, the PDA monomers appear as an intense blue color owing to their conjugated ene-yne framework, and upon interaction with the microbe or microbial product, a conformational transition occurs in the conjugated polymer backbone leading to intense blue-red color changes. This color change can be used to as an indicator of the presence of the microbe or microbial product. In particular, the color change is caused by external structural perturbations, such as binding of amphiphilic and bacterial membrane associated hydrophobic molecules causes conformational transitions in the conjugated polymer backbone.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0046">In an embodiment, the container or structure has a PDA material incorporated therein or disposed on a surface of the container or structure. The container and structure can be made of the same material or of different materials. In an embodiment, a packaging or other monomer and a PDA material (e.g., diacetylene monomer) can be mixed and polymerized prior to formation of the container or structure. In an embodiment, formation of the container or structure includes curing and molding the material into a desired shape. A desired shape for a container can include a container bottle or other type of container as well as caps or nozzles that can be disposed on the container body, while shapes of the structure are described in more detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0047">The following describes methods of preparing various embodiments of the present disclosure. In preparing the materials having a PDA material incorporated therein, diacetylene monomers and packaging or other monomers can be mixed in organic solvent/s, aqueous solutions, or mixtures. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: solvent type, ratio between the monomers, and addition of additives required for plastic properties. The diacetylene monomers and packaging or other monomers can then be polymerized. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: separate polymerization of components/simultaneous polymerization; degree of polymerization; and polymerization before/after molding. In an embodiment, the polymerization of the PDA material can be controlled using UV light at about 254 nm. In an embodiment, the PDA material and packaging or other polymers can then be molded to the desired shape/structure and curing/annealing. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: duration of curing; temperature; and post-curing polymerization steps (See Example 7).</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0048">In an embodiment, the material used to form the container or structure can also include hydrolyzed silica or metallic nano/microparticles such as gold, silver, copper or inorganic nano/microparticles such as zinc oxide, titanium oxide (See Example 7). In an embodiment, a packaging or other monomer, a diacetylene monomer, and a silica precursor or micro/nanoparticle, are mixed prior to formation of the packaging material. In an embodiment, the silica precursors can include, but are not limited to, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS), methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS), diethoxydimethylsilane (DEMS), vinylotriethoxysilane (VTES), and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the silica can be included to produce a rough surface, which can enhance adhesion of the microbe to the surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0049">In an embodiment, diacetylene monomers are mixed with silica precursors. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: ratios among components; type of silica precursors; and nature of solvents. Packaging monomers are then dissolved in appropriate solvents. Parameters to be modulated are polymer preparation protocols. The two monomer solutions can then be mixed. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: timing of reagent addition and mixing; temperature; and ratios. The mixture can then be molded to desired shapes and structures, and cured and polymerized. In an embodiment, the following variables can be modulated: the order of the two processes; and duration. In some embodiments, a mixed assembly is created through thin film techniques (e.g., dip-coating, layer-by-layer, nano/micro imprinting, ink-jet printing, lithography or spin coating (See Example 7)).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0050">In an embodiment, a packaging or other polymeric material is made using a process comprising the steps of: 1) mixing a diacetylene monomer with a silica precursor (first solution), 2) mixing the first solution with a packaging or other monomer to form a second solution, and 3) polymerizing the second solution. In another embodiment, a packaging or other polymeric material is made using a process comprising the steps of: 1) mixing a diacetylene monomer, a silica precursor and a packaging or other monomer, and 2) polymerizing the mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0051">In an embodiment where the PDA material (e.g., PDA monomer or unpolymerized PDA) is included into the manufacturing process of the container, the container can be sterilized without affecting the PDA material. After sterilization, the PDA monomer can be flash polymerized using a high intensity laser to activate the PDA material.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0052">In an embodiment, the polymerization time of the PDA monomer can be controlled to optimize the colorimetric response of the PDA material. Optimization of the PDA monomer can be conducted using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The absorbance values at 530 and 650 nm can be recorded on an interval (e.g., about 5 seconds). The earliest time point at which the ratio reaches a stable value was determined as the optimized polymerization time.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0053">Having described some embodiments for making the container and structure, focus is now directed towards to details regarding the PDA material. In an embodiment, the PDA material can be disposed on the entire container or structure, or any portion of a container or structure. In one embodiment, the PDA material can be disposed on one side of container or structure that contacts the fluid in the container, a neck or lip portion of the container, and the like. In one embodiment, a PDA material is coated onto the neck or lip portion of the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0054">In an embodiment, the PDA material can be disposed via multiple appropriate techniques including, but not limited to, dip coating, aerosol coating, coating with monolayers prepared at the air/water interface, nano/micro imprinting technology, ink-jet printing, lithography technology methods, and the like (See Example 7). In an embodiment, disposing can include the application of a single layer of PDA material, multiple layers of PDA materials (identical or different types of PDA materials), or multiple layers of PDA material and other materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0055">In an embodiment, a container or structure is coated with a PDA material includes 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid, tetraethyl orthosilicate, nitric acid, and water. The mole ratios of the 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid, tetraethyl orthosilicate, nitric acid, and water can be approximately 1:9:312:0.13:0.05, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0056">In an embodiment, the structure may be attached to the container or can be added to or within the container. In an embodiment, the structure can be a polygonal object, a flat disk, a filter, a spherical object, a spherical porous sphere containing PDA vesicles or micelles, or multiple PDA spheres sensitive to different pathogens where the PDA material is disposed on the surface of the structure so that fluid of the container can be exposed to the microbe or microbial products. In an embodiment, the structure has a roughened surface or the structure does not have a smooth surface, where the non-smooth surface may increase adherence of the microbe or microbial product to the structure. In an embodiment, the structure can vary in size from the mm range to cm range. In regard to multiple PDA spheres sensitive to different pathogens, it is advantageous that certain types of PDA materials are more or less sensitive to certain microbes.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0057">In an embodiment, the structure can be made of a material such as glass, a nitrocellulose membrane, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate, a cellulose acetate substrate, and polyurethane where the PDA material is disposed on the surface of the structure.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0058">In an embodiment, the structure can be porous so that the PDA material and fluid can interact with one another. For example, the porous structure can be impregnated with the PDA material and/or the PDA material can be disposed within the pores of the porous material. In an embodiment, the porous structure can be made of a material such as agar, cellulose acetate, a solgol, polyurethane and a combination thereof. In embodiment, the structure can be a porous, opaque substrate so that the color change may be more readily observable. In an embodiment, the porous, opaque substrate can be made of a nitrocellulose membrane.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0059">In a particular embodiment, a PDA-based ball-like structure can be inserted into the container with the fluid. In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure can respond to the existence of the microbe or microbial product by changing color. In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure includes a PDA material and is physically large enough so as to not squeeze through the opening of the container where the fluid is dispersed. In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure can include a filter-type interface having a pore size small enough to capture microbes (e.g., which may bring the microbe in close proximity with the PDA material, thereby amplifying the effective concentration of the microbe in the vicinity of the PDA material, leading to color change). In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure can also be created from a perforated material that can either increase the effective surface area of the ball-like structure and/or allow for trapping microbes that diffuse to the area of the ball-like structure through simple diffusion. In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure could be made of any of the material described herein, and in particular, can be made of a plastic or polymeric material (perforated or not) and the PDA material can be attached to its surface with proper surface functionalization.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0060">In an embodiment, the PDA-based ball-like structure could report the detection of microbe or microbial products through a color change, through a fluorescence signal, through an electric signal, and/or a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag that is implanted in it. If a color change is sought after, the contrast can be made twice as high if one hemisphere of the PDA-based ball-like structure is covered by an optically reflective surface. In this way a ray of light would travel through the PDA-based ball-like structure twice before reaching the eye of an observer, thereby increasing the contrast by two fold. In another embodiment, the same could be made for an arbitrary coverage of the ball by reflective covers, either continuous or randomly located throughout the PDA-based ball-like structure surface.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0061">In an embodiment, the PDA material can be encapsulated in a gel/hydrogel form (e.g., agarose) and then encapsulated within a thin membrane or film that covers it to render a ball-like structure, or covered by a filter-type interface. In another embodiment, the PDA material could be bound (e.g., covalent bond, ionic bond, electrostatic bond, and the like) to a plastic surface, thereby reducing the chance of PDA material leaking to the container.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0062">In an embodiment, a filter having a certain size pore specific for one or more types of microbes could be used to filter microbes from the fluid in the container (See, <figref>FIG. 7</figref>). In an embodiment, a filter of approximately 0.2 Î¼m could be used to filter microbes (e.g., bacterial cells are 0.2-5 Î¼m in size) from the fluid in the container. In this regard, a 0.2 Î¼m filter (which resembles a mesh) (or a similar filter having a different pore size for other microbes) can be coated with a thin layer of PDA material, a PDA-absorbed gel, or individual PDA materials, embedded PDA vesicles or micelles such that the filter is still acting as a filter and thereby capable of capturing microbes such as bacteria on its surface. Upon capturing of bacteria by the filter, the PDA material is effectively seeing a much higher concentration of bacteria in its vicinity than otherwise represented by the concentration of microbe in the fluid, which can amplify the PDA material signal. In an embodiment, the filter can be positioned along the internal walls, at the bottom of a container, or at the top of the container near the opening. In another embodiment, the PDA material can be disposed within a gel and the filter is positioned adjacent to or around the PDA-gel (See <figref>FIG. 4</figref>). In an embodiment, sol-gel/PDA films can also be prepared at the air/water interface, i.e. using the Langmuir method and/or a method generally shown in the schematics of <figref>FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. These sol-gel/PDA films are then transferred onto the packaging or other substrate. Polymerization can be carried out prior to film transfer or after.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0063">In another embodiment, the PDA material is attached to the output of a microfluidic device within the container that filters and segregates bacteria to the PDA material. Segregation can be size-basedâleading to a concentration of bacterial cells at the filter matrix and a subsequent induction of color change in the filter-associated PDA material. In an embodiment, the microfluidic device could employ a combination of channels within the container at decreasing widths to accommodate bacteria at all sizes at the beginning and as the liquid flows through, bacteria would get trapped in the channels depending on their size. In an embodiment, the PDA material can be coated at one or more positions along the channel so that the bacteria can interact with the PDA material.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0064">In an embodiment, the PDA material is naturally fluorescent in visible colors upon activation by the microbe or microbial products. In an embodiment, the PDA material can be visualized using a light source (as part of the container, e.g., in the container cap) that would excite the fluorescent PDA as needed. In this embodiment, a light source of low weight and dimension (e.g., LED, laser diode etc.) is powered by a small power source (e.g., any battery, flat battery, or paper-based battery), which may be trigged upon manual or automatic switch (e.g., squeezing the cap). The light is directed towards the PDA-containing object, and the fluorescent light from the PDA, if any, is seen by the observer.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0065">In an embodiment, the container can include one or more sub-compartments that are separate from the main compartment of the container. In an embodiment, the sub-compartments can be located on the sides of the container or bottom of the container. The PDA material or structure including the PDA material can be included in the sub-compartment. In an embodiment, the fluid in the main compartment of the container can come into contact with the PDA material upon an event such as removal of a seal, opening of the cap of the container, or removal of a tab, so that the PDA material comes into contact once the seal is broken or the cap is turned past a certain point. In an embodiment, the event can cause a portion of the sub-compartment to open to the fluid in the main compartment. In an embodiment, the container may need to be shaken or otherwise mixed to ensure that the PDA material and the fluid come into contact with one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0066">In an embodiment, the container includes a tab that when removed exposes the fluid in the container to the PDA material (e.g., the PDA can be in a sub-compartment or the tab should separate the PDA material from the fluid). In an embodiment, the tab can be disposed on the side of the container, in the cap of the container, and the like. Once the tab is removed, the fluid (and microbes or microbial products therein) can contact the PDA material exposed by removal of the tab. In an embodiment, the PDA material and/or the substrate including the PDA material can be any of those described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0067">In an embodiment, the container includes two sub-compartments (a secondary compartment and a tertiary compartment). In an embodiment, the secondary compartment includes the PDA material, while the tertiary compartment includes a PDA activation solution. In an embodiment, the PDA activation solution is an acid, base, surfactant, organic components, micro/nano particles, gaseous components (e.g., carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide) or other material that causes the PDA material to undergo a color change. In an embodiment, there is a boundary between the secondary compartment and the tertiary compartment, where the boundary can be dissolved by the microbe or microbial product. If a microbe or microbial product is present in the fluid in the main compartment of the container, the microbe or microbial product dissolves the boundary and causes the PDA material and the activating material to come into contact with one another causing indirect, rapid color change in the PDA.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0068">Now having described the container, structure, and embodiments of ways to incorporate the PDA material into the container or structure, attention is now directed toward the specific PDA materials.

In an embodiment, the islands can be nanoparticles, as described herein. In an embodiment, the PDA layer or PDA film can have a thickness of about 1 Î¼m to 1 cm and a width and length appropriate to cover the desired area of the container (e.g., 100 Î¼m to 10 cm).</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0070">In an embodiment, the PDA nanoparticle, the PDA vesicle, and/or the PDA micelle can be attached (e.g., covalently, ionically, electrostatically, etc.) to the surface of the container and/or structure, randomly or in an ordered fashion (e.g., an array) using alternately charged polymers such as polyacrylic acid, polystyrene sulfonate, linker molecules, or a salinization inducing agent such organofunctional alkoxysilane molecules.

      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0076">In an embodiment, an agent can be bound to the PDA material and/or can be disposed adjacent the PDA material to enhance the interaction of the microbe or microbial products with the PDA material. In an embodiment, the agent can include a capturing agent, a charged material, or a combination thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0077">In an embodiment, the capturing agent can be attached to the PDA material. The capturing agent binds to the microbe. In an embodiment, the capturing agent can include: a sugar, a glycoprotein, an antibody, an aptamer, metallic nanoparticle, and a combination of mentioned agents. In an embodiment, the capturing agent is bound to the PDA material through a covalent, ionic, or electrostatic bond. In an embodiment, the capturing agent is bound to a surface of the container or substrate so that the capturing agent is adjacent (e.g., in close proximity) the PDA material, so that the microbe or microbial product can interact with the PDA material.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0078">In an embodiment, a charged material can be bound to the PDA material or can be disposed adjacent the PDA material to enhance the interaction of the microbe or microbial products with the PDA material.

The PDA that is exposed to bacteria (herein referred to as activated PDA material) is red (i.e., has high optical absorption anywhere but in the red optical regime). In an embodiment, it may be difficult to visualize dim PDA material color changes in a semi-transparent plastic as the environment background is colorful. The visual clues of the color change can be enhanced by creating contrast that is not only based on color but also based on overall intensity of light getting to the eye of the observer, i.e., red light versus no light (i.e., black), or blue light versus no light.</p>

While inactivated PDA material will look the same (blue), activated PDA material will appear dark (as the PDA will absorb anywhere but the red, and the optical dye will absorb the red). In another embodiment, an optical dye can be used with (e.g., mixed with or attached to or near the PDA material) the PDA material that absorbs in the blue regime (e.g., QSY35 by Invitrogen). Inactivated PDA material will look dark (as the PDA material will absorb anywhere but the blue, and the optical dye will absorb the blue), activated PDA material will appear normal red. For example a dye is introduced that absorbs all visible spectrum apart from deactivated PDA material such that without microbial detection a container cap head is black; with microbial detection, the container cap head is colored. A dye can also be introduced that absorbs all visible spectrum apart from activated PDA material such that without microbial detection a container cap head is colored; with microbial detection a container cap head is black.</p>

Briefly, the test was carried out to measure the colorimetric response induced in polydiacetylene (PDA) coated circular Perspex and square glass substrates under the influence of <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i>. Two distinct chemical formulations of PDA were tested using <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>incubated with growth medium and phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Five distinct concentrations (10Ì6, 10Ì5, 10Ì4, 10Ì3, 10Ì2) of each bacteria type were tested and colorimetric response was measured at regular intervals.

      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0103">The absorbance values obtained for Plate 3 at 530 nm and 640 nm after background subtraction were less than 0.1. High background noise was obtained due to <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>overgrowth (greater than 10Ì7 cells/ml) resulting in incubation solution turbidity. <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>are known to form biofilms which could also result in higher turbidity. A clear growth medium was observed at 6.5 h and turbid growth medium at 34.5 h, respectively. Moreover, PDA coated glass sensors displayed low absorbance intensities at 530 nm and 640 nm, due to the sensor design and fabrication decisions. The color intensity remained low and did not induce high absorbance even after the bacteria induced a blue to red colorimetric response. Thus, the compounding effect of the high background absorption and low signal absorbance (intensity of PDA coated glass sensors) resulted in non-significant CR values. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> represents color change values (ratios of Abs<sub>640</sub>/Abs<sub>530</sub>) measured for glass PDA sensors obtained by evaluating spectrophotometry data related to Plate 3. The figure shows that the absorbance at blue (Abs640) is decreasing while the absorbance at red (Abs530) is increasing as time progress, indicating the glass PDA sensors are changing color from blue to red.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0104">Although the CR measurement could not be performed for plate 3 the method remains valid and should work for the targeted bacteria concentrations (10Ì2Ë10Ì<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml), since the growth medium remains clear at these concentrations.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0105">In order to obtain colorimetric response for Plate 3, the color change was subjectively judged based on the digital photographs of Plate 3 taken at different time points.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0106">Based on the images the following assessment scheme was developed to manually judge the color change.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0107">If the PDA sensor did not change color (remained completely blue), 0 points were assigned to the particular sensor. A representative example is shown in <figref>FIG. 13A</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0108">If the PDA sensor displayed an intermediate blue-red (purple) color or if half the sensor area had changed color completely to red, 0.5 points were assigned to the particular sensor. A representative example is in <figref>FIG. 13B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0109">If the PDA sensor completely changed color (became red), 1 point was assigned to the particular sensor. A representative example is shown in <figref>FIG. 13C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0110">The digital photographs of glass-PDA sensors obtained before (0 hours) and after (127 hours) treatment with bacteria were used as reference standard for blue and red color.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0111">For example: Digital photograph of Plate 3 captured at 39 h is <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. Based on a careful examination of the plate it can be observed that the sensors present in the 10Ì6 cells/ml row are completely red and would be scored as 1. Sensors in rows with 10Ì4 and 10Ì5 cells/ml concentration would be scored as 0.5. The sensors in the 0 and 10Ì2 cells/ml rows would be scored at 0.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0112">This subjective estimation of color was conducted by staff scientist experienced in working with PDA sensors. The confidence level in assigning 0 and 1 points are higher than assigning 0.5 points, since it is easier to determine if the PDA sensor is completely blue or red. If all the wells in one bacteria concentration treatment group change color to red, then 8 points will be assigned to this group.</p>

Thus, the signals obtained after background subtraction were greater than 0.1 and enabled accurate calculation of CR and color change. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> represents color change values (ratios of Abs<sub>640</sub>/Abs<sub>530</sub>) measured in Perspex PDA sensors obtained by evaluating spectrophotometry data related to Plate 4. <figref>FIG. 11</figref> shows that the absorbance at blue (Abs640) is decreasing while the absorbance at red (Abs530) is increasing as time progress, indicating the Perspex PDA sensors are changing color from blue to red. From results summarized in Table 2, we can conclude that <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>induce a concentration dependent colorimetric response in Perspex PDA sensors within a time period of 35 to 73 hours. A threshold bacterial concentration of 10Ì8-10Ì<sup>9 </sup>cells/ml is required to induce colorimetric response.</p>
      <heading id="h-00015-en" level="2">Bacterial Enumeration.</heading>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0116">Two separate methods were used to calculate the bacterial concentrations at regular intervals during the experiment. Both the methods can reliably measure the bacterial concentrations from the range of 10 cell/ml to 10Ì<sup>7 </sup>cells/ml. The calibration curve for the Brewster method was obtained by plotting the growth curves of <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphyloccocus Aureus </i>for initial bacterial concentrations of 10Ì2, 10Ì3, 10Ì4, 10Ì5 and 10Ì6 cells/ml. When the bacterial concentration is higher than 10Ì7 cells/ml the calibration curve and equation are an estimate of the growth trend and the margin for error increases. The method used by Micrim labs to calculate the bacterial concentration is known as plate counting. However if the bacterial concentration is greater than 10Ì7 cells/ml the colonies grow in close proximity to each other and individual colonies cannot be identified and counted.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0117">The results obtained for bacterial counts for Plate 3 and Plate 4 from Micrim labs were always lower than the results obtained using the Brewster method (Data present in Appendix 2 and Appendix 3). The lower count obtained could be due to attrition of bacterial cells that occurs during the storage and transport of samples (at 4Â° C.) from Cirle to Micrim. The discrepancies in the bacterial counts obtained from both methods could also be attributed to the fact that samples for both methods were acquired from different test wells.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0118">It should also be noted that the bacterial counts obtained using the Brewster method provide a more conservative estimation of PDA sensor sensitivity. The results presented were all obtained using the more conservative of the bacterial enumeration methods.</p>

      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0119">The PDA sensors incubated with <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>in PBS did not change color throughout testing. Based on bacterial counts obtained from wells containing <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>in PBS we estimate that the lack of nutrients in PBS buffer did not allow the proliferation and survival of bacterial cells beyond 24 hours. The bacteria were not able to reach a threshold concentration (10Ì8Ë10Ì9 cells/ml) which is critical to induce color change in PDA sensors.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="2">PDA Sensor Response Observed Towards <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and <i>Staphyloccocus Aureus: </i></heading>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0120">In this set of experiments, we noted that the specific PDA formulations created and tested have colorimetric response to <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa</i>, but not <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>after approximately 4 days of the experiment. This is likely due to several factors, including that, <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>quickly form biofilm, whereas <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>forms biofilms very slowly. <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>is Gram-positive and research had shown that the Lipopolysaccharide, which is the complex glycolipids embedded within the membrane of Gram negative bacteria, is the major component interacting with PDA sensors. We believe that the use of a more porous material to embed the PDA to would allow for enhanced Lipopolysaccharide and biofilm interaction with the PDA. Additionally, changes to the concentration and composition of PDA will improve sensor sensitivity to <i>Staphylococcus</i>. Thus, a sensor can be designed to interact with selected microbes, or to a plurality of microbes.</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0121">Following the experiment, the <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>cultured in growth media were removed from the plates and all the plates were wrapped with parafilm and alumina foil to store in a 4Â° C. refrigerator. The plate wells containing PDA sensors were not washed with detergent, so there is still a very small portion of <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>left on the PDA sensors. After approximately 30 days, all the glass PDA sensors change color from blue to red in the plate which used to have <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>cultured with growth media. The number of <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>is hard to estimate since all the bacteria are incubated in 4Â° C. refrigerator and most of the <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>including growth media were removed. A few Perspex PDA sensors also changed color form blue to red in the plate which used to have <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>cultured with growth media. The experimental result is estimated since the glass PDA has a faster response time than Perspex PDA. Above observations were conducted with a control group, which did not demonstrate a colorimetric change when stored in the same fashion and temperature conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0122">The experimental results indicate that PDA sensors are also sensitive to <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i>. However, the response time is very slow as compared to <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>and takes up to 30 days probably because <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>does not have as much Lipopolysaccharide copies as Gram negative bacteria cell lines do.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="2">Conclusions</heading>
      <p id="p-00125-en" num="0123">Testing carried out to explore the colorimetric response of circular Perspex and square glass PDA sensors under the influence of bacteria has been completed, reviewed, and summarized. This was an exploratory test without strict acceptance criteria.</p>
      <p id="p-00126-en" num="0124">The glass PDA sensors displayed a faster response time to <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>as compared to the Perspex PDA sensors. We hypothesize that this is due to an inherent difference in the formulation of PDA used to synthesize both the sensor types. The glass PDA sensors were fabricated using a blend of PDA monomers and silica which is conducive towards dip-coating. On the other hand the Perspex PDA sensors were formulated using PDA monomers dissolved in solvents, which is conducive towards spin coating. We hypothesize that the presence of silica micro-domains on the surface of the glass PDA enabled bacterial anchoring, providing better interaction between the bacterial cells and PDA domains.</p>
      <p id="p-00127-en" num="0125">The PDA sensors have a much faster response time to <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>than <i>Staphylococcus Aureus</i>. We hypothesize that this is because <i>Staphylococcus Aureus </i>does not have as many copies of Lipopolysaccharide as <i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa </i>does due to the inherent difference in these two bacteria strains. Thus, selective or general sensors to microbes can be developed as needed for a particular use.</p>

[Silbert L, Shlush I B, Israel E, Porgador A, Kolusheva S, Jelinek R. 2006. Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 72: 7339-7344]. The first-step comprises of creating vesicles using PDA monomers. These vesicles are then trapped to agar gels, before polymerizing the entire construct. More specifically, vesicles containing DMPC and 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid (2:3 molar ratio) will be prepared at a concentration of 1 mM. The lipids will then be dried together in vacuo. Following evaporation, distilled water will be added and the suspension will then be probe sonicated at 70Â° C.

Different concentrations of bacteria/fungi are spiked into the lens solutions to determine the detection limit and detection range. More specifically, bacterial samples are purchased from America Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured as per provider specifications. A mounted digital camera is used to acquire images of PDA films in the presence of different concentrations of bacteria/fungi every 30 minutes for a period of 10 hours. Images are evaluated to calculate the sensor response time to bacteria/fungal contamination. The minimum detection capabilities of the film is also evaluated.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0138">The PDA/vesicle films are further evaluated for stability in multipurpose contact lens solution at different temperature and pH. More specifically, PDA films are stored in the contact lens solution for a period 60 days. The films are also exposed to temperature and pH fluctuations. The PDA film storage lens solutions is then compared to normal lens solutions using mass spectroscopy to determine any constitutional changes which would indicate film leeching or degradation. In order to determine the stability of the PDA films mass spectroscopy is used to evaluate and obtain the chemical signatures of contact lens solutions. The chemical signatures of the bottled solution are compared with the signature obtained from the PVA film storage solution to detect PDA or agar leeching/degradation.
