      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Electroencephalography (EEG) involves measuring and recording electrical activity resulting from many neural processes associated with different portions of the brain. EEG data is typically measured using a plurality of electrodes disposed on or near the scalp of a person to measure voltage fluctuations resulting from this electrical activity within the neurons of the brain. In some instances, the electrodes are coupled directly to the scalp of the person. Alternatively, in other instances, the electrodes are incorporated into a headset that may be worn on the head of the person and which locates the electrodes along the scalp of the person.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Certain examples are shown in the above-identified figures and/or described in detail below. In describing these examples, like or identical reference numbers are used to identify the same or similar elements. Also, as used herein, two structures are âoperatively coupledâ when they are coupled directly or coupled indirectly (e.g., through one or more intervening structures and/or layers).</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Electroencephalography (EEG) data is indicative of electrical activity of neurons (e.g., neural depolarization) in the brain. The neural electrical activity may be due to stimuli of one or more of the five senses (evoked activity) and/or from thought processes (spontaneous activity). Summations of these electrical activities (e.g., brainwaves) propagate to the surface (e.g., the scalp) and are detectable with electrodes. EEG data can be classified in multiple different frequency bands. Human brainwave frequencies include delta (approximately less than about 4 Hertz (Hz)), theta (approximately between about 3.5 Hz to about 7.5 Hz), alpha (approximately between about 7.5 Hz and about 13 Hz), beta (approximately between about 14 Hz and about 30 Hz) and gamma (approximately between about 30 Hz and about 100 Hz) frequency ranges. Skull and dermal layers tend to attenuate waves, particularly those above about 75 Hz.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">EEG signals may be measured using one or more electrodes placed on a scalp of a person (e.g., a user, a viewer, a subject, a panelist, a participant or a patient) to measure voltage fluctuations resulting from electrical activity associated with post synaptic currents occurring within neurons of the person's brain. To enable surface EEG electrodes to receive signals effectively from the brain, the electrodes are placed close to the scalp. The electrodes may be manually placed upon a subject's head or may be contained in a wearable apparatus such as, for example, a headset. Some known EEG headsets utilize electrodes that are permanently fixed to the headset. A wire or cord is connected to the electrodes that transfers the signals gathered by the electrodes to a nearby computer or processing station. Thus, in such headsets, when an electrode is broken or otherwise inoperable, the entire headset may need to be replaced or significant maintenance is required to replace the inoperable electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Additionally, to decrease impedance and improve signal quality, known headsets are typically strapped tightly onto a user's head to decrease the distance between the electrodes and the tissue of the scalp. However, too much pressure (e.g., greater than two Newtons per millimeter square (N/mm<sup>2</sup>)) results in discomfort (e.g., pain) for most subjects. Also, in some instances, a user's hair is too long and/or thick to enable the known headset to operate well because the electrodes may not protrude all the way through the user's hair to contact the scalp.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Other known EEG headsets utilize a cap with holes for inserting wet EEG electrodes. With wet EEG electrodes, an operator applies a conductive gel into a hole of the cap and plugs an EEG electrode into the corresponding hole. The electrode is attached to a wire or cord that is also connected to the nearby computer or processing station. However, these gels are messy, and application of the gel is time consuming and requires consumables that need to be replenished. Additionally, in such an arrangement, specific electrodes are to be inserted into a particular corresponding hole so that the signals gathered by the electrode can be properly designated as associated with a particular area of the brain. Therefore, placing the wet EEG electrodes in the cap is time consuming, requires trained personnel, and is, thus, expensive.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Example headset(s) for receiving neuro-response data from a person's brain are disclosed herein. Example headsets disclosed herein comprise a plurality of example electrode holders disposed on a cap that is to be worn on the head of a person. In some examples, the electrode holders are disposed in specific locations on the cap for effective (e.g., optimum) reading. The specific locations may be, for example, over a particular part of the brain that emits certain brain waves of interest. In some examples, electrodes are inserted into the electrode holders to engage the scalp of the user and receive EEG signals. Example electrode holders disclosed herein are fixedly attached to the cap and are communicatively coupled to a wire or cord within the cap. In some examples, the wires or cords lead to a processor (e.g., a processor attached to the cap or a nearby computer or processing station) or a plug on the cap. In some such examples, the example electrodes are not permanently attached to a wire or cord. Instead, the electrodes removably engage corresponding ones of the electrodes holders. In some examples, the electrodes may be placed in any of the electrode holders.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">When inserted into the electrode holders, the electrodes engage the scalp of a wearer of the cap. The signals gathered by one of the electrodes are transferred through the electrode, to the electrode holder and, thus, to the corresponding wire or cord coupled to the respective electrode holder. Thus, example electrodes disclosed herein may be easily inserted, removed, interchanged and/or replaced, which greatly reduces the time spent setting up and/or using the headset. As a result, if a single electrode is malfunctioning or otherwise inoperable, a user may remove the electrode and replace it, without disposing the entire cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Example electrodes disclosed herein are structured to be removably secured in a corresponding one of the example electrode holders. In some such examples, the electrode extends from an end of an electrode housing that includes a plurality of ribs along an outer surface of the electrode housing. The electrode holder of some such examples includes a retainer that engages the ribs and secures the electrode housing in place. In some examples, the electrode housing is movable up and/or down in the electrode holder, via the ribs and retainer interaction, to position the electrode closer to or further from the scalp of the user. This adjustability allows the electrode to be moved relative to the scalp (e.g., sufficiently close to the scalp to collect a good signal without causing discomfort) thereby increasing both signal collection quality and wearability (e.g., comfort).</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Some example electrode holders disclosed herein are capable of accommodating electrodes of multiple different sizes. For example, an electrode of a first length may be used with a user who has short hair and/or fine hair. A relatively longer electrode may be used with a user who has longer or thicker hair so that the electrode extends all the way through the user's hair to engage the user's scalp. As a result, example headsets disclosed herein are customizable to accommodate different persons having different head shapes, hair lengths and/or hair thicknesses.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">In some examples, the electrode is implemented as a pogo pin assembly. In some such examples, a spring is disposed within the electrode housing to bias the electrode pin outwards from the end of the electrode housing to engage the scalp of the user. The tension from the spring adjusts to the force applied to the head and further reduces discomfort when the electrode pin engages the scalp. As a result, the spring increases wearability without compromising signal collection quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">An example headset disclosed herein includes a cap to be worn on a head of a person and a first electrode holder carried by the cap. In some examples, the first electrode holder defines a first opening therethrough. The example headset of some such examples includes a first electrode that is insertable into the first opening. The first electrode of some such examples has a first length and is adjustable in the first opening to a first plurality of discrete positions having different depths of insertion relative to the first opening. In some such examples, the first electrode is to engage the head of the person when inserted a sufficient depth into the first opening. The example headset of some examples also includes a second electrode that is interchangeable with the first electrode and insertable into the same first opening as the first electrode (with the first electrode removed). The second electrode of some such examples has a second length greater than the first length and is adjustable in the first opening to a second plurality of discrete positions having different depths of insertion relative to the first opening. The second electrode of some examples engages the head of the person when inserted a sufficient depth into the first opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">In some examples, the first electrode includes an electrode housing and a pin that is retractable into the electrode housing. In some such examples, the first electrode includes a spring disposed within the electrode housing to bias the pin outwards. In some examples, the electrode housing includes a sheath having a plurality of ribs protruding from an outer surface of the sheath. In some examples, the first electrode holder includes a retainer disposed within the first opening. In some such examples, at least a portion of the plurality of ribs are to engage the retainer when the first electrode is disposed in the first opening to secure the first electrode at one of the different depths. In some examples, the plurality of ribs includes a first rib disposed a first distance from a first end of the sheath and a second rib disposed a second distance from the first end of the sheath. In some examples, the second distance is greater than the first distance. In some such examples, the force of the first electrode against the head of the person when wearing the cap is greater when the second rib is engaged with the retainer than when the first rib is engaged with the retainer.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">In some examples, the ribs are adjustably coupled to the first electrode holder when the first electrode is disposed in the first opening. In some examples, the ribs are adjustable by screwing the ribs into the respective electrode holder. In other examples, the ribs are not helical and adjustably coupled to the first electrode holder via a non-screwing motion. In some examples, the non-screwing motion includes a sliding motion, a friction fit, etc. In some examples, the non-screwing motion includes a snap fit.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In some examples, the ribs and the first electrode holder are rotatably coupled when the first electrode is disposed in the first opening. In some examples, the first opening defines a first passage through the cap. In some examples, the retainer is communicatively coupled to a wire disposed within the cap.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">In some examples, the electrode housing includes a handle. In some examples, the handle comprises a first material and the sheath and the pin comprise of a second material, which is different than the first material. In some such examples, the first material is an insulator.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some examples, the first electrode holder includes a grip extending away from the first electrode when the first electrode is in the first electrode holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Some example headsets include a second electrode holder carried by the cap. In some examples, the second electrode holder has a second opening therethrough. Some examples include a third electrode insertable into the second passage. In some examples, the first electrode is interchangeable with the third electrode and insertable into the second opening.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Example methods disclosed herein include placing a cap on a head of a person, the cap having a first electrode holder comprising a base, an opening extending through the base and a retainer operatively coupled to the base within the opening. Some example methods include inserting an electrode into the opening of the base while the cap is disposed on the head of the person. In some example methods, the electrode includes an elongated sheath having a plurality of ribs to engage the retainer. Some example methods also include adjusting a depth of the electrode within the opening by removably securing the electrode in one of a plurality of discrete positions having different depths of insertion relative to the opening defined by an interface between the plurality of ribs and the retainer.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Some example methods include indicating when the electrode is inserted in the opening and engaged with the retainer. Some example methods further include indicating when the electrode is in contact with the head of the person.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">Some example methods include analyzing a quality of a signal gathered by the electrode, performing a comparison of the quality to a threshold quality, determining that the quality is acceptable or unacceptable based on the comparison and indicating whether the quality is unacceptable. Some example methods include adjusting the cap on the head of the person.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Turning now to the figures, <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> show an example headset <b>100</b> constructed in accordance with the teachings of this disclosure for gathering EEG signals from the head of a person. The example headset <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> may be used, for instance, to gather medical information from a patient in a medical or a home environment, to control aspects of a game or other entertainment device, to provide data as part of a fitness regime, to collect audience measurement data, to control remote devices and/or for multiple other uses. The example headset <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is intended to be worn on the head of a person, a user, a subject, a viewer, a participant and/or panelist.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The example headset <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> includes a cap <b>102</b> (e.g., a base, a cover, headgear) that is to be disposed (e.g., worn) on the head of a person. In the illustrated example, the cap <b>102</b> is comprised of a flexible and/or stretchable material such as, for example, nylon, plastic, rubber, etc. In some examples, the cap <b>102</b> includes a chin strap <b>103</b> for tightening the cap <b>102</b> against the head of the user. In other examples, alternative and/or additional buckles and/or straps are employed to tighten and/or secure the cap <b>102</b> on the head of the person.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">As shown in the illustrated example of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the headset <b>100</b> includes a plurality of electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>operatively coupled to the cap <b>102</b>. The electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the illustrated example are adapted to receive electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>for gathering EEG signals from the scalp of a user. More specifically, each of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>removably secures a respective electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to the cap <b>102</b>. The electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are disposed in fixed locations on the cap <b>102</b> to locate the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>at or near desired areas (e.g., near a particular area of the brain that emits a certain signal for a certain response) for good (e.g., near optimum) electrode contact and/or data collection. In the illustrated example there are multiple electrode sites. In some examples, the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are placed in specific locations to comply with the International <b>10</b>-<b>20</b> system, which is a standard of electrode placement on the scalp to ensure standardized reproducibility. These sites provide coverage of all the lobes of the brain including frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal. Additionally, these sites are the accepted EEG electrode sites for a clinically valid EEG. In other examples, the headset <b>100</b> may include more or fewer electrode holders and/or electrodes.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">The cap <b>102</b> of the illustrated example includes a plurality of wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>disposed on, under, and/or within the cap <b>102</b> (e.g., under the cap, on top of the cap, within the material of the cap or between two layers of material comprising the cap). The wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the illustrated example are communicatively coupled (e.g., in circuit with, in electrical contact with, etc.) to the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, respectively. In the illustrated example, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>run through the cap and connect to a processing unit <b>110</b> (<figref>FIG. 1B</figref>) disposed in the rear of cap <b>102</b>. The wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the illustrated example carry the signals gathered by the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to the processing unit <b>110</b>. In some examples, traces, communication links, a ribbon, a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB), and/or other suitable communication links may be used in addition to or alternatively to the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. In other examples, the electrode holders <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are wirelessly coupled to the processing unit <b>110</b> and/or to a remote processor. For example, one or more of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may include a transmitter to wirelessly transmit signals (e.g., EEG signals) to the processing unit <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In the illustrated example, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are disposed between a top layer of material and a bottom layer of material in the cap <b>102</b>. In such an example, the top layer of material comprises a conductive material (e.g., a conductive mesh) that provides a Faraday cage to prevent external static and non-static electric fields from interfering with the EEG signals. By disposing the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>within the material of the cap <b>102</b>, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are also less likely to be caught or snagged on objects.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">In some examples, an electrode is employed to provide a reference signal for comparing with the EEG signals gathered from other parts of the person's head by, for example, the example headset <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. A reference electrode is positioned at a point on the person's body that has minimal or no EEG activity or other artifacts and/or noise such as, for example, those indicative of muscle contractions or blood flow. In the illustrated example of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the headset <b>100</b> includes a reference electrode <b>109</b> that may be attached to the ear (e.g., the earlobe) of the wearer. A wire <b>111</b> communicatively couples the electrode <b>109</b> to the processing unit <b>110</b>. The reference electrode <b>109</b> of the illustrated example may be a wet electrode (e.g., a one use gel sensor) or a dry electrode (e.g., a flat metal pad) and may be attached to the ear of the wearer using any suitable fastening mechanism(s) such as, for example, an adhesive or a clip. An example of a clip for attaching an electrode to an earlobe of a person is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/829,849 titled âMETHODS AND APPARATUS TO GATHER AND ANALYZE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC DATA,â filed Mar. 14, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">In the example headset <b>100</b> of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a single reference electrode <b>109</b> is implemented and attached to the ear of the person wearing the headset <b>100</b>. However, in other examples, the reference electrode <b>109</b> may be attached to the nose, the neck, or any other location on the person capable of providing a reference signal. Additionally, in some examples, more than one reference electrode is implemented.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">In the illustrated example, the processing unit <b>110</b> houses electrical components for processing signals gathered from the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the reference electrode <b>109</b> (described in further detail below). In some examples, the electrical components are used, for example, to convert the EEG data from analog data to digital data, amplify the EEG data, filter (e.g., remove noise from) the data, analyze the data and/or transmit the data to a computer or other remote receiver or processing unit. In some examples, the processing unit <b>110</b> includes hardware and software such as, for example, an amplifier, signal conditioning circuitry, a semiconductor based micro-processor and/or a transmitter for transmitting signals to a data center or a computer. In other examples, some of the processing occurs at the headset <b>100</b> and some processing occurs remotely after the headset <b>100</b> transmits data or semi-processed results to a remote site such as, for example, via a wireless connection. In some examples, the processing unit <b>110</b> is removably attached to the headset <b>100</b>. In some such examples, the processing unit <b>110</b> may be removed and replaced with a different processing unit that may have, for example, different programming functions and analysis tools. In some examples, a plurality of processing units may contain different preprogrammed analysis tools and the processing units may be interchanged depending on the desired function (e.g., controlling a game, collecting medical information, controlling household appliances, etc.) of the headset <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">In some examples, the headset <b>100</b> does not include the processing unit <b>110</b> and, instead, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>111</b> lead to a plug (e.g., a pin connector), which may be used to plug the headset directly to another computer or processing station. In still other examples, the processing unit <b>100</b> includes only an amplifier to amplify the EEG signals. In some such examples, the processing unit <b>100</b> may be plugged into another computer or processing station for further processing and/or may wireless transmit the amplified signals to the computer and/or processing station. In some examples, it is advantageous to amplify the signals as close to the electrodes as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">
        <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> is an exploded view of an example implementation of one of the plurality of electrodes <b>106</b><i>a </i>and one of the plurality of electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a </i>of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. In the illustrated example, the electrode holder <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes a support or base <b>200</b> defining a passage or opening <b>202</b> therethrough. In the illustrated example, the opening <b>202</b> extends through the base <b>200</b> from a top surface <b>204</b> of the base <b>200</b> to a bottom surface <b>206</b> of the base <b>200</b>. The base <b>200</b> also has an annular groove <b>208</b> where the cap <b>102</b> is operatively coupled to the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the illustrated example further includes a first curved extension <b>210</b> and a second curved extension <b>212</b>, which project upward from the base <b>200</b> and extend outward (e.g., away from the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>). In some examples, the first and second curved extensions <b>212</b> are grips that are used as finger tabs to allow a user to easily insert the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>, described in further detail below. Though curved extensions <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> are shown in the illustrated example, other suitable shape(s) may additionally and/or alternatively be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">As shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes a handle <b>214</b> and an electrode body comprising a housing or sheath <b>216</b> and a pin <b>218</b> (e.g., a pogo pin). In the illustrated example, the sheath <b>216</b> receives the pin <b>218</b>. The pin <b>218</b> of the illustrated example is retractable into the sheath <b>216</b> and biased outward from the sheath <b>216</b> by a spring (described in further detail below). Specifically, the pin <b>218</b> is retractable into a bottom end <b>220</b> of the sheath <b>216</b> and the handle <b>214</b> is coupled to a top end <b>222</b> of the sheath <b>216</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the sheath <b>216</b> of the illustrated example includes a plurality of ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(e.g., first engagement members). The ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are protrusions extending outward from the sheath <b>216</b>. In the example shown, the sheath <b>216</b> has seven ribs. However, in other examples, the sheath <b>216</b> may have more or fewer ribs (e.g., two ribs, twenty ribs, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">The electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the illustrated example is insertable into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, a user may position the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>above the opening <b>202</b> (e.g., the position shown in <figref>FIG. 2A</figref>) of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and insert the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the position shown in <figref>FIG. 2B</figref>) by applying a downward force (e.g., a force toward the scalp of the user wearing the cap). The ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>of the sheath <b>216</b> engage a retainer ring (e.g., a second engagement member) (described below) inside the opening <b>202</b> of the base <b>200</b> to secure the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>in one of a plurality of discrete positions in the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>allow the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>to lock and/or snap into position once inserted into the opening <b>202</b>. Each rib defines a different, discrete position or depth that the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be inserted into the opening <b>202</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the depth of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>in the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>may be adjusted.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">
        <figref>FIG. 2B</figref> shows the example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>of <figref>FIG. 2A</figref> inserted into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. In an example operation, a user can place a first finger (e.g., an index finger) under the first curved extension <b>210</b> and a second finger (e.g., a middle finger) under the second curved extension <b>212</b>. In this manner, the user can use his/her thumb and/or palm to press on the top of the handle <b>214</b> to insert the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The user may push the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>releasably locks or snaps into engagement at the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be pressed downward until the pin <b>218</b> engages the scalp of the user and may be further adjusted (e.g., pulled in or out) depending on the desired pressure to be applied to the scalp. As the pin <b>218</b> engages the head of the user, the cap <b>102</b> is forced upward and away from the head and, thus, creates a downward tension in the cap <b>102</b>. This downward tension or biasing force assists in keeping the pin <b>218</b> against the scalp of the user and the cap <b>102</b> secure and stabile on the user's head. In some examples, the cap <b>102</b> being forced upward (e.g., away from the head of the user) provides a visual indication that the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the head. In addition, the pin <b>218</b> of the illustrated example is retractable into the sheath <b>216</b> against the force of the spring (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>), which softens the force of the pin <b>218</b> against the scalp. This dual adjustability greatly increases the wearability of the cap <b>102</b> and enables a user to more effectively situate the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>against the scalp for good signal quality without discomfort for the wearer of the cap.</p>

In the illustrated example, the opening <b>204</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>includes a first aperture <b>300</b> having a first diameter, an annular cavity <b>302</b> having a second diameter <b>304</b>, a third aperture <b>306</b> having a third diameter and a fourth aperture <b>308</b> having a fourth diameter. The first, second, third and fourth apertures <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> define the inside of the opening <b>204</b> (e.g., a passage through the base <b>200</b> and cap <b>102</b>). In other examples, the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>may include more or less apertures to define the opening <b>204</b>.

      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">As shown in the example of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a retainer ring <b>310</b> is disposed within the annular cavity <b>302</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>.

In the illustrated example, the first and second springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> are U-shaped springs. In other examples, there may be one spring. In some such examples, the lone spring may be formed of an annular ring that surrounds an inserted electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">As the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the illustrated example is inserted into the opening <b>202</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>engage and/or slide past the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> and force the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> to bend radially outwards. When one of the plurality of ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is slid past the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, the springs <b>314</b><i>a</i>-<b>316</b> flex radially inward, due to their biasing force, and engage a section of the sheath <b>216</b> between two of the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. In this position, the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the illustrated example secure and stabilize the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>and prevent the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>from moving up or down in the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>until a large enough force on the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>overcomes the force provided by the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>. When such a force is applied, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>is moved further into the base <b>206</b> or is removed from the base <b>206</b>. During manufacturing, the tension of the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> can be selected to achieve a desired amount of force acting on the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>. For example, stiffer springs may be used to prevent the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>from moving in the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>when relatively smaller forces are acting on the electrode <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In illustrated the example, the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are individual annular rings formed around the sheath <b>216</b>. The ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>represent discrete positions that the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be held in the electrode holder <b>104</b>. However, in other examples, the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be helical and form a thread (e.g., similar to a screw). In such an example, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be screwed (e.g., rotated) into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. With a thread arrangement, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be adjusted in continuous manner, with relatively greater refinement in the positioning. The thread arrangement also eliminates the need for the disk <b>312</b> to have spring properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">In other examples, other types of engagement members may be used inside the opening <b>202</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>to secure the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In some examples, the inside of the opening <b>202</b> has a substantially flat wall from the top 204 of the base <b>200</b> to the bottom of the base <b>206</b> that has a protrusion or rib extending therefrom into the opening to engage the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>on the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In such an example, the protrusion may be electrically coupled to the wire <b>108</b><i>a </i>(e.g., via a wire or trace extending through the base <b>200</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the illustrated example, the pin <b>218</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>engages the head of a user and receives EEG signals transmitted through the scalp. The pin <b>218</b> is retractable into a cavity <b>320</b> in the bottom end <b>220</b> of the sheath <b>216</b> and is biased outward via a spring <b>322</b>, which is disposed within the cavity <b>320</b>. A tip <b>324</b> of the pin <b>218</b> contacts the scalp of the head of a person and senses the EEG signals. The spring <b>322</b> allows the pin <b>218</b> to retract into the sheath <b>216</b> if too much force is applied downward against the scalp and, thus, increases the comfort and wearability of the headset <b>100</b>. Different size springs may be utilized with the first electrode <b>212</b> to provide more or less force. In some examples, the spring <b>322</b> provides around two (2) Newtons of force. In addition, the distance at which the sheath <b>216</b> is inserted into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>also affects the force applied against the scalp. For example, the force of the pin <b>218</b> against the scalp increases the further the sheath <b>216</b> is inserted into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Also, in the illustrated example, the spring <b>322</b> is a coil spring. However, in other examples, the spring <b>322</b> may be implemented by any other type of spring such as, for example, a leaf spring.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">In the illustrated example, the pin <b>218</b>, the spring <b>322</b> and the sheath <b>216</b> are comprised of a conductive material such as, for example, silver, silver chloride, gold, platinum, titanium, etc. In some examples, the pin <b>218</b>, the spring <b>322</b> and the sheath <b>216</b> are comprised of the same conductive material. However, in other examples, the pin <b>218</b>, the spring <b>322</b> and/or the sheath <b>216</b> are comprised of different conductive materials. In the illustrated example, because the pin <b>218</b>, the spring <b>322</b> and the sheath <b>216</b> are conductive, and in contact with each other, the signals gathered by the pin <b>218</b> are transferred through the pin <b>218</b>, the spring <b>322</b> and the sheath <b>216</b>. The signals are also transferred from the sheath <b>214</b> to the retainer ring <b>310</b> via electrical contact between the sheath <b>214</b> and the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the retainer ring <b>310</b>. In the illustrated example, a wire <b>326</b> is disposed within the base <b>200</b> of the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and communicatively couples (e.g., electrically couples) the retainer ring <b>310</b> and the wire <b>108</b><i>a </i>within the cap <b>102</b> at the annular groove <b>208</b>. The wire <b>326</b> may be operatively coupled to the retainer using any suitable fastening mechanism such as, for example, welding, an adhesive, friction fit, etc. Thus, signals received by the pin <b>218</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>are transferred to the wiring of the cap <b>102</b> and, in some examples, to the processing unit <b>110</b> or other output cord or part elsewhere on the headset <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">In the illustrated example, the handle <b>214</b> is comprised of an insulator. As a result, a person may touch the handle <b>214</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>without interfering with the EEG signals being transmitted through the sheath <b>218</b>. In the illustrated example, the handle <b>214</b> is in the shape of a circular knob with grips. However, in other example, other suitable handles and/or shapes may be employed (e.g., a turnkey, a lever, etc.).</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">In an example operation, the cap <b>102</b> of the illustrated example is placed on the head of a person and the chin strap <b>103</b> is adjusted to change the tension of the cap <b>102</b> on the head. Once situated, an electrode (e.g., the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>) is inserted into an electrode holder (e.g., the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>). In some examples, the headset <b>100</b> is communicatively coupled to a computer or processing station for real-time processing and display. The computer or processing station may indicate when an electrode has been placed in a certain electrode holder. Then, the electrode may be pushed into the corresponding electrode holder until the pin of the electrode engages the scalp of the user with a desired level of pressure. In some examples, the computer or processing station may also indicate that the electrode has contacted the scalp of the user and signals are successfully being received by the electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">In the examples of <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>, the pin <b>218</b> and the sheath <b>216</b> are cylindrical and have circular cross-sections. However, in other examples, the pin <b>218</b> and/or the sheath <b>216</b> may have a rectangular, square or other shaped cross-section. In the illustrated example, the tip <b>324</b> of the first electrode pin <b>218</b> is flat, which provides a larger surface area to contact the scalp of the user than would a point. The larger surface area also increases the comfort level of the headset <b>100</b> by distributing the force over a larger area than would be the case in a pointed electrode. However, in other examples, the tip <b>324</b> of the pin <b>218</b> may be rounded or otherwise point shaped. The pin <b>218</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>is sized to protrude through the hair on a person's head, which provides sufficient surface area to contact the scalp of the user and receive signals from the brain. Different sized pins <b>218</b> may be used depending on the thickness of the hair.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">Additionally, although a plurality of ribs <b>222</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b> as covering a majority of the sheath <b>216</b>, in other examples, the ribs <b>222</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>only cover a portion of the sheath. In such an example, the remainder of the sheath <b>216</b> may be smooth.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">The other electrode holders <b>104</b><i>b</i>-<i>n </i>and electrodes <b>106</b><i>b</i>-<i>n </i>shown in the headset <b>100</b> in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> may be identical to the example electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>. As a result, the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be freely interchanged with other electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Thus, in the illustrated example, specific electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are not earmarked for only accepting a particular electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. Instead, any of the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be inserted into any of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. As a result, if an electrode is malfunctioning, that malfunctioning electrode can be easily removed and replaced, without having to replace the entire headset <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">While the example electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>are disclosed herein in relation to a stretchable or flexible cap <b>102</b>, the example electrode <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>are also capable of being incorporated into a rigid headset. Additionally or alternatively, the example electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>could be used in any other headset structure or base member capable of incorporating the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The interaction between the example electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>allow electrodes to be easily and quickly inserted, replaced, interchanged, etc. Additionally, because the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are in communication with (e.g., electrically connected to) the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be used in any of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, the time spent setting up the headset is greatly reduced compared to prior headsets.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates two different sized example electrodes that may be used with the example holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>disclosed herein. In some examples, when a user has longer and/or thicker hair, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may not be long enough to extend all the way through the hair to effectively engage the head of the user. In such an instance, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be replaced with a longer electrode such as, for example, the electrode <b>400</b>, which has a relatively longer sheath and pin compared to the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>. As mentioned above, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes the handle <b>214</b>, the sheath <b>216</b> and the pin <b>218</b>. The sheath <b>216</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>has a length of l<b>1</b>, and the pin <b>218</b> of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>has a length of l<b>2</b>. The electrode <b>400</b> is substantially similar to the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>and includes a handle <b>402</b>, a sheath <b>404</b> and a pin <b>406</b> (which is retractable into the sheath <b>404</b>). In the illustrated example, the sheath <b>404</b> of the electrode <b>400</b> has a length of l<b>3</b>, and the pin <b>406</b> of the electrode <b>400</b> has a length of l<b>4</b>. In some examples, l<b>3</b> is about one to two inches. In the example shown, l<b>3</b> is larger than l<b>1</b>, and l<b>4</b> is larger than l<b>2</b>. In other examples, l<b>4</b> is the same as l<b>2</b> and l<b>3</b> is larger than l<b>1</b>. Thus, the example electrodes disclosed herein may be manufactured in a range of sizes (e.g., lengths) to accommodate different hair thicknesses and/or head sizes. As mentioned above, a longer electrode such as the electrode <b>400</b> may be used when the user has thicker hair and a relatively shorter electrode (e.g., the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>) is not long enough to extend through the hair.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of an example processing system <b>500</b> for use with the example headset <b>100</b>. The example system <b>500</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> includes a plurality of electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are coupled, for example, to a headset <b>100</b> to be worn on a head of a subject for gathering EEG data as explained above. The electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are coupled to electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, which are coupled to a processor unit <b>110</b> of the headset <b>100</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">In the system <b>500</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are communicatively coupled to the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>via a communication link <b>502</b> such as, for example, the contact formed between the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>disclosed above (e.g., <figref>FIG. 3</figref>). In the example shown in <figref>FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>, the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>includes the retainer ring <b>310</b>, which engages (e.g., contacts) the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>on the sheath <b>216</b> to releasably secure and stabilize the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>within the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The electrode pin <b>218</b>, the sheath <b>216</b> and the spring <b>322</b> are electrically conductive. Therefore, signals gathered by the electrode pin <b>218</b> are transferred through the sheath <b>216</b> and to the retainer ring <b>310</b> disposed within the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. In the example shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a </i>also includes the wire <b>326</b> that transfers signals from retainer ring <b>310</b> through the base <b>200</b> to an outside surface of the base.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">As shown in the block diagram of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are communicatively coupled to the processing unit <b>110</b> via a communication link formed by, for example, wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. In some examples, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are disposed within the material of a cap <b>102</b> (e.g., between a top and bottom layer of material). The wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>communicatively couple each of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(and their respective electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>) to the processing unit <b>110</b> of the headset <b>100</b>. In other examples, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>in the cap <b>102</b> connect to a plug on the cap <b>102</b>, which allows the cap <b>102</b> to be plugged into another outside computer or processing station.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">The example system <b>500</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> also includes a reference electrode <b>109</b>. The reference electrode <b>109</b> is coupled to the processing unit <b>110</b> via a wire <b>111</b>. The reference electrode <b>109</b> provides a reference signal to compare against the EEG signals gathered by, for example, the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The reference electrode <b>109</b> may be attached to the ear, the nose, the neck, or any other suitable place on the person's body having minimal or no EEG activity. For example, in the illustrated example of <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the reference electrode <b>109</b> is coupled to the ear of the wearer. In some examples, the system <b>500</b> includes more than one reference electrode.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">The example processing unit <b>110</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> includes an analog-to-digital converter <b>504</b>, a signal conditioner <b>506</b>, a database <b>508</b>, an analyzer <b>510</b> and a transmitter <b>512</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">The analog-to-digital converter <b>504</b> converts the analog signals received at the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the reference electrode <b>109</b> to digital signals. In some examples, the analog-to-digital converter <b>504</b> is located in the processing unit <b>110</b> in the housing of the headset. In other examples, the analog-to-digital converter <b>504</b> comprises multiple A-D converters located to service individual electrodes or sets of the electrodes to convert the signals as close to the source as possible, which may further reduce interference. In some examples, the A-D converters are disposed within housings of electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">The signal conditioner <b>506</b> of the illustrated example prepares the gathered signals so that the data is in a more usable form. For example, the signal conditioner <b>506</b> may include an amplifier to amplify the signal to a more detectable level. In addition, the signal conditioner <b>506</b> may include a filter to remove noise from the signal. The filter may also be used as a bandpass filter to pass one or more frequency bands and/or manipulate select bands depending on the desired processing and/or analysis. In some examples, each of the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and/or the reference electrode <b>109</b> may include a signal conditioner at or near the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>or the reference electrode <b>109</b>. The example signal conditioner <b>506</b> may include hardware and/or software to execute a signal conditioning method. In some examples, the signal conditioner includes a detrending unit to compensate for electrode polarization, in which there is slow movement of the voltage signal unrelated to brain wave activity due to polarization of the electrodes. The example processing unit <b>110</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> also provides signal processing that may include hardware and/or software to execute Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) calculations, coherence measurements and/or custom adaptive filtering.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">The analyzer <b>510</b> of the illustrated example analyzes the data gathered from the electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and the reference electrode <b>109</b> and processed by the analog-to-digital converter <b>504</b> and the signal conditioner <b>506</b> in accordance with one or more analysis protocols depending on the desired study. For example, in some studies, the analyzer <b>510</b> process the data to determine one or more of a subject's mental state, physiological state, attention, resonance or memory, emotional engagement and/or other suitable characteristics of the subject. Descriptions of example processing operations and techniques are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser.

      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">The transmitter <b>512</b> of the illustrated example communicates the data at any stage of processing and/or the results of the analysis from the analyzer <b>510</b> to an output <b>514</b>. The output <b>514</b> may be implemented by a handheld device, an alarm, a display screen on the headset, a remote server, a remote computer and/or any other suitable output. In some examples, the output is a display screen and may be used to indicate when an electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is in an electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>and when the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is receiving signals. Also, in some examples, the output <b>514</b> may be used to indicate that an electrode is <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is not gathering a sufficiently strong signal, according to the signal analysis preformed by the processing unit <b>110</b>. In such examples, the output <b>514</b> may indicate that the electrode <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is to be inserted further into the respective electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to improve signal quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">Data transmission may be implemented by Bluetooth transmission, wi-fi transmission, ZiGBee transmission and/or encryption before transmission. In the illustrated example, the database <b>508</b> stores gathered data. The streams can be buffered for streaming or stored on-board (i.e., at the headset) for periodic or aperiodic uploads during, for example, low-activity periods.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">The components <b>504</b>-<b>512</b> of the processing unit <b>110</b> are communicatively coupled to other components of the example system <b>500</b> via communication links <b>516</b>. The communication links <b>516</b> may be any type of wired connection (e.g., a databus, a USB connection, etc.) or a wireless communication mechanism (e.g., radio frequency, infrared, etc.) using any past, present or future communication protocol (e.g., Bluetooth, USB 2.0, USB 3.0, etc.).

      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example process of gathering EEG data (block <b>600</b>) that may be implemented, for example, with the headset <b>100</b> disclosed herein. The example process begins by placing a cap (e.g., a base) on a head of a person (block <b>602</b>) such as for, example, the cap <b>102</b> shown in <figref>FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The example cap <b>102</b>, as described above, is placed (e.g., stretched over) on the head of a person. The example cap <b>102</b> includes the plurality of electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>that are operatively coupled to the cap <b>102</b>. The electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are disposed on the cap <b>102</b> in specific areas for optimum reading.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">The example process <b>600</b> includes adjusting the cap on the head of the person (block <b>604</b>). The cap may include one or more buckles and/or straps to secure the cap to the head of the person. In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, the cap <b>102</b> includes the chin strap <b>103</b>, which may be adjusted to situate the cap <b>102</b> on the person's head.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">The example process <b>600</b> includes inserting an electrode into an electrode holder (block <b>606</b>). In some examples, the electrode holder includes an opening or passage formed therein to receive the electrode. In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>include openings (e.g., opening <b>204</b>) to receive the electrodes <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. An example one of the plurality of electrodes <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be inserted into the opening of an example one of the plurality of electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The example electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be provided in a plurality of different sizes. A longer electrode may be utilized, for example, with persons have longer and/or thicker hair.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">The example process <b>600</b> includes indicating the electrode is inserted into the electrode holder (block <b>608</b>). As mentioned above, the wires of the cap may be operatively coupled to a computer or processing station. In some examples, a graphical user interface or other display indicates when an electrode has been inserted into an electrode holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0078">The example process <b>600</b> includes adjusting the electrode in the electrode holder (block <b>610</b>). In some examples, the electrode and the electrode holder include features (e.g., engagement members) that enable the electrode to be moved up or down in the electrode holder and, thus, closer or further from the head of the person wearing the cap. In some examples, the features are to secure the electrode in discrete positions in the electrode holder.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0079">In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes the plurality of ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. When the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>, the ribs <b>224</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>engage the first and second springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> of the retainer ring <b>312</b>. The springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> are biased radially inwards and secure the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>in discrete positions in the electrode holder <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be moved up or down, by supplying a force to the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>that overcomes the force from the springs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b>, to position the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>closer to or further from the head of the person. As the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>engages the head of the person, the cap <b>102</b> is stretched upward and away from the head of the person, which creates tension in the cap <b>102</b>. This tension assists in holding the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>against the head of the person. Additionally, in some examples, the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes the spring <b>322</b> that biases the pin <b>218</b> outward from the sheath <b>216</b>. The spring advantageously reduces some of the pressure of the electrode <b>106</b><i>a </i>against the scalp to increase wearability.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0080">The example process <b>600</b> includes indicating the electrode is receiving signals (block <b>612</b>). In some examples, the graphical user interface or display may indicate (e.g., via a green light) once the electrode has made contact with the head of the person and is successfully receiving signals from the brain.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0081">In some examples, the example process <b>600</b> determines if the signal quality from an electrode is acceptable (block <b>613</b>). For example, the example processing unit <b>110</b> may condition and analyze the gathered signal to assess signal quality. In analyzing the quality of the signal, the processing unit may perform a comparison of the quality to a threshold quality and determining that the quality is acceptable or unacceptable based on the comparison. If the signal quality is poor, that is, not acceptable, the process <b>600</b> continues at block <b>610</b> to adjust the electrode or at block <b>606</b> to insert a different electrode. If the example process <b>600</b> determines that the electrode is gathering a signal of acceptable quality (block <b>613</b>), the process <b>600</b> continues.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0082">The example process <b>600</b> includes determining whether another electrode is to be inserted into another electrode holder (block <b>614</b>). In some examples, the headset includes a plurality of electrode holders. In some examples, electrodes are inserted into all of the electrode holders on the cap. However, in other examples, electrodes are inserted into only a subset or group of electrode holders and the remaining electrode holders are empty. In other examples, only one electrode is used. In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, any amount of example electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may be operatively coupled to the cap <b>102</b>, and electrodes may be inserted in one or more of the electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">If it is determined that another electrode is to be inserted into another electrode holder for gathering signals, the process <b>600</b> includes inserting another electrode into another electrode holder (block <b>606</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">The example process <b>600</b> includes attaching one or more reference electrodes to the person (block <b>615</b>). In some examples, an electrode is utilized to provide reference signal to compare against the other EEG signals. In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, the reference electrode <b>109</b> is attached to the ear of the wearer and is communicatively coupled to the processing unit <b>110</b> via the wire <b>111</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0085">After inserting one or more electrodes into one or more electrode holders, the example process <b>600</b> includes gathering EEG signals from the electrodes of the headset (block <b>616</b>). In the example headset <b>100</b> disclosed above, the cap <b>102</b> includes wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>that are communicatively coupled to the respective electrode holders <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The electrodes <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>receive signals from the head of the person and the signals are transmitted through the respective electrode holders <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>to the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>. The wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>(and the wire <b>111</b> of the reference electrode <b>109</b>) are coupled to, for example, the processing unit <b>110</b>. In other examples, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>111</b> are operatively coupled to a plug, which may be plugged into another line and connected to an outside computer or processing station. In still other examples, the wires <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>n</i>, <b>111</b> are operatively coupled to an amplifier/transmitter, which amplifies the signals and then transmits them, wirelessly, to an outside computer or processing station.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0086">The example process <b>600</b> includes analyzing the EEG signals (block <b>618</b>). An example process of analyzing EEG data is discussed in <figref>FIG. 7</figref>. Once the analyzing is complete, the example method <b>600</b> ends (block <b>620</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0087">
        <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart representative of example instructions which may be executed to analyze EEG data (block <b>700</b>) collected from the example headset <b>100</b>. The example headset <b>100</b> has a plurality of electrodes that contact the scalp of a subject to receive electrical signals from the subject's brain. The example process of analyzing EEG data (block <b>700</b>) includes reading the EEG signals from the electrodes (block <b>702</b>). In the illustrated example, the signals are converted from an analog signal to a digital signal (block <b>704</b>). In some examples, the analog-to-digital conversion takes place in a processing unit, such as, for example, the processing unit <b>110</b> of the example system <b>500</b>. In other examples, the analog-to-digital conversion takes place adjacent the electrodes within the headset to convert the signal as close to the source as possible.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0088">In the illustrated example, the signals are conditioned (block <b>706</b>) to improve the usefulness of the signals and the accessibility of the data contained therein. For example, as disclosed above, the conditioning may include amplifying the signals and/or filtering the signals (e.g., with a bandpass filter).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0089">The signals are analyzed (block <b>708</b>) to, for example, determine a mental state of the subject, a health condition, an engagement with media as an audience member or effectiveness of the media, and/or an input desire for an electrical device. For example, the EEG data may be analyzed to evaluate brain activity in particular frequency bands of the EEG data and/or in particular regions of the brain. Assessments and/or calculations of the relationship(s) and correlation(s) of the frequency bands and regions of activity of the EEG data may be used to determine an emotional or mental state of a person including, for example, attention, emotional engagement, memory or resonance, etc. A description of other processing operations and techniques is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/829,849 titled âMETHODS AND APPARATUS TO GATHER AND ANALYZE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC DATA,â filed Mar. 14, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0090">In the illustrated example, the signals (e.g., the results of the analysis) are transmitted to an output (block <b>710</b>), such as, for example, the output <b>514</b> of the example system <b>500</b>. Example modes of output include, for example, sounding an alarm, displaying a message and/or other alert on a screen, issuing a report to a local and/or remote computer and/or any other suitable output. In addition, the output may include the wired or wireless communications detailed herein. In some examples, the output includes data reflected of a person paying attention, the person not paying attention, the person in a state of semi-involvement with a media program, or other mental state of the person, and the identity of the program are transmitted to, for example a remote data facility. Raw data, processed data, a history log or an indicator of audience measurement also may be transmitted to the remote data for collection. The remote data facility may be, for example, a marketing company, a broadcast company, an entertainment studio, a television network and/or any other organization that might benefit from or otherwise desire to know when people are and/or are not focused on broadcast programs and what those programs are. This example allows broadcasting companies and/or marketing personnel to analyze which programs people are watching, when they are watching the programs and/or when they are focused during the broadcast. After the output (block <b>710</b>), the example process <b>700</b> ends (block <b>712</b>).</p>
