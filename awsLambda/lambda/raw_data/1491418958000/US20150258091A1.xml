    <summary>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to novel bicyclic compounds structurally related to diketopiperazines and methods for their therapeutic use. In particular, this invention relates to the neuroprotective activity of such compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of cyclic Glycyl-2-Allyl Proline (âcyclic G-2-AllylPâ or âcG-2-AllylPâ) and pharmaceutical compositions thereof in the treatment of cognitive disorders.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Cognitive disorders, i.e. impairments of memory and learning processes, have a significant detrimental effect on the quality of life of patients affected by it. Clinically recognized cognitive disorders vary from mild cognitive impairment through to dementias of varying severity.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Mild cognitive impairment (âMCIâ) is a transition stage between the cognitive changes of normal aging and the more serious problems caused by Alzheimer's disease. The amnestic subtype of MCI, which has been linked to development of Alzheimer's disease, significantly affects memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Dementia is a clinically recognised broad-spectrum syndrome consisting of degrees of loss of cognitive abilities. Dementia can be one of many symptoms of various neurological diseases or the main abnormality associated with the disease, as it is the case in Alzheimer's disease. (Adams and Victor's, Principle of Neurology, 7<sup>th </sup>ed.)</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Most common causes of dementia include: cerebral atrophy associated with Alzheimer's disease, Lewy-bodies disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Pick's disease; vascular narrowing or blockage in the brain (i.e. vascular dementia also known as multi-infarct dementia); Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease; head trauma; HIV infection or Down's syndrome.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Currently there only several medications that have been shown to afford at most a modest transient benefit to the patients. Cholinesterase inhibitors (anticholinesterases), such as donepezil (AriceptÂ®), galantamine (RazadyneÂ®, Razadyne ERÂ®, ReminylÂ®, NivalineÂ®) and rivastigmine tartrate (ExelonÂ®) have been show to be efficacious in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease dementia. ExelonÂ® has recently been approved for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. Memantine NMDA receptor antagonists are the first approved Alzheimer's disease medication acting on the glutamatergic system (AxuraÂ®, AkatinolÂ®, NamendaÂ®, EbixaÂ®). These drugs however have side effects which in some cases lead to discontinuation of the therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">With the increase in the life span and general aging of the population there is a need to develop drugs which could delay or alleviate the cognitive function in aging patients.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">We have previously shown in patent application PCT/US2004/02830 filed Aug. 31, 2004, expressly incorporated herein fully by reference, that cyclic GP analogues, including but not limited to cyclic cyclopentyl-G-2-MeP and cyclic-G-2-AllyP are neuroprotective and neuroregenerative.

      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0069">Certain aspects of this invention include the use of cyclic G-2-AllylP in treatment of cognitive impairment associated with aging with neurodegenerative conditions or in situations in which cognitive impairment is found with no apparent neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0070">Scopolamine is commonly used in animal models of cholinergic hypofunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. The functional deficits observed after scopolamine treatment include those found in human patients with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, scopolamine treatment is reasonably predictive of cognitive impairment found in human diseases. Additionally, scopolamine treatment mimics cognitive dysfunction in humans who do not have neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0071">cG-2-AllylP administered to animals treated with scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction produces clinical improvement in those animals, similar to the therapeutic improvement observed in people suffering from cholinergic hypofunction. For example, cholinergic hypofunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. Thus, studies of effects of Cyclic G-2-AllylP scopolamine treated animals are reasonably predictive of effects observed in human beings suffering from cholinergic dysfunction.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0072">Such other agents may be selected from the group consisting of for example, growth factors and associated derivatives, e.g., insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), the tripeptide GPE, transforming growth factor-Î²1, activin, growth hormone, nerve growth factor, growth hormone binding protein, and/or IGF-binding proteins. Additional compounds include Glycyl-2-Methyl Prolyl Glutamate and/or other compounds disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/155,864, now U.S. Pat.

      <heading id="h-00010-en" level="2">Therapeutic Applications</heading>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0073">Compositions and methods of the invention find use in the treatment of animals, such as human patients, suffering from cognitive impairment. Still more generally, the compositions and methods of the invention find use in the treatment of mammals, such as human patients, suffering from memory impairment, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, including dementia including dementias resulting from cerebral atrophy associated with Alzheimer's disease, Lewy-bodies disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Pick's disease; vascular narrowing or blockage in the brain (i.e. vascular dementia also known as multi-infarct dementia); Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease; head trauma; HIV infection or Down's syndrome.</p>
      <heading id="h-00011-en" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration</heading>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0074">Cyclic G-2-AllylP can be administered as part of a medicament or pharmaceutical preparation. This can involve combining a compound of the invention with any pharmaceutically appropriate carrier, adjuvant or excipient. The selection of the carrier, adjuvant or excipient will of course usually be dependent upon the route of administration to be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0075">In general, compounds of this invention will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts by any of the usual modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with other conventional therapeutic agents for the disease being treated. A therapeutically effective amount may vary widely depending on the disease or injury, its severity, the age and relative health of the animal being treated, the potency of the compound(s), and other factors. As anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic agents, therapeutically effective amounts of cyclic G-2-AllylP may range from 0.001 to 100 milligrams per kilogram mass of the animal, with lower doses such as 0.001 to 0.1 mg/kg being appropriate for administration through the cerebrospinal fluid, such as by intracerebroventricular administration, and higher doses such as 1 to 100 mg/kg being appropriate for administration by methods such as oral, systemic (e.g. transdermal), or parenteral (e.g. intravenous) administration. A person of ordinary skill in the art will be able without undue experimentation, having regard to that skill and this disclosure, to determine a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention for a given disease or injury.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0076">Cyclic G-2-AllylP may be administered peripherally via any peripheral route known in the art. These can include parenteral routes for example injection into the peripheral circulation, subcutaneous, intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraspinal, intracisternal, topical, infusion (using e.g. slow release devices or minipumps such as osmotic pumps or skin patches), implant, aerosol, inhalation, scarification, intraperitoneal, intracapsular, intramuscular, intranasal, oral, buccal, transdermal, pulmonary, rectal or vaginal. The compositions can be formulated for parenteral administration to humans or other mammals in therapeutically effective amounts (e.g. amounts which eliminate or reduce the patient's pathological condition) to provide therapy for the neurological diseases described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0077">Desirably, if possible, when administered as anti-apoptotic and anti-necrotic agent, cyclic G-2-AllylP can be administered orally. The amount of a compound of this invention in the composition may vary widely depending on the type of composition, size of a unit dosage, kind of excipients, and other factors well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In general, the final composition may comprise from 0.0001 percent by weight (% w) to 10% w of the compound of this invention, preferably 0.001% w to 1% w, with the remainder being the excipient or excipients.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0078">Other convenient administration routes include subcutaneous injection (e.g. dissolved in a physiologically compatible carrier such as 0.9% sodium chloride) or direct administration to the CNS. Using stereotactic devices and accurate maps of an animals' CNS, a compound may be injected directly into a site of neural damage. Such routes of administration may be especially desired in situations in which perfusion of that location is compromised either by decreased vascular perfusion or by decreased cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) flow to that area. Examples include administration by lateral cerebroventricular injection or through a surgically inserted shunt into the lateral cerebroventricle of the brain of the patient, intraveneously, direct injection into the desired location or other routes.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0079">The effective amount of compound in the CNS may be increased by administration of a pro-drug form of a compound, which comprises a compound of the invention and a carrier, where the carrier is joined to a compound of the invention by a linkage which is susceptible to cleavage or digestion within the patient. Any suitable linkage can be employed which will be cleaved or digested following administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0080">However, there is no intention on the part of the applicants to exclude other forms of administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0081">In further embodiments of the invention, restoring nerve function in an animal can comprise administering a therapeutic amount of cyclic G-2-AllylP in combination with another neuroprotective agent, selected from, for example, growth factors and associated derivatives (insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), transforming growth factor-Î²1, activin, growth hormone, nerve growth factor, growth hormone binding protein, IGF-binding proteins (especially IGFBP-3), basic fibroblast growth factor, acidic fibroblast growth factor, the hst/Kfgk gene product, FGF-3, FGF-4, FGF-6, keratinocyte growth factor, androgen-induced growth factor. Additional members of the FGF family include, for example, int-2, fibroblast growth factor homologous factor-1 (FHF-1), FHF-2, FHF-3 and FHF-4, karatinocyte growth factor 2, glial-activating factor, FGF-10 and FGF-16, ciliary neurotrophic factor, brain derived growth factor, neurotrophin 3, neurotrophin 4, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), glial-cell line derived neurotrophic factor, activity-dependant neurotrophic factor, cytokine leukaemia inhibiting factor, oncostatin M, interleukin), Î±-, Î²-, Î³-, or consensus interferon, and TNF-Î±. Other forms of neuroprotective therapeutic agents include, for example, clomethiazole; kynurenic acid, Semax, tacrolimus, L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol, andrenocorticotropin-(4-9) analogue (ORG 2766) and dizolcipine (MK-801), selegiline; glutamate antagonists such as, NPS1506, GV1505260, MK-801, GV150526; AMPA antagonists such as 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)quinoxaline (NBQX), LY303070 and LY300164; anti-inflammatory agents directed against the addressin MAdCAM-1 and/or its integrin Î±4 receptors (Î±4Î²1 and Î±4Î²7), such as anti-MAdCAM-1 mAb MECA-367 (ATCC accession no. HB-9478).</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0082">Cyclic G-2-AllylP is suitably administered by a sustained-release system. Suitable examples of sustained-release compositions include semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Sustained-release matrices include polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919; EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983, <i>Biopolymers: </i>22: 547-56), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, <i>J. Biomed. Mater. Res.: </i>15: 267), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., 1981, <i>J. Biomed. Mater. Res.: </i>15: 267), or poly-D-(â)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). Sustained-release compositions also include a liposomally entrapped compound. Liposomes containing the compound are prepared by methods known per se: DE 3,218,121, EP 52,322, EP 36,676, EP 88,046, EP 143,949, EP 142,641, Japanese Pat. Appln. 83-118008, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545, and EP 102,324. Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (from or about 200 to 800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the most efficacious therapy.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0083">For parenteral administration, in one embodiment cyclic G-2-AllylP is formulated generally by mixing each at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically, or parenterally, acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0084">Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting cyclic G-2-AllylP uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, a buffered solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0085">A carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; glycine; amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, histidine, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, trehalose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counter-ions such as sodium; non-ionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or polyethylene glycol (PEG); and/or neutral salts, e.g., NaCl, KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0086">Cyclic G-2-AllylP is typically formulated in such vehicles at a pH of from or about 4.5 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of salts of the compound. The final preparation may be a stable liquid or lyophilized solid.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0087">Formulations of cyclic G-2-AllylP in pharmaceutical compositions can also include adjuvants. Typical adjuvants which may be incorporated into tablets, capsules, and the like are a binder such as acacia, corn starch, or gelatin; an excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose; a disintegrating agent like corn starch or alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or lactose; a flavouring agent such as peppermint, wintergreen, or cherry. When dosage forms are tablets, cyclic G-2-AllylP compositions can include binders and optionally, a smooth coating. When the dosage form is a capsule, in addition to the above materials, it may also contain a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Other materials of various types may be used as coatings or as modifiers of the physical form of the dosage unit. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, a sweetener such as sucrose, preservatives like propyl paraben, a colouring agent, and a flavouring agent such as cherry. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice. For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like may be desired. buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0088">For injection, intraventricular administration and other invasive routes of administration, cyclic G-2-AllylP must be sterile. Sterility may be accomplished by any method known in the art, for example filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). Therapeutic compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper able to be pierced by a hypodermic injection needle.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0089">A pharmaceutical formulation containing cyclic G-2-AllylP ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, in sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10 mL vials are filled with 5 mL of sterile-filtered 1% (w/v) aqueous solution of compound, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized compound using bacteriostatic Water-for-Injection. It can be readily appreciated that other dosage forms and types of preparations can be used, and all are considered to be part of this invention.</p>

      <p id="p-00130-en" num="0125">Efficacy of nootropic drugs can be conveniently tested using models of cholinergic hypofunction. Cholinergic hypofunction has been shown to contribute to dementia-related cognitive decline and remains a target of therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease (Hunter 2004). The cholinergic hypofunction model is also applicable to other conditions. For example, it has been shown that scopolamine-induced cholinergic hypofunction can selectively impair the recognition accuracy of disgust and anger facial expressions rendering the of scopolamine on emotion-recognition similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients (Kamboy 2006). Scopolamine has been commonly used to induce cholinergic hypofunction, and is a well-known model for human Alzheimer's disease, aging and other disorders of cognitive function (Liskowsky et al, Int. J. Dev. Neurosci, 24(2-3):149-156 (2006), Lindner et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl.) September 27 (2006), Bouger et al., Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol 15(3):331-346 (2005), Ebert et al, Eur. J. Clin.

      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0127">The first part of the study involved acute testing of the cG-2AllylP in the Morris Water Maze memory model. The MWM test is one of the most frequently used tests for assessing spatial memory in rats and is well recognized to accurately predict effects of disease and treatment on spatial memory generally. Therefore, the MWM test reflects effects of disease and treatment in human subjects.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0128">The standard procedure for MWM was followed. We used a circular swimming pool (80 cm depthÃ150 cm diameter) filled with opaque water, with the temperature maintained at 20Â° C. A platform was hidden 1 cm below the water surface, with a white flag (10 cmÃ10 cm) located either 20 cm above the platform for the visual cue and at 3 o'clock position in relation to the starting location for a spatial cue. On days 1-4 of the experiment rats underwent memory acquisition trials with 6 trials (60 seconds each) in each day of testing (habituation phase). Latency to reach the platform was recorded and the daily reduction of average latency was used to measure the capability to learn where the hidden platform was.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0129">On day 5 of the experiment normal, non-aged Wistar rats were split into groups to receive either saline (n=28) or scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p., n=27) to induce memory deficit. Scopolamine was administered half an hour before the probe test commenced.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0130">10 min following the scopolamine treatment, the cyclic G-2AllylP was administered orally at 30 mg/kg (n=31) with vehicle-treated animals administered the diluent by oral gavage using an identical treatment protocol (n-24).</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0131">Acute effects of cG-2allylP were then tested in animals with scopolamine-induced memory impairment and in age-matched control animals with no memory impairment to determine any direct pharmacological effect on memory processing.

The amount of time the rats spend swimming near the platform provided a measure of how much they relied on visual and spatial cue to locate the platform, as opposed to using a non-spatial strategy.

      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0135">Aged rats (male Wistar rats, 18-20 months old) were divided into four groups: two vehicle-treated (groups 1 and 3) and two G-2-AllylP treated (groups 2 and 4) (all groups n=6-8). Cyclic G-2-AllylP was synthesised by the Department of Medicinal Chemistry and dissolved in normal saline before the treatment. On day 1 a single dose of cyclic G-2-AllylP was given centrally (20 ng/animal, i.c.v.) to the animals in groups 2 and 4; saline was administered to groups 1 and 3. The memory tests using Novel Object Recognition Test started either on day 3 (groups 1 and 2) or 24 (groups 3 and 4) after the treatment. On the completion of the NORT, the rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and were perfused transcardially with normal saline followed by 10% formalin. Tissues collected at day 7 in groups 1 and 2, and at day 28 from groups 3 and 4. The brains were kept in the same fixative for a minimum of 2 days before being processed using a standard paraffin embedding procedure. Briefly, small blocks (10Ã10Ã3 mm) of tissue were fixed for up to 24 hrs. The blocks were then infiltrated and embedded with paraffin and cut in ribbons and mounted on slides. Slides were then stored until immunostaining was commenced.</p>

      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0137">Exploratory activity is a typical learning behaviour displayed by animals including humans and rats in novel environments. Exploratory activity decreases over time when the novel becomes familiar and the habituation occurs. In familiar environments, exploratory activity can be reactivated by introducing a novel object. The increase in exploring behaviour once the environment is altered following a habituation provides a measure of the memory for the familiarity and the recognition of the novelty.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0138">In this Example, we carried out two NORTs, one at days 3-6 and the other at 24-27 days. The rats were allowed to familiarise themselves with the testing arena (90Ã60Ã40 cm) in the first day of NORT. In the following two days of each test, four novel objects were placed into the testing arena and the rats had 2 trials each day (each of 15 min duration and 2 hours apart). The time spent on exploring the objects was reduced once the animal tested learned about the objects (training phase). In the last day (day 4 of each test), one familiar object was replaced by a novel object before the second trial (test 6, testing phase). The average time spent on exploring the 3 familiar objects and the time spent on exploration of the novel object was used as a measure for the memory of familiarity and the novelty recognition.</p>

      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0139">It is accepted that the hippocampal formations in humans and animals play a crucial role in a number of memory types (Morris et al. 2006 Europ. J. Neurosci. 23, 2829). The specific functionality remains under dispute, but there is an understanding that hippocampus plays a key role in the automatic encoding and initial storage of attended experiences (episodic memory formation), memory consolidation and novelty detection. The first aspect, encoding and short-term storage of memories, is dependant on the synaptic plasticity and synaptic transmission, both of which are linked to glutaminergic neurotransmission.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0140">Glutaminergic transmission is facilitated by two types of glutamate receptors: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalone propionic acid receptors AMPA or non-NMDA receptors.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0141">APMA receptor subunit GluR1 is a post-synaptic receptor and has been commonly used for memory measurement. GluR1 is believed to mediate calcium influx, and has a vital function in synaptic plasticity related to learning. It has been previously suggested (Hayashi et al., 2000) that incorporation of GluR1 into synapses might be important for long-term potentiation (LTP), which is essential for learning and memory.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0142">It had been demonstrated that NMDA receptor subunit NR1 is crucial for formation of spatial memory. In knock-out models where the R1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region was selectively knocked-out, the long-term potentiation was shown to be abolished (Tsien 1996).</p>

      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0151">Hippocampal slices from regions CA1 (granular cell layer, strata oriens and radiatum) and CA3 (pyramidal cell layer) were stained for AMPA receptors GluR1.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0152">In CA3 there was no change in the number of receptors in each region on either day 7 or 28. There was however a significant increase in the number of AMPA receptors in CA1 (granular cell layer) (<figref>FIG. 4</figref>) and CA1 stratum oriens (<figref>FIG. 5</figref>) and on day 28.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0153">That histological change was correlated with the improved performance in the novel object recognition test. The improved memory (<figref>FIG. 2</figref>) was correlated to the elevated AMPA glutamate receptor-1 (<figref>FIG. 3</figref>). We concluded that cG-2AllylP improved glutaminergic neuro-transmission (GluR1) at post-synaptic level.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0154">We observed that cG-2-AllylP treatment resulted in a long term increase in GluR1 staining on the post-synapses and increased the density of pre-synaptic vesicles.

That increase is a marker of increased synaptic plasticity and a clear indication of synaptogenesis which is a most likely cause of the improvement in the performance of the treated groups in applied memory tests.</p>

      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0159">Four middle aged Wistar male rats (12 months) were divided into two groups: one vehicle-treated (n=2) and one cG-2-AllylP-treated (n=2). The rats were treated subcutaneously with 3 mg/kg/day of either saline or cG-2-AllylP for 7 days. On day 21 of the experiment the animals were sacrificed and the hippocampal tissue was harvested. Semi-thin sections of the tissue were fixed with OsO<sub>4 </sub>and embedded in resin. CA1 stratum oriens and CA3 sections were then sliced into ultra-thin, 80 nm slices and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Approximately 50 synapses per animal were analysed, synapse type classified and vesicle density was measured using AnalySISÂ®.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0160">Transmission electron microscopy was used to count the total number of vesicles on the slides. The average density was calculated by measuring the total area (using AxioVision software) and using the number of vesicles.

      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0162">We conclude from these studies that scopolamine treatment can decrease cognitive function in animals, and that these changes can mimic cognitive impairment in human beings with one or more of a variety of neurological conditions. Additionally, we conclude that cG-2-AllylP can improve cognitive function in scopolamine-treated animals and in animals with normal aging-related cognitive impairment. Further, we conclude that cG-2-AllylP can increase synaptogenesis, increase AMPA receptors, increase neural plasticity, can stabilize synaptic modifications and can increase novelty recognition.</p>

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0165">To determine the effects of cG-2-AllylP and cyclic cyclopentyl-G-2-MeP on neuronal cells in vitro, a series of studies was carried out using cerebellar explants from adult rats. In vitro systems are suitable for studying neuronal proliferation, neurite growth, formation of nerve bundles, and effects of toxins on neural cells, effects that parallel effects observed in vivo. Thus, results of studies using in vitro cerebellar explants are predictive of effects of interventions in vivo.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0166">In a first series of studies, effects of glutamate on cerebellar explants were determined. At physiological concentrations, glutamate is a neurotransmitter in the CNS of mammals, including humans. However, at sufficiently high concentrations, glutamate is neurotoxic, resulting in neuronal cell death. Because glutamate is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS of mammals, including humans, and because glutamate neurotoxicity is recognized in the art as reflective of neurotoxicity in general, and including cell death and degeneration, it is a valuable tool useful for identifying and characterizing agents effective in treatment of neurodegeneration and neural cell death.</p>

      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0175">To determine whether cG-2AllylP might prevent neuronal injury in response to stroke, cardiac arterial bypass graft surgery (CABG) or other hypoxic insults, a series of studies were carried out in rats that had been exposed to hypoxic-ischemic injury (HI). Adult rats (Wistar, 280-310 g, male) were used. The modified Levine model preparation and experimental procedures were used (Rice et al, 1981, <i>Ann. Neurol.: </i>9: 131-141; Guan et al J., 1993, <i>Cereb. Blood Flow Metab.: </i>13(4): 609-16). These procedures in brief, consist of an HI injury induced by unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by inhalational asphyxia in the animals with an implanted lateral ventricular cannula. A guide cannula was stereotaxically placed on the top of the dura 1.5 mm to the right of the mid-line and 7.5 mm anterior to the interaural zero plane under halothane anaesthesia. The right carotid artery was double ligated two days after the cannulation. After 1 hour recovery from the anaesthesia, each of the rats were placed in an incubator where the humidity (90Â±5%) and temperature (31Â°Â±0.5Â° C.) were controlled for another hour, then exposed to hypoxia (6% oxygen) for 10 min. The animals were kept in the incubator for an additional 2 hours before treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0176">Nine pairs of rats were treated intracerebral ventricularly (icy) with either cG-2AllylP (2 ng) or its vehicle (normal saline) 2 hours after hypoxic-ischemic insult. Rats in each group were simultaneously infused with cG-2-AllylP or its vehicle under light anaesthesia (1.5% halothane) 2 hours after the insult. A total volume of 20 Î¼l was infused (icy) over 20 minutes by a micro-infusion pump.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0177">Histological examination was performed on rats 5 days after the hypoxic-ischemic injury. The rats were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital and were perfused transcardially with normal saline followed by 10% formalin. The brains were kept in the same fixative for a minimum of 2 days before being processed using a standard paraffin imbedding procedure.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0178">Coronal sections 8 Î¼m in thickness were cut from the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus and were stained with thionin and acid fuchsin. The histological outcome was assessed at three levels: (1) the mid level of the striatum, (2) where the completed hippocampus first appeared and (3) the level where the ventral horn of the hippocampus just appears. The severity of tissue damage was scored in the striatum, cortex and the CA1-2, CA3, CA4 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Tissue damage was identified as neuronal loss (acidophilic (red) cytoplasm and contracted nuclei), pan-necrosis and cellular reactions. Tissue damage was scored using the following scoring system: 0: tissue showed no tissue damage, 1: &lt;5% tissue was damaged, 2: &lt;50% tissue was damaged, 3: &gt;50% tissue was damaged and 4: &gt;95% tissue was damaged.</p>

      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0179">The results of this study are shown in <figref>FIG. 14</figref>. <figref>FIG. 14</figref> shows that hypoxic-ischemic injury (left bars of each set) resulted in significant damage scores in each of the areas of the brain studied. <figref>FIG. 14</figref> also shows that central administration of a relatively low dose of cG-2-AllylP (right bars of each set; 2 ng) significantly reduced the tissue damage in each brain region examined compared to the vehicle treated group (p&lt;0.001).</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0180">It can be seen that cG-2-AllylP can be neuroprotective against neural damage caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury, even when administered after hypoxic-ischemic injury.

Rats were divided into 5 treatment groups treated intracerebral ventricularly (icv) with one of 4 doses of cG-2-AllylP or with its vehicle (normal saline) 2 hours after hypoxic-ischemic insult (1: n-10, 2 ng, 2: n=9, 4 ng; 3: n=9, 20 ng; 4: n=10, 100 ng; and 5: n=9, vehicle).</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0182">
        <figref>FIG. 15</figref> shows hypoxia alone (vehicle) produces neuronal damage scores in all areas of the brain studied. In animals treated with cG-2-AllylP, hypoxia had less effect, even though the agent was administered after the hypoxic/ischemic injury. The neuroprotective effect was observed for all doses of cG-2-AllylP, except for the highest dose (100 ng) administered to the striatum. However, in all other sites and with all other doses, cG-2-AllylP lessened the neural damage effects of hypoxia/ischemia. Moreover, cG-2-AllylP had an increased efficacy in brain regions that experienced progressive injury associated with delayed cell death, such as that associated with apoptosis. In brain regions such as the dentate gyms and the cerebral cortex, that are more resistant to HI injury, the progression of injury is known to be slower and more severe than in the brain regions that are more sensitive to HI injury such as the striatum and the CA1-2, CA3 and CA4 sub-regions of the hippocampus. This result shows that cG-2allylP can be beneficial in treatment of chronic neurological disorders.</p>
