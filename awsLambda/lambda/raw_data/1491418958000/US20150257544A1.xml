      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates to a child carrier and more particularly but not exclusively a child carrier for use in a car as an alternative to a child seat to serve as a safety restraint for the child.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Whilst travelling with children in a vehicle it is important that the children are correctly strapped in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The rules governing typos of strapping provisions required for children whilst travelling vary in different countries.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In some countries a child must travel in a child seat, whereas in others small child may be legally carried in the arms of the parent. Some countries also specify a direction in which children of certain weights or heights should face whilst travelling and in what position in the car they may be placed for example in the passenger seat or back seat therefore the equipment required may vary from place to place.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Parents or carers, or users, are always keen to provide the highest safety measures possible for their children however the varying laws in different countries may mean that they cannot always guarantee that their preferred travel arrangements will be available or that they will have the necessary equipment with them.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Also when abroad and particularly when travelling, it may not always be viable or possible to carry a home-standard child seat and therefore an alternative must be sought.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present invention therefore arose in order to overcome problems associated with travelling with children in vehicles when standardised child travel arrangements are not available, and a user desires a standardised or familiar arrangement the user can trust; particularly where no arrangements for children are not feasible or are unavailable and a user does not feel comfortable or needs reassurance.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Granted United States patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,618,097 (GHATGE) discloses a vehicle seat belt guide comprising a support body having at least one anchor position and a belt diverter supported by and selectively position able relative to the support body, said support body being of a substantially elongated form and substantially rigid, the or each said anchor position of the support body being adapted in use to engage with and be supported by a support member extending from a vehicle seat back to a headrest and said support body comprising a guide formation which extends along at least a part of the length of the elongate support body whereby, in use, and with the support body extending, substantially perpendicular to the normal direction of travel of the vehicle, the seat belt diverter is movable laterally relative to the direction in which the support member extends from a vehicle seat back to a headrest, the seat belt guide further comprising clamping means to secure the belt diverter in a required position relative to the support body.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">United States patent application U.S. Pat. No. 3,769,938 WUDZIAK) discloses an infant's garment having an elongated shirt like body, said shirt like body comprising a covering for the shoulders and torso of an infant including a front side and a back side, said shirt like body having a neck opening at one end and a crotch portion in the other end, manually releasable snap means joined to said other end for attaching said crotch portion to a mating ring member that is joined to the shirt like body below said neck opening near the center of the back side of said garment, means for enlarging the neck opening to allow passage of the infant's head therethrough and for thereafter closing the neck opening, a pair of waist encircling band portions, each of said waist encircling band portions being attached to opposite sides of the front side and the back side of said garment at the central portion of said garment for securing the garment around the waist of the infant, and means comprising a pair of snap connected leashes attached to said waist encircling band portions for tying the infant in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Granted European patent EP 1 565 091 (BERGKVIST) discloses a child harness that includes a child carrying pouch which is positioned on the front side of the harness, so as to be supported on the chest side of the wearer, and that further includes two strap loops which pass around respective shoulders of the wearer, wherein the loops are mutually fastened by means of a fastener means on the rear side of the harness, characterised in that the strap of each loop has a longitudinally extending thickened edge on the mutually adjacent edges of the loops on the rear side of the harness; and in that the fastener means has along each of two opposite edges an undercut groove which slidingly receives a respective edge thickening of the adjacent strap loops, therewith allowing the fastener means to slide along the straps of the loops.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In contrast the present invention provides a highly portable and flexible means. of providing child safety in a myriad of vehicles both with arrangements for child safety and with none, and more particularly provides a safety conscious, portable and simple-to-use alternative to as user simply holding baby on their lap whenever a dedicated infant seat is not available.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">According to the present invention there is provided a child carrier for transporting a child in a car comprising: a child harness mounted. on a backboard that is rigid at least in part, said backboard comprising at least one fastening arranged in Use to attach the carrier to a user in a seat restraint. The harness comprises two belts arranged in use to pass over the child's shoulders, one for each arm, two belts to secure around the child's waist, and a belt between the child's legs.</p>

The belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b> may be arranged in use such that all the belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b> connect to one main buckle <b>20</b> to form the harness <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0041">In preferred embodiments the backboard <b>2</b> further comprises a pouch <b>4</b>. The pouch <b>4</b> may be a pocket with leg holes in which the child can be seated. Said pouch <b>4</b> may be attached in use to the belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b>, internally or externally, permanently or temporarily. Preferably the pouch <b>4</b> is permanently attached at least on the tapered section of the backboard <b>2</b> allowing the pouch <b>4</b> to flap open. This allows the pouch <b>4</b> to be easily cleaned and the child to be easily placed into the pouch <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0042">Typically in use the backboard <b>2</b> may be arranged to be attached to the user by the fastening <b>10</b> or strapping <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> as described above.

In such embodiments therefore the backboard <b>2</b> is held to the user by the strapping <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the restraint when use. In preferred embodiments the restraint is merely passed over and around the user which may be accomplished with the carrier in place, wherein for example the fastening <b>10</b> including strapping <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> may be displaced or detached to allow passage of the restraint in use on at least one side of the user and carrier <b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0044">In some embodiments the backboard <b>2</b> may therefore include at least one guide loop as additional fastening to guide and secure the restraint in a preferred position. Ideally the loops may be opened to allow the restraint to pass through and then closed around the restraint to hold it in position.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0045">In preferred embodiments the carrier includes a padded layer that covers the restraint and/or backboard <b>2</b> in use so as to not rub or pinch the child. Ideally the padded layer may be removable so as to be easily washed if required and may accordingly be secured by temporary means such as press studs or poppers <b>7</b>, buttons, zippers, or hook and loop.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0046">In embodiments with the pouch <b>4</b>, once the restraint is in place the pouch <b>4</b> may then be raised from its open position and attached to the backboard <b>1</b> Preferably the pouch <b>4</b> is lifted from its open position and is removably attached to the backboard <b>2</b> by a plurality of poppers <b>7</b> although it is envisaged that other forms of attachment such as hooks, buckles, clips, clasps or hook and loop attachment such as Velcroâ¢ may be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0047">In some countries the direction that the child should face when being transported in the vehicle is legislated.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0048">In order therefore to accommodate both orientations said pouch <b>4</b> may include a head support that cups or supports the back of the child's head whilst travelling seated backwards but that can be folded down and secured in place, typically by a popper <b>7</b>, to allow space for the face of the child when travelling forwards.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0049">Preferably the pouch <b>4</b> is formed of a strong, durable, lightweight, breathable fabric. Ideally the pouch <b>4</b> is padded for comfort and so as to provide support for the child but is not rigid or not wholly rigid so that the pouch <b>4</b> may be easily displaced and/or stowed when not in use.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0050">In some preferred embodiments the harness <b>3</b> belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b> may accept or be arranged with a removable loop <b>6</b> for holding toys so that the child can play whilst travelling. Preferably the loop <b>6</b> may attach to the buckle or an outward facing area of the belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b> so as not to rub the child in use. In some embodiments the loop <b>6</b> may encompass the harness belts <b>15</b>-<b>19</b>.</p>
