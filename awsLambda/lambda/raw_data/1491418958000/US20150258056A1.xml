      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The numbers in parenthesis refer to the numbered references listed at the end of the specification.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is two to four times higher in patients with diabetes mellitus (1). One component of the cardiovascular disease, intimal thickening (also known as intimal hyperplasia and neointimal formation), is increased in diabetics. Diffuse intimal thickening creates a fertile environment for the initial lipid deposition that occurs early in cardiovascular disease ((2-4) and pathological intimal thickening enhances plaque stability while also increasing plaque burden as cardiovascular disease progresses (5, 6). Additionally, increased intimal thickening is also a major limiting factor to the efficacy of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) as it leads to restenosis, the re-sealing of an artery after PCI (7, 8). Thus, there is a need for methods that prevent the increased intimal thickening in diabetic patients.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">This invention is based, in part, on the discovery that one aspect of diabetes mellitus is an increase in microRNA-221 and microRNA-222 (together referred to as miR-221/222) in the arteries. Increases in miR-221/222 lead to accelerated intimal thickening and reduce the effectiveness of the standard of care for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore this invention is based, in part, on the discovery that a) this increase in miR-221/222 occurs due to an increase in the activity of the protein kinase pathway consisting of Ras, raf-1, Mitogen Activated Kinase Kinase (MEK)-1 and MEK-2, Extracellular signal Response Kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2 (collectively referred to as the ERK pathway); and b) that the increase in miR-221/222 in the vasculature can be inhibited by activation of 5â² adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Inhibition of the ERK pathway, activation of AMPK, or direct inhibition of miR-221/222 reduces intimal thickening to levels similar to that seen in non-diabetics.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention is a method of inhibiting the increase in miR-221/222 in the vasculature of diabetic patients for the purpose of preventing accelerated cardiovascular disease through inhibition of ERK pathway, direct inhibition of miR-221/222, or activation of AMPK.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The ERK pathway consists of a series of proteins that are activated in response to a stimulus. The ERK pathway has multiple stimuli that promote the activation of the small GIPase, ras, which in turn activates Raf. Raf then activates MEK 1 and 2, which in turn activates ERK 1 and 2 (also known as mitogen activated protein kinase p42/44). A novelty of this invention is that while previous reports suggest that inhibition of the ERK pathway with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, is not effective in reducing the cell proliferative aspect of intimal thickening following arterial injury in non-diabetic animals(9), under diabetic conditions the ERK pathway becomes dominant in regulating intimal thickening. The present invention is derived from the finding and includes a method using inhibition of activation of any member of the ERK pathway to lower miR-221/222 levels in the vasculature and in turn reduce the increased intimal thickening that occurs in response to diabetes.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">As such, one embodiment of the invention comprises a method using a composition selected from the group of raf inhibitors that include Sorafenib Tosylate (Bay 43-9006, Nexavar), PLX4032 (Vemurafenib, RG7204, Zelboraf, RO5185426), SB 590885 (5-[2-[4-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethoxy]ph-enyl]-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]-2,3-dihydr-o-1H-inden-1-one oxime), GDC 0879 ((E)-2,3-Dihydro-5-[1-(2-hydroxyethy-1)-3-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-1H-inden-1-one-oxime), GW 5074 (3-(3,5-Dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzyliden-e)-5-iodo-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one), L-779,450 (2-Chloro-5-[2-Phenyl-5-(4-pyridinyl-)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]phenol), ZM 336372 (3-(Dimethylamino)-N-[3-[(4-hydroxyb-enzoyl)-amino]-4-methylphenyl]benzamide), PLX-4720, RAF265 (CHIR-265), NVP-BHG712, and AZ628.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method using a composition selected from the group of MEK inhibitors that include AZD6244 (Selumetinib, ARRY-142886), PD0325901 (PD325901), C1-1040 (PD 184352), U0126, PD98059, GSK1120212 (JTP-74057, trametinib), BIX02188, BIX02189, AS703026, and AZD8330 (ARRY-424704). Additionally, one embodiment of the invention comprises a method using a composition that inhibits ERK.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Another embodiment of the invention is a method using a composition that activates AMPK. This composition can be selected from the group of AMPK agonists: metformin, AICAR, and or A-769662.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">Another embodiment of the invention includes methods that directly inhibit miR-221/222 through silencing RNA (siRNA) methods. Silencing RNA are small ribonucleic acids that are designed to bind to other nucleic acids and either inhibit their function or promote their degradation. In order to promote stability and efficacy of these silencing RNAs, their structure is often modified. These modifications include changes to the nucleic acid backbone to a phosphorothioate, 2â²-O methylation (2â²OMe) or locked nucleic acids.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Intimal thickening is the major cause for failure of PCI and this is exaggerated in diabetic patients. Thus, another embodiment of the invention is a method for treating or preventing restenosis and vascular stenosis in subjects with diabetes mellitus comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that reduces miR-221 and/or miR-222 levels in the vasculature combined with an inhibitor of mTOR. This mTOR inhibitor may be selected from a group consisting of BEZ235 (NVP-BEZ235), Everolimus (RAD001), Rapamycin (Sirolimus, AY-22989, WY-090217), AZD8055, Temsirolimus (CCI-779, Torisel), P1-103, KU-0063794, Deforolimus (Ridaforolimus, AP23573, MK-8669), PP242, XL765, GSK1059615, WYE-354, OSI-027, GDC-0980 (RG7422), GSK2126458, PKI-587, PF-04691502, WYE-125132, WYE-687, NVP-BGT226, WAY-600, AZD2014, INK 128, Torin1.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The standard of care for preventing restenosis is the use of drug eluting stents that release an anti-restenotic agent over a prolonged period. Thus another embodiment of the invention is a method for treating or preventing restenosis and vascular stenosis in subjects with diabetes mellitus comprising insertion of an intraluminal device impregnated with and configured to release a compound that inhibits increases in miR-221 and/or miR-222 in the vasculature and an mTOR inhibitor.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Molecular mechanism related to the increase in miR-221/222 in the vasculature of subjects with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus leads to an increase in activation of Ras which then activates Raf. Raf then activates MEK1/2. MEK 1/2 activates ERK 1/2 which in turn leads to an increase in miR-221/222. Inhibition of any of these targets will block the increase in miR-221/222 that occurs in diabetes mellitus. Activation of AMPK by an AMPK agonist will also reduce miR-221/222.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The present invention provides methods for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. As used herein, the term âcardiovascular diseaseâ refers to pathological processes that lead to a restriction of blood flow through the blood vessel. This restriction may result from the development of an atherosclerotic plaque or through restenosis. In both cases intimal thickening plays an important role in the development and progress of the cardiovascular disease and the restriction of blood flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Intimal thickening is the growth of the innermost layer of the artery wall. The artery wall consists of three layers. The outer most is the adventia, which holds the artery in place. The middle layer is the media. This layer consists largely of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that function to dilate and constrict the artery as needed. The innermost layer is the intima and includes the endothelium that forms a barrier between the blood and the artery. Intimal thickening consists of VSMC migrating from the media to the intima and proliferating. As the cells proliferate, the intima becomes thicker and lumen of artery narrows restricting blood flow.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Atherosclerotic plaque development occurs when lipids (e.g. cholesterol) are deposited in the artery wall and elicit an inflammatory response in the cells that comprise the artery wall. This inflammatory response leads to the recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells and increased intimal thickening. Together these processes lead to the development of lesion within the artery wall that contains a necrotic core that develops from the processing of the lipids by the inflammatory cells that is surrounded by vascular smooth muscle cells that form a âfibrous capâ that stabilizes the plaque. Continued growth of this lesion leads to a narrowing of the arterial lumen and a restriction of blood flow. At this point, the restriction of blood flow can lead to ischemia in the organs supplied by the blood vessel resulting in angina or claudication. Ultimately, the fibrous cap erodes away and a rupture occurs which leads to myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Restenosis refers to the re-narrowing of a blood vessel following treatment of a narrowing (stenosis) with percutaneous intervention (e.g. balloon angioplasty). In this case, intimal thickening is the major factor driving blood vessel narrowing. The inflation of a balloon at the site of a vascular stenosis leads to an inflammatory response that drives increased intimal thickening. This form of intimal thickening is often referred to as neointimal hyperplasia, as it represents the accelerated proliferation (hyperplasia) of VSMCs to form a new intima. <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that intimal thickening in response to injury to the artery is increased in a mouse model of diabetes. It further shows that inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which is highly effective at blocking intimal thickening in non-diabetics is no longer effective in the diabetic mouse model. <figref>FIG. 2</figref> shows that VSMCs isolated from the mouse model of diabetes exhibit increased proliferation and migration compared to VSMCs isolated from non-diabetic mice and a resistance to the effects of the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. These results mimic clinical findings with mTOR inhibitor eluting stents that show an increase in restenosis in the diabetic population(10-13).</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Multiple aspects of diabetes result in an inflammatory insult to the vasculature, including hyperglycemia (14), hypoglycemia (15-17), inflammation (15, 18), and reactive oxygen species (19-21). While it is clear that this increased injury to the vasculature promotes increased cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, changes in the cellular and molecular responses to these insults may also play an important role in the increased cardiovascular disease in the diabetic population (20, 22, 23). The present invention is a method for preventing the increased intimal thickening that occurs in diabetic patients. VSMC proliferation and migration are regulated by the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Quiescent VSMCs maintain an elevated level of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>that blocks VSMC proliferation and migration and inhibits neointimal hyperplasia (24-29). Upon injury, p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein is down regulated through the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) as neointimal hyperplasia progresses (24-27). Inhibition of mTOR restores normal p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>levels, blocks VSMC proliferation and migration and is effective in the prevention of in-stent restenosis (27, 30-32). <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate that the ability of inhibition of mTOR to produce an increase in p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>in injured arteries, as seen in the non-diabetic mice, is lost in diabetic mice. <figref>FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref> illustrate that the loss of effect of mTOR inhibition on p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>levels is also seen in VSMCs isolated from these mice. <figref>FIG. 3E</figref> demonstrates that the p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein levels are reduced in uninjured arteries of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic mice. <figref>FIG. 3F</figref> demonstrates that mRNA encoding p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>is also reduced in the vasculature of diabetic mice, Together these data demonstrate that diabetes promotes a decrease in p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein, in the absence of injury to the vasculature, through a loss of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA. This explains the resistance to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin seen in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, as mTOR inhibitors increase p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein by blocking protein degradation. Inhibition of mTOR will not increase p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein levels when p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA is reduced. The present invention is a method for restoring normal regulation of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein in diabetic patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">
        <figref>FIG. 4A</figref> shows that in the diabetic mice there is an increased activation of the extracellular response kinase 1/2 (ERK) pathway, as has been previously reported (11, 12, 33). <figref>FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref> demonstrate that treatment of diabetic mice with an inhibitor MEK 1/2 which blocks activation of the ERK pathway restores normal levels of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA and protein in the diabetic mice. <figref>FIG. 4D</figref> illustrates that the reduced p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA seen in VSMCs from the diabetic mice results from accelerated degradation rather than decreased mRNA production. Further <figref>FIG. 4D</figref> demonstrates that inhibition of the ERK pathway with PD98059, a MEK 1/2 inhibitor, is effective at blocking the accelerated degradation of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA. Likewise, <figref>FIG. 4E</figref> shows that inhibition of ERK 1/2 directly with silencing RNA inhibits the accelerated degradation of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA in VSMCs from diabetic mice. Thus, elevated activation of the ERK pathway promotes the loss of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>that leads to increased intimal thickening in diabetes. This invention provides methodology to prevent the loss of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>in the vasculature of diabetic patients and the subsequent increased intimal thickening.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The present invention includes the administrator of âtherapeutically effective amountsâ of compounds in order to inhibition ERK pathway activation, activate AMPK, or directly inhibit miR-221/222. Therapeutically effective amounts are defined as doses that achieve concentrations in the vasculature at or above the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The ERK pathway, illustrated in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, has multiple stimuli that promote activate the small GTPase, Ras, which in turn activates Raf. Raf then phosphorylates a mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK 1 and MEK 2), which in turn activates ERK 1/2 (also known as mitogen activated protein kinase). One embodiment of the present invention is a method comprising inhibition of the ERK pathway. This can be achieved through inhibition of activation of any member of the ERK pathway. Thus, one embodiment of this invention is a method using a composition selected from the group of raf inhibitors that include Sorafenib Tosylate (Bay 43-9006, Nexavar), PLX4032 (Vemurafenib, RG7204, Zelboraf, RO5185426), SB 590885 (5-[2-[4-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethoxy]ph-enyl]-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]-2,3-dihydr-o-1H-inden-1-one oxime), GDC 0879 ((E)-2,3-Dihydro-5-[1-(2-hydroxyethy-1)-3-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]-1H-inden-1-one-oxime), GW 5074 (3-(3,5-Dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzyliden-e)-5-iodo-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one), L-779,450 (2-Chloro-5-[2-Phenyl-5-(4-pyridinyl-)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]phenol), ZM 336372 (3-(Dimethylamino)-N-[3-[(4-hydroxyb-enzoyl)-amino]-4-methylphenyl]benzamide), PLX-4720, RAF265 (CHIR-265), NVP-BHG712, and AZ628. Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method using a composition selected from the group of MEK inhibitors that include AZD6244 (Selumetinib, ARRY-142886), PD0325901 (PD325901), CI-1040 (PD 184352), U0126, PD98059, GSK1120212 (JTP-74057, trametinib), BIX02188, BIX02189, AS703026, and AZD8330 (ARRY-424704). Two additional embodiments of the invention comprise methods using a composition that inhibits ERK or Ras.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Increased ERK pathway activity promotes an increase in two microRNAs known to promote intimal thickening, miR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221/222). miR-221/222 accelerate intimal thickening through degradation of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>mRNA. <figref>FIG. 6</figref> demonstrates that diabetic mice exhibit increased levels of miR-221/222 in the vasculature compared to non-diabetic mice both before and after injury and that this increase is blocked by administration of the MEK 1/2 inhibitor, U0126. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> demonstrates that both miR-221/222 are elevated in the vasculature of diabetic mice and that treatment with a silencing RNA, 2â²-OMe-miR-222, reduces miR-221/222 levels back to normal.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Silencing RNA (siRNA) is an effective method for inhibition of microRNA activity (34). One embodiment of this invention is the use of silencing RNA in this manner to directly inhibit the increase in miR-221/222 in the vasculature of diabetic patients. This silencing RNA will be comprised of the ribonucleic acid sequence: 5â²-ACCCAGUAGCCAGAUGUAGCU-3â², where A is adenosine, C is cytosine, G is guanine, and U is uridine. The silencing RNA may consist of a ribonucleic acid with a phosphorothioate, locked nucleic acid, or 2â²-O-methylated backbone. In the phosphorothioate, a sulfur is substituted for a non-bridging oxygen in the phosphate backbone of an oligonucleotide. A 2â²O-methylated RNA is a ribonucleic acid where a methyl group has been added to the 2â² hydroxyl group of the ribose unit. A locked nucleic acid is a nucleic acid where the nucleotide is modified with an extra bridge connecting the 2â² oxygen and 4â² carbon.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">
        <figref>FIG. 8</figref> demonstrates that the increase in miR-221/222 diminishes its targets, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, c-Kit, and the p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). This in turn promotes cell proliferation and migration. <figref>FIG. 9</figref> demonstrates that inhibition of miR-221/222 with 2â²OMe-miR-222 restores levels of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>protein to normal levels. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> demonstrates that reducing miR-221/222 levels to the levels seen in non-diabetic mice is effective at reducing intimal thickening in the diabetic mice to levels similar to that of normal mice.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">One embodiment of the invention is a method comprising agonists of 5â² adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to block the increase in ERK activity and reduce miR-221/222 expression. AMPK activation reduces ERK activation in response to IGF-1 (35). <figref>FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> demonstrate that two AMPK agonists, metformin and AICAR (respectively), are effective in reducing miR-221/222 in the VSMCs from diabetic mice to levels similar to VSMCs from non-diabetic mice. <figref>FIG. 13</figref> demonstrates that among patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, those diabetic patients that are not currently taking metformin exhibit elevated levels of miR-221/222 in their internal mammary arteries. Furthermore, those diabetic patients currently on metformin therapy exhibited normal levels of miR-221/222 in their internal mammary arteries.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Our data show that in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes, neointimal hyperplasia following femoral wire injury is increased in manner resistant to mTOR inhibition. This resistance to mTOR inhibition is derived from the down-regulation of p27<sup>Kip1 </sup>in an mTOR independent manner by the increased miR-221/222 levels caused by increased ERK activity. This invention describes the use of methods that inhibit activation of the ERK pathway or promote activation of the AMPK pathway to block the increase in miR-221/222, inhibit the increase in intimal thickening associated with diabetes and restoring the normal response of the vasculature to mTOR</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">As intimal thickening is the major component of restenosis, one embodiment of this invention is the use of a miR-221/222 lowering agents in combination with an mTOR inhibitor for the prevention of restenosis in patients with diabetes. The miR-221/222 lower agent may be an ERK pathway inhibitor, an AMPK agonist, or a silencing RNA directly targeting miR-221/222. The mTOR inhibitor to be combined with the miR-221/222 lowering agent could be selected from a group consisting of BEZ235 (NVP-BEZ235), Everolimus (RAD001), Rapamycin (Sirolimus, AY-22989, WY-090217), AZD8055, Temsirolimus (CCI-779, Torisel), PI-103, KU-0063794, Deforolimus (Ridaforolimus, AP23573, MK-8669), PP242, XL765, GSK1059615, WYE-354, OSI-027, GDC-0980 (RG7422), GSK2126458, PKI-587, PF-04691502, WYE-125132, WYE-687, NVP-BGT226, WAY-600, AZD2014, INK 128, Torin1. As the standard method for administering mTOR inhibitors for the prevention of restenosis is drug eluting stents, an embodiment of this invention is an intraluminal device impregnated with and configured to release a compound that inhibits increases in miR-221 and/or miR-222 in the vasculature and an mTOR inhibitor. The addition of the miR-221/222 lowering agent restore normal regulation of intimal thickening that is sensitive to mTOR inhibition making the standard anti-restenotic therapies effective in diabetic patients.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an example of the present invention. In non-diabetic mice local delivery of rapamycin is highly effective at reducing intimal thickening in response to wire injury. In diabetic mice, intimal thickening is increased and local delivery of rapamycin is no longer effective at reducing intimal thickening. Co-administration of the MEK 1/2 inhibitor, U0126, has minimal effects in the non-diabetic mice, but restores the ability of rapamycin to intimal thickening in the diabetic mice.</p>
