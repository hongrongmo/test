      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Pet food is food specifically manufactured for consumption by pets. Similar to humans, it is important that pets receive proper nutritional content from their food. Unfortunately, some pets may have poor dietary habits and may refuse to adequately consume pet food that serves their nutritional needs (for example, due to lack of flavor). Pets may have a disposition to eat unhealthy foods, such as food that may be flavorful but low in nutritional content. In such cases, a pet may not be adequately meeting its daily nutritional needs.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">As such, there is a need to provide food for pets that provides both nutritional value and flavor so as to be healthy and enjoyable for consumption by a pet.</p>

      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">Other aspects will be apparent from the following description of example embodiments and the associated figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">Grinding Apparatus</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Reference will be made to <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> which illustrate an example pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b>. <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> each illustrate the pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> using a different view. For example, <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view, <figref>FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exploded view, <figref>FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a side view and <figref>FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a bottom view of a cap of an example pet flavor grinding apparatus of <figref>FIG. 3</figref> taken along line <figref>FIG. 4-FIG</figref>. <b>4</b> of <figref>FIG. 3</figref>. Features and components of the pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> will now be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> is used to break down a pet flavor tablet <b>150</b> into smaller parts. The pet flavor tablet <b>150</b> may be referred to as simply a tablet <b>150</b> at various portions of this document. The pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> may be used to grind the tablet <b>150</b> into smaller pieces, which may be referred to as grinds. These grinds may be applied to food for consumption by a pet. For example, these grinds may be applied to pet food. Pet food is food specifically manufactured for consumption by pets. In some instances, the grinds may be applied to food that is not pet food. For example, the grinds may be applied to human food.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">In the example embodiment of <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> includes a container <b>120</b> and a grinding mechanism <b>130</b> which is coupled to the container <b>120</b>. The container <b>120</b> defines a tablet-storing space <b>124</b> which stores one or more tablets <b>150</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The container <b>120</b>, in the example embodiment, includes a top end <b>122</b> and a bottom end <b>123</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the top end <b>122</b> is open while the bottom end <b>123</b> is closed. The closed bottom end <b>123</b> has an external surface which is flat to support the pet flavor grinding apparatus <b>100</b> when it is set on a surface, such as a table.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">In the example, the grinding mechanism <b>130</b> is provided on a cap <b>110</b> of the container <b>120</b>. The cap <b>110</b> is removably attached to the container <b>120</b> at a top end <b>122</b> of the container. For example, in the perspective view of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the cap <b>110</b> is attached to the container <b>120</b>, while in the exploded view of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the cap <b>110</b> is separated from the container <b>120</b>. In the example embodiment, the cap <b>110</b> and the top end <b>122</b> of the container <b>120</b> are both threaded and the threading is used to attach the cap <b>110</b> to the container <b>120</b>. That is, the cap <b>110</b> may be screwed onto the container <b>120</b> using the threading. When the cap <b>110</b> is attached to the container, the container <b>120</b> is closed; the open top end <b>122</b> is covered by the cap <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">When the cap <b>110</b> is removed, pet flavor tablets <b>150</b> may be added to the tablet-storing space <b>124</b> defined by the container <b>120</b> via the open top end <b>122</b>. In such cases, as illustrated, the tablets <b>150</b> may fall (by the action of gravity) towards the bottom end <b>123</b> of the container <b>120</b> when the apparatus <b>100</b> is maintained in an upright position.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The grinding mechanism <b>130</b> is in communication with the tablet-storing space <b>124</b>, and accordingly may receive the stored tablets <b>150</b>. Since the grinding mechanism <b>130</b> is located near the top end <b>122</b> of the container <b>120</b>, the tablets <b>150</b> contact the grinding mechanism when the apparatus <b>100</b> is rotated upside down. In this position, gravity draws the tablets to the grinding mechanism.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The grinding mechanism <b>130</b> may include two spaced apart grinding elements <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>(i.e. an inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>and an outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b</i>) that form a spacing <b>134</b> in between them. The spacing <b>134</b> is in communication with the tablet-storing space <b>124</b>, and tablets <b>150</b> may be received in the spacing <b>134</b> from the tablet-storing space <b>124</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">One of the grinding elements is rotatable or otherwise movable relative to the other of the grinding elements. In the example illustrated, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>includes one or more blades and the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>includes teeth. The outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>is provided on a rotatable portion <b>170</b> of the cap <b>110</b>. The rotatable portion <b>170</b> of the cap <b>110</b> is rotatable relative to other portions of the cap <b>110</b> (such as the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b</i>). The rotatable portion <b>170</b> of the cap <b>110</b> may be rotatably mounted on the other portions of the cap <b>110</b> (i.e., it may be rotatably attached to the non-rotatable portions of the cap <b>110</b>) and, at least a portion of the rotatable portion <b>170</b> is exposed to allow a user to engage that portion. More particularly, a user may rotate the rotatable portion <b>170</b> by gripping the rotatable portion <b>170</b> in one hand and the container <b>120</b> in the other hand and applying forces using each hand in generally opposing directions. More particularly, the hand gripping the container <b>120</b> prevents the container from spinning while a force is applied to the rotatably portion <b>170</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The rotatable portion rotates about an axis of rotation and, in the example illustrated, the container <b>120</b>, the cap <b>110</b>, the rotatable portion <b>170</b>, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>and the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>are all centered on the axis of rotation. In the example illustrated, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>does not move relative to the container <b>120</b>. The inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>is, in the example illustrated, propeller-shaped (it may also be referred to as fan-shaped). In the example illustrated, the propeller-shaped inner grinding element includes four angled blades. Each blade has a sharp edge for chopping the tablet <b>150</b> into grinds. More particularly, rotation of the rotatable portion <b>170</b> of the cap <b>110</b> causes rotation of the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b</i>, which is attached to the rotatable portion <b>170</b>. Under such rotation, the teeth (or other grinding feature) of the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>push a tablet <b>150</b> against the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a</i>, causing the tablet <b>150</b> to be broken down.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Accordingly, when tablets <b>150</b> are positioned in between the grinding elements <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, the rotation of the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>with respect to the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>grinds the tablets <b>150</b>. In such example embodiments, grains from the grinded tablets (i.e. the residue or grinds) may be discharged from the spacing <b>134</b>, and the apparatus <b>100</b>. Such grains may be directed to be discharged on pet food (or other food to be consumed by a pet) so as to provide an additive for the pet food.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In some embodiments, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>and/or the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>may be of other shapes apart from those illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>may not be propeller-shaped. Rather, the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>may be comprised of teeth (i.e. a series of protrusions). Similarly, the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>may not be cylindrically shaped. Similarly, in some embodiments, the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>may not have teeth. The outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>may instead have other features that may facilitate breakdown of the tablet.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Further, it will be appreciated that the grinding mechanism may have multiple grinding stages. For example, in some embodiments, the grinding mechanism may have a first grinding stage located near the container <b>120</b> which breaks the tablets <b>150</b> down into medium-sized grinds and a second grinding stage located downstream from the first grinding stage (i.e. located further away from the container <b>120</b> than the first grinding stage) which breaks the tablets <b>150</b> down into smaller grinds. In some embodiments, the first grinding stage may resemble that illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> (e.g. it may be constructed of an inner grinding element which is propeller-shaped and an outer grinding element which includes teeth) and the second grinding stage may be of a different configuration. For example, the second grinding stage may include an inner grinding element which includes teeth and an outer grinding element which also includes teeth.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Further, while the example illustrates grinding elements that include blades and teeth, in other embodiments, other features could be used instead of blades and teeth. For example, the grinding elements <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>may include graters, edges, or other types of objects to grind the tablets.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Furthermore, in some embodiments, the grinding mechanism may be located at the bottom end <b>123</b> of the container <b>120</b> instead of the top end <b>122</b>. In such embodiments, the bottom end <b>123</b> could be open. In some embodiments, the rotatable portion <b>170</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> is located at an opposite end of the container <b>120</b> as the grinding mechanism <b>130</b>. For example, the rotatable portion could be attached at the top end <b>122</b> and the grinding mechanism <b>130</b> at the bottom end <b>123</b> and a rotatable shaft could connect the rotatable portion to the grinding mechanism <b>130</b>. For example, the rotatable shaft could connect the rotatable portion <b>170</b> to the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a </i>which could be rotatable responsive to rotation of the shaft.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may include a second cap <b>172</b>. In the example illustrated, the second cap may be attached to the cap <b>110</b> on an exterior surface of the cap <b>110</b>. The second cap <b>172</b> may serve a number of functions including, for example, sealing the grinding mechanism <b>130</b> when not in use, preventing fingers or other objects from entering the grinding area, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> has one or more openings on the cap <b>110</b> and/or second cap <b>170</b> downstream from the grinding mechanism (i.e. on the side of the grinding mechanism that expels grinds) that are sized to only allow grinds having a desired maximum size to pass through to outside the apparatus <b>100</b>; grinds that are over the maximum size remain within the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In at least some embodiments, one or more of the components of the apparatus <b>100</b> may be constructed of polycarbonate. For example, in at least some embodiments, any one or more of the following components may be constructed of polycarbonate: the inner grinding element <b>132</b><i>a</i>, the outer grinding element <b>132</b><i>b </i>and/or the cap <b>110</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Pet Flavor Tablet</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The pet flavor tablet <b>150</b> is a tablet <b>150</b> that includes a plurality of ingredients. The plurality of ingredients may include, for example, two ingredients, three ingredients, four ingredients, five ingredients or, in some embodiments, more than five ingredients. The plurality of ingredients may be derived from animal based products and/or non-animal based products (e.g. vegetarian products). Each of the plurality of ingredients may have varying nutritional content. Also, each of the plurality of ingredients may provide varying health benefits to a pet when consumed by the pet. Accordingly, the tablet <b>150</b> is made from a combination of ingredients that provide different nutritional content and/or health benefits. Further, various types of tablets <b>150</b> of differing combination of ingredients may be made to provide different flavors and/or health benefits to the pet.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">The tablet <b>150</b> may be manufactured by various processes. For example, in at least some examples, the tablet <b>150</b> may be manufactured by an extrusion process. Extrusion is a process used to create objects (e.g. tablets <b>150</b>) that are of fixed cross-sectional profiles. A material is pushed or drawn through a die of a desired cross-section to create the object (referred to as the âextrudedâ material). In such cases, a multitude of ingredients may be combined to create a dough. In at least some example embodiments, the dough may include one or more base ingredients (such as, sweet potatoes, quinoa, and/or brewer's yeast, etc.) and/or bulking ingredients (such as, tapioca). The dough may then be combined with other ingredients, such as flakes (which may be vegetable flakes in some embodiments. Example flakes are described in the discussion of the ingredients below). For example, the dough may be sprinkled with the flakes, and mixed to form a homogenous dough mix. The dough mix may then be extruded i.e. pushed or drawn through a die of a desired cross-section (which may be cylindrical shaped, spherical shaped or other types of shape). The result is formation of one or more tablets <b>150</b> in the form of âextrudedâ bits. The tablets <b>150</b> derive their shape from the die. More specifically, the tablets derive their shape based on the manner by which they are cut or shaped by the corresponding cross-sectional shape of the die. As such, the tablets <b>150</b> may be cylindrically shaped, spherically shaped, etc. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, in at least one embodiment, the tablets <b>150</b> are cylindrical in shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">To allow the tablets to be easily broken apart by the grinder, the tablets may be small in size. More particularly, in at least some embodiments, each tablet <b>150</b> may have a width taken along any cross section of the tablet <b>150</b> that is less than 5 millimeters. In some embodiments, each tablet <b>150</b> may have a width taken along any cross section of the tablet <b>150</b> that is less than 4 millimeters.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">In at least some example embodiments, rather than adding the flakes to the dough, the flakes may instead be added to the extruded bits. That is, the flakes may be combined with the extruded bits (which are by-product of the extrusion process described above) to create the tablets <b>150</b>. In at least some example embodiments, other processes may be implemented in order to manufacture the tablets <b>150</b>, such as a cold press process, pressed powder tab process, molding process, etc.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">As mentioned above, in at least some example embodiments, the ingredients within a tablet <b>150</b> may be of varying types and provide various nutritional content. For example, the ingredients may be or include one or more of a carbohydrate, fatty acid, anti-oxidant, fiber, protein, vitamin, food acid, mineral, fat, etc. The different types of nutritional content may be derived from various ingredients.</p>
