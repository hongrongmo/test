      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This invention is directed to methods of treating pain in patients comprising treating patients with noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof at a dosage that provides a therapeutic serum concentration. In one embodiment, the average serum concentration is 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL, including under conditions where the QT interval prolongation does not exceed about 50 milliseconds, and preferably about 30 milliseconds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Noribogaine is sometimes referred to as 12-hydroxyibogaine. U.S. Pat. No. 2,813,873 claims noribogaine albeit as â12-O-demethylibogaineâ while providing an incorrect structural formula for ibogaine. Noribogaine can be depicted by the following formula:</p>

          <img id="img-00001-en" he="19.98mm" wi="51.48mm" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" file="US20150258104A1_00010.PNG" img-format="png" original="US20150258104A1-20150917-C00001.TIF" />
        </chemistry>
      </p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0004">Noribogaine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have recently received significant attention as a non-addictive alkaloid useful in treating drug dependency (U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,456) and as a potent analgesic (U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,737). Such treatment generally requires administration of high doses of noribogaine, typically 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg body weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0005">Noribogaine is a metabolite of ibogaine found in human, dog, rat and monkey. While the prior art suggests that ibogaine at higher doses is useful as a treatment for addiction, use of ibogaine is associated with hallucinations and other negative side effects. In the United States, ibogaine is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Noribogaine has been suggested to have a greater and longer lasting activity in humans than ibogaine for reducing craving for addictive substances and treating chemical dependency. U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,456, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses highly purified noribogaine and teaches that it should be provided at dosages from about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day to treat addiction, although no human data was provided showing an effective dose to treat drug addiction.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0006">Pain is broadly defined as an unpleasant sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. The interpretation of sensory pain occurs when peripheral nerve endings called nociceptors are stimulated and subsequently transmit signals through sensory neurons in the spinal cord. The signals are then transmitted to the brain, at which point the individual becomes aware of the pain.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0007">There are a number of pain categories and classifications, which for example, can be grouped into four categories according to the source and related nociceptors: (1) cutaneous pain; (2) somatic pain; (3) visceral pain; and (4) neuropathic pain. Other pain classifications include acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain is defined as short-term pain or pain with an easily identifiable cause. Acute pain indicates present damage to tissue or disease and may be âfastâ and âsharpâ followed by aching pain. Acute pain is centralized in one area before becoming somewhat spread out. Acute pain generally responds well to medications (e.g., morphine).</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0008">Chronic pain may be medically defined as pain that has lasted six months or longer. This constant or intermittent pain has often outlived its purpose because it does not help the body to prevent injury. It is often more difficult to treat than acute pain. Expert care is generally necessary to treat any pain that has become chronic. In addition, stronger medications are typically used for extended periods in an attempt to control the pain. This can lead to drug dependency. For example, opioids are used in some instances for prolonged periods to control chronic pain. Drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and even psychological addiction may occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0009">Debilitating chronic pain affects tens of millions of people annually and costs hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of medication, physical therapy, and lost production. The current methods for treating chronic pain have a limited success rate and in some cases may result in chemical dependency.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0010">Numerous treatments have been developed in attempts to ameliorate pain in its various categories. However, in many cases, treatment requires the use of addictive or habit-forming substances (e.g., morphine or methadone). While the prior art suggests that ibogaine at higher doses is useful as a treatment for pain, use of ibogaine is associated with hallucinations and other negative side effects. In the United States, ibogaine is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0011">Noribogaine is a metabolite of ibogaine found in human, dog, rat and monkey. However, the therapeutic dosing of noribogaine for treating pain in humans has not previously been addressed, especially as it relates to dosing protocols that are effective, as well as safe. Indeed, prior to the instant invention, it was uncertain as to whether noribogaine could be administered at a dose which was therapeutic while at the same time safe for patients.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0012">Accordingly, there is a significant need for effective, non-addictive treatment for pain, such as chronic, debilitating, nociceptive pain, that reduces the need for habit-forming pain relieving drugs.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0013">While noribogaine has been disclosed for treatment of pain, its use in humans is complicated by the fact that the ranges in the prior art are exceptionally broad (0.01 to 1000 mg/kg body weight). Furthermore, human clinical studies demonstrate that the lower dosing of noribogaine has minimal impact on the alleviation of pain in patients. Thus, the previously disclosed broad range has now been found to be insufficient for human therapy at the lower end of this range.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0014">Moreover, the use of noribogaine imparts a dose dependent prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval, rendering higher dosing of noribogaine unacceptable. A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential ventricular tachyarrhythmia which can result in death.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0015">The current invention is predicated on the surprising discovery that treatment with a narrow dosage range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, between 0.1 mg/kg body weight and 4 mg/kg body weight, provides a therapeutic alleviation of pain. Preferably, the dose range that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds in humans is between 0.1 mg per kg body weight and no more than 3 mg per kg body weight and, more preferably between 0.7 mg per kg body weight and no more than 2 mg per kg body weight, or any subrange or subvalue within the aforementioned ranges.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0016">In some embodiments, the dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is about 120 mg. In some embodiments, the dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is about 100 mg. In some embodiments, the dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is about 1.5 mg/kg body weight. In some embodiments, the dose that provides both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds is about 2 mg/kg body weight.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0017">In some embodiments, the patient is administered an initial dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, followed by one or more additional doses. In one embodiment, the initial dose is from 75 mg to 120 mg. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are lower than the initial dose. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are from 5 mg to 50 mg. In one embodiment, such a dosing regimen provides an average serum concentration of noribogaine of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses maintain an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL over a period of time. In one embodiment, the one or more additional doses are administered periodically.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0018">In a preferred embodiment, the narrow therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate described above do not prolong the QT interval to unacceptable levels in human patients. In some embodiments, patients are administered therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof in a clinical setting with cardiac monitoring. In some embodiments, the patient will be pre-screened to evaluate tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, e.g., to determine whether the patient has any pre-existing cardiac conditions which would disqualify them from treatment with noribogaine. In one embodiment, a patient who exhibits a QT interval prolongation of less than about 20 ms after treatment with one or more therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof will not require further clinical monitoring. In one embodiment, the patient is not monitored after administration of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0019">In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient is sufficient to provide an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL or any subrange or subvalue there between. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of 80 ng/mL to 100 ng/mL.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0020">In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL is administered as a single dose. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of 50 ng/mL to 180 ng/mL is administered as multiple doses. In some embodiments, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 0.1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg. In some embodiments, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 1 mg/kg to 4 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 0.1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg. In another embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from 0.7 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0021">In some embodiments, the serum concentration is sufficient to alleviate or inhibit said pain while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 80 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms.

      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0035">It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of this invention will be limited only by the appended claims.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0036">The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0037">It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms âaâ, âanâ, and âtheâ include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âa compoundâ includes a plurality of compounds.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="2">I. Definitions</heading>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0038">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein the following terms have the following meanings</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0039">The term âaboutâ when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time, amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may vary by (+) or (â) 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or any subrange or subvalue there between. Preferably, the term âaboutâ when used with regard to a dose amount means that the dose may vary by +/â20%. For example, âabout 2 mg/kg noribogaineâ indicates that a patient may be administered a dose of noribogaine between 1.6 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg. In another example, about 120 mg per unit dose of noribogaine indicates that the unit dose may range from 96 mg to 144 mg.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0040">âAdministrationâ refers to introducing an agent, such as noribogaine, into a patient. Typically, an effective amount is administered, which amount can be determined by the treating physician or the like. Any route of administration, such as oral, topical, subcutaneous, peritoneal, intra-arterial, inhalation, vaginal, rectal, nasal, introduction into the cerebrospinal fluid, or instillation into body compartments can be used. The agent, such as noribogaine, may be administered by direct blood stream delivery, e.g. sublingual, buccal, intranasal, or intrapulmonary administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0041">The related terms and phrases âadministeringâ and âadministration ofâ, when used in connection with a compound or pharmaceutical composition (and grammatical equivalents) refer both to direct administration, which may be administration to a patient by a medical professional or by self-administration by the patient, and/or to indirect administration, which may be the act of prescribing a drug. For example, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug and/or provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0042">âPeriodic administrationâ or âperiodically administeringâ refers to multiple treatments that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Periodic administration may also refer to administration of an agent, such as noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or salt or solvate thereof one, two, three, or more times per day. Administration may be via transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, intranasal, intrapulmonary, oral administration, or other administration.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0043">âComprisingâ or âcomprisesâ is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. âConsisting essentially ofâ when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination for the stated purpose. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. âConsisting ofâ shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.</p>

Also encompassed within this invention are derivatives of noribogaine that act as prodrug forms of noribogaine. A prodrug is a pharmacological substance administered in an inactive (or significantly less active) form. Once administered, the prodrug is metabolized in vivo into an active metabolite. Noribogaine derivatives include, without limitation, those compounds set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,456 and 8,362,007; as well as in U.S. patent application Ser.

      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0135">This invention is not limited to any particular chemical form of noribogaine or noribogaine derivative, and the drug may be given to patients either as a free base, solvate, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In the latter case, the hydrochloride salt is generally preferred, but other salts derived from organic or inorganic acids may also be used. Examples of such acids include, without limitation, those described below as âpharmaceutically acceptable saltsâ and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0136">âPharmaceutically acceptable compositionâ refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, preferably a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0137">âPharmaceutically acceptable saltâ refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0138">A âpharmaceutically acceptable solvateâ or âhydrateâ of a compound of the invention means a solvate or hydrate complex that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound, and includes, but is not limited to, complexes of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0139">As used herein the term âsolvateâ is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term âsolvateâ. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest. The term âsolvateâ as used herein refers to complexes with solvents in which noribogaine is reacted or from which noribogaine is precipitated or crystallized. For example, a complex with water is known as a âhydrateâ. Solvates of noribogaine are within the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in organic chemistry that many organic compounds can exist in more than one crystalline form. For example, crystalline form may vary based on the solvate used. Thus, all crystalline forms of noribogaine or the pharmaceutically acceptable solvates thereof are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0140">âTherapeutically effective amountâ or âtherapeutic amountâ refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine, in the context of treating pain, refers to an amount of noribogaine that provides immediate and/or sustained pain relief for at least about 2 hours beyond control (placebo), at least about 5 hours beyond control, and preferably at least about 10 hours beyond control.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0141">The therapeutically effective amount of the compound may be higher or lower, depending on the route of administration used. For example, when direct blood administration (e.g., sublingual, pulmonary and intranasal delivery) is used, a lower dose of the compound may be administered. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine or derivative is from about 50 ng to less than 100 Î¼g per kg of body weight. Where other routes of administration are used, a higher dose of the compound may be administered. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of the compound is from greater than about 1 mg to about 8 mg per kg of body weight per day.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0142">A âtherapeutic levelâ of a drug is an amount of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that is sufficient to treat patients suffering from pain or to treat, prevent, or alleviate acute pain symptoms, but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the âserum concentration.â Where the serum concentration of noribogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term ânoribogaineâ encompasses any form of noribogaine, including derivatives thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0143">A âsub-therapeutic levelâ of noribogaine or pharmaceutical salt and/or solvate thereof that is less than the therapeutic level described above. For example, the sub-therapeutic level of noribogaine may be e.g., 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount (e.g., 120 mg) of noribogaine, or any subvalue or subrange there between. Sub-therapeutic levels of noribogaine may coincide with âmaintenance amountsâ of noribogaine which are amounts, less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provide some attenuation and/or prevention of post-acute withdrawal syndrome in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0144">As defined herein, a âprophylactically effective amountâ of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provides attenuation and/or prevention of a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. For example, the prophylactically effective amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who no longer has a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder (e.g., no longer physically addicted to nicotine). For example, a prophylactically effective amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount. However, a prophylactically effective amount may be the same as the therapeutically effective amount, for example when a patient who is physically addicted to nicotine is administered noribogaine to attenuate cravings for a period of time when nicotine use is not feasible. The prophylactically effective amount may vary for different a diseases or disorders or symptoms of different diseases or disorders.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0145">As defined herein, a âmaintenance amountâ of a drug or an agent is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount that provides attenuation and/or prevention of syndrome disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically manifests a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder. For example, a maintenance amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount, or any subvalue or subrange there between.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0146">The term âdoseâ refers to a range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that provides a therapeutic serum level of noribogaine when given to a patient in need thereof. The dose is recited in a range, for example from 20 mg to 120 mg, and can be expressed either as milligrams or as mg/kg body weight. The attending clinician will select an appropriate dose from the range based on the patient's weight, age, type and degree of pain, health, and other relevant factors, all of which are well within the skill of the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0147">The term âunit doseâ refers to a dose of drug that is given to the patient to provide therapeutic results, independent of the weight of the patient. In such an instance, the unit dose is sold in a standard form (e.g., 20 mg tablet). The unit dose may be administered as a single dose or a series of subdoses. In some embodiments, the unit dose provides a standardized level of drug to the patient, independent of weight of patient. Many medications are sold based on a dose that is therapeutic to all patients based on a therapeutic window. In such cases, it is not necessary to titrate the dosage amount based on the weight of the patient.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0148">âTreatment,â âtreating,â and âtreatâ are defined as acting upon a disease, disorder, or condition with an agent, such as noribogaine, to reduce or ameliorate harmful or any other undesired effects of the disease, disorder, or condition and/or its symptoms. âTreatment,â as used herein, covers the treatment of a human patient, and includes: (a) reducing the risk of occurrence of the condition in a patient determined to be predisposed to the condition but not yet diagnosed as having the condition, (b) impeding the development of the condition, and/or (c) relieving the condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition and/or relieving one or more symptoms of the condition. âTreatingâ or âtreatment ofâ a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results such as the reduction of symptoms. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to: pain relief in all categories and classifications of pain; treating, alleviating and/or preventing acute and/or chronic pain; treating, alleviating and/or preventing cutaneous, somatic, visceral and/or neuropathic pain; and preventing the recurrence of long-term pain.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0149">As used herein, the term âpatientâ refers to mammals and includes humans and non-human mammals.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0150">As used herein, the term âQT intervalâ refers to the measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart. Prolongation of the QT interval refers to an increase in the QT interval.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0151">As used herein, the term âpainâ refers to the all categories and classifications of pain, which are summarized below for purposes of illustration.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0152">First, cutaneous pain is caused by injury to the skin or superficial tissues. Cutaneous nociceptors terminate just below the skin, and due to the high concentration of nerve endings, produce a well-defined, localized pain of short duration. Example injuries that produce cutaneous pain include paper cuts, minor burns (e.g., first degree burns) and superficial lacerations.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0153">Second, somatic pain originates from ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, and even nerves themselves, and is detected with somatic nociceptors. The scarcity of nociceptors in these areas produces a sharp, aching, pain of longer duration than cutaneous pain and somewhat less localized. Examples include a sprained ankle or broken bones.</p>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0154">Third, visceral pain originates from body organs. Visceral nociceptors are located within body organs and internal cavities. Similar to somatic pain, a scarcity of nociceptors in these areas produces a pain usually more aching and of a longer duration than somatic pain. Visceral pain may be more difficult to localize. Injuries to visceral tissue may exhibit âreferredâ pain, where the sensation is localized to an area completely unrelated to the site of injury. Myocardial ischaemia (i.e., the loss of blood flow to a part of the heart muscle tissue) is an example of referred pain; the sensation can occur in the upper chest as a restricted feeling, or as an ache in the left shoulder, arm, or hand. Another example of referred pain is phantom limb pain. Phantom limb pain is the sensation of pain from a limb that a person no longer has or from which the person no longer receives physical signals. This phenomenaâalso known as deafferentation painâis almost universally reported by amputees and quadriplegics.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0155">Fourth, neuropathic pain (e.g., âneuralgiaâ) can occur as a result of injury or disease to the nerve tissue itself. The injury or disease can disrupt the ability of the sensory nerves to transmit correct information to the thalamus or cortex. Consequently, the brain interprets painful stimuli even though there is no obvious or documented physiologic cause for the pain.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0156">Other pain classifications include acute pain and chronic pain. Acute pain is defined as short-term pain or pain with an easily identifiable cause. Acute pain indicates present damage to tissue or disease and may be âfastâ and âsharpâ followed by aching pain. Acute pain is centralized in one area before becoming somewhat spread out. Acute pain generally responds well to medications (e.g., morphine).</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0157">Chronic pain may be medically defined as pain that has lasted six months or longer. This constant or intermittent pain has often outlived its purpose because it does not help the body to prevent injury. It is often more difficult to treat than acute pain. Expert care is generally necessary to treat any pain that has become chronic. In addition, stronger medications are typically used for extended periods in an attempt to control the pain. This can lead to drug dependency. For example, opioids are used in some instances for prolonged periods to control chronic pain. Drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and even psychological addiction may occur.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0158">âNociceptive painâ refers to pain that is sensed by nociceptors, which are the nerves that sense and respond to parts of the body suffering from a damage. The nociceptors can signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain. Nociceptive pain is typically well localized, constant, and often has an aching or throbbing quality. A subtype of nociceptive pain includes visceral pain and involves the internal organs. Visceral pain tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain may be time limited; when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves. However, nociceptive pain related to arthritis or cancer may not be time limited. Nociceptive pain tends to respond to treatment with opiate analgesics, such as, for example, buprenorphin, codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and the like. Examples of nociceptive pain include, without limitation, pains from sprains, bone fractures, burns, bumps, bruises, inflammatory pain from an infection or arthritic disorder, pains from obstructions, cancer pain, and myofascial pain related to abnormal muscle stresses.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0159">âNeuropathic painâ refers to chronic pain, often due to tissue injury. Neuropathic pain is generally caused by injury or damage to nerve fibers. It may include burning or coldness, âpins and needlesâ sensations, numbness and/or itching. It may be continuous and/or episodic. Neuropathic pain is difficult to treat, but opioids, including, without limitation, methadone, tramadol, tapentadol, oxycodone, methadone, morphine, levorphanol, and the like. Causes of neuropathic pain include, without limitation, alcoholism; amputation; back, leg, and hip problems; chemotherapy; diabetes; facial nerve problems; HIV/AIDS; multiple sclerosis; shingles; spine surgery; trigeminal neuralgia; fibromyalgia; and the like. In some cases, the cause of neuropathic pain may be unclear or unknown.</p>

Without being bound by theory, it is believed that tapering will allow the full therapeutic effect of noribogaine with less prolongation of the QT interval. Tapering involves administration of one or more subsequently lower doses of noribogaine over time. For example, in some embodiments, the first tapered dose is 50% to 95% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the second tapered dose is 40% to 90% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the third tapered dose is 30% to 85% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the fourth tapered dose is 20% to 80% of the first or original dose.

      <p id="p-00293-en" num="0308">Noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations above the limit of quantification were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using model-independent methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were the observed values. Plasma concentration data in the post-distribution phase of the plasma concentration-time plot were fitted using linear regression to the formula In C=In Coât.Kel, where Co was the zero-time intercept of the extrapolated terminal phase and Kel was the terminal elimination rate constant. The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) was determined using the formula t<sub>1/2</sub>=0.693/Kel. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last determined concentration-time point (tf) in the post distribution phase was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The area under the curve from the last concentration-time point in the post distribution phase (Ctf) to time infinity was calculated from AUC<sub>t-â</sub>=Ctf/Kel. The concentration used for Ctf was the last determined value above the LLOQ at the time point. The total AUC<sub>0-â</sub> was obtained by adding AUC<sub>tf </sub>and AUC<sub>t-â</sub>. Noribogaine apparent clearance (CL/F) was determined using the formula CL/F=Dose/AUC<sub>0-â</sub>Ã1000, and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was determined using the formula Vd/F=(CL/F)/Kel. Total urine noribogaine was the sum of both analytes.</p>
      <p id="p-00294-en" num="0309">Summary statistics (means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation) were determined for each dose group for safety laboratory test data, ECG and pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacodynamic variables. Categorical variables were analysed using counts and percentages. Dose-proportionality of AUC and Cmax was assessed using linear regression. The effect of dose on pharmacodynamic parameter values over time was assessed using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons (with Tukey-Kramer adjustment) between each dose group to the placebo were conducted at each time point using the least squares estimates obtained from the ANOVA, using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS ver 6.0).</p>

Fluctuations in individual distribution-phase concentration-time profiles may suggest the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation (see highlighted individual 4-8 hour profiles in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, insert). Both Cmax and AUC increased linearly with dose (Table 1, upper panel). Mean half-life estimates of 28-50 hours were observed across dose groups for noribogaine. Volume of distribution was extensive (1417-3086 L across dose groups).</p>

Noribogaine glucuronide was detected in all subjects by 0.75 hours, with peak concentrations occurring 3-4 hours after noribogaine dosing. Mean half-life of 21-23 hours was estimated for plasma noribogaine glucuronide. The proportion of noribogaine glucuronide Cmax and AUC relative to noribogaine was 3-4% for both dose groups. Total urine noribogaine elimination was 1.16 mg and 0.82 mg for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively, representing 3.9% and 1.4% of the doses administered.</p>

Analgesic effect was assessed based on duration of hand immersion in ice water and on visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores upon hand removal from the water bath. For duration of hand immersion, after adjusting for baseline differences, comparison of each dose group with placebo by ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p&gt;0.9). Similarly, for VAS pain scores, after adjusting for baseline differences, comparison of each dose group with placebo by ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p=0.17).</p>

      <p id="p-00310-en" num="0323">This example is to illustrate that noribogaine can be administered at a therapeutic dosing while maintaining an acceptable QT interval. While the therapy employed is directed to opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the results show that a therapeutic window can be established for noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00311-en" num="0324">The efficacy of noribogaine in humans was evaluated in opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients had been receiving methadone treatment as the opioid substitution therapy, but were transferred to morphine treatment prior to noribogaine administration. This was done to avoid negative noribogaine-methadone interactions that are not observed between noribogaine and morphine. See U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,157, filed Mar. 14, 2014 and Ser. No. 14/346,655, filed Mar. 21, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p>
      <p id="p-00312-en" num="0325">Three cohorts of nine (9) subjects (6 administered noribogaine and 3 administered placebo in each cohort) were evaluated for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Cohort 1 received a single dose of 60 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 2 received a single dose of 120 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 3 received a single dose of 180 mg noribogaine or placebo. Treatment was administered 2 hours after last morphine dose and the time to resumption of morphine (opioid substitution treatment, OST) was determined. Few adverse effects of noribogaine were observed in any of the participants, including no hallucinatory effects. Table 3 shows the reported adverse events for each treatment that were not attributable to withdrawal from opioids. Headaches were frequent in the placebo and 60 mg noribogaine treatment groups, but were attenuated in the 120 mg and 180 mg dose groups.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> indicates the time to resumption of morphine (OST) for patients treated with placebo (circles), 60 mg noribogaine (squares), 120 mg noribogaine (triangles), and 180 mg noribogaine (inverted triangles). Patients receiving a single 120 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids of greater than 20 hours. Patients receiving a single 180 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids similar to that of placebo. This demonstrates that increasing the dose of noribogaine to 180 mg results in a shorter time to resumption of OST than observed in patients receiving 120 mg noribogaine. Time to resumption of OST after treatment with 180 mg was still longer than untreated patients (7 hours, not shown) or those administered 60 mg noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00318-en" num="0329">Patients were evaluated based on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) scoring systems over the period of time between administration of noribogaine (or placebo) until resumption of OST. These scales are outlined in Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, World Health Organization, Geneva (2009), Annex 10, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The scales measure the intensity of withdrawal symptoms, based on clinical, subjective, and objective indicia.</p>
      <p id="p-00319-en" num="0330">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> shows the COWS scores at time of resumption of OST for each cohort. Box includes values representing 25%-75% quartiles. Diamond=median; crossbar in box=mean; whiskers=values within standard deviation of mid-quartiles. No outliers present. The highly variable COWS scores across and within each cohort indicates that patients were resuming opiates without relation to the intensity of withdrawal. This was also reflected in SOWS and OOWS scores at the time of resumption of OST.</p>
      <p id="p-00320-en" num="0331">
        <figref>FIG. 6A</figref> shows the mean change in total COWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 6B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the COWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 7A</figref> shows the mean change in total OOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 7B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the OOWS total score change from baseline. <figref>FIG. 8A</figref> shows the mean change in total SOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. <figref>FIG. 8B</figref> shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the SOWS total score change from baseline. These data indicate that withdrawal symptoms get worse over time after cessation of OST, and that patients administered placebo experience generally worse withdrawal symptoms over that period. Patients who received 120 mg noribogaine generally experienced fewer withdrawal symptoms than the other patients, regardless of the scale used. Patients administered placebo generally experienced more withdrawal symptoms than patients who were administered noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00321-en" num="0332">Patients' QT intervals were evaluated at regular time points throughout the study. <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> shows the average change in QT interval (ÎQTc1, i.e., QT interval prolongation) over the first 24 hours post noribogaine (or placebo) administration. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> shows the estimated correlation between noribogaine concentration and change in QT interval. There is a dose-dependent increase in QT interval prolongation that is correlated with the serum concentration of noribogaine.</p>
      <p id="p-00322-en" num="0333">Based on above data, it is believed that the therapeutic window for a single bolus dose of noribogaine is bound at the lower end by 50 mg and at the upper end by less than 180 mg. In particular, the therapeutic serum concentration in vivo appears to be between about 50 ng/mL and about 180 ng/mL.</p>
