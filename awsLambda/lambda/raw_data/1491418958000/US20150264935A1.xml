      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Hypochlorous acid is an unstable weak acid, which could only exist in a solution. For example, it can dissolve in the water to form hypochlorous acid water. Hypochlorous acid is an extended-spectrum sterilizing ingredient which substantially exists in neutrophils of human body, and eliminates any kinds of protokaryon pathogen such as virus, bacteria, fungi. The leftover of hypochlorous acid after sterilization is water, which does not cause side effects like allergy or cancer etc. Hypochlorous acid was widely applied in our daily life as disinfectant and sterilizer, for example, the sterilizer of the endoscope in the hospital, the cleansing of vegetables and fruit, and the substitution fir iodine in wound treatment.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">However, the hypochlorous acid solution has disadvantages such as its overactive character, rapidly decaying tendency, short action time, making it difficult to be applied to common use. In addition, the hypochlorous acid solution with high fluidity is hard to stay on its applied subject stably, which thus increases the risk of incomplete sterilized. Further, when applied to human body, affects and influences caused by hypochlorous acid other than disinfection and sterilization are issues widely noticed.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Therefore, the object of the present invention is to break through the limit of traditional hypochlorous acid application, and provide a safe and durable, high-performance and extended-spectrum semi-fluid hypochlorous acid composition for disinfection and sterilization which is commercially applicable, with stable and slow release rate, moisture retaining, lubricating, protecting and repairing capabilities, and is suitable for extensive application.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The embodiment of the present invention is explained hereinafter. The explanation is not intended to limit the embodiment of the present invention, but only illustrates one of preferred embodiments thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Because the hypochlorous acid only exists in solution, hypochlorous acid and water are directly referred as hypochlorous acid water hereinafter but not described separately.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">A semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing comprises water, hypochlorous acid, thickening agent, emollient, and water-binding agent. The water and the hypochlorous acid are mixed and stirred with thickening agent, emollient, and water-binding agent to form a hydrogel or a viscous substance.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Specifically, there will be a fine sterilizing effect with the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the water equal to 1 ppm (parts per million) by weight. Because the hypochlorous acid contains chlorine, there will be a significant smell of chlorine once the concentration of hypochlorous acid in water exceeds 100 ppm. Therefore, if the semi-fluid composition is applied to daily use, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in water should better be less than or 100 ppm by weight to avoid the smell of chlorine. Preferably, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in water from 10 to 50 ppm by weight endues the hypochlorous acid water with disinfecting and sterilizing effect but without causing stimulations in the organism. And if the semi-fluid composition is for medical use, such as the sterilization of medical kits, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in the water can exceed 100 ppm by weight. In this embodiment, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in water is 25 ppm by weight, and the pH value is from 2.0 to 7.0. Preferably, in other embodiments, if the semi-fluid composition is applied to some particular conditions, such as being applied to a relatively sensitive private part of an organism, the concentration of hypochlorous acid in water should better be from 1 to 3 ppm by weight, so as to reduce the possibility of causing stimulations in the organism.</p>

      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0048">The semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing can be utilized as a skin care product like moisturizing lotion, which can be selected from embodiment 1 to 16 listed in table 1. The semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing used as a skin care product comprises 0.5˜10 wt % of the thickening agent, 0.5˜15 wt % of the emollient, and 2˜60 wt % of the water-binding agent. Preferably, If the semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing is used as a skin care product for long time use, the composition can be selected from embodiments 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15 that do not add preservatives, so as to prevent harmful stimulations to the skin due to regular use of preservatives, because the hypochlorous acid water of the semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing already has disinfecting and sterilizing effects. Table 4 shows the specific ways of embodiment of embodiments 5, 7, 9, and 13 of the present invention without preservative. The utilization of the semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing as a skin care product can prevent the formation of acne on the skin and can also soften the skin and retain moisture thereof. If the applied skin is relatively dry, preferably, the semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing can include natural plant oil, wherein the percentage thereof is 5˜30 wt %. As shown in embodiments 5 and 7 listed in table 4, the semi-fluid composition of the present invention for lubricating, moisture retaining, disinfecting and sterilizing comprises shea butter (natural plant oil), which has small molecular size and is hard to be oxidized and can be easily absorbed by the skin. The oil can stay on the surface of the skin to form a protective layer, by which the oil has a stronger effect of moisturization.</p>
