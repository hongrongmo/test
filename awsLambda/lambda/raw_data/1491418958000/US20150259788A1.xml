      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Recently, large-capacity magnetoresistive random access memories (MRAM) which employ a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) are a promising focus of development. The MTJ element used for an MRAM comprises two ferromagnetic layers (CoFeB) between which a tunnel barrier layer (MgO) is sandwiched, one layer being assigned as a magnetization fixed layer (reference layer) in which the direction of magnetization is not to change, and the other as a magnetization free layer (memory layer) in which the direction of magnetization can be easily reversed.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">When the directions of magnetization of the reference layer and memory layer are parallel to each other, the resistance of the tunnel barrier layer (barrier resistance) is lower and the tunnel current is greater than when the directions of magnetization are antiparallel. Here, the MR ratio is defined as: MR ratio=(Resistance in antiparallel stateâResistance in parallel state)/Resistance in parallel state. In a conventional method of manufacturing an MTJ element, generally, a sputtering apparatus is used to form an MgO tunnel barrier layer. However, with this method, high-quality MgO cannot be formed, which makes it difficult to achieve a high MR ratio.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural diagram showing an apparatus for manufacturing a magnetoresistive element, according to the first embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">A first chamber <b>10</b> and a second chamber <b>20</b> are connected to each other via a transfer chamber <b>30</b>. A gate valve <b>31</b> is provided between the transfer chamber <b>30</b> and the first chamber <b>10</b>, whereas a gate valve <b>32</b> is provided between the transfer chamber <b>30</b> and the second chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">The first chamber <b>10</b> is configured to form a ferromagnetic film of a magnetoresistive element and to accommodate therein a stage <b>50</b> on which a substrate <b>40</b> is placed. On an upper section of the chamber <b>10</b>, a CoFeB target (magnetic material target) <b>11</b>, which is a ferromagnetic material is provided as a sputtering source. When the target <b>11</b> is subjected to RF sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere, a CoFeB film can be formed on the substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">The second chamber <b>20</b> is configured to form a non-magnetic tunnel barrier film of a magnetoresistive element and to accommodate therein a stage <b>50</b> on which a substrate <b>40</b> is placed. On an upper section of the second chamber <b>20</b>, an MgO target (nonmagnetic material target) <b>21</b>, which serves as a sputtering source, and an insulating film having a dielectric constant lower than that of MgO, for example, an aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) target (low dielectric-constant target) <b>22</b> are provided. When the MgO target <b>21</b> is subjected to sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere, an MgO film can be formed on the substrate <b>40</b>. Further, when the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b> is subjected to sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere, an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>film can be deposited on the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">A magazine <b>33</b> configured to accommodate a plurality of substrates <b>40</b> or substrate stages <b>50</b> is contained in the transfer chamber <b>30</b>. Here, the substrates <b>40</b> or substrate stages <b>50</b> on which the substrates are placed can be transferred to each other between the chambers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> while maintaining the airtight states of the chambers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">The structure of the second chamber <b>20</b> will be described in further detail with reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">On a lower portion of the second chamber <b>20</b>, a rotating stage <b>25</b> which can be driven by a motor (not shown) or the like is provided. On the rotating stage <b>25</b>, a substrate stage <b>50</b>, on which a substrate <b>40</b> is placed, can be mounted. On the upper section of the second chamber <b>20</b>, the MgO target <b>21</b> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b> are disposed.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In front of the MgO target <b>21</b> (shown as being under the target in the figure), a shutter <b>26</b> is provided, and similarly, in front of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b> (shown as being under the target), a shutter <b>27</b> is provided. The shutters <b>26</b> and <b>26</b> are configured to open after discharge is stabilized in the sputtering of the targets. Further, above the rotating stage <b>25</b>, a sub-shutter <b>29</b> is provided, which is configured to temporarily cover the surfaces of the substrate <b>40</b> and substrate stage <b>50</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">The target <b>21</b> is connected to an RF power source <b>60</b> via a switch <b>61</b>, and the target <b>22</b> is connected to the RF power source <b>60</b> via a switch <b>62</b>. As the switch <b>61</b> and/or switch <b>62</b> are/is selected, RF power can be applied selectively to the target <b>21</b> and/or target <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">The second chamber <b>20</b> is provided with a gas inlet <b>65</b> configured to introduce an inert gas of Ar or the like. Further, the second chamber <b>20</b> is provided with an exhaust outlet <b>66</b> configured to evacuate the inside thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Next, a method of manufacturing a magnetoresistive element, which employs this apparatus, will now be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">First, one of a plurality of substrates <b>40</b> accommodated in the magazine <b>33</b> of the transfer chamber is conveyed into the first chamber <b>10</b>. In the first chamber <b>10</b>, the CoFeB target <b>11</b> is subjected to RF sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere, to form a CoFeB film on the substrate <b>40</b>. Note here that the conveyance of the substrate <b>40</b> may be carried out by moving only the substrate <b>40</b> itself, or the substrate stage <b>50</b> on which the substrate <b>40</b> is placed.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Next, the substrate <b>40</b> on which the CoFeB film is formed is conveyed into the second chamber <b>20</b> via the transfer chamber <b>30</b>. Then, the substrate stage <b>50</b> is set on the rotating stage <b>25</b>. Here, since the first chamber <b>10</b> is now empty, a CoFeB film may be formed on another substrate <b>40</b> in the first chamber <b>10</b>. More specifically, the next substrate is conveyed from the transfer chamber <b>30</b> into the first chamber <b>10</b>, and CoFeB film can be formed on the next substrate <b>40</b> by a similar process to that described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">In the second chamber <b>20</b>, while the shutter <b>27</b> is opened and the shutter <b>26</b> and the sub-shutter <b>29</b> are closed as shown in <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, RF power is applied to the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b>, and thus Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is subjected to RF sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere. In this manner, an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>film <b>71</b> is deposited on the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b> without being deposited on the substrate <b>40</b> or substrate stage <b>50</b>. Note that the apparatus is configured such that after the discharge is stabilized, the shutter <b>27</b> of the target <b>22</b> is opened.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">Next, while the shutter <b>27</b> is closed and the shutter <b>26</b> and the sub-shutter <b>29</b> are opened as shown in <figref>FIG. 3B</figref>, RF power is applied to the MgO target <b>21</b>, and thus MgO is subjected to RE sputtering in an Ar gas atmosphere. In this manner, an MgO film is formed on the substrate <b>40</b>. At the same time, an MgO film <b>72</b> is formed on the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b>, as well. Note that after the discharge is stabilized, the shutter <b>26</b> of the target <b>21</b> is opened. Further, in order to deposit the MgO film evenly, the rotating stage <b>25</b> is rotated during the sputtering.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Subsequently, the substrate stage <b>50</b> on which the substrate <b>40</b> is placed is conveyed into the transfer chamber <b>30</b>, and this substrate <b>40</b> is conveyed into the first chamber <b>10</b>. Here, the second chamber <b>20</b> is now empty, and therefore an MgO film may be formed on another substrate in the chamber <b>20</b>. More specifically, the next substrate <b>40</b> is conveyed from the transfer chamber <b>30</b> into the second chamber, and thus the MgO film can be formed on the next substrate <b>40</b> by a similar process to that described above.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">Subsequently, the substrate <b>40</b> conveyed into the first chamber is subjected to sputtering of the CoFeB target <b>11</b> once again, and thus a CoFeB film is formed on the substrate <b>40</b>. As described above, a CoFeB film, an MgO film and a CoFeB film are deposited in order on the substrate <b>40</b>, and thus a magnetoresistive element in which an MgO tunnel barrier layer is interposed between CoFeB ferromagnetic layers can be prepared.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Here, with regard to the formation of an MgO film in the second chamber <b>20</b>, if sputtering of the MgO target <b>21</b> is carried out without sputtering of a target having a low dielectric constant as in the conventional techniques, MgO is deposited partially on the inner surface of the chamber <b>20</b>. If MgO is deposited on the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b>, the deposited MgO will serve as a capacitor. Further, partial depositions of MgO form a discontinuous capacitor, which makes plasma instable.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Experiments conducted by the authors of the present embodiment showed that MgO attached to the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b> serves to increase the target voltage Vdc while forming MgO film, and further Vdc greatly vary. These results may cause degradation of the quality or reproducibility of the MgO film formed on the substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">By contrast, according to the present embodiment, before the formation of the MgO film, a target having a dielectric constant lower than that of MgO is subjected to sputtering to deposit a low dielectric-constant material on the inner surface of the second chamber <b>20</b>. With this process, even if MgO is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber by the sputtering of MgO, the total capacitance reduced. When the capacitance is reduced, Vdc is reduced and the variation of Vdc is suppressed. Consequently, the plasma is stabilized. Therefore, the quality and reproducibility of the MgO film formed on the substrate <b>40</b> can be enhanced.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Note that the experiments conducted by the authors of the present embodiment have confirmed that the reduction of Vdc and suppression of the variation thereof stabilizes plasma. This is considered to be for the following reasons:</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">(1) Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which has a dielectric constant lower than that of MgO, is deposited more uniformly than MgO on the inner surface of the chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">(2) MgO is deposited more uniformly on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>than it is when deposited directly on the inner surface of the chamber.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">(3) The capacitance is lower when MgO is deposited by laminating it with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>on the inner surface of the chamber than it is when MgO is deposited.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">The above-described phenomenon is not necessarily limited to the case where MgO is used as a non-magnetic material, but also occurs when another non-magnetic material is used. In consideration of the fact that the effect can be obtained by depositing Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which has a dielectric constant lower than that of MgO, in advance on the inner surface of the chamber, the above-mentioned other non-magnetic material of the low dielectric-constant target may be any type as long as it has a dielectric constant lower than that of the non-magnetic material to be formed on the substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Another significance of the embodiment is the deposition of not a metal such as Ta, but a low-dielectric constant material such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>on the inner surface of the chamber by sputtering. More specifically, if MgO grows in an island manner, a drawback occurs, in which the capacitance varies greatly. As described above, the capacitance can be stabilized by uniformly depositing the insulating layer (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) as in the present embodiment. Even if a metal such as Ta is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber in advance, the effect of stabilization of the capacitance cannot be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">As described above, according to this embodiment, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber <b>20</b> by sputtering of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b> as a pre-stage for the formation of the MgO film. With this pre-stage, the variation of the target voltage Vdc for the formation of the MgO film by sputtering can be reduced, and the voltage Vdc can be lowered. Therefore, the quality of the MgO film formed on the substrate <b>40</b> can be improved, and the reproducibility thereof can be enhanced. Thus, the MR ratio of the MTJ element can be increased.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Further, this embodiment comprises the transfer chamber <b>30</b> and magazine <b>33</b> between the first and second chambers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. With this structure, it is possible to process separate substrates <b>40</b> in the first and second chambers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> at the same time. That is, while forming an MgO film in the second chamber <b>20</b>, a CoFeB film may be formed on a separate substrate in the first chamber <b>10</b>. With this structure, the production throughput can be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit structural diagram showing a memory cell array of an MRAM which employs a magnetoresistive element of this embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">A memory cell in the memory cell array MA comprises a serial connector between a magnetoresistive element (MTJ element) and a switch element (for example, a field-effect transistor (FET)) T. One end of the serial connector (that is, one end of the magnetoresistive element <b>30</b>) is electrically connected to a bit line BL, while the other end of the serial connector (that is, one end of the switch element T) is electrically connected to a source line SL.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">A control terminal of the switch element T, for example, a gate electrode of the FET, is electrically connected to a word line WL. The potential of the word line WL is controlled by a first control circuit <b>1</b>. The potentials of the bit line BL and source line SL are controlled by a second control circuit <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">A basic structure of the MTJ element is, for example, as shown in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. That is, a lower electrode <b>91</b> is formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>90</b>. On the lower electrode <b>91</b>, a CoFeB film <b>92</b> serving as a ferromagnetic magnetization fixed layer, an MgO film <b>93</b> serving as a non-magnetic tunnel barrier layer, and a CoFeB film <b>94</b> serving as a ferromagnetic magnetization free layer are stacked. In other words, the MTJ element has a structure in which the tunnel barrier layer is interposed between the ferromagnetic layers. Further, an upper electrode <b>95</b> is formed on the CoFeB film <b>94</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">The apparatus of this embodiment is configured to form a laminated structure of the MTJ element, and in particular, with this apparatus, which deposits a low dielectric-constant material in the chamber <b>20</b> in advance when forming the MgO film <b>93</b>, the quality and reproducibility of the MgO film <b>93</b> can be improved.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is shows an apparatus for manufacturing a magnetoresistive element, according to the second embodiment, in particular, the structure of the second chamber. The same structural members as those shown in <figref>FIG. 2</figref> will be designated by the same reference numbers, and detailed explanations therefor will be omitted.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">The basic structure is similar to that of the first embodiment, and this embodiment is different from the first embodiment described before in the structure of the second chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">A Ta target <b>23</b> having a gettering effect on oxygen, water or the like is provided together with targets <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> in the second chamber <b>20</b>. A shutter <b>28</b> is provided on a substrate side of the target <b>23</b>. The target <b>23</b> is connected to an RF power source <b>60</b> via a switch <b>63</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In order to form an MgO film with this apparatus, the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target <b>22</b> is subjected to sputtering while the shutter <b>27</b> is open and the shutters <b>26</b> and <b>29</b> are closed, and thus a low dielectric-constant material is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Subsequently, the shutter <b>27</b> is closed and the shutter <b>28</b> is opened, the Ta target <b>23</b> is subjected to sputtering, and thus a low dielectric-constant material is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber <b>20</b>. With the formation of the Ta film, the gettering effect on oxygen, water, etc., in the chamber <b>20</b> is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">After that, the MgO target <b>21</b> is subjected to sputtering while the shutters <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are closed and the shutter <b>26</b> and the sub-shutter <b>29</b> are opened, and thus an MgO film is formed on the substrate <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">Naturally, with the deposition of an MgO film as described above, an advantageous effect similar to that of the first embodiment can be obtained. In addition, oxidizing gases of oxygen, water, etc., released from the chamber and other structural members during the formation of the MgO film are captured and removed by the Ta film deposited on the inner surface of the chamber. Therefore, the MgO film can be deposited on the substrate <b>40</b> in such a state that the oxidizing gases in the chamber <b>20</b> are reduced in quantity, and thus the quality of the MgO film can be further improved. Consequently, an MTJ element having a high MR ratio can be achieved.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Modified Examples</heading>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">Note that the embodiments are not limited to those discussed above.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">More specifically, the non-magnetic target is not necessarily limited to MgO, but it may be of any material as long as it can function as a tunnel barrier layer of an MTJ element. For example, AlN, AlON, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or the like can be employed. Further, the low dielectric-constant target is not limited to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but may be of any material as long as it has a dielectric constant lower than that of the non-magnetic target. For example, an Si oxide, Si nitride, Al oxide, Al nitride or Zn oxide can be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">Furthermore, the magnetic target is not necessarily limited to CoFeB, but it may be of any ferromagnetic material as long as it can form an MTJ element. The target for gettering oxygen, water, etc., is not limited to Ta, but CuN, CoFe, CoFeB, Ru, Ti, Mg, Cr, Zr or the like can be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">In the meantime, the above-provided embodiments are discussed in connection with an example of RF sputtering using an RF power source, but the embodiments are also applicable to DC sputtering. For example, it is also possible to employ an Al target and carry out sputtering in an O gas atmosphere. Further, the embodiments can be applied not only to such a system that a low dielectric-constant material is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber each time a substrate is processed, but also to such a system that a low dielectric-constant material is deposited on the inner surface of the chamber each time a certain number of substrates are processed.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">Further, in the above-provided embodiments, the magnetic film and non-magnetic film are formed in separate chambers, respectively, but it is also possible to form these films sequentially in a single chamber. In this case, any system may be used as long as it is such that one chamber may comprise a magnetic target, a non-magnetic target and a low dielectric-constant target and sputtering can be performed by selecting a target from these.</p>
