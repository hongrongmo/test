      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Â§119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-24424, filed on Feb. 28, 2014, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to a heat-resistant alloy used in a heat-resistant bolt and the like for fastening high temperature parts of an engine, and a method of manufacturing a heat-resistant bolt using the a heat-resistant alloy. In particular, the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may be manufactured with reduced manufacturing cost and tensile strength in an elevated temperatures and hardness thereof may be improved by reducing a content of expensive nickel (Ni) element and adjusting contents of other elements, such as chromium (Cr).</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In accordance with improvement of performance of a vehicle, an engine of the vehicle is located at a highly elevated temperature environment, and thus many parts included in the engine require high durability and the like in the elevated temperature environment. Particularly, many bolts are used in the engine, and use of a material having excellent high temperature characteristics that may endure the elevated temperature environment is required.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">For example, a heat-resistant alloy steel, such as SUH660 and SNB16, which contains a large amount of nickel (Ni) or chromium (Cr), and the like, has been developed. Particularly, a 15Cr26Ni1.25Mo alloy, i.e. SUH660, has been widely used. The SUH660 is a precipitation hardening type of heat-resistant alloy steel and has been used as a shaft material in a turbojet engine for aircrafts until now. The SUH660 is also a face-centered cubic austenitic alloy, and has improved tensile strength of about 271 MPa at the elevated temperatures of about 800Â° C. and thus has improved heat resistance and high temperature characteristics such as formability, weldability, and the like. Accordingly, SUH660 has been used in a heat-resistant bolt for vehicles, special hot tools, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">However, even though SUH660 has the aforementioned advantages, an expensive nickel (Ni) is contained in a content of about 26% and thus the manufacturing cost increases. Further, in accordance with development of an engine technology, a heat-resistant alloy used in the engine is highly desired to endure such elevated temperatures.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The description provided above as a related art of the present invention is just merely for helping understanding of the background of the present invention and should not be construed as being included in the related art known by those skilled in the art.</p>

      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in various exemplary embodiments with reference to Tables and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The present invention provides an austenitic heat-resistant alloy and a method of manufacturing a heat-resistant bolt using the austenitic heat-resistant alloy. In an aspect, the present invention provides an austenitic heat-resistant alloy which may reduce a manufacturing cost and improve strength thereof in a highly elevated temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In the related art, SUH660 or SNB16 containing a large amount of nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), or the like has been used as a heat-resistant alloy. Particularly, SUH660 has excellent tensile strength of about 296 MPa at the elevated temperature of about 800Â° C. However, since the SUH660 contains expensive nickel (Ni) element in a content of about 26 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy, the manufacturing cost may increase.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">However, in the austenitic heat-resistant alloy according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the content of nickel (Ni) may be reduced by about 20 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy, and the content of titanium (Ti) may increase by about 3 wt %. Accordingly, the manufacturing cost may be reduced and high temperature tensile strength, hardness, and the like may be improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">In an exemplary embodiment, the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may include: based on a total weight of the austenitic heat-resistant alloy, carbon (C) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.08 wt %, silicon (Si) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1.00 wt %, manganese (Mn) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 2.00 wt %, nickel (Ni) in an amount of about 17 to about 22 wt %, titanium (Ti) in an amount of about 2.7 to about 3.2 wt %, chromium (Cr) in an amount of about 11 to 16 wt %, molybdenum (Mo) in an amount of about 0.3 to about 1.0 wt %, vanadium (V) in an amount of about 0.1 to about 0.4 wt %, and a remainder of iron (Fe) and optionally an nevitable impurity.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">As used herein, carbon (C) may improve castability of a molten metal, and further improve castability and tensile strength in an elevated temperature and the like by forming of eutectic carbide with chromium (Cr) and the like. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of carbon (C) may be in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.08 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of carbon (C) is less than about 0.01 wt %, castability and tensile strength at the elevated temperature and the like may not be improved sufficiently. When the content of carbon (C) is greater than about 0.08 wt %, an effect of increasing content thereof may not be obtained accordingly, thereby increasing the manufacturing cost. In addition, an amount of insoluble carbide may increase, and thus tensile strength at the elevated temperature and the like of the alloy may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">As used herein, silicon (Si) may be a deoxidized element and improve acid resistance, hardness, high temperature fatigue strength, and the like of the alloy. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of silicon (Si) may be in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1.00 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of silicon (Si) is less than about 0.01 wt %, fatigue strength in an elevated temperature and the like may not be obtained sufficiently. When the content of silicon (Si) is greater than about 1.00 wt %, since compound between metals may be formed simultaneously, stability of a tissue at high temperatures may deteriorate, thereby reducing toughness, ductility, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0035">Manganese (Mn), as used herein, may fix sulfur (S) which may be inevitably contained in the alloy as sulfide and thus improve hot workability. In addition, manganese (Mn) may form a fine dispersed phase in an alloy tissue during cooling and thus increase tensile strength in an elevated temperature and a fatigue life. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of manganese (Mn) may be in an amount of about 0.01 to about 2.00 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of manganese (Mn) is less than about 0.01 wt %, tensile strength in an elevated temperature and the fatigue life of the alloy may not be improved sufficiently. When the content of manganese (Mn) is greater than about 2.00 wt %, ductility, corrosion resistance, and the like of the alloy may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0036">Nickel (Ni), as used herein, may be essential to ensure a stable austenite tissue. Further, nickel (Ni) may improve other physical properties of the alloy in an elevated temperature, and particularly may play a significant role of maintaining an austenite phase at elevated temperatures to increase tensile strength and ductility. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of nickel (Ni) may be in an amount of about 17 to about 22 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of nickel (Ni) is less than about 17 wt %, sufficient heat resistance and the like may not be obtained. When the content of nickel (Ni) is greater than about 22 wt %, economic efficiency may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0037">Titanium (Ti), as used herein, may improve physical properties of the alloy at an elevated temperature together with nickel (Ni). Titanium (Ti) may be bonded to nickel (Ni) to form a high temperature reinforcing phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti (Î³â²) and thus improve heat resistance of the alloy. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of titanium (Ti) may be in an amount of about 2.7 to about 3.2 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of titanium (Ti) is less than about 2.7 wt %, sufficient physical properties at elevated temperatures may not be obtained. When the content of titanium (Ti) is greater than about 3.2 wt %, an effect of increasing content thereof is not obtained accordingly, and thus economic efficiency may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0038">Chromium (Cr), as used herein, may basically improve oxidation resistance and the like of the alloy, and suppress a reduction of tensile strength fatigue strength and the like of the alloy at an elevated temperature, which may be caused by reduced nickel (Ni). Accordingly, the content of Cr may improve the tensile strength, the fatigue strength, and the like of the alloy at an elevated temperature. Since a raw material cost of chromium (Cr) is about 10 to about 30% of that of nickel (Ni), the alloy including Cr instead of Ni may improve economic efficiency. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of chromium (Cr) may be in an amount of about 11 to about 16 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content of chromium (Cr) is less than about 11 wt %, sufficient tensile strength, high temperature fatigue strength, and the like at an elevated temperature may not be obtained. When the content of chromium (Cr) is greater than about 30 wt %, ferrite may be formed as a matrix tissue of the alloy instead of austenite.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0039">Molybdenum (Mo), as used herein, may increase temper softening resistance of the alloy and provide a solid-solution reinforcing effect. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of molybdenum (Mo) may be in an amount of about 0.3 to about 1.0 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content is less than about 0.3 wt %, sufficient temper softening resistance and the like may not be obtained. When the content is greater than about 1.0 wt %, toughness, ductility, and the like of the alloy may be reduced.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0040">Vanadium (V), as used herein, may form stable carbide and the like at elevated temperatures and thus improve strength and the like of the alloy at elevated temperatures. In certain exemplary embodiments, the content of vanadium (V) may be in an amount of about 0.1 to about 0.4 wt % based on the total weight of the alloy. When the content is less than about 0.1 wt %, sufficient improvement of strength at elevated temperatures may not be obtained. When the content is greater than about 0.4 wt %, corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures may be reduced and deterioration in ductility and toughness may be caused.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0041">The austenitic heat-resistant alloy according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention may have improved tensile strength, fatigue strength, and the like at elevated temperatures. Accordingly, the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may be applied to an engine or turbo charger part and the like, or particularly applied to a heat-resistant bolt for fastening the engine part in elevated temperatures and the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may be applied to a heat-resistant bolt for fastening a turbo engine and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Hereinafter, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing an austenitic heat-resistant alloy.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment, a method of manufacturing a heat-resistant bolt by using the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may include steps of: a first step of cold forging and then rolling the austenitic heat-resistant alloy to set an exterior diameter, an effective diameter, and a length of the heat-resistant bolt; a second step of heat treating and then air cooling the rolled heat-resistant alloy to improve strength; a third step of surface treating the air-cooled heat-resistant alloy to manufacture the heat-resistant bolt, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">In certain exemplary embodiments, cold forging, rolling, and the like may be performed before the heat-treatment step in order to easily form a screw thread of the heat-resistant bolt. In other certain exemplary embodiments, the austenitic heat-resistant alloy may include: based on a total weight of the austenitic heat-resistant alloy, carbon (C) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 0.08 wt %, silicon (Si) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 1.00 wt %, manganese (Mn) in an amount of about 0.01 to about 2.00 wt %, nickel (Ni) in an amount of about 17 to about 22 wt %, titanium (Ti) in an amount of about 2.7 to about 3.2 wt %, chromium (Cr) in an amount of about 11 to 16 wt %, molybdenum (Mo) in an amount of about 0.3 to about 1.0 wt %, vanadium (V) in an amount of about 0.1 to about 0.4 wt %, and a remainder of iron (Fe) and an inevitable impurity.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">In the first step, the exterior diameter, the effective diameter, and the length of the heat-resistant bolt may be set without limitation. In certain exemplary embodiments, a rolling pressure of the rolling for manufacturing the screw thread of the heat-resistant bolt and the like may be in a range of about 45 to about 55 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the rolling pressure is less than about 45 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, hardness of the manufactured heat-resistant bolt may be substantially reduced to about 35 HRC or less due to reduced work hardening. When the rolling pressure is greater than about 55 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, hardness of the manufactured heat-resistant bolt may be reduced substantially to about 35 HRC or less due to processing heat occurring during the rolling.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">In certain exemplary embodiments, in the second step, a heat-treatment temperature of the heat treating may be in a range of about 650 to about 700Â° C. or particularly of about 680Â° C. When the temperature is less than about 650Â° C., a solid-solution reinforcing phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti (Î³â²) may not be formed and thus sufficient tensile strength and the like may not be obtained. When the temperature is greater than about 700Â° C., coarse solid-solution reinforcing phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti (Î³â²) may be formed and thus sufficient tensile strength at elevated temperatures and the like may not be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">In yet certain exemplary embodiments, a heat-treatment time of the heat treating may be about 11 to about 13 hours, or particularly of about 12 hours. When the heat-treatment time is less than about 11 hours, the solid-solution reinforcing phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti (Î³â²) may not be sufficiently formed and thus sufficient tensile strength and the like at elevated temperatures may not be obtained. When the heat-treatment time is greater than about 13 hours, loose solid-solution reinforcing phase of Ni<sub>3</sub>Ti (Î³â²) may be formed and thus sufficient tensile strength and the like at elevated temperatures may not be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In still certain exemplary embodiments, in the third step, the surface treating may be, but not limited to, phosphate coating treatment, MoS<sub>2 </sub>treatment, hardening treatment, or the like and the surface treatment may be performed over a surface of the air-cooled heat-resistant alloy after the heat treating in order to maintain physical properties of the heat-resistant alloy, maintain corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and the like, and further suppress burning due to high temperatures and the like.</p>
