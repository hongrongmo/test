      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">FIELD</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an improved cleat for footwear.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Professional and amateur athletes, as well as outdoor enthusiasts, often find it advantageous to wear shoes or other footwear that includes a cleated sole. Examples of such footwear might include baseball shoes, soccer shoes, football shoes, hiking shoes, golf shoes, or track &amp; field spikes. Cleats can prevent numerous leg and foot injuries by reducing slippage and providing for better foot traction on a variety of surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Cleats come in a variety of different shapes, sizes and styles. A cleat might take the form of a spike, a stud, a blade, or any other similar protrusion located on the underside of the footwear. In addition, a cleat might have different dimensions depending on the activity and the surface on which it will be used. For example, a cleat used on a hard surface, such as a track, may have a lower profile or height than a cleat used on grass or dirt. Moreover, cleats might be removable or permanently attached to the outsole of the shoe or other footwear.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">In order to improve the performance of cleats and cleated footwear, it is often desirable to have a lightweight cleat that is securely fixed to the underside of the footwear, and is designed in such a way as to provide maximum traction and durability.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">An improved cleat design is provided to enhance an article of footwear. At least one cleat is arranged on a bottom surface of the outsole, such that the cleat is disposed partially within the outsole and extends substantially perpendicular from the bottom surface of the outsole. The cleat includes an aperture such that a portion of the outsole extends through the aperture in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface of the outsole to retain the at least one cleat in a desired position relative to the outsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In one aspect of this disclosure, the cleat is further defined as a unitary member having two planar surface angled at a junction toward each other, where the two planar surfaces have a longitudinal axis oriented substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the outsole and the junction is oriented substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the outsole. The cleat further includes an aperture formed therein and extending across the junction and a bridge extending between the two planar surfaces and substantially spanning the aperture, where a portion of the outsole encases the bridge and extends through the aperture in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface of the outsole to retain the at least one cleat in a desired position relative to the outsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">In another aspect of this disclosure, a midsole of the footwear has a substantially planar bottom surface, such that the at least one cleat is disposed entirely below the bottom surface of the midsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">In yet another aspect of this disclosure, the outsole of the footwear can include at least one nodule integrally formed with and extending outward from the bottom surface of the outsole, wherein the at least one cleat is encapsulated partially by the at least one nodule. The nodule has formed by one or more arcuate side surfaces extending from the bottom surface of the outsole to a distal end from which the cleat protrudes from, where cross-sectional area between the side surface increases continually from the distal end to the bottom surface of the outsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. The description and specific examples in this summary are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p>

      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0042">Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0043">With reference to the figures, an article of footwear <b>10</b> is provided and may include an upper <b>12</b>, a sockliner or insole <b>13</b>, a midsole <b>14</b>, and an outsole <b>16</b>. The upper <b>12</b> and the midsole <b>14</b> cooperate to position and retain a user's foot (not shown) relative to the outsole <b>16</b> during use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that an article of footwear <b>10</b> may include other elements and parts, including but not limited to laces, an insole, and a stiff toe portion. The type and quantity of elements and parts of the article of footwear <b>10</b> may depend on the particular use for which the article of footwear is designed. Relevant parts and elements of an article of footwear <b>10</b> will be described herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0044">With reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, in an example embodiment the outsole <b>16</b> may include a first member <b>18</b> and a second member <b>20</b>. The first member <b>18</b> may be fixed to the midsole <b>14</b> and may be formed of a substantially resilient material such as thermoplastic polyurethane, nylon and fiberglass compound, PebaxÂ®, or another type of plastic material. The second member <b>20</b> may be fixed to the first member <b>18</b> and be formed of a substantially rigid material such as carbon fiber, thermoplastic polyurethane, nylon and fiberglass compound, PebaxÂ®, or another type of plastic material. The second member <b>20</b> may be fixed to the first member <b>18</b> with an adhesive, overmolding, three-dimensional printing process, or any other known fastening system. In an alternative embodiment, the outsole <b>16</b> may be formed as a single-piece.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0045">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the outsole <b>16</b> may include a plurality of pod elements or nodules <b>22</b>. A cleat is encapsulated partially within each nodule and protrudes therefrom in a direction substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the outsole. The quantity and arrangement of cleats <b>26</b> and nodules <b>22</b> on the outsole <b>16</b> may depend on the particular use for which the article of footwear <b>10</b> was designed. By way of example only, an article of footwear <b>10</b> designed for baseball may include fewer cleats <b>26</b> than an article of footwear designed for football (or vice versa), while an article of footwear <b>10</b> designed for hiking may not include any cleats <b>26</b> and an article of footwear designed for track may not include any nodules <b>22</b>. Different arrangements for the cleats <b>26</b> and nodules <b>22</b> fall within the scope of this application.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0046">With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 4</figref>, the nodule <b>22</b> may include an arcuate surface <b>27</b> extending from the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b> to a distal or end portion <b>41</b> of the nodule <b>22</b>. Depending on the location of the nodule <b>22</b> relative to the outsole <b>16</b>, the arcuate surface <b>27</b> may have a varying symmetrical or asymmetrical profile with varying degrees of curvature that allow the nodule <b>22</b> to dissipate forces transmitted through the outsole <b>16</b> from the ground, before such forces are transmitted to the user's foot. For example, a portion of the arcuate surface <b>27</b> may extend with a first profile to a peripheral edge <b>29</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>, while another portion of the arcuate surface <b>27</b> may extend with a second profile to the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>. In an example embodiment, the cross-sectional area between the side surfaces increases continually from the end portion <b>41</b> to the bottom surface of the outsole <b>16</b>. In other embodiments, the cross-sectional area between the side surfaces may be a substantially fixed measure from the end portion <b>41</b> to the bottom surface of the outsole <b>16</b> (e.g., protruding cuboid shape). The nodules <b>22</b> may be integrally formed with the first member <b>18</b> and/or the second member <b>20</b> and thus formed of the same material as the first member <b>18</b> and/or the second member <b>20</b>. The material used to form the nodule <b>22</b> can have a hardness or density sufficient to ensure that the cleat <b>26</b> remains stable and does not move or shift within the nodule when the cleat contacts the ground or surface on which the article of footwear <b>10</b> is being used. For example, the nodule <b>22</b> may be formed of a thermoplastic polyurethane having a hardness in the range of 55D to 80D in accordance with the ASTM D2240 standard. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the nodules <b>22</b> may be removably attached to the outsole <b>16</b> by a screw, clip, press-fit engagement, or other attachment system known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">
        <figref>FIGS. 5-8</figref> depict an example embodiment of a cleat <b>26</b>. In the example embodiment, the cleat <b>26</b> is comprised generally of a stem <b>30</b>. The stem <b>30</b> includes a top end <b>33</b> and a bottom end <b>34</b> separated by substantially planar and parallel first sidewalls <b>37</b> and substantially planar and parallel second sidewalls <b>39</b>. The stem <b>30</b> may be substantially flat with a rectangular cross section. The edges and corners of the stem <b>30</b> may be beveled or radiused. Beveling the edges and corners of the stem <b>30</b> may help to dissipate the pressure imparted by the edges and corners of the stem <b>30</b> on the nodules <b>22</b> and/or outsole <b>16</b> (via a larger contact surface area), and thus ensure that the cleat <b>26</b> is securely fastened to the nodules and/or outsole.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">In the example embodiment, the cleat <b>26</b> is formed from 1050 grade stainless steel. The cleat <b>26</b> may be formed from titanium, aluminum, other grades of steel as well as other types of metals. The cleat may also be formed from other materials of suitable hardness and durability, including for example certain polyurethanes. In some embodiments, the cleat <b>26</b> may be coated with a layer of tungsten <b>31</b> for improved strength, durability, and wear resistance. The layer of tungsten <b>31</b> may entirely coat the stem or coat only the portions of the cleat which protrude from the nodule or engage the surface on which the article of footwear <b>10</b> is being used. The size and shape of the cleat <b>26</b>, as will be described in more detail below, may significantly reduce the weight of the cleat, as compared to a prior art cleat. Specifically, the size and shape of the cleat <b>26</b> may reduce the weight of the cleat <b>26</b> by 40-50%, or 3 grams per cleat, such that the weight of the article of footwear <b>10</b> is reduced by 1-2 ounces.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">In the example embodiment, the stem <b>30</b> includes a retaining feature (also referred to herein as the retention portion). The retaining feature functions to secure the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>. In the example embodiment, the retaining feature is further defined as an aperture <b>38</b>. The aperture <b>38</b> is generally located adjacent to the top end <b>33</b> of the stem <b>30</b>. An axis <b>45</b> of the aperture <b>38</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the first and second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> of the stem, and substantially parallel to the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>. During assembly, a portion of the outsole extends through the aperture in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface of the outsole to retain the cleat in a desired position relative to the outsole. It is envisioned that the aperture <b>38</b> may have a variety of shapes, including a circle, an ellipse, an oval, a square, and a rectangle, and may include radiused or beveled edges <b>43</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">To the extent the structural integrity of the stem <b>30</b> and the cleat <b>26</b> are not compromised, the weight of the cleats <b>26</b> can be reduced by increasing the size of the aperture <b>38</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 8</figref>, in one embodiment, the width W<b>1</b> of the aperture <b>38</b> is between forty-five and fifty-five percent of a width W<b>2</b> of the stem <b>30</b>. In another embodiment, the width W<b>1</b> of the aperture <b>38</b> is fifty-one percent of the width W<b>2</b> of the stem <b>30</b>. In this way, the weight of the cleat <b>26</b> can be reduced. Moreover, because metal cleats can contribute substantially to the weight of the footwear, the overall weight of the footwear is also reduced by increasing the size of the aperture.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the example embodiment, the stem <b>30</b> further includes a flange <b>36</b>. The flange <b>36</b> can be integrally formed with the stem <b>30</b> and may extend from at least one of the first and second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b>. In the example embodiment, the flange <b>36</b> extends substantially perpendicular to the first and second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b>; however, it is understood that the flange <b>36</b> may extend from the first and second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> in any direction or angle that creates a flange <b>36</b> relative to either the first or second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the flange <b>36</b> may extend from the second sidewalls <b>39</b> adjacent to the top end <b>33</b> of the stem, forming a generally flat, T-shaped stem <b>30</b>. The flange <b>36</b> may also be formed at any other location between the top end <b>33</b> and the bottom end <b>34</b> of the stem <b>30</b>. With reference to <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, a bottom surface <b>47</b> of the flange <b>36</b> may be substantially parallel to the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>, and further serve to retain the cleat <b>16</b> (in an axial direction) in a relation to the outsole. It is also contemplated that the bottom surface <b>47</b> of the flange may extend from the first and second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> such that the angle between the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b> and the bottom surface <b>47</b> of the flange is greater than ninety (90) degrees and less than one hundred eighty (180) degrees.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">With reference to at least <figref>FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>15</b>, the process of fixing the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b> will now be described in more detail. In one embodiment, the stem <b>30</b> is affixed to the outsole <b>16</b> by an insert molding process. Specifically, the stem <b>30</b> may be placed in an insert mold before the outsole <b>16</b> is molded there-around. With particular reference to FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>7</b>, as the first member <b>18</b> and/or second member <b>20</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>, including the nodules <b>22</b>, are molded, the overmold material will generally flow around each stem <b>30</b>, including the flanges <b>36</b> and through the aperture <b>38</b>. Accordingly, a portion of the outsole <b>16</b> may extend through the aperture <b>38</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole. With reference to <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, it is contemplated that the entire cleat <b>26</b> may be disposed within the outsole <b>16</b> and entirely below, or external to, the midsole <b>14</b>. In an article of footwear <b>10</b> that does not include the midsole <b>14</b>, or includes the midsole <b>14</b> and the insole <b>13</b>, the entire cleat <b>26</b> may be disposed within the outsole <b>16</b> and entirely below, or external to, the insole <b>13</b>. In this way, pressure created by the force of the ground bearing on the cleat is evenly disbursed by the nodules <b>22</b>, the outsole <b>16</b>, the midsole <b>14</b> and/or the insole <b>13</b>, before it is imparted on the user's foot.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">The overmold material in and around the cleat <b>26</b>, as described above, will generally fix the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>. The overmold material around stem <b>30</b>, including around the flange <b>36</b> and through the aperture <b>38</b>, will generally prevent the cleat <b>26</b> from moving relative to the outsole <b>16</b> when a forced is applied to the cleat <b>26</b>. In at least one embodiment, the molding material may flow around the stem <b>30</b> such that a portion of the stem extends perpendicularly from the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">
        <figref>FIGS. 9-12</figref> depict an alternative embodiment of a cleat <b>26</b>â². In this embodiment, the cleat <b>26</b>â² includes a stem <b>30</b> and a cap <b>32</b>. Except with respect to the difference discussed herein, the cleat <b>26</b>â² may be substantially the same as cleat <b>26</b> described above. The cap <b>32</b> may be integrally formed with the stem <b>30</b> by stamping, machining, casting, or any other technique known in the art. Alternatively, the cap <b>32</b> may be formed from a separate piece of material and attached to the stem <b>30</b> by a welding process, such as tack-welding, or any other suitable technique known in the art. In either case, the cap <b>32</b> may be formed from steel, titanium, aluminum, or any other suitable material. The cap <b>32</b> provides additional traction between the cleat <b>26</b> and the ground or surface on which the article of footwear <b>10</b> is being used. Accordingly, the cap <b>32</b> may also be referred to as a ground-engaging portion of the cleat <b>26</b>â². Moreover, the cap <b>32</b> prevents dirt and debris from penetrating into the nodule adjacent to the side surfaces of the cleat <b>26</b>â³ and thereby improves retention of the cleat <b>26</b>â³ in the nodule over time.</p>
      <p id="p-00055-en" num="0055">With particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 9 and 12</figref>, the cap <b>32</b> may include a generally planar top surface <b>44</b>, a bottom surface <b>46</b>, a first arcuate end <b>48</b>, a second arcuate end <b>50</b>, a first sidewall <b>52</b>, and a second sidewall <b>54</b>. With reference to <figref>FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>, it is also understood that the first arcuate end <b>48</b> and the second arcuate end <b>50</b> may be substantially planar as they extend between the top surface <b>44</b> and the bottom surface <b>46</b>. The top surface <b>44</b> of the cap <b>32</b> may be adjacent to, and extend beyond the periphery of, the stem <b>30</b>. A cross-sectional area of the cap <b>32</b> may be larger than a cross-sectional area of the stem <b>30</b>, when the cross-sectional area of the stem and the cap are taken parallel to the axis <b>45</b> of the aperture <b>38</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00056-en" num="0056">The first and second arcuate ends <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> of the cap <b>32</b> may extend from the top surface <b>44</b> to the bottom surface <b>46</b>. With reference to <figref>FIG. 12</figref>, and by way of example only, a height H<b>2</b> of the cap <b>32</b> may be between 2 mm and 6 mm. With reference to at least <figref>FIGS. 11</figref><i>a </i>and <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the cap <b>32</b> may have a generally triangular cross section with the first and second sidewalls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> extending between the top surface <b>44</b> and the bottom surface <b>46</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref><i>a</i>, in one embodiment, the sidewalls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> have a generally arcuate surface that may be convex relative to the axis <b>45</b> of the aperture <b>38</b>. It is also understood that the sidewalls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may be concave relative to the axis <b>45</b> of the aperture <b>38</b> as they extend between the top surface <b>44</b> and the bottom surface <b>46</b>. With reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref><i>b</i>, the sidewalls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may also be substantially planar as they extend between the top surface <b>44</b> and the bottom surface <b>46</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0057">With reference to <figref>FIG. 9</figref>, the sidewalls <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may include a plurality of grooves <b>56</b> extending from the bottom surface <b>46</b> to a point generally between the top surface <b>44</b> and the bottom surface. The grooves <b>56</b> may have a V-shaped profile and may provide traction between the cleat <b>26</b> and the ground or surface on which the article of footwear <b>10</b> is being used.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0058">In some embodiment, the top <b>44</b> of the cap <b>32</b> includes a channel <b>60</b> adjacent to, and extending around, the periphery of the stem <b>30</b>. The channel <b>60</b> may have a variety of profiles, including V-shaped, square, or arcuate. During the molding process, a portion of the molding material for the outsole <b>16</b> and/or nodule <b>22</b> may extend into the channel <b>60</b> as best seen in <figref>FIG. 11</figref>. This feature also helps to retain the cleat <b>26</b> in the nodule <b>22</b>. The channel <b>60</b> may also help to seal the stem <b>30</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>, thus preventing dirt and other debris from being deposited between the cleat <b>26</b> and the outsole <b>16</b> and/or the nodule <b>22</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0059">With reference to at least <figref>FIGS. 13-15</figref>, in another embodiment, a cleat <b>26</b>â³ may include a foot <b>28</b>, a stem <b>30</b>, and a cap <b>32</b>. Except with respect to the differences discussed herein, the cleat <b>26</b>â³ may be substantially the same as the cleat <b>26</b>â². The stem <b>30</b> may include a flange <b>36</b>â² to help retain the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>. The flange <b>36</b>â² may extend from the first and/or second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> of the stem <b>30</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface <b>35</b> of the outsole <b>16</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, in one embodiment, the flange <b>36</b>â² may form a shoulder <b>40</b> around the periphery of the stem <b>30</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0060">The foot <b>28</b> may be formed from steel, titanium, aluminum, or any other suitable material. In one embodiment, the foot <b>28</b> is formed from 1050 grade stainless steel. The foot <b>28</b> may be integrally formed with the stem <b>30</b> by stamping, machining, casting, or any other technique known in the art. Alternatively, the foot <b>28</b> may be formed from a separate piece of material and attached to the stem <b>30</b> by a welding process, such as tack-welding, or any other suitable technique known in the art.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0061">The foot <b>28</b> may be located adjacent to the top end <b>33</b> of the stem <b>30</b>. With reference to at least <figref>FIGS. 16A-16C</figref>, and corresponding <figref>FIGS. 17A-17C</figref> and <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>C, the foot <b>28</b> may have a variety of shapes and profiles, and may extend from, and perpendicular to, the first and/or second sidewalls <b>37</b>, <b>39</b> of the stem <b>30</b>, forming a lip <b>62</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>, a portion of the outsole <b>16</b> may extend around and adjacent to the foot <b>28</b> and the lip <b>62</b> to further retain the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>. With particular reference to <figref>FIGS. 14-15</figref>, and the process described above for fixing the cleat <b>26</b> to the outsole <b>16</b>, the overmold material for the outsole <b>16</b> and/or nodule <b>22</b> may extend around the lip <b>62</b> of the foot <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0062">
        <figref>FIGS. 19A-19D</figref> depict another example embodiment of a cleat <b>70</b>. In this embodiment, the cleat <b>70</b> is formed by a unitary member having two planar surfaces <b>71</b> angled along a junction <b>72</b> toward each other. For example, the two planar surfaces may form an angle in a range from 120 degrees to 160 degrees although this angle may vary for other embodiments. Bending the cleat <b>70</b> helps to better secure the cleat in the outsole <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0063">For illustrative purposes, the cleat is made with a length of 18 mm, a width of 15.5 mm and a thickness of 1.8 mm. It is understood that these dimensions may vary. In any case, the thickness of the unitary member is substantially smaller than its width or length, thereby creating a narrow profile as seen in <figref>FIGS. 19C and 19D</figref>. Additionally, the shape of the cleat defines a longitudinal axis (i.e., its length is greater than its width) that is oriented substantially perpendicular to the bottom surface of the outsole. The edges and corners of the cleat <b>70</b> may be beveled or radiused. The suspended nature of the cleat <b>70</b> within the nodule <b>22</b>, helps to dissipate the pressure imparted on the outsole <b>16</b> and therefore reduces the pressure experienced by the wearer.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">To attach the cleat <b>70</b> to the article of footwear, the cleat <b>70</b> further includes a retention feature <b>82</b> (also referred to herein as a retention portion). During assembly, the retention portion <b>82</b> is encapsulated in the bottom surface of the outsole <b>16</b> (e.g., a nodule extending from the bottom surface of the outsole), such that a ground-engaging portion <b>84</b> as indicated below <b>83</b> extends out of the outsole <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the retention portion <b>82</b> comprises substantially half of the cleat although more or less of the retention portion may be encapsulated in the bottom surface of the outsole <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">In the example embodiment, an aperture <b>86</b> is formed in the retention portion <b>82</b> of the cleat <b>70</b>. A bridge <b>87</b> extends between the two planar surfaces and substantially spans the aperture. While the bridge is shown extending between inwardly facing surfaces, it is also envisioned that the bridge may extend between outwardly facing surfaces as well. Likewise, it is appreciated that the shape of the aperture and/or the bridge may differ from those shown in the figures.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In one embodiment, the cleat is comprised of a metal material. The aperture <b>86</b> and the bridge <b>87</b> can then be formed, for example by a metal stamping process, such that the cleat <b>70</b> is a unitary member. This method can drastically reduce the cost of manufacturing each individual cleat. During assembly, a portion of the outsole encases the bridge and extends through the aperture in a direction substantially parallel to the bottom surface of the outsole to thereby retain the at least one cleat in a desired position relative to the outsole. In comparison to other embodiments, the bridge <b>87</b> provides additional surfaces for the material of the outsole to engage and thereby retain the cleat in place. Other methods for forming a cleat are also contemplated by this disclosure, including but not limited to CNC machining, forging, injection, casting, etc.</p>

      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure. Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described. The same may also be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the disclosure, and all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.

It is understood that the figures may not represent the actual size of the cleats <b>26</b>, and that different sizes of cleats <b>26</b> may be used on the same article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms âcomprises,â âcomprising,â âincluding,â and âhaving,â are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">When an element or layer is referred to as being âon,â âengaged to,â âconnected to,â or âcoupled toâ another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being âdirectly on,â âdirectly engaged to,â âdirectly connected to,â or âdirectly coupled toâ another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., âbetweenâ versus âdirectly between,â âadjacentâ versus âdirectly adjacent,â etc.). As used herein, the term âand/orâ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as âfirst,â âsecond,â and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">Spatially relative terms, such as âinner,â âouter,â âbeneath,â âbelow,â âlower,â âabove,â âupper,â and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as âbelowâ or âbeneathâ other elements or features would then be oriented âaboveâ the other elements or features. Thus, the example term âbelowâ can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
