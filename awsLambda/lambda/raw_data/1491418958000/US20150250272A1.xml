    <summary>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The invention relates to a device for pivotably assembling or attaching at least two components, notably two links of a bracelet, for example a watch bracelet.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Such an assembly device allows links to be assembled, generally using a guide pin (also simply called pin) that guides the pivoting and a screw, it being possible for the assembled links to move rotationally relative to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">An assembly of this type is exposed to a risk of unwanted unscrewing. This problem, which is well known to watchmakers, is caused by the repeated movements of the links relative to one another when the bracelet is being worn, or by knocks.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In order to resolve this problem, document CH695389 discloses a device for assembling watch bracelet link elements that allows the link elements, for example two outer link elements and a central link element, to be assembled so that they can move angularly relative to one another. This assembly device comprises a screw equipped with a head, at one of its ends, and with a threaded part at its other end. A middle part of the screw, cylindrical in shape, acts as a guide pin guiding the rotation of the central link element. In order to limit the risk of unwanted unscrewing, a tubular barrel, made of an elastic material and provided with an annular narrowing, is driven into a drilling through which the screw passing through one of the outer link elements passes. The screw comprises an annular groove intended to accommodate the narrowing of the barrel. At the time of assembly, the screw is introduced into the barrel until its narrowing engages in the annular groove of the screw. As a result of that, the barrel applies to the screw a radial clamping force which combines with the retention force applied by the threads of the screw. The screw is thus immobilized axially with respect to the link. Such a solution requires several component parts to be assembled, and this involves a relatively lengthy assembly time. Furthermore, because the clamping force applied by the annular narrowing of the barrel to the screw needs to be high, assembly and/or disassembly operations may prove to be difficult.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">The present invention seeks to improve the situation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">To this end, the invention relates to an assembly device for pivotably attaching at least two components, comprising a screw intended to be screwed into a first component and bearing a guide pin guiding the pivoting of a second component, wherein the pin comprises at least one rotation-prevention zone having a shape designed to collaborate with a zone of corresponding shape of the first component, so as to prevent said pin from rotating.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">According to the invention, in order to remedy the risk of unwanted unscrewing of the screw and of the components becoming detached, the pin is prevented from rotating, notably prevented from rotating with minimal clearance, by one of the components that are to be assembled. This prevention is performed in a simple way by virtue of collaboration between the shape of the pin and that of the component. This results in axial immobilization of the screw which bears the pin.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">In one particular embodiment, the screw is housed in the pin and the pin and the screw are designed to collaborate in such a way that the screw drives the pin in axial translation when it is prevented from rotating and the screw is being screwed into the first component.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The assembly device also has the advantage of taking the form of a preassembled module comprising the screw already housed in the pin, the whole being ready to be incorporated for example into a watch bracelet in a simple way.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The rotation-preventing zone of the pin, for example a peripheral zone, may be a projecting shape, a reentrant shape, or a flat. Accordingly, the first component comprises a zone of complementary shape, being respectively reentrant, projecting, or flatted.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The pin may comprise several peripheral rotation-preventing zones. These various zones may, for example, form a toothset.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">In one particular embodiment, the assembly device comprises retention means, notably radial retention means for radial retention between the pin and the screw and designed to allow a relative angular movement between the pin and the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The radial-retention means may notably make it possible to create a torque that applies resistance to the relative rotation of the screw and of the pin, while at the same time allowing a degree of freedom between the pin and the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">When the two components are being assembled, all the operator has to do is overcome the resistive torque applied by the radial-retention means in order to make the screw turn with respect to the pin which is prevented from rotating. After assembly, when the assembly device is assembling two components, for example two links of a bracelet, there may still be some clearance between the peripheral rotation-preventing zone of the pin and the correspondingly shaped zone of the first component. In such a case, the pin is mounted in the first component with clearance. As a result, repeated knocks may cause the pin some residual movement. However, such movement has no impact on the screw because the radial-retention means allow the pin to move angularly with respect to the screw. The screw therefore remains in the screwed-in position, without the risk of becoming unscrewed, despite any repeated small rotations there might be of the pin.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Furthermore, by virtue of the radial-retention means, when the assembly device is preassembled, the screw is housed in the pin but does not turn freely inside the latter.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">According to a first embodiment, the assembly device comprises at least one seal positioned between the screw and the pin, designed to exert a retention torque between the screw and the pin providing retention between the pin and the screw, notably radial retention between the pin and the screw. In this case, the seal or seals provide the retention, notably the radial retention, between the pin and the screw while at the same time allowing the one to rotate with respect to the other. The seal or seals are designed to shear and thus spare the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The seal may for example be toric or four-lobed. Other types of seal may of course be used.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Advantageously, the pin is secured to the screw in axial translation by collaboration of at least one stop of an internal portion of the pin with at least one stop surface borne by the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The pin may be limited axially by two bearing surfaces borne by the screw, particularly by means of two internal bearing surfaces or lands of the pin. For example, the screw may be made up of two distinct elements: one comprising a head part and a body or intermediate part, which are secured to one another and separated by a land, and the other comprising a threaded end part. When the assembly device is preassembled, these two elements are introduced into the pin then assembled with one another, for example by pressing or laser welding. During assembly, the internal lands of the pin are, for example, interposed between the land separating the head and body parts of the screw and a free end of the end part of the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">According to a second embodiment, the pin and the screw bear respective toothsets designed to collaborate by claw coupling, under the effect of elastic return means, so as to exert retention torque providing retention between the pin and the screw, notably radial retention between the pin and the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In this case, the coupling-together of the respective toothsets of the pin and of the screw provides the retention between the pin and the screw, notably the radial retention. Furthermore, in the event of relative rotation of the pin with respect to the screw, caused by residual movement of the pin or at the time of the screwing, the elastic means urge the toothsets together in order to keep them coupled. The radial travel of the pin is less than the angular pitch of the teeth of the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Advantageously, the elastic return means comprise a helical spring housed inside the pin and surrounding the screw, said spring pressing against a bearing surface borne by the screw, at one end, and against a bearing surface borne by the pin, at another end. In this case, and advantageously also, said spring is preloaded by assembling an end part of the screw, bearing a screw thread, and a head part and intermediate part of the screw which are joined to one another.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">The respective toothsets of the pin and of the screw may be symmetric or asymmetric. Asymmetric toothsets make it possible to maximize the size of the teeth, making them easier to manufacture, and make it possible to improve the feel perceived by the operation, notably upon the disengagement of the claw coupling, i.e. when the toothsets become disengaged.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">The pin and the screw may be interlocked with one another either directly or via an interface ring bearing a first toothset that engages with the toothset of the pin and a second toothset that engages with the toothset of the screw.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">Advantageously, the screw is equipped with a head arranged at an open first end of the pin and an end part bearing a screw thread and extending out of the pin at an open second end of said pin.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">Advantageously also, the peripheral rotation-preventing zone of the pin is arranged near the first end of the pin.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The invention also relates to an assembly comprising at least two components attached using the assembly device as defined hereinabove.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">The invention also relates to a bracelet comprising at least two links attached using the assembly device as defined hereinabove.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The invention finally relates to a method of pivotably assembling at least two components using the assembly device as defined hereinabove, and which comprises, after the assembly device has been introduced into an opening passing through a second component, a screwing step during which the screw is screwed into a first component and drives in axial translation the pivoting-guiding guide pin of the device, which is prevented from rotating through the collaboration of its rotation-preventing zone with the corresponding zone of the first component.</p>

      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">The end part <b>42</b> comprises a threaded section <b>420</b>, at one of its ends, and an assembly section <b>421</b> at its other end, these being connected to one another by a junction section <b>422</b>. The assembly section <b>421</b> has a tubular shape with outside and inside diameters respectively equal or substantially equal to D<b>1</b> and to d<b>1</b>. It is designed to be inserted into the pin <b>5</b>, via one of its ends <b>53</b>, at the same time fitting over the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b>. The threaded section <b>420</b> has an outside diameter here equal or substantially equal to D<b>1</b>.

      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">The guide pin <b>5</b> providing pivoting guidance has a tubular cylindrical shape (notably the external surface <b>55</b>) of axis AX and comprises an open first end <b>52</b> and an open second end <b>53</b>. It forms an internal housing <b>50</b> that is cylindrical and coaxial with the axis AX, for accepting the screw <b>4</b>. The internal diameter of the pin <b>5</b> is equal, or substantially equal, to D<b>1</b>. The external diameter of the pin <b>5</b> (without the projecting peripheral zone <b>540</b> mentioned below) is denoted D<b>2</b>, D<b>2</b> of course being greater than D<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The diameters D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> and d<b>1</b> are depicted in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>.</p>

      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">With reference to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the pin <b>5</b> comprises, near its first end <b>52</b>, an end section <b>54</b> bearing a projecting peripheral zone <b>540</b>, or bulge, preventing rotation. In the particular embodiment depicted in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the projecting zone <b>540</b> has a semicylindrical overall shape of axis parallel to the axis AX.

      <p id="p-00057-en" num="0060">The assembly device <b>3</b> also comprises two O-ring seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>arranged between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> and designed to apply a resistive, notably friction, torque between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b>, creating resistance to the relative rotation of the pin <b>5</b> and of the screw <b>4</b> and thus providing radial retention between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> while at the same time allowing a degree of freedom between the pin and the screw. The resistive torque is determined in such a way as to allow relative rotation of the pin <b>5</b> and of the screw <b>4</b>, notably as the screw is being screwed into the link M<b>1</b> and in the event of residual travel of the pin <b>5</b>. The screw <b>4</b> forms two annular grooves <b>401</b>, <b>402</b> to house the seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, in this instance in its head part <b>40</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00058-en" num="0061">In place of O-ring seals, use could be made of any other suitable shape of seal, for example four-lobed seals so as to maximize contact areas. Use could also be made of a single seal or of more than two seals so as to create a sealed zone in which the friction conditions are not influenced by the potential presence of liquid.</p>
      <p id="p-00059-en" num="0062">The central link M<b>2</b> has, passing through it, a cylindrical drilling <b>21</b> for the passage of the assembly device <b>3</b>, of a diameter equal or substantially equal to D<b>2</b>, in its lateral end portion <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00060-en" num="0063">The link element M<b>1</b><i>a </i>comprises a hole <b>11</b> to accept the threaded end <b>420</b> of the assembly device <b>3</b>, the hole being provided with a tapping <b>110</b>. The hole <b>11</b> here passes through the link element M<b>1</b><i>a</i>. As an alternative, it could be a blind hole. The hole <b>11</b> is slightly wider, near its mouth onto the housing <b>10</b>, so as to form a land <b>111</b> acting as a stop for the positioning of the screw <b>4</b> at the end of screwing.</p>
      <p id="p-00061-en" num="0064">The link element M<b>1</b><i>b </i>has passing through it a drilling <b>12</b> for the passage of the assembly device <b>3</b>, configured to house the end section <b>54</b> of the pin <b>5</b>. The drilling comprises a cylindrical wall provided with a reentrant zone <b>120</b>, or hollow zone, of a shape that complements that of the projecting zone <b>540</b> and which is intended to house the latter.</p>
      <p id="p-00062-en" num="0065">The assembly device <b>3</b> is preassembled by performing the steps described hereinafter:</p>
      <p id="p-00063-en" num="0066">During a first step, the O-ring seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>are fitted into the annular grooves <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0067">During a second step, the one-piece component consisting of the head part <b>40</b> and of the intermediate part <b>41</b> is introduced into the housing <b>50</b> of the pin <b>5</b> via the open first end <b>52</b> thereof, until its land <b>44</b> comes to bear against, or near, the first stop of the annular portion <b>51</b> of the pin <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0068">During a third step, the assembly section <b>421</b> of the end part <b>42</b> is introduced into the housing <b>50</b> of the pin <b>5</b> via the open second end <b>53</b> and comes to fit over the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b>, until the annular surface <b>426</b> of the free end of the assembly section <b>421</b> comes to bear against or near the second stop formed by the annular portion <b>51</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0069">On completion of the second and third steps, the annular portion <b>51</b> of the pin <b>5</b> is interposed between two stop surfaces consisting of the land <b>44</b> and of the annular surface <b>423</b> of the free end of the end part <b>42</b>. However, some clearance or play is left between the portion <b>51</b> and the stop surfaces <b>44</b> and <b>426</b> so as to allow the screw to turn.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0070">The second and third steps may be carried out in any order or simultaneously.</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0071">On completion of these steps, the component comprising the head part <b>40</b> and intermediate part <b>41</b> may be secured to the end part <b>42</b> of the screw <b>4</b> by pressing. Alternatively, these two elements may be secured to one another by welding, notably by laser welding. The threaded section <b>420</b> of the end part <b>42</b> extends out of the pin <b>5</b> and the screw head <b>400</b> is positioned at the open end <b>52</b> of the pin <b>5</b>. The pin <b>5</b> is axially delimited with respect to the screw <b>4</b> by its internal portion <b>51</b> interposed between the land <b>44</b> and the free end <b>426</b> of the assembly section <b>421</b> of the end part <b>42</b>. The pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> are thus secured together with minimal clearance in axial translation.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0072">Furthermore, the seals <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>apply a friction torque between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> and this creates resistance to the relative rotation of the screw and of the pin and provides the one with radial retention with respect to the other.</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0073">The process of assembling the two links M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b> using the assembly device <b>2</b> already preassembled will now be described with reference to <figref>FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0074">During a first step E<b>1</b>, the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are placed in the assembly position. To do that, the lateral end portion <b>20</b> of the link M<b>2</b> is introduced into the housing <b>10</b>, between the two link elements M<b>1</b><i>a </i>and M<b>1</b><i>b</i>. The openings <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>12</b> are positioned in line with one another so as to form a passage to receive the assembly device <b>3</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0075">During a second step E<b>2</b>, the assembly device <b>3</b> is introduced through the passage formed by the openings <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>12</b> until the projecting zone <b>540</b> of the pin slightly enters the housing <b>120</b>, which allows rotation of the guide pin <b>5</b> with respect to the screw <b>4</b> to be prevented.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0076">The process then involves a screwing step E<b>3</b>. During this step E<b>3</b>, the screw <b>4</b> is turned, for example by an operator, by turning the screw head <b>400</b> through the open end <b>52</b> of the pin <b>5</b>. The screwing force applied in order to turn the screw <b>4</b> needs to be greater than the friction torque applied by the O-ring seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the operator needs to overcome the friction torque applied by the seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b. </i></p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0077">Under the action of being turned, the screw <b>4</b> moves in a helical movement comprising an axial component directed in the direction of screwing as indicated by an arrow <b>7</b> in <figref>FIG. 5</figref> as soon as the threaded end <b>420</b> engages the tapping <b>110</b> of the link element M<b>1</b><i>a</i>. In its helical movement, the screw <b>4</b> drives in axial translation the pin <b>5</b> which moves as one with the screw <b>4</b> in terms of axial translation but is prevented from rotating through the collaboration of its projecting zone <b>540</b> with the reentrant zone <b>120</b> of the link M<b>1</b>. Thus, as the screw <b>4</b> is screwed into the tapped hole <b>11</b> in the link M<b>1</b>, the pin <b>5</b> enters the passage formed by the openings <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>12</b> in a movement of axial translation in the direction <b>7</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0078">The assembly device <b>3</b> thus enters the passage formed by the openings <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>12</b> passing through the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> through the helical movement of the screw <b>4</b> and axial translational movement of the pin <b>5</b> until for example the end <b>53</b> of the pin <b>5</b> comes into abutment against the land <b>111</b> of the link element M<b>1</b><i>a</i>. The assembly device <b>3</b> is thus positioned longitudinally (which means to say in the direction of the axis AX) with respect to the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0079">The longitudinal positioning of the assembly device <b>3</b> with respect to the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> could be achieved by an alternative or additional stop against which the screw <b>4</b> comes into abutment. For example, in the case of a blind tapped hole <b>11</b>, the additional stop could consist of the closed end of the hole.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0080">On completion of the screwing step E<b>3</b>, the threaded end <b>420</b> is fully engaged in the tapping <b>110</b> and the entirety of the projecting zone <b>540</b> of the pin <b>5</b> is housed in the reentrant zone <b>120</b> of the link element M<b>1</b><i>b</i>, as depicted in <figref>FIG. 5</figref>. Axial retention of the pin <b>5</b> with respect to the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> is achieved through the force applied by the threads <b>420</b> of the screw <b>4</b> within the tapped hole <b>11</b> of the link M<b>1</b>. The links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> are thus assembled, it being possible for the link M<b>2</b> to pivot with respect to the link M<b>1</b> about the pin <b>5</b>. Said pivot of the link M<b>2</b> is reached through the rotation of said link around the external surface <b>55</b> of the pin <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00078-en" num="0081">When the bracelet is being worn or in the event of knocks, repetitive contact between the exterior surface <b>55</b> of the pin <b>5</b> an the internal wall of the hole <b>21</b> of the central link M<b>2</b> occur. That causes small angular movements of the pin <b>5</b> with respect to the outer link M<b>1</b>. These angular movements are reduced to a minimum by the projecting zone <b>540</b> of the pin <b>5</b> which is prevented from rotating by the reentrant zone <b>120</b> of the link M<b>1</b> and butts against the wall thereof. However, there may still be some angular clearance between the respective immobilizing zones <b>540</b>, <b>120</b> of the pin <b>5</b> and of the link M<b>1</b>, which is capable of causing residual movement of the pin <b>5</b> with respect to the link M<b>1</b>. Such a phenomenon does not, however, have any impact on the screw <b>4</b> because of the action of the seals <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>. What happens is that these are able to shear relative to the contact surfaces of the pin <b>5</b> and of the annular grooves <b>401</b>, <b>402</b>. The seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b </i>thus allow the pin <b>5</b> a small angular movement with respect to the screw <b>4</b> making it possible to absorb the residual travel of the pin <b>5</b> with respect to the link M<b>1</b> without the screw <b>4</b> being turned. As a result of that the screw <b>4</b> is unaffected by the repeated contact between the central link M<b>2</b> and the pin <b>5</b>. It remains in its screwed-in position. The risk of unwanted unscrewing is thus eliminated. To complement the effects of the seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a clearance may also be created between the body part <b>41</b> of the screw and the end part <b>42</b>. To do that, the end part <b>42</b> may be mounted with clearance on the body part <b>41</b> of the screw, for example using a key or a bayonet.</p>
      <p id="p-00079-en" num="0082">In order to dismantle the assembly device <b>3</b>, in order to disconnect the links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, all an operator has to do is turn the screw <b>4</b> in the direction of unscrewing, using the screw head <b>400</b>, by applying an unscrewing torque that is higher than the friction torque applied by the seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>. Under the action of being turned in the unscrewing direction, the screw <b>4</b> performs a helical movement that has an axial-translation component in the opposite direction to the direction <b>7</b>. The screw <b>4</b>, thus moved, drives the pin <b>5</b> in axial translation, which pin is prevented from rotating but moves as one with the screw <b>4</b> in terms of axial translation in the opposite direction to the direction <b>7</b>. The result of this is that the pin <b>5</b> leaves the link element M<b>1</b><i>b </i>with the screw <b>4</b> lodged inside it.</p>
      <p id="p-00080-en" num="0083">
        <figref>FIGS. 6 to 8</figref> depict a second embodiment of the assembly device <b>3</b> of the invention. For the sake of clarity, only those elements that differ from the first embodiment described will now be described.</p>
      <p id="p-00081-en" num="0084">In this second embodiment, the radial retention between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> is provided by toothsets <b>56</b> and <b>424</b> borne by the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> respectively, in the place of the seals <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>b</i>. Through these toothsets <b>56</b>, <b>424</b>, the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> are designed to collaborate by claw coupling, under the return action of a helical spring <b>47</b>, so as to apply a claw coupling torque that opposes the relative rotation of the pin <b>5</b> and of the screw <b>4</b> and provides radial retention between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b>. The angular pitch between the teeth is designed to be greater than the residual angular movement of the pin <b>5</b> when the latter is prevented from rotating with clearance in the link M<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00082-en" num="0085">The screw <b>4</b> comprises a head part <b>40</b>, an intermediate part <b>41</b> and an end part <b>42</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0086">The head part <b>40</b>, of diameter D<b>1</b>, is secured to the intermediate part <b>41</b> of diameter d<b>1</b> (less than D<b>1</b>) and therewith forms a one-piece component part. These two parts <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> are separated by a bearing land <b>44</b>, against which the helical spring <b>47</b> is intended to come to bear at one of its two ends. The axial length of the component <b>40</b>-<b>41</b> is greater than the length of the pin <b>5</b>, the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> being intended to project out of the pin <b>5</b> through the second end <b>53</b> thereof when the device <b>3</b> is preassembled.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0087">The end part <b>42</b> comprises a threaded section <b>420</b>, at a first end, and an assembly section <b>423</b> bearing the toothset <b>424</b>, at a second end, the two sections <b>420</b> and <b>423</b> being connected by a junction section <b>422</b>. An axial opening <b>425</b> in the form of a blind hole for accepting the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> is formed in the end part <b>42</b> at the second end thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00085-en" num="0088">The pin <b>5</b> comprises an internal housing <b>50</b> which is cylindrical and coaxial, for accepting the screw <b>4</b>. The housing <b>50</b> comprises a first section <b>500</b> of internal diameter equal or substantially equal to D<b>1</b>, comprising the end <b>52</b>, and a second section <b>501</b>, comprising the end <b>53</b>, of a diameter equal or substantially equal to d<b>1</b>. The two sections <b>500</b> and <b>501</b> are separated by a land <b>502</b> against which the helical spring <b>47</b> bears. The toothsets <b>56</b> are borne by the end <b>53</b> of the pin <b>5</b>. The axial length of the first section <b>500</b> of the housing <b>50</b> is greater than the axial length of the head part <b>40</b> of the screw <b>4</b> so as to form a housing <b>57</b> to accept the spring <b>47</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00086-en" num="0089">The toothsets <b>424</b> and <b>56</b> are symmetric here.</p>
      <p id="p-00087-en" num="0090">The spring <b>47</b> bears against the land <b>44</b>, via a washer <b>48</b><i>a</i>, at one of its ends, and against the land <b>502</b>, by means of another washer <b>48</b><i>b</i>, at its other end.</p>
      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0091">The pin <b>5</b> bears a rotation-preventing zone <b>540</b>, in this instance a projecting one.</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0092">The assembly device is preassembled as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0093">During a first step, the washer <b>48</b><i>a</i>, the spring <b>47</b> and the washer <b>48</b><i>b </i>are successively placed over the intermediate part <b>41</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0094">In a second step, the one-piece component part <b>40</b>-<b>41</b> on which the spring <b>47</b> and the washers <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b </i>are placed is introduced into the pin <b>5</b>, via the end <b>52</b>, until the screw head <b>400</b> becomes lodged inside the pin <b>5</b>, near the end <b>52</b>. In this position, the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> projects out of the pin <b>5</b> via the end <b>53</b> and the spring <b>47</b>, bearing against the lands <b>44</b> and <b>502</b> via the washers <b>48</b><i>a</i>, <b>48</b><i>b</i>, is preloaded.</p>
      <p id="p-00092-en" num="0095">During a third step, the end part <b>42</b> is assembled with the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> by inserting and pressing the latter into the opening <b>425</b>. The end part <b>42</b> thus fits over the projecting free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b>. During assembly, the toothsets <b>56</b> and <b>424</b> are coupled, or engaged, directly with one another. The pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b> thus collaborate by claw coupling, under the return effect of the spring <b>47</b>, so as to apply a claw-coupling torque that applies resistance to the relative rotation of the pin <b>5</b> and of the screw <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00093-en" num="0096">The process of assembling two links M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> using the assembly device <b>3</b> according to the second embodiment is similar to that described previously except that the screwing torque needs to be higher than the claw-coupling torque applied by the coupled toothsets <b>56</b>, <b>424</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00094-en" num="0097">As explained previously, when the bracelet is being worn or in the event of knocks, the pin <b>5</b> is prevented from rotating by its projecting zone <b>540</b> which collaborates with the reentrant zone <b>120</b> of the link M<b>1</b>. Furthermore, the screw <b>4</b> is unaffected by any potential residual movement of the pin <b>5</b> with respect to the link M<b>1</b> thanks to the interlocked toothsets <b>56</b>, <b>424</b> which allow a relative angular movement between the pin <b>5</b> and the screw <b>4</b>. What happens is that the toothsets <b>56</b>, <b>424</b> are designed to move apart from one another against the return action of the spring <b>47</b> under the effect of the dynamics of the pin <b>5</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00095-en" num="0098">
        <figref>FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> depict a third embodiment, representing an alternative form of embodiment of the assembly device which differs from the second embodiment in that the toothset <b>56</b> of the pin <b>5</b> and the toothset <b>424</b> of the end part <b>42</b> are coupled to one another not directly but via an additional interface ring <b>8</b> which bears a first toothset <b>80</b> intended to be coupled to the toothset <b>56</b> borne by the end <b>53</b> of the pin <b>5</b> and a second toothset <b>81</b> intended to be coupled to the second toothset <b>424</b> borne by the end part <b>42</b>. The two sets of toothsets (<b>56</b>, <b>80</b>) and (<b>81</b>, <b>424</b>) are asymmetric here.</p>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0099">The helical spring <b>47</b> is here housed near the screw head <b>400</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0100">The assembly device <b>3</b> according to the third embodiment is preassembled in a way similar to what was previously described relative to the second embodiment. The end part <b>42</b> is assembled with the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> with the interposition of the interface ring <b>8</b>. The ring <b>8</b> is placed over the free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> and the toothsets <b>56</b> and <b>80</b> are engaged. The free end of the intermediate part <b>41</b> is then introduced into the receiving opening <b>425</b> of the end part <b>42</b> and the toothsets <b>81</b> and <b>424</b> are engaged. During the preassembly of the device <b>3</b>, the spring <b>47</b> is preloaded. The two sets of toothsets (<b>56</b>, <b>80</b>) and (<b>81</b>, <b>424</b>) are interlocked under the action of the spring <b>47</b> and oppose the relative rotation of the pin <b>5</b> and of the screw <b>4</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0101">The use of two sets of toothsets that are asymmetric means that manufacture becomes easier and it is possible to produce either teeth which are more coarse than those of the second embodiment, for the same number of indexing positions of the pin <b>5</b> relative to the screw <b>4</b>, or a greater number of teeth and a greater number of indexing positions of the pin <b>5</b> relative to the screw <b>4</b>, which improves the feel perceived by the operator during the disengagement of the claw coupling.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0102">The spring <b>47</b> may be housed in any position along the pin <b>5</b>. In any scenario it bears against the land <b>44</b> that separates the head part <b>40</b> and the intermediate part <b>41</b> of the screw <b>4</b>, at one of its ends, and against the land that separates the two sections <b>500</b> and <b>501</b> of the pin <b>5</b> respectively comprising a passage of diameter D<b>1</b> and a passage of diameter d<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0103">In the foregoing description, the screw <b>4</b> and the pin <b>5</b> form two distinct components. The screw <b>4</b> is fixed into a first link M<b>1</b>. The pin <b>5</b> forms a pivoting surface for a second link M<b>2</b>. The screw <b>4</b> has no contact with the second link M<b>2</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0104">In the foregoing description, the head part <b>40</b> and intermediate or body part <b>41</b>, and the end part <b>42</b> are secured by press fitting. They could be secured together by any suitable means, for example by welding. In the foregoing description, the pin <b>5</b> is prevented from rotating with respect to the link M<b>1</b> by collaboration of a projecting peripheral zone <b>540</b> borne by the pin <b>5</b> with a reentrant zone <b>120</b> provided in the link M<b>1</b>. As an alternative, the peripheral immobilizing zone of the pin <b>5</b> could have either the form of a reentrant zone intended to collaborate with a projecting zone of complementary shape of the link M<b>1</b>, or the form of a flat intended to collaborate with a corresponding flat of the link M<b>1</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0105">Moreover, in the foregoing description, the projecting immobilizing zone <b>540</b> of the pin <b>5</b> has an overall shape that is semicircular in cross section (perpendicular to the axis AX). Of course other shapes are conceivable, for example a U-shape or a V-shape or any other suitable shape.</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0106">It is also possible to conceive of several immobilizing zones at the periphery of the pin, for example in the form of a toothset. In that case of course the link <b>1</b> would be provided with the same number of immobilizing zones of corresponding shape.</p>
