      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention is related to epoxy thermosets. More particularly, the present invention is related to tougheners for epoxy thermosets.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Background of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Epoxy thermosets are inherently brittle due to their highly cross-linked polymer network. Such a drawback has resulted in limited use of epoxy resins in many demanding applications where toughness is required. In recent years, new developments in composites, coatings, and electronics require epoxy thermosets with greater thermal stability. Increasing the thermal stability of the epoxy polymer network often requires further tightening of the polymer network with increased crosslink density, resulting in a much more brittle polymer network.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Among the methods for solving the problems, it has been attempted to blend a rubbery ingredient with an epoxy resin. Examples of these methods include (1) heating partially cross linked rubbery random copolymer particles prepared by emulsion polymerization using a nonionic emulsifier or the like to a temperature higher than the cloud point of the emulsifier, thereby coagulating them, then optionally washing the coagulate with water and mixing the same with an epoxy resin, (2) mixing a rubbery polymer latex and an epoxy resin and then evaporating off the water content to obtain a mixture, and (3) mixing a rubbery polymer latex with an epoxy resin under the presence of an organic solvent to obtain a mixture.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The methods of (1) and (2) described above are methods of dispersing polymer particles that are adhered to each other by coagulation in a viscous epoxy resin. Since the rubbery polymer particles are physically bonded to each other, pulverization or a re-dispersion operation with a considerably large mechanical shearing force is required upon mixing with the epoxy resin. The higher viscosities of the epoxy resins often make it more difficult to uniformly re-disperse the rubbery polymer particles. As a result, such processes may leave an unmixed portion, and lumpy agglomerations are sometimes formed in the unmixed portion. Furthermore, addition of polymer particles to the viscous epoxy resin often leads to a further increase in viscosity, resulting in difficulties using the dispersions. Use of epoxy reactive diluents in place of liquid epoxy resins can significantly reduce viscosity of the dispersions, but it is usually accompanied by sacrificing other properties, such as thermal stability, mechanical strength and chemical resistance.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Method (3) described above does not include a coagulating operation, so an epoxy resin composition with rubbery polymer particles dispersed uniformly can be obtained, but a great amount of water content present together with the organic solvent in the system must be separated or evaporated off. Separation of the organic solvent layer and the aqueous layer can require as long one day and one night. Additionally, the organic solvent layer and the aqueous layer are difficult to separate substantially since they form a stable emulsified suspension. Further, in a case of removing the water content by evaporation, a great amount of energy is necessary and, in addition, water soluble impurities such as an emulsifier or sub-starting materials usually used in the production of rubbery polymer latexes remain in the composition to degrade the quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Therefore, a need exists for a toughening system with low viscosity that provides a uniform distribution of rubbery particles in an epoxy thermoset matrix.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">In an embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a composition comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of: a) 45 to 97 weight percent of a divinylarene dioxide; and b) 3 to 55 weight percent of a core shell rubber comprising a rubber particle core and a shell layer wherein said core shell rubber has a particle size of from 0.01 Î¼m to 0.5 Î¼m.</p>

      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0000">When DVBDO is prepared by the processes known in the art, it is possible to obtain one of three possible isomers: ortho, meta, and para. Accordingly, the present invention includes a DVBDO illustrated by any one of the above Structures individually or as a mixture thereof. Structures VI and VII above show the meta (1,3-DVBDO) isomer and the para (1,4-DVBDO) isomer of DVBDO, respectively. The ortho isomer is rare; and usually DVBDO is mostly produced generally in a range of from about 9:1 to about 1:9 ratio of meta (Structure VI) to para (Structure VII) isomers. The present invention preferably includes as one embodiment a range of from about 6:1 to about 1:6 ratio of Structure VI to Structure VII, and in other embodiments the ratio of Structure VI to Structure VII may be from about 4:1 to about 1:4 or from about 2:1 to about 1:2.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0020">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the divinylarene dioxide may contain quantities (such as for example less than about 20 wt %) of substituted arenes. The amount and structure of the substituted arenes depend on the process used in the preparation of the divinylarene precursor to the divinylarene dioxide. For example, divinylbenzene prepared by the dehydrogenation of diethylbenzene (DEB) may contain quantities of ethylvinylbenzene (EVB) and DEB. Upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide, EVB produces ethylvinylbenzene monoxide while DEB remains unchanged. The presence of these compounds can increase the epoxide equivalent weight of the divinylarene dioxide to a value greater than that of the pure compound.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0021">In one embodiment, the divinylarene dioxide useful in the present invention comprises, for example, divinylbenzene dioxide (DVBDO), a low viscosity liquid epoxy resin. The viscosity of the divinylarene dioxide used in the process of the present invention ranges generally from about 0.001 Pa s to about 0.1 Pa s, preferably from about 0.01 Pa s to about 0.05 Pa s, and more preferably from about 0.01 Pa s to about 0.025 Pa s, at 25Â° C.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="2">Core Shell Rubber</heading>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0023">The second component is a core shell rubber comprising a rubber particle core and a shell layer. The core shell rubber has a particle size in the range of from 0.01 Î¼m to 0.8 Î¼m in an embodiment, from 0.05 Î¼m to 0.5 Î¼m in another embodiment, and from 0.08 Î¼m to 0.30 Î¼m in yet another embodiment. The core shell rubber is a polymer comprising a rubber particle core formed by a polymer comprising an elastomeric or rubbery polymer as a main ingredient, optionally an intermediate layer formed with a monomer having two or more double bonds and coated on the core layer, and a shell layer formed by a polymer graft polymerized on the core or on an intermediate layer. The shell layer partially or entirely covers the surface of the rubber particle core by graft polymerizing a monomer to the core.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0024">In an embodiment, the polymer constituting the rubber particle core is crosslinked and has limited solubility in the divinylarene dioxide component. In an embodiment, the rubber particle core is insoluble in the divinylarene dioxide component. Further, the rubber content in the rubber particle core is generally in the range of from 60 weight percent to 100 weight percent, 80 weight percent to 100 weight percent in another embodiment, 90 weight percent to 100 weight percent in another embodiment and 95 weight percent to 100 weight percent in yet another embodiment.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0025">Generally, the polymer constituting the rubber particle core has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 0Â° C. or lower and â30Â° C. or lower in another embodiment. In an embodiment, the polymer constituting the rubber particle core is made from an elastomeric material comprising from 50 weight percent to 100 weight percent of at least one member selected from diene monomers (conjugated diene monomers) and (meth)arcylic acid ester monomers and 0 to 50 weight percent of other copolymerizable vinyl monomers, polysiloxane type elastomers or combinations thereof. The term â(meth)acrylâ is defined as acryl and/or methacryl.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0026">The diene monomer (conjugated diene monomer) constituting the elastomeric material can include but is not limited to, for example, butadiene, isoprene and chloroprene. In an embodiment, butadiene is used. Further, the (meth)acrylic ester monomer can include, for example, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate and lauryl methacrylate. In another embodiment, butyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate can be used. They can be used alone or in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0027">Further, the above-mentioned elastomeric materials of a diene monomer or (meth)acrylate ester monomer can also be a copolymer of a vinyl monomer copolymerizable therewith. The vinyl monomer copolymerizable with the diene monomer or (meth)arcylic ester monomers can include, for example, aromatic vinyl monomers and vinyl cyanate monomers. Examples of aromatic vinyl monomers that can be used include but are not limited to styrene, Î±-methylstyrene, and vinyl naphthalene, while examples of vinyl cyanate monomers that can be used include but are not limited to (meth)acrylonitrile and substituted acrylonitrile. The aromatic vinyl monomers and vinyl cyanate monomers can be used alone or in combination.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0028">In an embodiment, the amount of the diene monomer or (meth)arcylic ester monomer used is in the range of from 50 weight percent to 100 weight percent and, in another embodiment, from 60 weight percent to 100 weight percent based on the entire weight of the elastomeric material. If the amount of the diene monomer or (meth)arcylic ester monomer to be used for the entire rubber elastomer is less than 50 weight percent, the ability of the polymer particles to toughen a polymer network, such as a cured epoxy matrix, is decreased. On the other hand, the amount of the monomer copolymerizable therewith is, in an embodiment, 50 weight percent or less and, in another embodiment, 40 weight percent or less based on the entire weight of the elastomeric material.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0029">Further, as an ingredient constituting the elastomeric material, a polyfuntional monomer may also be included for controlling the degree of crosslinking. The polyfunctional monomer can include, for example, divinylbenzene, butanediol di(meth)acrylate, triallyl(iso)cyanurate, allyl(meth)acrylic, diallyl itaconate, and diallyl phthalate. The polyfunctional monomer can be used in an amount in the range of from 0 weight percent to 10 weight percent, from 0 weight percent to 3 weight percent in another embodiment, and from 0 weight percent to 0.3 weight percent in yet another embodiment, based on the entire weight of the elastomeric material. In the case where the amount of the polyfunctional monomer exceeds 10 weight percent, the ability of the polymer particles to toughen a polymer network, such as cured epoxy matrix is decreased.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0030">Optionally, a chain transfer agent may be used for controlling the molecular weight or the crosslinking density of the polymer constituting the elastomeric material. The chain transfer agent can include, for example, an alkylmercaptan containing from 5 to 20 carbon atoms. The amount of the chain transfer agent in the recipe is generally in the range of from 0 weight percent to 5 weight percent and, in another embodiment, from 0 weight percent to 3 weight percent based on the entire weight of the elastomeric material. In the case where the amount exceeds 5 weight percent, the amount of the non-crosslinked portion in the rubber particle core increases, which may result in undesired effects on the heat resistance, rigidity, etc. of the composition when it is incorporated into an epoxy resin composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0031">A polysiloxane type elastomer may be used in place of the elastomeric material described above as the rubber particle core or in combination therewith. In the case where the polysiloxane type elastomer is used as the rubber particle core, a polysiloxane type elastomer constituted of dialkyl or diaryl substituted silyloxy unit, for example, dimethyl silyloxy, methylphenyl silyloxy, and diphenyl silyloxy can be used. In an embodiment, when using such a polysiloxane type elastomer, a crosslinked structure can be introduced by using a polyfunctional alkoxy silane compound or with radial polymerization of silane compound having a vinylic reactive group.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0032">In an embodiment, the polymer particles can be configured to have an intermediate layer between an elastic core layer and a shell layer. The intermediate layer is formed by using a monomer (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as a âmonomer for intermediate layer formationâ) having two or more polymerizable (radical polymerizable) double bonds in a single molecule. Through one of the double bonds, the monomer for intermediate layer formation is graft-polymerized with a polymer forming the elastic core layer to substantially chemically bond the intermediate layer and the shell layer and, at the same time, through the remaining double bond(s), crosslinking the surface of the elastic core layer. This can improve the grafting efficiency of the shell layer, since many double bonds are arranged in the elastic core layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0033">In an embodiment, the intermediate layer is present in an amount of from 0.2 weight percent to 7 weight percent of the polymer particles. The monomer has two or more double bonds and can be selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylate type polyfunctional monomers, isocyanuric acid derivatives, aromatic vinyl type polyfunctional monomers, and aromatic polycarboxylic acid esters. Radical polymerizable double bonds are more efficient to form a crosslinked layer that covers surface of the elastic core layer. The mass of the monomers forming the intermediate layer equals the mass of the intermediate layer, assuming all monomers added to the formulation participated in the reaction to form the intermediate layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0034">The shell layer can provide the affinity to the rubbery polymer particles for the particles to be stably dispersed in the form of primary particles in the polyol component.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0035">The polymer constituting the shell layer is graft polymerized with the polymer constituting the rubber particle core in an embodiment, substantially forming a chemical bond with the polymer constituting the core. For facilitating production of the composition containing the polyol component according to the production process of this invention, at least 70 weight percent in one embodiment, at least 80 weight percent in another embodiment, and at least 90 weight percent in yet another embodiment, of the polymer constituting the shell layer is bonded with the core.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0036">In an embodiment, the shell layer has limited swellability, compatibility or affinity to the polyol component to facilitate mixing and dispersion of the rubbery polymer particles in the resins.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0037">In another embodiment, the shell layer has non-reactive functional groups with epoxide, but optionally reactive functional groups capable of forming chemical bonds with epoxy hardeners, such as amines and anhydrides, under conditions where the epoxy resins react with the curing agents are also suitable.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0038">In an embodiment, the polymer constituting the shell layer is a polymer or copolymer obtained by polymerizing or copolymerizing one or more ingredients selected from the group consisting of (meth)arcylic esters, aromatic vinyl compounds, vinyl cyanate compounds, unsaturated acid derivatives, (meth)acrylamide derivatives and maleimide derivatives. Particularly, in embodiments where chemical reactivity is required for the shell layer during curing of the epoxy composition, it is preferred to use a copolymer obtained by copolymerizing one or more of monomers containing one or more of reactive functional groups selected from carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, carbon-carbon double bonds, anhydride groups, amino groups or amide groups which can react with the epoxy composition, or a curing agent thereof, or a curing catalyst thereof, etc., in addition to alky(meth)arcylic esters, aromatic vinyl compounds or vinyl cyanate compounds. In an embodiment, the functional group is at least one reactive functional group selected from the group consisting of an epoxy group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, an anhydride group, a hydroxyl group, or a carbon-carbon double bond.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0039">Examples of the (meth)arcylic esters that can be used include, but are not limited to alkyl(meth)acrylate esters such as methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, butyl(meth)acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl(meth)acrylate. Examples of the aromatic vinyl compounds include, but are not limited to styrene, Î±-methylstyrene, alkyl-substituted styrene, and halogen-substituted styrenes such as bromo styrene or chloro styrene. Examples of vinyl cyanate compounds include, but are not limited to (meth)acrylonitrile and substituted acrylonitrile. Examples of the monomers containing the reactive functional group include, but are not limited to 2-hydroxylethyl(meth)acrylate, 2-aminoethyl(meth)acrylate, glycidyl(meth)acrylate, and (meth)acrylate esters having a reactive side chain. Examples of the vinyl ether containing a reactive group include but are not limited to glycidyl vinyl ether and allyl vinyl ether. Examples of the unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives include but are not limited to (meth)acrylic acid, itaconic acid, chrotonic acid and maleic acid anhydride. Examples of (meth)acrylamide derivatives include, but are not limited to (meth)acrylamide (including N-substituted products). Examples maleimide derivatives include but are not limited to maleicacid imide (including N-substitution products).</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0040">The weight ratio of the core layer to the shell layer of a preferred rubber particle is generally in the range of from 40/60 to 95/5, in the range of 50/50 to 95/5 in another embodiment, and is in the range of from 60/40 to 85/15 in yet another embodiment. In a case where the core/shell weight ratio is outside of 40/60 and the amount of the rubber particle core layer is lower than that of the shell layer, then improvement in toughness of an epoxy thermoset containing the rubber particle dispersion tends to be lower. On the other hand, in cases where the ratio is outside of 95/5 and the amount of the shell layer is lower than that of the core layer, it can result in problems in the production process during coagulation and the expected properties may not be obtained.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0041">The rubbery polymer particles (B) can be produced by a well-known method, for example, emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization, or micro-suspension polymerization. Among them, a production process by the emulsion polymerization is suitable from the view point that it is easy to design composition of the rubbery polymer particles (B), and it is easy to produce the particles at an industrial scale and maintain quality of the rubbery polymer particles suitable to the process of this invention. As the emulsifying or dispersing agent in an aqueous medium, it is preferred to use those that maintain emulsifying or dispersion stability even in the case where pH of the aqueous latex is neutral. Specifically, they include, for example, nonionic emulsifier or dispersant such as alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of various acids, for example, alkyl or aryl sulfonic acids typically represented by dioctyl sulfosuccinic acid or dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid, alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid typically represented by dodecyl sulfonic acid, alkyl or aryl ether sulfonic acid, alkyl or aryl substituted phosphoric acid, alkyl or aryl ether substituted phosphoric acid, or N-alkyl or aryl sarcosinic acid typically represented by dodecyl sarcosinic acid, alkyl or aryl carboxylic acid typically represented by oleic acid or stearic acid, alkyl or aryl ether carboxylic acids, and alkyl or aryl substituted polyethylene glycol, and dispersant such as polyvinyl alcohol, alkyl substituted cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or polyacrylic acid derivative.

In addition, modulus slightly increased in amine cured thermosets, and only minor decrease in modulus was observed in anhydride cured system.</p>
