      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of ophthalmology, and particularly provides a system and a configured device for preliminary diagnosis of ocular diseases, which is based on imaging of the eyes and on the diagnosis of ocular disorders, on the basis of the processing of these images and the reflection values of the retina and/or the pupil that they provide.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">An estimate based on the National Health Survey (ENS 2007) indicates that at least 1.5% to 2.6% of the Chilean population has some visual impairment, of this percentage is estimated that at least Â¼ of them has chronic defects classified as blindness. The world situation is not so different, and this reveals that there are at least 12 million children under the age of 10, which is the age group of preventive control, suffer from visual impairment due to refractive error (myopia, strabismus or astigmatism) in addition there are more severe cases like ocular cancer that affects 1 in 12,000 live births, which is usually seen in children up to 5 years old. All of these conditions and others, in most cases can be corrected without major complications with a preventive diagnosis and effective treatment in infants from birth to about 5 years old, preventing these disorders getting worse with time and treatment being too expensive, ineffective or simply being too late to be implemented.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Most of these problems could be detected at an early age, but require continuous medical supervision and examinations which are carried out with high-cost instruments that also require the presence of specialists to use them.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">For the group of infants (0-5 years) which is the control group and primary diagnosis, there are two key problems in performing these tests: it is difficult to make that infants focus their gaze intently to any device that performs the test and also the ophthalmologist or pediatrician has only fraction of a second to capture the image before the pupil shrinks in response to the bright flash light. These problems lead to pediatricians are unable to detect ocular problems early, and therefore cannot effectively take preventive measures before the problem getting worse.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The red pupillary reflex is fairly well understood by ophthalmologists and pediatric specialists worldwide, and has been used as a diagnostic instrument around the world since the 60s. Normally, the light reaches the retina and a portion of it is reflected off the pupil by the choroid or posterior uvea, which is a layer of small vessels and pigmented cells located near the retina. The reflected light, seen from a coaxial instrument to the optical plane of the eye, normally present a reddish color, due to the color of blood and pigments of the cells, so this color can vary from shiny reddish or yellowish in people with light pigmentation to a more grayish red or dark pigmentation in people with dark pigmentation. In 1962, Bruckner (Bruckner R. Exakte Strabismus diagnostic bei 1/2-3 jahrigen Kindern mit einem einfachen Verfahren, dem âDurchleuchtungstest.â Ophthalmologica 1962; 144: 184-98) described abnormalities in the pupillary reflex as well as in quality, intensity, symmetry or presence of abnormal figures, therefore, pupilar red color test is also known as Bruckner test. Another similar test is the Hirschberg test, which uses the corneal reflex to detect misalignment of the eyes, which enables to diagnose some degree of strabismus (Wheeler, M. âObjective Strabismometry in Young Children.â Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc 1942; 40:. 547-564). In summary, these tests are used to detect misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), different sizes of the eyes (anisometropy), abnormal growths in the eye (tumors), opacity (cataract) and any abnormalities in the light refraction (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism).</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">The evaluation of the pupillary and corneal reflexes is a medical procedure that can be performed with an ophthalmoscope, an instrument invented by Francis A. Welch and William Noah Allyn in 1915 and used since the last century. Today, his company Welch Allyn, has products that follow this line as Pan Opticâ¢. There are also photographic screening type portable devices for the evaluation of pupilar red color as Plusoptix (Patent application No. WO9966829) or Spotâ¢ Photoscreener (Patent Application No. EP2676441A2), but the cost ranges between USD 100 to 500, they weigh about 1 kg and also require experience in interpreting the observed images.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">With regard to state of the art, concerning computer applications for the prompt diagnosis of ocular diseases, the application No. FR2876570 A1 by Mawas, presents a process to obtain a picture with a camera and remit it in negative to a specialist ophthalmologist via email, in order to detect strabismus (Hirschberg test); however, this lacks the processing of the image, the immediately preliminary diagnosis and its application to mobile devices. The patent application No. US2013235346 A1 by Huang, points to a smart device application to obtain a set of pictures, at two specified working distances, and four orientations to run of photo-refraction tests, Bruckner and Hirschberg test, but requires masks that function like outlines on the screen, where the patient's face is fixed to obtain working distances, and there is no subsequent processing of images for a higher quality image.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">The present invention is a practical and reliable solution for rapid diagnosis of ocular problems, which allows a preliminary examination only with the use of smart phones or tablet type devices, currently used by millions of people worldwide. The application can be run by parents, paramedics, pediatricians and ophthalmologists without the need for a more complex instrument or experience in the use of these, and effectively allows conducting a test to detect ocular problems. This application prototype was tested in 100 infants, from which 3 children with problems were detected, and which were referred to specialists who positively found ocular problems. The system allows to conduct a preliminary medical test regarding to the pupillary reflex (pupillary red color test or Bruckner test) and corneal reflex (Hirschberg test).</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The present invention relates to a system for the preliminary diagnosis of ocular diseases, said system comprising: <ul id="ul-00001-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00002-en" list-style="none"><li>a device for capturing images or a camera;</li><li>a device generating light or a flash;</li><li>a screen for displaying the image;</li><li>a memory for storing data</li><li>a computational application stored in the memory that executes the process of capturing a plurality of images of the eyes of an individual, and a final corrected image obtained through the processing of said plurality of images, by performing a post-processing of the final image corrected by calculating the percentage of the colors that compose the pupillary reflex of each eye and comparing it with the values obtained for previous clinical cases;</li><li>and a processor functionally attached to the camera, the flash, the screen and the memory, such that runs the application.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0018">In the system of the invention, the memory further includes images for the comparison of the final corrected image with previously diagnosed clinical cases, with ocular diseases.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0019">The system can be implemented by using a computational device, a smart phone, or any device with connection to a camera, either an internal camera or a webcam and a system of a lighting device, of a built-in flash type.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0020">The present invention also includes an âex vivoâ method for the preliminary diagnosis of ocular diseases, comprising the steps of: <ul id="ul-00003-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00004-en" list-style="none"><li>focusing the image of the individual's eyes, using a camera and a screen of a computing device;</li><li>eliminating ambient lighting; in case a light is on in the room, the light is turned off, and if there is natural light, closing the windows or curtains to decrease it;</li><li>capturing a plurality of images of the individual's eyes with said camera, using the flash;</li><li>processing the plurality of images, by using a computational application in order to obtain a final corrected image of the individual's eyes;</li><li>displaying the said final corrected image on the screen and visually comparing it with clinical cases previously diagnosed with ocular diseases.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0026">For the processing of the plurality of images, in order to obtain a final corrected image, the computational application includes the following steps: <ul id="ul-00005-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00006-en" list-style="none"><li>i. making a first selection of images from the plurality of images;</li><li>ii. obtaining an approximation of the area of the individual's face in each image of the said first selection;</li><li>iii. aligning the mentioned first selection of images, from the edge detection by its spatial translation in each image of the said first selection;</li><li>iv. determining the area of the two eyes in each image of the said first selection;</li><li>v. obtaining a determined location of the center of the two eyes from each image of the said first selection;</li><li>vi. making a second selection of images, from said first selection, to select a single image of the individual's eyes with greater sharpness;</li><li>vii. processing that said single image to obtain a final corrected image with greater focus;</li><li>viii. cutting the eyes of the individual from that final corrected image, from the determined location of the centers and calculating the area of the two eyes; and</li><li>ix. post-processing the final corrected image, to detect the percentage of the colors that compose the pupillary reflex.</li></ul></li></ul></p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0056">Illustrative embodiments of the preferred embodiment are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another.

      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0057">In the specification, reference may be made to the spatial relationships between various components and to the spatial orientation of various aspects of components as the devices are depicted in the attached drawings. However, as will be recognized by those skilled in the art after a complete reading of the present application, the devices, members, apparatuses, etc. described herein may be positioned in any desired orientation. Thus, the use of terms to describe a spatial relationship between various components or to describe the spatial orientation of aspects of such components should be understood to describe a relative relationship between the components or a spatial orientation of aspects of such components, respectively, as the device described herein may be oriented in any desired direction.</p>
      <p id="p-00035-en" num="0058">The present invention relates essentially to a system and method employing a computational application that can be executed on mobile devices and related devices, which allows obtaining a preliminary examination of ocular conditions, using the pupillary and corneal reflexes obtained from a photograph of the eyes.</p>
      <p id="p-00036-en" num="0059">Unlike the old cameras of the non-digital age, digital cameras and mobile devices, like current smartphones or tablets, are programmed with a temporary setup between camera and flash, in such a way to avoid the reflection of the red pupil in the pictures that are obtained with them. However, is not well known that this reflex has important information about ocular diseases, and can be used for their detection as a preliminary screening using the invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00037-en" num="0060">Since mobile devices are currently used by millions of people around the world, the purpose of the present invention is to provide an application easy to use to the general population, without requiring the utilization of complex ophthalmic instruments, and which recreates the effect of old cameras that can capture the reddish reflex of the eyes, but also includes a processing of the obtained image, so this reflection to be sharper and more focused.</p>
      <p id="p-00038-en" num="0061">The present invention, therefore, is a useful tool for the early and preliminary detection of ocular diseases, which are then confirmed by specialists. Furthermore, this computational application has been particularly useful for avoiding problems associated to perform ocular examinations in infants, since through it is not necessary to sleep them, keep them focused, or subjected to long ocular examinations, is not necessary to dilate their pupils by using pharmacological drops, with the consequent disadvantages that they usually produce. The present invention can perform this examination by simply lowering the ambient lighting before taking the pictures of the eye, using the flash. Infants are the group of greatest need for continuous ocular controls, because at this age they can develop many of the ocular problems that could have on their lives as adults, which often fail to be detected early.</p>
      <p id="p-00039-en" num="0062">The computational application of the present invention can be installed in any electronic device. A non-limiting example of a smartphone, according to the invention, is an iPhone 4SÂ®, marketed by Apple Inc., and shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. This smartphone has a camera for capturing images (lens <b>1</b>), a device generating light or flash <b>2</b>, a screen that allows displaying images <b>3</b> and serve to focus on the individual, a memory that stores the application and images, and a processor that runs the application to obtain the final images.</p>
      <p id="p-00040-en" num="0063">In <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, is represented how the camera of the device in question is activated, the output of the camera is shown on screen <b>3</b>. The focus point is marked with respect to the individual's eyes <b>4</b> touching the screen <b>5</b>, in order to proceed, subsequently, to lower the amount of ambient lighting. The pupil dilates naturally being in low light, so, at this moment, the taking of a plurality of images is activated, using the application.</p>
      <p id="p-00041-en" num="0064">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, which is a graphical representation of a screenshot of the application, shows the button for the initiation of taking a plurality of images <b>6</b>, a setting button <b>7</b> and a button to display the images obtained <b>8</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00042-en" num="0065">To begin capturing pictures, the application turns on the flash light <b>2</b>, but the pictures will begin to be processed when the application estimates that what is being captured is already under the influence of light from the flash. The application estimates the amount of light contained in each image, transforming these to Yâ²UV color space, which represent a luminance component Yâ² and two chrominance components UV. The application calculates the average of the component Yâ², which represents the luminance of the pixel. Then, calculating the luminance before starting and during the frames, the application discriminates from which frame to start capturing, as it is known from this frame, that the flash <b>2</b> is affecting the captured image.</p>
      <p id="p-00043-en" num="0066">Frames containing no flash light <b>2</b> are discarded. The application performs it by removing an arbitrary number of frames captured since the flash <b>2</b> started to work, so then be able to capture ten images to be used in the process.</p>
      <p id="p-00044-en" num="0067">The capture of the first image of the process is different from the others, since in this frame the approximate area of the individual's face is detected using an appropriate âhaar cascadeâ, which is a process that captures the best section of the individual's face, and this section is cropped, obtaining the image to be used; this minimizes the amount of information to be processed by the application. In order to obtain the rest of the images, the same detected area is cropped, obtaining images of the same size as the first. Notably, the first frames pictures since the flash <b>2</b> has an effect, where the greatest effect on the retina reflex occurs, because at that time the pupil is dilated by the little pre-flash light. For this reason, the number of used frames does not exceed ten.</p>
      <p id="p-00045-en" num="0068">By completing the capture of the ten images, a camera stabilization process is performed, which helps to reduce camera shake or movement of the person in the sequence. To achieve this, first the position of the prominent edges of the image (âgood features to trackâ) is detected. These same points are then searched in the next image frame by calculating the âoptical flowâ. After obtaining the points of the first image in the following one, the calculation of the translational suffered by the following image, regarding its predecessor, is performed. For this, the average of the motion vectors of all the prominent edges of this is calculated by transferring the image by that amount. This allows the eyes to be always in the same position in all the taken pictures, so it is possible, as will be explained later, to perform the detection of the important features, using not one, but several pictures.</p>
      <p id="p-00046-en" num="0069">With the images already aligned the area enclosed by each eye of each of the images is calculated, using a âcascade haarâ both for the right eye and the left eye. Afterwards, using the image gradients the center of the pupil of each eye is obtained in each image. After, the images where all the features could not be detected are discarded.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0070">At this time, a set of positions of centers and a set of areas where the eyes are, are available. With this, it is possible to calculate a position that represents better the eye center. To do this, first all outliers from the set of centers are eliminated and then position of all of them are averaged. A similar process is applied to each of the squares enclosing the eyes, getting the best square enclosing each eye. At the end, the process selects the picture that is less blurry as the final image.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0071">To perform the above, a defocusing of each of the images, using a Gaussian filter is performed. Then, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is calculated, and the average of 90% of the highest values are calculated, obtaining a value that estimates how sharper the image is. The chosen image is also passed by another process called âunsharp maskingâ to focus it digitally, which consists of blurring the image, using a Gaussian blur and subtracting the result to the original image on a weighted basis for a larger focus. Then, the portion of the image is cropped in the best frame obtained in the previous step for each eye, and another image, corresponding to the pupil and iris of the eye is cropped, from the best center also obtained in the previous step.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0072">By the process just described, a good reflection on the retina can be obtained, producing a color which allows diagnostic analysis. This color is usually related to the internal condition of the eye. In a normal patient, this will be reddish tonality; and in abnormal cases could detect a white color that may indicate the existence of some abnormal body into the eye, or a yellow color indicating some eye deformation. So a post processing in which it is necessary to detect what color appeared in the pupil reflex shooting takes place. To do this the amount of red, white and yellow color in the image of the pupil is calculated. To do this the image of the pupil of each eye is transformed to HSV color space and passed through a mask that leaves in color white all colors within a specific range. The percentage of white pixels is then calculated, getting the percentage of that color in the image. <ul id="ul-00009-en" list-style="none"><li><ul id="ul-00010-en" list-style="none"><li>If the predominant color is red, it is likely that the eye looks normal. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is an example of this case, where the reflection of the red pupil <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> seen in both eyes is normal.</li><li>If the predominant color is red, with a percentage of orange or yellow color, is likely to have a common problem in sight. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is an example of this case, where the presence of a yellow reflection in the right eye <b>14</b> of the patient may be a sign of refractive errors or strabismus. It is recommended for this patient to request a visit to the ophthalmologist.</li><li>If the predominant color is white, there is probably a problem with a tumor disease in the eye. <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is an example of this case, where the reflection of the red reflex seen in the right eye <b>15</b> is normal. The white reflection in the left eye <b>16</b> may be a sign of a dangerous condition within the patient's eye. It is recommended for the patient to visit an ophthalmologist as soon as possible, urgently.</li><li>In case none of the above situations occurs, the analysis does not reach a conclusive result, so the patient should require an expert and conduct more complex tests with the proper equipment, to obtain a more accurate diagnosis.</li></ul></li></ul></p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0077">Finally, the final processed image (<figref>FIG. 7B</figref>) can be seen, to be used for diagnosing ocular diseases. <figref>FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> show a comparison between a normally captured image with an electronic device, according to the invention (<figref>FIG. 7A</figref>) and the final image processed by the computer application (<figref>FIG. 7B</figref>).</p>
