      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">This disclosure relates to prosthetics generally, and more specifically to systems and methods for total ankle replacement.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The ankle is a joint that acts much like a hinge. The joint is formed by the union of three bones. The ankle bone is the talus. The top of the talus fits inside a socket that is formed by the lower end of the tibia, and the fibula, the small bone of the lower leg. Arthritis, bone degeneration, and/or injury can cause ankle joint deterioration resulting in pain, reduced range of motion, and decreased quality of life. In many cases, physicians are recommending ankle replacement surgery with an implant as an option. Consequently, improved systems and methods of providing ankle replacement surgery are desirable.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates one example of a configuration of channel <b>16</b> in accordance with some embodiments. Channel <b>16</b> is illustrated as having a flat bottom surface <b>16</b><i>a </i>and angled side walls <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>that taper inwardly such that the top of channel <b>16</b> is narrower than the bottom. Second channel <b>17</b> is aligned along the same longitudinal axis as first channel <b>16</b> and is shaped identical to first channel <b>16</b> with a flat bottom surface <b>17</b><i>a </i>and angled side walls <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>c </i>that taper inwardly such that the top of channel <b>17</b> is narrower than the bottom.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0134">
        <figref>FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates another example of a configuration of channel <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 2D</figref>, side walls <b>16</b><i>b </i>and <b>16</b><i>c </i>perpendicularly extend from bottom surface <b>16</b><i>a</i>. Like first channel <b>16</b>, second channel <b>17</b> can also be configured such that side walls <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>17</b><i>c </i>perpendicularly extend from bottom wall <b>17</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments, side walls <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, <b>17</b><i>c </i>include internal extending rails <b>16</b><i>d</i>, <b>17</b><i>d </i>that perpendicularly extend inwardly from side walls <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>b</i>, <b>17</b><i>c</i>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0135">Regardless of the configuration of channels <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>, either first channel <b>16</b> or second channel <b>17</b> faces away from the ankle and will engage with rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> as described in greater detail below. This configuration enables rotation guide slide <b>20</b> to be used during an ankle replacement procedure for either the right ankle or left ankle.</p>
      <p id="p-00136-en" num="0136">
        <figref>FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are isometric views of one example of a rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> in accordance with some embodiment, and <figref>FIG. 3C</figref> is a side profile view rotation guide pointer <b>30</b>. Rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> comprises a wide, rectangular base <b>22</b> and a narrow, elongated pointer extension <b>24</b> that extends from base <b>22</b>. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref>, the underside <b>21</b> of base <b>22</b> includes a protrusion <b>26</b> configured to engage first channel <b>16</b> or second channel <b>17</b> of rotation guide slide <b>20</b>. Protrusion <b>26</b> extends longitudinally across base <b>22</b> (i.e., in a direction that is perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal length of elongated pointer extension <b>24</b>). As best seen in <figref>FIG. 3C</figref> and has a flat bottom surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and angled sides <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>26</b><i>c </i>such that the top portion of protrusion <b>26</b> is narrower than the bottom surface such that protrusion <b>26</b> has a complementary shape to channels <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> of rotation guide slide <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, sides <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>26</b><i>c </i>of protrusion <b>26</b> perpendicularly extend from bottom surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>of protrusion <b>26</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00137-en" num="0137">Referring again to <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, the top side <b>25</b> of base <b>22</b> includes a finger tab <b>27</b> extending perpendicularly from the top side <b>25</b> of base <b>22</b> and running along a lateral axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of protrusion <b>26</b>. Put another way, finger tab <b>27</b> extends from top side <b>25</b> and extends parallel to the longitudinal direction of the elongated pointer extension <b>24</b>. Finger tab <b>27</b> can be used to approximately align pointer extension <b>24</b> with the mechanical axis of the tibia <b>260</b> as described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00138-en" num="0138">Still referring to <figref>FIG. 3A</figref>, top side <b>25</b> of base <b>22</b> defines a pair of screw holes <b>36</b>, with one hole being located on either side of finger tab <b>27</b>. Each screw hole <b>36</b> is configured to receive a screw <b>37</b> (<figref>FIG. 4A</figref>) to affix rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> to rotation guide slide <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, screw <b>37</b> extends through protrusion <b>26</b>, exiting bottom surface <b>26</b><i>a </i>and penetrating bottom surface <b>16</b><i>a </i>on the rotation guide slide <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, screws <b>37</b> do not exit the rotation guide pointer <b>30</b>; rather, screws <b>37</b> are configured to expand side walls <b>26</b><i>b </i>and <b>26</b><i>c</i>, causing protrusion <b>26</b> to expand within channel <b>16</b> and creating a friction connection between rotation guide pointer and rotation guide slide.</p>
      <p id="p-00139-en" num="0139">Pointer extension <b>24</b> extends from base <b>22</b> at a first end <b>31</b> and tapers at a second end <b>32</b> to form a rounded point <b>33</b>. Pointer extension <b>24</b> defines a pin hole <b>28</b> along its length that extends from a top side <b>34</b> to a bottom side <b>35</b>. The pin hole <b>28</b> is positioned at a distance from the base <b>22</b> that is sufficient to allow the appropriate travel of other components, e.g., adjustment block <b>100</b>, which is described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00140-en" num="0140">The use of rotation guide assembly <b>40</b> is now briefly described with reference to <figref>FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, which is used once access is gained to the tibia <b>260</b> and talus <b>265</b>. In some embodiments, such access is gained by making an anterior incision lateral of the tibialis, with care taken to avoid the anterior tendons, to expose the tibia <b>260</b>, talus <b>265</b>, and a portion of the midfoot. In some embodiments, the incision is approximately 125 mm long; however, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the incision can be greater or less than 125 mm.</p>
      <p id="p-00141-en" num="0141">Gutter fork <b>10</b> is inserted into the medial gutter of the ankle joint, and rotation guide slide <b>20</b> is operationally connected to medial gutter fork <b>10</b> by placing guide hole <b>18</b> over shaft <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 4A</figref>. Rotation guide slide <b>20</b> is positioned with either first channel <b>16</b> or second channel <b>17</b> facing away from the tibia <b>260</b>. Rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> is operationally connected to rotation guide slide <b>20</b> by sliding protrusion <b>26</b> into either first channel <b>16</b> or second channel <b>17</b>, whichever is facing away from the tibia <b>260</b>. Thus assembled, an operator uses finger tab <b>27</b> to rotate the combined rotation guide slide <b>20</b> and rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> about an axis defined by shaft <b>2</b>. A surgeon or other profession can also use finger tab <b>27</b> to slide rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> along an axis defined by first channel <b>16</b> or second channel <b>17</b>. The operator thus uses finger tab <b>27</b> to rotate the combined rotation guide slide <b>20</b> and rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> and slide rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> until pointer extension <b>24</b> is approximately aligned with the mechanical axis of the tibia <b>260</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00142-en" num="0142">The position of rotation guide slide <b>20</b> can be fixed relative to gutter fork <b>10</b> by inserting a set screw (not shown) into hole <b>19</b> defined by rotation guide slide <b>20</b>, and the position of the rotation guide pointer <b>30</b> relative to the rotation guide slide <b>20</b> can be fixed by tightening screws <b>37</b>.

Also shown in <figref>FIG. 35</figref> is a drill guide <b>280</b> attached to the tool holder <b>134</b> of the adjustment block <b>100</b>, with the first frame <b>110</b> slightly above the anterior surface of the tibia <b>260</b>. In some embodiments, the tool holder <b>134</b> includes a stage with a pair of pins <b>135</b>, and the drill guide <b>280</b> has a corresponding pair of mounting ears <b>283</b> with holes adapted to snap onto the pins <b>135</b>. This tool holder design is just exemplary in nature, and other embodiments include other suitable mounting structures as described in greater detail below.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0173">In the embodiment of <figref>FIG. 35</figref>, the drill guide <b>280</b> is a small profile device sized and shaped to be inserted beneath the refracted skin (not shown) in the ankle region. The drill guide <b>280</b> has at least two guide holes <b>281</b> to be used to drill pilot holes in the tibia <b>260</b>. The drill guide also has pin holes <b>282</b> that can be used to pin the drill guide to the bone, for position fixation. In some embodiments, the drill guide <b>280</b> has sizing patterns <b>285</b> showing the size and location of one or more resectioning cuts corresponding to the holes to be drilled using the drill guide <b>280</b>. In some embodiments, the drill guide <b>280</b> has one or more reference lines <b>286</b> that the physician optionally can use to position the drill guide <b>280</b> (by adjusting the proximal-distal knob <b>111</b>, the medial-lateral knob <b>121</b><i>a </i>or <b>121</b><i>b</i>, and the anterior-posterior knob. In some embodiments, the lines <b>285</b>, <b>286</b> are visible under a fluoroscope, so the physician can view the position and size of the lines <b>285</b>, <b>286</b> in situ, relative to the patient's bones.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0174">The physician sizes the tibial tray component of the ankle replacement system by mounting a drill guide <b>280</b> on the tool holder and adjusting its position as described above. The position adjustment device (adjustment block) <b>100</b> is locked with the tool holder <b>134</b> at first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0175">The physician views the X-ray of the tibia bone <b>260</b> and drill guide <b>280</b> and determines whether it is the optimum size and position for the patient. The position can be adjusted based on the X-ray, using knobs <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>131</b>. If the size of the resectioning cut corresponding to the drill guide <b>280</b> is too large or too small, the physician removes the drill guide, selects a different size drill guide, and snaps the new drill guide onto the tool holder <b>134</b> of the adjustment block <b>100</b>. The drill guide is then repositioned against the tibia, imaged by fluoroscope, and the size is again checked. To facilitate fluoroscopic X-ray imaging, the drill guide <b>280</b> can be made of plastic, while the circles surrounding holes <b>281</b> and the patterns <b>285</b>, <b>286</b> can be made of metal. Thus, only the circles surrounding holes <b>281</b> and the patterns <b>285</b>, <b>286</b> appear on the X-ray, superimposed against the tibia <b>260</b> and talus <b>265</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0176">Although some embodiments use a single drill guide <b>280</b> for sizing, location of fixation pins by holes <b>282</b> and drilling corners <b>281</b>, other embodiments described below use a first guide with holes <b>282</b> and patterns <b>285</b>, <b>286</b> for sizing the tibia trial <b>210</b> and locating the fixation pins, and a second guide (e.g., a drilling guide) with holes <b>281</b> and <b>282</b> for performing the drilling. Because the adjustment block <b>100</b> and the pins in holes <b>282</b> provide common references, the holes <b>281</b> can still be drilled with proper location relative to the pin holes <b>282</b> and patterns <b>285</b>, <b>286</b>.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 36</figref> shows the tibia <b>260</b> with adjustment block <b>100</b> and drill guide <b>280</b>. Soft tissue is omitted for ease of viewing. When the physician has verified that the optimum size of drill guide <b>280</b> has been selected, the physician pins the drill guide <b>280</b> to the tibia <b>260</b> using (e.g., 2.4 mm) fixation pins <b>287</b> inserted through the pin holes <b>282</b> and trimmed such that pins <b>287</b> extend slightly above the drill guide <b>280</b>. Then the physician drills holes in the tibia <b>260</b> through the guides holes <b>281</b> using the drill guide <b>280</b> and drill <b>288</b>. The holes thus drilled in the bone <b>260</b> define corners of a resectioning cut to be performed in the tibia. The physician then removes the drill guide <b>280</b>, while leaving the pins <b>287</b> in place (in the distal portion of the tibia <b>260</b> to be removed by the resectioning). While removing the drill guide <b>280</b>, the adjustment block can remain locked in the first coordinates with the first frame <b>110</b> adjusted to the same proximal-distal coordinate and the second frame <b>120</b> adjusted to the same medial-lateral coordinate.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0178">
        <figref>FIG. 37</figref> shows the adjustment block <b>100</b> still fixed to the fixation pins <b>150</b> in the same position, with a cut guide <b>290</b> mounted to the tool holder <b>134</b> of the adjustment block <b>100</b>. The cut guide <b>290</b> has a plurality of slots <b>295</b>, sized and located to connect the corner holes drilled with the drill guide <b>280</b>. The cut guide <b>290</b> is sized and shaped to match the drill guide <b>280</b>. Thus, the physician has a set of drill guides <b>280</b> and a corresponding set of cut guides <b>290</b>. The selection of a drill guide size automatically selects the corresponding cut guide size to make cuts which are sized and located to connect the corner holes drilled with the drill guide <b>280</b>, as described above. The cut guide <b>290</b> has a corresponding pair of mounting ears <b>293</b> with holes adapted to snap onto the pins <b>135</b>. The cut guide <b>290</b> also has pin holes <b>292</b> which are sized and located to receive the fixation pins <b>287</b>. This aligns the position of the cut guide <b>290</b> with the position previously occupied by the drill guide <b>280</b>, to ensure alignment of the resectioning cuts with the previously drilled corner holes. In some embodiments, the cut guide <b>290</b> includes additional ears <b>296</b> with pin holes for receiving additional fixation pins <b>297</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0179">To mount the cut guide <b>290</b>, the physician slides the holes <b>292</b> of cut guide <b>290</b> over the fixation pins <b>287</b> and snaps the cut guide into place on the tool holder <b>134</b>. For stability, the physician can then insert two more fixation pins <b>297</b> through the pin holes of ears <b>296</b> and into the talus bone <b>265</b>. With the cut guide <b>290</b> securely pinned to bones <b>260</b>, <b>265</b>, the physician performs the resectioning cuts through the guide slots <b>295</b>, cutting the bone to connect the previously drilled holes. In some embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 37</figref>, one cut guide <b>290</b> is used for both the tibia resection and the first cut of the talar resection. The cut guide <b>290</b> is then removed from the surgery site, and detached from the adjustment block <b>100</b>. The sections of the tibia <b>260</b> and talus <b>265</b> that have been cut are removed, along with the fixation pins <b>287</b> and <b>297</b>. In other embodiments (not shown), the tibia cut guide is only used to resection the tibia, and a separate cut guide is used to resection the talus after removal of the tibia cut guide.</p>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0180">The use of the adjustment block <b>100</b> permits the holes <b>281</b> to be drilled first with a first tool, and the cuts to be performed afterwards with a second tool, while maintaining accurate alignment between the holes and the cuts. Drilling the holes first avoids stress concentrations at the corners of the resectioned distal tibia.</p>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0181">Although some embodiments described herein use a drill guide <b>280</b> and a cut guide <b>290</b> commonly fixed using the adjustment block <b>100</b> and fixation pins <b>287</b>, other embodiments attach different tools to the tool holder <b>134</b> for purpose of resectioning the tibia and talus. For example, some embodiments include a cut guide without using a separate drill guide.</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0182">Following the initial resectioning of tibia <b>260</b>, which is described in greater detail below, the physician inserts the tibia trial <b>210</b>, poly trial insert <b>230</b> and floating trial <b>250</b>, while the adjustment block <b>100</b> is still locked to the two fixation pins <b>150</b>, and the tool holder <b>134</b> is in the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions. Should the physician choose to temporarily remove the adjustment block from the surgery site (e.g., for inspection, cleaning or suctioning), the physician returns the adjustment block to the same coordinates to locate the tool holder <b>134</b> at the same position to complete the procedure. Because the fixation pins <b>150</b> are excluded from the distal portion of the tibia removed by the resection, the fixation pins <b>150</b> are available throughout the procedure for use in adjusting or correcting the resection cuts.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0183">The physician snaps the tibia trial <b>210</b> onto the tool holder <b>134</b>. <figref>FIGS. 38 and 39</figref> show the adjustment block in position with the tibia trial <b>210</b> attached. The adjustment block <b>100</b> is adjusted to position the tool holder in an anterior-posterior direction, while the tool holder is at the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions. The tibia trial <b>210</b> is repositioned in the posterior direction until a predetermined portion of the tibia trail contacts an anterior cortex of the tibia. In some embodiments, the position of the third frame <b>130</b> is adjusted until the posterior surface <b>219</b> of anterior tibia reference member <b>218</b> extending from the plate <b>211</b> contacts the anterior cortex of the tibia <b>260</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0184">In some embodiments, the tibial trial <b>210</b> is used in connection with a spacer <b>240</b> to assess the ligament laxity of the ankle joint as shown in <figref>FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref>. Spacer <b>240</b> can be provided in a variety of thicknesses including, but not limited to 4 mm, 5 mm, and 6 mm to list only a few possibilities. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 33A and 33B</figref>, spacer <b>240</b> includes an elongate body <b>242</b> including an extension <b>244</b> at one end. Extension <b>244</b> defines spaced apart holes <b>246</b> that are sized and configured to receive fixation pins <b>297</b> therein. A blind hole <b>248</b> that is at least partially threaded is also defined by spacer <b>240</b> and is configured for aiding the removal of spacer <b>240</b> from its engagement with tibial trial <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, spacer <b>240</b> is fabricated from a radiolucent material.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0185">Once tibia <b>260</b> is resectioned using the superior and angled medial and lateral slots of cutting guide <b>290</b> shown in <figref>FIG. 37</figref>, the resected portion of the tibia <b>260</b> is removed. Tibia trial <b>210</b> is inserted as described above, and spacer <b>240</b> is inserted into engagement with tibia trial <b>210</b> as shown in <figref>FIGS. 39A and 39B</figref>. The combination of tibia trial <b>210</b> and spacer <b>240</b> are used to assess the ligament laxity prior to resection of the upper talus. Once the ligament laxity has been assessed, spacer <b>240</b> can be removed and cutting guide <b>290</b> can be placed back over pins <b>297</b> and the inferior slot can be used to resect to the top of talus <b>265</b> as shown in <figref>FIG. 39C</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0186">In some embodiments, an additional talar cutting guide, such as talar cutting guide <b>270</b> illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 39D and 39E</figref>, can be used to provide an initial talar resection or to further resect the talus beyond the resection provided by cutting guide <b>290</b>. As shown in <figref>FIGS. 39D and 39E</figref>, illustrate one example of a cutting guide <b>270</b> coupled to a resected talus <b>265</b> by fixation pins <b>297</b>, which are disposed within distal holes <b>272</b>. A set of proximal holes <b>274</b>, which are offset from distal holes <b>272</b>, and an elongate cutting slot <b>276</b> slot also are defined by cutting guide <b>270</b>. As can be seen by comparing <figref>FIGS. 39D and 39E</figref>, proximal holes <b>274</b> are offset from distal holes <b>272</b> by a distance to provide a surgeon with the options of resecting different amounts of the talus bone. In some embodiments, the vertical difference between the position of holes <b>272</b> and holes <b>274</b> is 2 mm. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the vertical distance between the center of holes <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> can be greater or less than 2 mm.</p>

        <figref>FIG. 40</figref> shows the tibia <b>260</b> and talus <b>265</b> with the tibia trial <b>210</b> in position. The tibia peg drill (not shown) is placed in the head of a tibia peg drill guide <b>299</b>, and is inserted in the holes <b>212</b> (<figref>FIG. 31</figref>) of the tibia trial <b>210</b>. The physician drills a plurality (e.g., <b>3</b>) peg holes <b>263</b> in the distal surface <b>262</b> of the resectioned tibia <b>260</b> using the tibia peg drill <b>299</b>. The holes <b>212</b> (<figref>FIG. 31</figref>) of the tibia trial <b>210</b> are used to locate these holes <b>263</b>. <figref>FIG. 41</figref> shows the distal end <b>261</b> of the tibia <b>260</b> at the completion of the peg drilling, with the three peg holes <b>263</b> in the resectioned surface <b>262</b> of the tibia.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0188">The tibia trial <b>210</b> is used to verify size and shape of the resectioning using the tibia trial, prior to implanting the ankle replacement system. Advantageously, the steps of attaching the tibia trial <b>210</b> to the tool holder <b>134</b>, adjusting the position adjustment device <b>100</b> to position the tool holder <b>134</b> in an anterior-posterior direction, and placing the tibia trial <b>210</b> on the resectioned tibia <b>260</b> using the tool holder <b>134</b>, can be formed without inserting any additional location fixing pins into the tibia, while the tool holder is locked in the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions.</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0189">
        <figref>FIGS. 42 and 43</figref> show the adjustment block <b>100</b> and tibia trial <b>210</b>, after installing the poly trial insert <b>230</b> into the tibia trial <b>210</b> and positioning the floating trial <b>250</b> between the talus <b>265</b> and the poly insert trial <b>230</b>, to permit articulation with the concave surface <b>232</b> of the poly insert trial <b>230</b> while the tool holder is in the first coordinates in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions. The physician can now assess the fit of the ankle replacement system, including size, anterior-posterior position, and whether the tibia has been sized, drilled and cut optimally. If any adjustments are deemed appropriate to the tibia resectioning, the physician can reapply the cut guide with the adjustment block set to the same proximal-distal and medial-lateral coordinates used before.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0190">Referring to <figref>FIGS. 44 and 45</figref>, the physician now performs a trial reduction to ensure the correct poly insert height and talus dome position. The talar implant anterior-posterior coordinate is determined by moving the floating trial <b>250</b> to the location where it best articulates with the concave surface <b>232</b> of the poly trial insert <b>230</b>. Two additional fixation pins <b>298</b> are inserted through the pin holes <b>253</b> of the floating trial <b>250</b> using a K-wire, such as a 2 mm K-wire, for example. Additional resection guides, described in greater detail below can be positioned by sliding pin holes in the resection guide(s) over the fixation pins <b>298</b>. The remaining talar cuts are then performed to match the geometry of the talar dome implant of the ankle replacement system as described below.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0191">A position adjustment device (or adjustment block) <b>100</b> as described above provides a fixed point of reference that facilitates the AP position of the tibial and talar implants of an ankle replacement system. The adjustment block <b>100</b> is capable of fixing a tibial trial <b>210</b> via a modular connection <b>134</b> to avoid insertion of additional pins in the distal tibia. The tibial trial <b>210</b>, while attached to the adjustment block <b>100</b>, allows the user to set the tibial implant anterior-posterior position by abutting the anterior post <b>218</b> against the tibial bone. The tibial trial <b>210</b> also serves as a drill guide to prepare the tibial pegs on the tibial implant.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0192">The tibial trial <b>210</b> while rigidly fixed to the adjustment block <b>100</b> then translates the anterior-posterior position to the talar trial <b>250</b> by using the poly trial insert <b>230</b> to articulate with the talar (dome) trial <b>250</b>. The talar trial <b>250</b> also has chamfer indicators <b>254</b> to help the user determine the optimal talar anterior-posterior position.</p>
      <p id="p-00193-en" num="0193">Advantageously, the system and method described above uses the adjustment block <b>100</b> as a fixed reference to associate all other instruments used for trial sizing and trials related to tibial side of the ankle replacement. Thus, a tibial sizer (e.g., drill guide <b>280</b>), tibial resection guide (e.g., cut guide <b>290</b>), and tibial trial <b>210</b> can all be anchored at the same position defined by the adjustment block <b>100</b>. This method preserves the distal layer of the tibia to avoid excess pin holes from fixation pins and devices.</p>
      <p id="p-00194-en" num="0194">The compact size of the adjustment block allows the tools to be fixed and placed close to the surgery site, for more accurate cuts, with reduced chance of components flexing. Sizing guides (e.g., drill guide <b>280</b>) and resection guides (e.g. cut guide <b>290</b>) can all be placed in the surgical window. The position of the tools and trials can be accurately adjusted by turning the adjustment knobs <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>131</b> in a small area.</p>

        <figref>FIGS. 46 and 47</figref> show another embodiment of the adjustment block <b>300</b> configured with a tool holder <b>330</b>. The adjustment block <b>300</b> has two independently positionable frames <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> for precisely positioning a tool holder <b>330</b> in the proximal-distal and medial-lateral directions, adjacent the joint to be replaced.</p>
      <p id="p-00196-en" num="0196">The first frame <b>110</b> is configured to be attached to two fixation pins <b>150</b> which have been inserted in the anterior surface of the tibia, near the distal end of the tibia as described above. A locking screw <b>112</b> actuates a locking plate (not shown), which bears against the fixation pins <b>150</b> to secure the adjustment block <b>100</b> relative to the pins. The first frame has a proximal-distal adjustment knob <b>111</b> coaxially connected to a screw <b>113</b>. The screw <b>113</b> can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread, square thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew use. The second frame <b>120</b> is fixedly attached or unitarily formed with a leadscrew nut (not shown), which the screw <b>113</b> drives. Rotation of the proximal-distal adjustment knob <b>111</b> rotates screw <b>113</b> to advance or retract the second frame <b>120</b> in the proximal-distal direction. When the second frame <b>120</b> is at the desired proximal-distal coordinate, the physician advances the locking screw <b>114</b> to lock the second frame <b>120</b> to the first frame <b>110</b> in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00197-en" num="0197">The second frame <b>120</b> has at least one medial-lateral adjustment knob <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b </i>coaxially connected to a screw <b>123</b>. The screw <b>123</b> can have an Acme thread, trapezoidal thread, square thread or other suitable thread for leadscrew use. The screw <b>123</b> drives a leadscrew nut (not shown), to which the tool holder <b>330</b> is fixedly attached or unitarily formed with. Rotation of the medial-lateral adjustment knob <b>121</b><i>a </i>or <b>121</b><i>b </i>rotates screw <b>123</b> to move the tool holder <b>330</b> in the medial-lateral direction. When the tool holder <b>330</b> is at the desired medial-lateral coordinate, the physician advances the locking screw <b>122</b> to lock the leadscrew <b>123</b> of the second frame <b>120</b> in place.</p>
      <p id="p-00198-en" num="0198">The position of the tool holder <b>330</b> in the anterior-posterior direction is determined by location of the first frame <b>110</b> relative to the pins <b>150</b>. The tool holder <b>330</b> can have any of a variety of configurations for easily attaching a tool or trial. One example of a tool holder <b>330</b> is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 46</figref>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 46</figref>, tool holder <b>330</b> includes a dovetail joint <b>332</b> and defines a cavity <b>334</b> between rails <b>336</b> of dovetail joint <b>332</b>. Tool holder <b>330</b> also defines a hole <b>338</b> extending in a direction parallel to the direction in which rails <b>336</b> of dovetail joint <b>332</b> extend from a first side <b>340</b> to a second side <b>342</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00199-en" num="0199">Cavity <b>334</b> is sized and configured to receive a locking wedge <b>344</b> therein. As best seen in <figref>FIG. 46</figref>, locking wedge <b>344</b> is cross-pinned in cavity <b>334</b> by the combination of pins <b>346</b>, <b>348</b>, which are respectively received in holes <b>350</b>, <b>352</b> (see also <figref>FIG. 52</figref>). For example, a pair of pins <b>346</b> are received within holes <b>350</b>, and a pin <b>348</b> is received within hole <b>352</b>. Locking wedge <b>344</b> includes a pair of spaced apart notches <b>354</b> (<figref>FIG. 52</figref>) each being sized and configured to receive a biasing member <b>356</b>. Biasing members <b>356</b>, which may take the form of compression springs, are disposed within notches <b>354</b> and urge locking wedge <b>344</b> towards hole <b>338</b>. A slot <b>358</b> (<figref>FIG. 52</figref>) is defined in locking wedge <b>344</b> and is sized and configured to receive pin <b>348</b> (<figref>FIG. 46</figref>) therein to prevent locking wedge <b>344</b> from being separated from tool holder <b>330</b>.</p>

For example, hole <b>338</b> defined by tool holder <b>330</b> is sized and configured to receive locking screw <b>364</b> and is in communication with cavity <b>334</b> such that shoulders <b>366</b> and <b>368</b> of locking screw <b>364</b> are in abutment with chamfers <b>362</b> of locking wedge <b>344</b>. In addition to shoulders <b>366</b>, <b>368</b>, locking screw includes an enlarged head <b>370</b> and threads or other engagement feature <b>372</b> at a distal end for engaging a corresponding structure defined by locking wedge <b>344</b> for maintaining locking wedge <b>344</b> in a locked position such that locking wedge is pressed against biasing members <b>356</b> and engages a tool disposed within dovetail joint <b>332</b>. A pin <b>374</b> is disposed within hole <b>376</b> defined by tool holder <b>330</b> at a position in which pin <b>374</b> is configured to contact shoulder <b>368</b> when locking screw <b>364</b> is in an unlocked position to maintain locking screw <b>364</b> in engagement with tool holder <b>330</b>.</p>

      <p id="p-00271-en" num="0271">With attention now to <figref>FIGS. 50-53</figref>, the sagittal sizing guide assembly <b>400</b> is then used to fluoroscopically identify the appropriate talar implant <b>1200</b> size and to set the appropriate height of talar resection. Sagittal sizing guide assembly <b>400</b> is connected to coronal sizing and drill guide <b>380</b> by lowering guide arm <b>402</b> such that mating extension <b>412</b> is engaged with slot <b>390</b>. For minimal parallax distortion the sagittal sizing guide assembly <b>400</b> should be oriented to hang on the side of the ankle closest to the c-arm receiver and the sagittal sizing guide assembly <b>400</b> should be placed as close to the bones of the ankle joint, particularly the tibia <b>260</b>, as possible. The sagittal guides are used to appropriately evaluate and position the proximal/distal resection placement of tibial and talar resections. In some embodiments, the talar size and talar chamfer preparations are estimated with the talar profile <b>486</b> on the distal side of sagittal guide. The tibia tray length is also indicated with the tibial pin length which is the proximal pin <b>480</b>. The push button <b>476</b> allows for appropriate AP placement.</p>

Then the operator drills holes in the tibia <b>260</b> through the guides holes <b>281</b> using the drill guide <b>280</b> and drill <b>288</b>. The holes thus drilled in the bone <b>260</b> define proximal corners of a resectioning cut to be performed in the tibia. The operator then removes the drill guide <b>280</b>, while leaving the pins <b>287</b> in place (in the distal portion of the tibia <b>260</b> to be removed by the resectioning). While removing the drill guide <b>280</b>, the adjustment block <b>100</b> can remain locked in the first coordinates with the first frame <b>110</b> adjusted to the same proximal-distal coordinate and the second frame <b>120</b> adjusted to the same medial-lateral coordinate.</p>

In some embodiments, additional fixation pins <b>297</b> are used to pin cut guide <b>290</b> to the talus bone <b>265</b>. Once the cut guide <b>290</b> is positioned and pinned, the operator performs the resectioning cuts through the guide slots <b>295</b>, cutting the bone to connect the previously drilled holes. In some embodiments, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref>FIG. 37</figref>, one cut guide <b>290</b> is used for both the tibia resection and the first cut of the talar resection. The cut guide <b>290</b> is then removed from the surgery site, and detached from the adjustment block <b>100</b>. The sections of the tibia <b>260</b> and talus <b>265</b> that have been cut are removed, along with the fixation pins <b>287</b> and <b>297</b>.
