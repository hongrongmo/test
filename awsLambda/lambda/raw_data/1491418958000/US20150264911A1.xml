      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to insect traps, and more particularly, relating to an illuminated insect trap for use in connection with a vacuum to dispose of the trapped insects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00002-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Insect traps of various types have been developed in the past. More specifically, insect traps heretofore devised and utilized consist of a myriad of designs that have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements. While the devices heretofore fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, they do not provide an insect trap of a new construction that attracts and captures insects as such there exists and need for an insect trap, which substantially departs from the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of an insect trap that connects to a conventional vacuum for disposal of captured insects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of insect traps now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new insect trap construction wherein the same can be used for attracting, capturing, and disposal of captured insects by a conventional vacuum cleaner.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">In general, in one aspect, an insect trap is provided. The insect trap includes a funnel body having wide open end and an opposite narrow open end. A cover is attached to the funnel body and is disposed at a vertical spaced distance from the wide open end and forms a gap between the cover and the wide open end. One or more light sources are positioned on a bottom side of the cover. A striker element is attached to the funnel body and operable to strike upon the funnel body. And, a vacuum hose has a first end connected to the narrow open end of the funnel body and a second end connectable to another vacuum hose of a conventional vacuum cleaner.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Numerous objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, embodiments of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of descriptions and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated embodiments of the invention.</p>

      <heading id="h-00005-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-5</figref>, there is representatively illustrated a new insect trap <b>10</b> in accordance with a least one embodiment of the present invention. With reference to <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, in one embodiment, the insect trap <b>10</b> includes a funnel body <b>12</b> and a cover <b>14</b> attached to the funnel body by bracket <b>15</b> at a vertically spaced distance from the wide, open end <b>16</b> of the funnel body, thereby creating a gap <b>18</b> between the cover and open end <b>16</b>. One or more light sources, preferably LED lights <b>20</b>, powered by batteries <b>21</b>, are disposed on a bottom side <b>22</b> of the cover <b>14</b> and are arranged to project light in a direction generally into the open end <b>16</b> of the funnel body <b>12</b>. To this end, insects are attracted to the light from lights <b>20</b> and are consequently drawn into the interior of the funnel body <b>12</b> through the gap <b>18</b> between the cover <b>14</b> and the funnel body.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">A vacuum hose <b>24</b> is attached by a first end <b>26</b> thereof to the narrow, open end <b>28</b> of the funnel body <b>12</b> with its opposite, second end <b>30</b> attached to a vacuum hose <b>32</b> of a conventional vacuum cleaner <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, end <b>30</b> of vacuum hose <b>24</b> is tapered so that it is able to connect to vacuum hoses of various diameters. To this end, when vacuum cleaner <b>34</b> is turned on, insects that have been trapped within funnel body <b>12</b> are vacuumed into the vacuum.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The insect trap <b>10</b> further includes a striker <b>36</b> attached to the funnel body <b>12</b>. The striker <b>36</b> is operated to impact the funnel body <b>12</b> to dislodge insects that are attached to the inner wall of the funnel body so that they are more readily removed by the vacuum <b>34</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the striker <b>36</b> is an electrically operated element, such as, for example, a solenoid striker, or another electrical or electrical-mechanical striker element.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">As further illustrated, the striker <b>36</b> is electrically connected to a timer <b>38</b>. Timer <b>38</b> is electrically powered and is plugged into a conventional electrical outlet by power cord <b>40</b>. In an embodiment, power cord <b>42</b> of the vacuum <b>34</b> can be plugged into the timer <b>38</b>. To this end, the timer <b>38</b> simultaneously powers the striker <b>36</b> and the vacuum <b>34</b> at predetermined intervals to vacuum insects from the funnel body <b>12</b>. It is contemplated, that other, more sophisticated embodiments, sensors that detect the presence of insects within the funnel body could be employed to operate the striker <b>36</b>, the vacuum <b>34</b>, or both.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The insect trap <b>10</b> includes a hanger element <b>44</b> attached to the funnel body <b>12</b> and extending vertically upward. The Hanger <b>44</b> facilitates suspending the funnel body <b>12</b> from a support structure. The insect trap <b>10</b> may also include a door hanger <b>46</b> attached to the funnel body <b>12</b> to permit hanging the funnel body from the top edge of a door. As illustrated, the hanger element <b>44</b> is attached to and extends upwardly from the door hanger <b>46</b>, which in turn is connected to both the funnel body <b>12</b> and the cover <b>14</b> by bracket <b>15</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, the insect trap <b>10</b> is shown with the electrical striker element <b>36</b> replaced by a manual striker element <b>36</b>â². Striker element <b>36</b>â² includes a spring element, such as, for example, a coil spring <b>48</b> attached at one end thereof to the funnel body <b>12</b> with a ball bearing <b>50</b> or the like attached to the opposite end. In operation, a user would simply pull back upon and release the ball bearing <b>50</b>, thereby causing the ball bearing to strike the funnel body <b>12</b> by the force of the spring <b>48</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">A number of embodiments of the present invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims.</p>
