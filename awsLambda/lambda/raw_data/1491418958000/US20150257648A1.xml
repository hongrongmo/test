  <abstract id="abstr_eng" date-changed="20150917" lang="eng" format="original">
    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A system for wearable/man-portable electromagnetic tomographic imaging includes a wearable/man-portable boundary apparatus adapted to receive a biological object within, a position determination system, electromagnetic transmitting/receiving hardware, and a hub computer system. The electromagnetic transmitting/receiving hardware collectively generates an electromagnetic field that passes into the boundary apparatus and receives the electromagnetic field after being scattered/interferenced by the biological object within. The hub computer system performs electromagnetic tomographic imaging based on the received electromagnetic field.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">1. Field of the Present Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The present invention relates generally to electromagnetic tomography, and, in particular but not exclusively, to electromagnetic tomographic imaging with man-portable components, including methods, devices, and systems.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">2. Background</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Electromagnetic tomography (EMT) is a relatively recent imaging modality with great potential for biomedical applications, including a non-invasive assessment of functional and pathological conditions of biological tissues. Using EMT, biological tissues are differentiated and, consequentially, can be imaged based on the differences in tissue dielectric properties. The dependence of tissue dielectric properties from its various functional and pathological conditions, such as blood and oxygen contents, ischemia and infarction malignancies has been demonstrated.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">Two-dimensional (2D), three-dimensional (3D) and even âfour-dimensionalâ (4D) EMT systems and methods of image reconstruction have been developed over the last decade or more. Feasibility of the technology for various biomedical applications has been demonstrated, for example, for cardiac imaging and extremities imaging.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">As in any biomedical imaging, the classical EMT imaging scenario consists of cycles of measurements of complex signals, as scattered or âinterferencedâ by a biologic object under study, obtained from a plurality of transmitters located at various points around the object and measured on a plurality of receivers located at various points around the object. This is illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. As recounted elsewhere herein, the measured matrix of scattered EM signals may then be used in image reconstruction methods in order to reconstruct a 2D or 3D distribution of dielectric properties of the object, i.e., to construct a 2D or 3D image of the object. Still further, 4D imaging may be achieved by reconstructing 3D images at different time points.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">Generally, it is very important for image reconstruction to precisely describe a distribution of EM field with an imaging domain <b>21</b>. The distribution of EM field with an imaging chamber is a very complex phenomenon, even when there is no object of interest inside.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of one possible embodiment of a prior art EM field tomographic spectroscopic system <b>10</b>. Such a system <b>10</b> could carry out functional imaging of biological tissues and could also be used for a non-invasive mapping of electrical excitation of biological tissues <b>19</b> using a sensitive (contrast) material (solution or nanoparticles) injected into the biological tissue <b>19</b> or in circulation system, characterized by having dielectric properties that are a function of electrical field, generated by biological excited tissue <b>19</b>. As illustrated in <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the system <b>10</b> included a working or imaging chamber <b>12</b>, a plurality of âEM field source-detectorâ clusters <b>26</b>, an equal number of intermediate frequency (âIFâ) detector clusters <b>28</b>, and a control system (not shown). Although only two EM field source-detector clusters <b>26</b> and two IF detector clusters <b>28</b> are shown, a much larger number of each are actually used.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">The imaging chamber <b>12</b> was a closed domain, such as a watertight vessel, of sufficient size to accommodate a human body or one or more parts of a human body. For example, the imaging chamber <b>12</b> may be a helmet-like imaging chamber to image brain disorders (for example acute and chronic stroke), ii) a cylindrical type chamber for extremities imaging, or iii) a specifically shaped imaging chamber for detection of breast cancer. As a result, the imaging chamber may have different shapes and sizes.</p>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The imaging chamber <b>12</b> and its EM field clusters <b>26</b>, as well as the IF detector clusters <b>28</b>, have sometimes been mounted on carts in order to permit the respective components to be moved if necessary, and the carts may then be locked in place to provide stability.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">Oversimplified, the system <b>10</b> operates as follows. An object of interest (e.g., biological tissue) is placed in the imaging domain <b>21</b>. The transmitting hardware generates electromagnetic (EM) radiation and directs it to one of antennas. This antenna transmits electromagnetic waves into imaging domain <b>21</b>, and all of the other antennas receive electromagnetic waves that have passed through some portion of the imaging domain <b>21</b>. The receiving hardware detects the resulting signal(s), and then the same cycle is repeated for the next antenna and the next one until all antennas have served as a transmitter. As described, for example, in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731, code-division technology can be utilized such that the transmitting hardware generates EM radiation and directs it to a plurality of simultaneously transmitting antennas that are specifically coded by a unique âantenna specific code,â so that the source of the resulting EM radiation received at a particular receiving antenna can be ârecognizedâ on the basis of the codes. The end result is a matrix of complex data which is transmitted to one or more computers in the control system that process the data to produce an image of the object <b>19</b> in the imaging domain <b>21</b>. An algorithm called an âinversionâ algorithm is utilized in this process.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">
        <figref>FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic illustration of a three-dimensional setting for the system of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">Unfortunately, traditional EMT technologies, while producing very useful results, have required equipment that is physically cumbersome and difficult to use. This can be true both for the technician, diagnostician, or the like as well as the person or animal who is being studied. With regard to latter, the discomfort caused by the imaging chamber can also be significant. The size and weight of the equipment also makes it very difficult to use the equipment in the place where it is assembled; disassembling and moving the equipment is not very feasible. Finally, the use of arrays of antenna and other equipment creates significant complexity and cost. Thus, a need exists for technology that produces similar results but in a cheaper, more convenient, and more comfortable physical form.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Moreover, a need exists for the imaging and diagnostic capabilities offered by EMT technologies to be available in settings beyond the traditional clinic setting. In particular, a need exists for EMT technologies to be available in everyday human life, providing safe, on-demand, on-line (real time) screening and diagnosis.</p>

      <heading id="h-00006-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00096-en" num="0096">As a preliminary matter, it will readily be understood by one having ordinary skill in the relevant art (âOrdinary Artisanâ) that the present invention has broad utility and application. Furthermore, any embodiment discussed and identified as being âpreferredâ is considered to be part of a best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. Other embodiments also may be discussed for additional illustrative purposes in providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. As should be understood, any embodiment may incorporate only one or a plurality of the above-disclosed aspects of the invention and may further incorporate only one or a plurality of the above-disclosed features. Moreover, many embodiments, such as adaptations, variations, modifications, and equivalent arrangements, will be implicitly disclosed by the embodiments described herein and fall within the scope of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00097-en" num="0097">Accordingly, while the present invention is described herein in detail in relation to one or more embodiments, it is to be understood that this disclosure is illustrative and exemplary of the present invention, and is made merely for the purposes of providing a full and enabling disclosure of the present invention. The detailed disclosure herein of one or more embodiments is not intended, nor is to be construed, to limit the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention, which scope is to be defined by the claims and the equivalents thereof. It is not intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention be defined by reading into any claim a limitation found herein that does not explicitly appear in the claim itself.</p>
      <p id="p-00098-en" num="0098">Thus, for example, any sequence(s) and/or temporal order of steps of various processes or methods that are described herein are illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, it should be understood that, although steps of various processes or methods may be shown and described as being in a sequence or temporal order, the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence or order, absent an indication otherwise. Indeed, the steps in such processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and orders while still falling within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the scope of patent protection afforded the present invention is to be defined by the appended claims rather than the description set forth herein.</p>
      <p id="p-00099-en" num="0099">Additionally, it is important to note that each term used herein refers to that which the Ordinary Artisan would understand such term to mean based on the contextual use of such term herein. To the extent that the meaning of a term used hereinâas understood by the Ordinary Artisan based on the contextual use of such termâdiffers in any way from any particular dictionary definition of such term, it is intended that the meaning of the term as understood by the Ordinary Artisan should prevail.</p>
      <p id="p-00100-en" num="0100">Regarding applicability of 35 U.S.C. Â§112, Â¶6, no claim element is intended to be read in accordance with this statutory provision unless the explicit phrase âmeans forâ or âstep forâ is actually used in such claim element, whereupon this statutory provision is intended to apply in the interpretation of such claim element.</p>
      <p id="p-00101-en" num="0101">Furthermore, it is important to note that, as used herein, âaâ and âanâ each generally denotes âat least one,â but does not exclude a plurality unless the contextual use dictates otherwise. Thus, reference to âa picnic basket having an appleâ describes âa picnic basket having at least one appleâ as well as âa picnic basket having apples.â In contrast, reference to âa picnic basket having a single appleâ describes âa picnic basket having only one apple.â</p>
      <p id="p-00102-en" num="0102">When used herein to join a list of items, âorâ denotes âat least one of the items,â but does not exclude a plurality of items of the list. Thus, reference to âa picnic basket having cheese or crackersâ describes âa picnic basket having cheese without crackers,â âa picnic basket having crackers without cheese,â and âa picnic basket having both cheese and crackers.â Finally, when used herein to join a list of items, âandâ denotes âall of the items of the list.â Thus, reference to âa picnic basket having cheese and crackersâ describes âa picnic basket having cheese, wherein the picnic basket further has crackers,â as well as describes âa picnic basket having crackers, wherein the picnic basket further has cheese.â</p>
      <p id="p-00103-en" num="0103">Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like components throughout the several views, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are next described. The following description of one or more preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p>
      <p id="p-00104-en" num="0104">
        <figref>FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a system <b>110</b> for wearable/man-portable electromagnetic tomographic imaging in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>110</b> includes a boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, a position determination system <b>180</b>, transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b>, which includes a transmitter and a receiver, and a hub computer system <b>128</b>. Each of these will be described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
      <p id="p-00105-en" num="0105">
        <figref>FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the operation of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> and transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> of <figref>FIG. 5</figref> in a two-dimensional context. Unlike prior art systems, the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> is not physically connected with the imaging domain <b>21</b>. In at least some embodiments, the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> is man-portable. As used herein, âman-portableâ means capable of being carried or borne by one human. In some embodiments, the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> may be provided in the form of a small cellular base station or âsmall cell,â such as, for example, a femtocell unit. In some embodiments, the transmitter and the receiver are separate devices, while in others the transmitter and receiver are combined in a single unit.</p>
      <p id="p-00106-en" num="0106">The boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is a man-portable hollow structure whose walls are made of material or materials that is or are non-transparent (opaque) with respect to EM waves and thereby defines the boundaries of the imaging domain <b>21</b> for the system <b>110</b>. The boundary apparatus <b>112</b> itself may take any of a variety of shapes, forms and the like. In at least some embodiments, the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is in the form of a garment or other wearable object. For example, the apparatus <b>112</b> may be a specially-designed shirt, vest, sleeve, bra or other undergarment, cap, or the like. In this regard, <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a side perspective view of a cap serving as wearable boundary apparatus <b>112</b> in accordance with one or more preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p>
      <p id="p-00107-en" num="0107">Regardless of its form, the walls of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> include a pattern of N EM-controlled âtransparentâ holes or windows <b>148</b> (i.e., entry/exit points) distributed so as to surround the imaging domain <b>21</b>. In some embodiments, the pattern of holes or windows <b>148</b> may be a repeating pattern. In other embodiments, the pattern of holes or windows <b>148</b> may be a non-repeating pattern. The condition (âopenâ or âclosedâ) of each entry/exit hole or window <b>148</b> may be controlled by a microchip device <b>132</b>. In at least some embodiments, the open or closed condition of each entry/exit hole or window <b>148</b> is individually coded. The combination of the entry/exit holes or windows <b>148</b> with their microchip devices <b>132</b> are sometimes referred to herein as âEMWindowsâ <b>150</b>. In operation, the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is placed around the object under study <b>19</b>, or the object <b>19</b> is placed within the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, and the system <b>110</b> is activated. During operation of the system <b>10</b>, the transmitter of the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> is used to generate an EM field that passes through one or more of the entry points <b>148</b> and into the imaging domain <b>21</b>. After interacting with the object <b>19</b> of interest, each âinterferencedâ or scattered EM interrogation field (E<sub>sct</sub>) passes through one or more of the exit points <b>148</b>, where it is then received at the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b>. By determining the radiation component corresponding to the traversal from each entry point (hole_i, where 0&lt;iâ¦N) to each exit point (hole_j, where 0&lt;jâ¦N) and incorporating location information about the respective entry and exit points <b>148</b>, as described below, an accurate image of the object <b>19</b> within the imaging domain <b>21</b> may be determined and reconstructed.</p>
      <p id="p-00108-en" num="0108">In order to facilitate the use of the interferenced or scattered EM interrogation field (E<sub>sct</sub>) information to properly determine a 2D or 3D spatial distribution of dielectric properties within the object <b>19</b>, and to thereby reconstruct a 2D or 3D image of the object <b>19</b>, the microchip devices <b>132</b> may be used to control operational aspects of the EMWindows <b>150</b>. In at least some embodiments, each EMWindow <b>150</b> includes a âsmartâ gate, sometimes referred to as a âmicroswitchâ or âmicrogate,â that may be used by the microchip devices <b>132</b> to open or close the entry/exit points. The gates may include the use of PIN diodes. Using these gates, the number of entry and exit holes windows <b>148</b> that are open or active at any one time may be varied. In particular, the specific entry and exit holes or windows <b>148</b> that are open and closed at any given time may be controlled or determined using control technology, as generally described below, and this information may be coordinated with corresponding measurements of E<sub>sct</sub>.</p>
      <p id="p-00109-en" num="0109">In at least some of these embodiments, determining the radiation for each unique entry/exit hole pair (i,j) may be achieved by coding the corresponding gates and then applying the coding to the electromagnetic (EM) radiation/waves/field. This may be accomplished, for example, using code-division technology; such technology is described, for example, in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731. <figref>FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are graphical illustrations of exemplary codes for gates I and J of the boundary apparatus of <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, and <figref>FIG. 9A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating use of the EMWindows coding concept. As shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, the transmitter of the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> generates electromagnetic (EM) radiation/waves/field, represented by complex signal E. As the EM waves enter into the imaging domain <b>21</b> through one of the N EMWindows (EMWindow_i) <b>150</b>, the signal E is coded as E(Ci). The coded signal E(Ci) passes through the imaging domain <b>21</b>, interacting with the tissue at a multitude of spatial points (x,y,z) and thereby acquiring information about the spatial distribution of dielectric properties of the tissue â(x,y,z) to produce E(Ci, â(x,y,z)). The EM waves then exit the imaging domain <b>21</b> through any EMWindow (EMWindow_j) <b>150</b> (which could even be the window EMWindow_j through which it entered, although this information may be of little benefit) where the signal is coded again to produce E(Ci, â(x,y,z), Cj). When finally received by the receiving hardware, the EM radiation has thus been coded with the unique signatures of the particular entry/exit pair. Decoding the signatures allows a matrix of complex raw data to be recovered in relation to the particular entry/exit hole pair (i,j). This data is further combined with information regarding the spatial location of i and j (such information being determined, for example, at the EMWindow position block <b>310</b> of <figref>FIG. 11</figref>, described below). Together, this data set (i.e., the complex matrix of raw data combined with spatial locations of âvirtual transmittersâ or âtransmitting windowsâ (EMWindow_i in this example) and âvirtual receiversâ or âreceiving windowsâ (EMWindow_j in this example)) is analogous to the data set generated and processed in previous EMT systems (i.e., the complex matrix of raw data combined with spatial locations of actual transmitters and windows). The data set is transmitted to one or more computers in the hub computer system <b>128</b> that process the data to produce an image of the object <b>19</b> in the imaging domain <b>21</b>. As with prior art systems, an algorithm called an âinversionâ algorithm is utilized in this process.</p>
      <p id="p-00110-en" num="0110">Additionally or alternatively to the use of gate âopen/closeâ coding, in at least some embodiments, determining the radiation for each unique entry/exit hole pair (i,j) may be achieved through the use of frequency shifting using frequency-shift keying (FSK) or the like. <figref>FIG. 9B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating use of EMWindows frequency shift keying. As shown therein, a frequency shift is applied at each EM entry opening (EMWindow_i), to shift the frequency by some amount ÎFreq_i, and at each EM exit opening (EMWindow_j) to shift the frequency by some amount ÎFreq_j.</p>
      <p id="p-00111-en" num="0111">In some embodiments, entry and exit holes or windows <b>148</b> are opened one at a time, such that only one entry hole or window <b>148</b> and one exit hole or window <b>148</b> are open during any given measurement. In other embodiments, more than one entry hole or window <b>148</b> is open during at least some of the measurements, more than one exit hole or window <b>148</b> is open during at least some of the measurements, or both. In some of these embodiments, all of the holes or windows <b>148</b> are open during at least some or all of the measurements.</p>
      <p id="p-00112-en" num="0112">If the specific EMWindows <b>150</b> that are open at the time of each E<sub>sct </sub>measurement are known, and the positions of the open holes or windows <b>148</b> at the time of such measurements are known, then the measurements may be used to derive an accurate image of the object <b>19</b> within the imaging domain <b>21</b>. With regard to the positions of the open holes or windows <b>148</b>, the locations of the holes or windows <b>148</b> must either be known ahead of time or must be determinable at the time of measurement. In some embodiments, the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is a generally rigid structure, and the locations of the holes or windows <b>148</b> are fixed, relative to each other, by the rigid nature of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is a flexible structure, and the locations of the holes or windows <b>148</b> are not fixed relative to each other and thus must be determined. In either case, because the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is preferably man-portable, and in many embodiments may be frequently moved from place to place, it may be useful to determine the location of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> and to determine the locations of the holes or windows <b>148</b> based on their location relative to the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>. Determining the location of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> and/or the locations of the holes or windows <b>148</b> is described in greater detail hereinbelow.</p>
      <heading id="h-00007-en" level="1">Power Considerations</heading>
      <p id="p-00113-en" num="0113">Consideration must be given to the power requirements of the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the transmitter provides irradiating power on the biological object through the EMWindows <b>150</b> in an amount similar to that produced by a conventional mobile phone. Using current technology, a maximal such power level may be between +33 dBm (2 W) and +36 dBm (4 W), which represents the approved power level for maximum output from a GSM850/900 mobile phone (+33 dBm) and for maximum output from a UMTS/3G mobile phone (power class 1 mobile).</p>
      <p id="p-00114-en" num="0114">Assuming the attenuation at the EMWindows varies from 0 to 20 dB, the attenuation within the biological object (which may be a complete organism, but more likely is merely a part of an organism, such as a human arm or leg) is expected to be within â60 dB to â100 dB. This leads to a power level, after passing through a biological object, of from â24 dBm to â87 dBm. Furthermore, assuming that the signal is attenuated approximately 20 dBm to 30 dBm when it passes from the object to the receiver, the estimated level of the signal on Rx (without any amplification by the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>) is within a range of â44 dBm to â117 dBm.</p>
      <p id="p-00115-en" num="0115">By way of comparison, the typical power level of wirelessly-received signals received wirelessly over variants of 802.11 networks, using commercial devices, is within â60 dBm to â80 dBm. The typical received signal power from a GPS satellite is â127 dBm, and the thermal noise floor for 1 Hz bandwidth at room temperature is â174 dBm.</p>
      <p id="p-00116-en" num="0116">Because the estimated minimal level of the signal is about â117 dBm and the estimated dynamic range for a static position of the object is about 53 dB, the level of the signal and dynamic range are believed to be within performance characteristics of modern telecommunication technologies and may not require any amplification of the signals at the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>. However, if amplification is desired or preferred, it may be included in or on the microchip device <b>132</b>. For example, small low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) are readily available commercially. A series of amplifiers suitable for use in preferred embodiments of the present invention is the MAX2686/MAX2688 low-noise amplifier, designed for GPS L1, Galileo, and GLONASS applications and having dimensions 0.86 mmÃ0.86 mmÃ0.65 mm, available from Maxim Integrated Products, 120 San Gabriel Drive, Sunnyvale, Calif. 94086.</p>
      <heading id="h-00008-en" level="1">Frequency Considerations</heading>
      <p id="p-00117-en" num="0117">Signal interference or parasitic cross coupling between EMWindows <b>150</b> can occur both inside the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> and outside.</p>
      <p id="p-00118-en" num="0118">Inside the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, direct, mutual coupling or interference may occur between EMWindows <b>150</b>. More particularly, the signal E or E(Ci) entering the imaging domain <b>21</b> may, in at least some situations, pass around (rather than through) the body of interest <b>19</b> and thus interfere with the signal of interest, i.e., the signal E(â(x,y,z)) or E(Ci,â(x,y,z)) that passes through the body of interest <b>19</b>. In at least some embodiments, this may be addressed using a âmatching/decouplingâ media (not shown). Such a media may decouple direct, mutual interference caused by a signal E or E(Ci) passing around the body of interest <b>19</b>. One example of such a media is a gel with a high concentration of salt.</p>
      <p id="p-00119-en" num="0119">Outside the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, the signal E being transmitted by the transmitting hardware may, in at least some situations, be powerful and parasitic relative to the signal E(â(x,y,z)) or E(Ci,â(x,y,z)) that passes through the imaging domain <b>21</b>, and thus may interfere with reception thereof by the receiving hardware. Thus, in at least some embodiments, a frequency converter may be utilized at each of the entry EMWindows <b>150</b> to create separation between the transmitter frequency and the receiver frequency, thereby avoiding interference with the transmitter signal. For example, a transmitter signal at a frequency of 0.5 GHz may be passed through a frequency doubler to produce an interrogation signal at a frequency of 1.0 GHz. The EM radiation thus passes through the imaging domain <b>21</b> at the interrogation frequency and likewise through one or more EMWindows <b>150</b> before being received at that frequency as well.</p>
      <p id="p-00120-en" num="0120">Frequency conversion may be used in conjunction with gate coding described previously. <figref>FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram illustrating use of EMWindows coding together with frequency conversion. As with the EMWindows coding shown in <figref>FIG. 9A</figref>, the transmitter of the transmitting/receiving hardware <b>126</b> generates electromagnetic (EM) radiation/waves/field, represented by complex signal E. The transmission frequency is designated as Freq_Tx. As the EM waves enter into the imaging domain <b>21</b> through one of the EMWindows (EMWindow_i) <b>150</b>, the signal E is coded as E(Ci), and the frequency is shifted by some amount ÎFreq_i. The coded signal E(Ci) passes through the imaging domain <b>21</b>, interacting with the tissue at a multitude of spatial points (x,y,z) and thereby acquiring information about spatial distribution of dielectric properties of the tissue â(x,y,z) to produce E(Ci, â(x,y,z)), at frequency Freq_Tx+ÎFreq_i. The EM waves then exit the imaging domain <b>21</b> through another EMWindow (EMWindow_j) <b>150</b>, where the signal is coded again to produce E(Ci, â(x,y,z), Cj). When finally received by the receiving hardware, still at frequency Freq_Tx+ÎFreq_i, the EM radiation has thus been coded with the unique signatures of the particular entry/exit pair but has also been shifted in frequency by the amount ÎFreq_i.</p>
      <p id="p-00121-en" num="0121">In one example, the transmission frequency (Freq_Tx) is 0.5 GHz, and a frequency shift is applied at each EM entry point (EMWindow_i) to shift the imaging frequency (Freq_imaging) upward to 1 GHz. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the frequency may be shifted higher, at least up to 2.5 GHz.</p>
      <p id="p-00122-en" num="0122">It will also be appreciated that, in accordance with the reciprocity principal:</p>
      <p id="p-00123-en" num="0000">[in-line-formulae]{right arrow over (<i>E</i>)}(<i>Ci</i>,â(<i>x,y,z</i>),<i>Cj</i>)={right arrow over (<i>E</i>)}(<i>Cj</i>,â(<i>x,y,z</i>),<i>Ci</i>)[/in-line-formulae]</p>
      <p id="p-00124-en" num="0123">Therefore, the uniqueness of the coding of each EMWindows pair (Ci,Cj) is independent from the way the EM wave enters the imaging domain <b>21</b> assuming the âabsoluteâ similarity of EM and geometrical properties of windows and that plane EM wave is irradiating the object.</p>

One passive, commercially available frequency doubler suitable for use in the present invention is the miniature Hittite HMC156AC8.

      <p id="p-00132-en" num="0129">The complexity of the problem of accuracy with regard to information about the positions of the entry and exit holes or windows <b>148</b> depends, at least in part, on the type of boundary apparatus <b>112</b> utilized. For example, the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> may be deformable or non-deformable. Examples of non-deformable apparatuses may include a helmet, a sleeve, a bra, a waistcoat, or the like. Notably, non-deformable apparatuses are not necessarily inflexible, but are generally non-elastic. One advantage of non-deformable boundary apparatuses <b>112</b> is that the exact 3D location of each EM hole or window <b>148</b>, relative to the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> as a whole, is known ahead of time. However, a non-deformable boundary apparatus <b>112</b> may require a larger or thicker âmatching/de-couplingâ layer.</p>
      <p id="p-00133-en" num="0130">Examples of deformable boundary apparatuses may include a cap, an âelasticâ sleeve, an âelasticâ bra, an âelasticâ waistcoat, or the like. In contrast to non-deformable apparatuses, deformable boundary apparatuses <b>112</b> may advantageously require a smaller or thinner âde-couplingâ layer. (Notably, in at least some embodiment, a decoupling layer is utilized even when there is a perfect fit of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> to the biological object of interest, because as stated previously, a significant function of a âde-couplingâ media is to decouple direct (around the body <b>19</b>) mutual interference between EMWindows <b>150</b> inside the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>.) Another advantage is that deformable boundary apparatuses <b>112</b> may be worn more comfortably, thereby perhaps better enabling the wearer to work, run, sleep and the like while wearing them. On the other hand, a major disadvantage of deformable boundary apparatuses <b>112</b> is that the exact 3D location of each of the EM holes or windows <b>148</b>, relative to the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> as a whole, is not known and has to be located/positioned every time measurements are conducted.</p>
      <p id="p-00134-en" num="0131">In one approach that may be particularly useful with regard to deformable boundary apparatuses, and may have applicability with non-deformable boundary apparatuses as well, a process of determining EM opening spatial information may be carried out in two stages. First, the exact 3D location for each of the EM holes or windows <b>148</b> of the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is determined for a theoretical state wherein the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is in place on or around a âstandardâ sized object <b>19</b>. This data is stored in memory in the system <b>110</b>. Once the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> is on a real object <b>19</b>, the actual locations of the EM holes or windows <b>148</b> will vary slightly from the theoretical, âstandardâ locations, but the theoretical locations may be used as a starting point for subsequent spatial fine-tuning, thereby enhancing and accelerating the process considerably. Spatial fine tuning is preferably within a 3D area of the size of an EM hole or window <b>148</b>. The position determination system <b>180</b> may utilize a localized (e.g., in-room) GPS-type system, a honeycomb algorithm wherein once the position of one cell is determined the position of cells next to it can be determined, or any other suitable system or approach.</p>
      <p id="p-00135-en" num="0132">Software may be used for fast determination of 3D (x,y,z) position as well as phase-shift correction for the path EMWindow_i-to-receiver and amplitude and phase correction at the entry EMWindows <b>150</b> when frequency is changed. In at least some embodiments, it is assumed that amplitude is similar for all EMWindow_i's (i=1 . . . N).</p>

Use is made of an iterative procedure based on either a gradient or a Newton calculation approach or it may use a simplified approach using a Born or Rytov approximation. If a non-approximation approach is used it preferably has one or more of the following features, among others: (i) the method is based on minimization of the difference between model scattered fields and measured scattered fields; (ii) the method uses a regularization method, such as Tikhonov regularization, one of its variants, or the like; (iii) one type of the calculation mesh is used in the method; (iv) one step of the iterative procedure is performed as solving of the two sets of direct problems of the same dimension: modeling of the so-called direct wave and modeling of the inverse wave; (v) both the direct wave and the inverse wave are calculated using nonreflecting or metallic boundary conditions; (vi) both the direct wave and the inverse wave are calculated on the same rectangular mesh; (vii) in order to solve the direct problem a conjugate gradient method (âCGMâ) might be used; (viii) one step of the CGM uses the sine Fourier transform; (ix) the wave equation for non-uniform media is used to solve the direct problem.</p>

For this reason: i) the spatial location of EMWindows has to be known (see <figref>FIG. 11</figref>) and ii) the mathematical model of an EMWindow as an antenna has to be provided. A simple point source or electric or magnetic dipole or Kirchoff type source or final elements model may be used to simulate the function of EMWindows in both transmitting and receiving modes.</p>
      <heading id="h-00012-en" level="1">Direct Problem Solver</heading>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0145">There are various approaches to solving the direct problem. In some embodiments, a conjugate gradient method may be used with a preconditioner. In order to do that, equation (4) may be rewritten in the form shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (8), where k<sub>av </sub>is an average value of k. The preconditioner operator can be constructed as a first step of the iterative process shown at U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (9). Taking into account the fact that the left side of equation (8) is an expression with constant coefficient, equation (9) can be solved at step <b>1575</b> using sine-type Fourier transform for the case with zero boundary conditions on the bound of calculation domain. Then R. A. James's method (originally invented for static problems, but subsequently developed for electromagnetic problems) is applied to make boundary conditions nonreflected. This technique creates a very robust and effective method. Computational experiments show that the iterative process appears to work with any reasonable contrasts and provides nonreflecting conditions with very high accuracy. Using a sine-type Fourier transform at step <b>1575</b> can make calculations 8 times faster than with the regular Fourier approach.</p>

It will be appreciated, however, that other approaches may be used. Furthermore, in at least some embodiments, the direct solver <b>1535</b> is used only for inverse problem solving. The input data in this case is the dielectric properties distribution in the form of a 2D or 3D array, which is received at step <b>1560</b>. For the first step of the iteration, this input data may be received from external input, which in some embodiments may be a homogeneous distribution of dielectric properties of a background (or matching) media, while in other embodiments may be merely an initial âguessâ distribution. In subsequent iterations, the input data is received from the previous iteration. Next to occur, at step <b>1565</b>, is the preparation of the parameters and arrays, which do not change during the direct problem solving process: the wave number, the computational grids, and the Green function for the uniform space.

      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0147">In at least some embodiments, a gradient method may be used to solve the inverse problem in electromagnetic tomography. In the case of a three-dimensional vector in cylindrical geometry this method needs significant modifications when compared with two dimensional and scalar cases. In general the inverse problem in EM field tomography can be formulated as a minimization problem as shown at U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (10), where S<sub>ij</sub><sup>theor </sup>are the theoretical values of the signal, S<sub>ij</sub><sup>theor </sup>are experimental values of the signal, and the last term is the Tikhonov regularization functional.</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0148">An important point of any minimization procedure is the method of a gradient calculation. It was proven that the gradient of functional in our case is set forth at U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (11) where E<sub>j </sub>and G<sub>ij </sub>are solutions of U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equations (12) and (13). Functions F<sub>j </sub>and P<sub>ij </sub>describe the field patterns for EMWindows <b>150</b> being used as entry holes or windows <b>148</b> and exit holes or windows <b>148</b>, respectively.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0149">Direct computation using the equation (11) is very time consuming even in the 2D case and cannot be effectively applied in the 3D case. The reason is that every step requires NÃM number of direct problems to be solved, where N is the number of transmitters, and M is the number of receivers. In at least some embodiments, the function shown at U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (14) can be the solution of U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (15). This makes it necessary to solve only two direct problems on each iterative step.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0150">The calculation of the sum in the right side of equation (15) continues to be a difficult problem, because it requires summation on all receivers for all cells of the computational mesh. In order to overcome this obstacle, a two-step procedure may be applied. First, U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (16) may be calculated on the surface of the computational domain. This needs significantly less computational effort compared to the calculation of the right part of equation (15). Second, U.S. Pat. No. 7,239,731 equation (17) may be solved with those boundary conditions. Equation (17) is the equation with constant coefficients and can be easily solved using sine-type FFT.</p>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0151">Finally, one step of the gradient method procedure requires solving two direct problems (equations (12) and (15)) plus one equation (equation (17)) with constant coefficients.</p>

As shown therein, at 8:00 pm, a patient may be resting at home when he experiences the onset of stroke-like symptoms, such as disorientation and weakness in the face and arms. In response, he or a family member or friend contacts a medical provider, and an ambulance is dispatched. Meanwhile, a doctor or other medical practitioner is contacted and updated on the situation. A wearable boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, such as the cap of <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, is placed on or around the patient's head, and scanning begins as shown around 8:25 pm. Resulting data may be provided to the doctor, ambulance staff, imaging specialists, and other personnel. Some of the data may be used directly for diagnosis, treatment, or the like, while complex image-related data may be processed according to the systems and methods of the present invention to reconstruct images from which further diagnosis, treatment, or the like may be triggered. In at least some embodiments, such processing may generate an automatic alert that the data indicates that a potential stroke is likely.

For example, <figref>FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the use of the system <b>110</b> and methods of <figref>FIGS. 5-12C</figref> in a 4D EMT differential (dynamic) fused imaging system <b>200</b>. At least in part, the operation of such a system <b>200</b> may be carried out using components, and according to a process or processes, previously described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0010493 A1. As used herein, â* means a complex number, unless otherwise indicated. The system includes a âknow-how blockâ <b>202</b>, an âattenuation vs. boundary problems assessment blockâ <b>204</b>, âan EMT system set-up and test blockâ <b>206</b>, an âimages reconstruction blockâ <b>208</b>, a âdifferential image formation blockâ <b>210</b>, a âmotion correction blockâ <b>212</b>, and a âfused images formation blockâ <b>214</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0158">As shown in the lower right-hand corner, two important inputs into the method and system are the type of imaging study and the time duration of the study (T_study). The type of imaging study may, for example, be i) a dynamic study of normal physiological activity within soft tissue of extremity or myocardial tissue or brain tissue, ii) a controlled stress study to assess a functional viability of tissues (for example myocardium or muscle tissue) during physical stress (exercise) or pharmacologically induced stress (for example using dobutamine as per already approved clinical procedure), iii) an injection of electromagnetic contrast agent(s) (e.g., synthesized composite functional nanoparticles), or the like, or a combination of the foregoing. The time duration of the study (T_study) may be input, for example, in units of seconds or a number of cycles of physiological activity (for example, cardiac cycles).</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0159">Based on the input, the system calculates, as represented by the âknow-howâ block <b>202</b>, various desired system parameters. These preferably include the required timely resolution (timely intervals between each EMT acquisition cycle (frame)), the number of frames to be acquired by the system, the required accuracy of measurements in amplitude, the required accuracy of measurements in phase, and the required accuracy of measurements in polarization (if needed).</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0160">Using this information, the âattenuation vs. boundary problems assessment blockâ <b>204</b> may calculate i) optimal dielectric properties (â*<sub>0</sub>=ââ²<sub>0</sub>+j ââ³<sub>0</sub>) of matching media (to be filled around the object <b>19</b> in the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>), mainly by optimizing an attenuation component (ââ³<sub>0</sub>), and ii) IFBW of the system based on required timely resolution and number of channels of the system to be acquired. Then a matching/decoupling media is prepared by mixing water, alcohol, salt, glycerol and/or other components at an appropriate concentration to match desired dielectric properties (â*<sub>0</sub>=ââ²<sub>0</sub>+j ââ³<sub>0</sub>). The boundary apparatus <b>112</b> may then be fully or partially filled (for making âemptyâ measurements or for making actual âin useâ measurements, respectively) with such media, which in at least some embodiments is in gel-type form. In particular, as represented by the âEMT system set-up and test blockâ <b>206</b>, the system <b>200</b>, including the EMT system <b>110</b>, is first set up and initialized and, with the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> fully filled with matching media, a test is conducted on this âemptyâ boundary apparatusâi.e., with the boundary apparatus <b>112</b> filled with matching/decoupling media but with no object <b>19</b> inside. This allows for assurance that the desired system parameters are met. Then, when the system <b>200</b> is ready, the object <b>19</b> under study is placed into the boundary apparatus <b>112</b>, along with the matching/decoupling media. In at least some embodiments, the matching media is spread on the inner surfaces of the apparatus <b>112</b> before placing the object <b>19</b> into the apparatus <b>112</b>.</p>

The absolute anatomical image that is determined at time T<b>0</b>, which may sometimes be referred to herein as a âBaseLine image,â is used to calculate a differential image and fused images at all further frames T<b>1</b> . . .

For frame T<b>0</b>, the starting point (initial distribution of dielectric properties within an imaging domain) for an iterative image reconstruction procedure may be a homogeneous distribution of matching media â*<sub>0</sub>=ââ²<sub>0</sub>+j ââ³<sub>0 </sub>within an imaging domain. For all other frames (T<b>1</b> . . . T_study), the starting point may be a homogeneous distribution of matching media â*<sub>0</sub>=ââ²<sub>0</sub>+j ââ³<sub>0 </sub>within an imaging domain (a BaseLine image (â*<sub>frame T0</sub>)), or alternatively, the starting point may be a reconstructed image from previous frame. In other words, a BaseLine image (â*<sub>frame T0</sub>), which is a reconstructed distribution of dielectric properties at time T<b>0</b>, can be used as a starting point for image reconstruction at other time points (frames) T<b>1</b> . . . T_study, or alternatively an image reconstructed at time Tt (â*<sub>frame Tt</sub>) can be used as a starting point for image reconstruction at frames t+1, t+2 etc. This significantly accelerates an image reconstruction procedure by decreasing a required number of iterations.</p>

      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0000">It is strongly preferred that the reconstructed images at time T<b>0</b> and Tt are to be motion free.

      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0163">A fused image at each time frame Tt may be obtained via the âfused images formation blockâ <b>214</b>. In one exemplary implementation, a background image, representing the absolute anatomical image of the biological object <b>19</b>, is produced using a gray palette, and a time-differential image, produced using a color palette, is superimposed over the background image. In this example, bony areas having low dielectric properties may be rendered in the absolute anatomical image using darker shades of gray while soft tissue areas may be rendered in the absolute anatomical image using lighter shades of gray. Also in this example, the degree of changes may be rendered in the time-differential image, which reflects physiological activity or interventions during the study, along a color spectrum such that each particular color represents a percentile of change.
