      <heading id="h-00001-en" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
      <p id="p-00001-en" num="0001">Inkjet technology has expanded its application to high-speed, commercial and industrial printing, in addition to home and office usage, because of its ability to produce economical, high quality, multi-colored prints. This technology is a non-impact printing method in which an electronic signal controls and directs droplets or a stream of ink that can be deposited on a wide variety of substrates. Inks used in such technologies can be liquid dispersions, solution, or emulsions and can include oil-based inks, non-aqueous solvent based inks, water-based inks and solid inks. Current inkjet printing technology involves forcing the ink drops through small nozzles by thermal ejection, piezoelectric pressure or oscillation, onto the surface of a media. The deposited ink droplets are, then, dried, e.g., using heat or forced air, or allowed to dry at ambient conditions.</p>
      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">Recently, curing of ink by radiation, and in particular ultraviolet (UV) curing, has become popular. In these cases, special ink is used and the image is cured by exposure to a radiation source. The uses of such radiation-curable (or photo-curable) inks and the curing process are rapidly becoming an alternative to the established conventional drying process.</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The inkjet printing industry uses different types of recording fluids such as oil-based inks, solvent-based (non-aqueous) inks, water-based inks, and solid inks (which are melted in preparation for dispensing). Solvent-based inks are fast drying, and as a result, are widely used for industrial printing. When solvent-based inks containing binders and other ingredients are jetted onto a substrate, the solvent(s) partially or fully evaporate from the ink, leaving the binder and other ingredients such as pigment particles on the printed substrate in the form of a dry film. During the drying process, the solvents, which are often volatile organic compounds (VOC), emit vapors, and therefore, can pollute the environment. The pollution problem becomes more critical for higher printing speeds or for wide format images, where large amounts of ink are deposited onto a substrate.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">As a result of this and other concerns, efforts related to preparing inks that are environmentally friendly have moved some research in the direction of water-based inks. However, radiation-curable (or photo-curable) water-based ink compositions are noticeably limited among available options due to their specific features. Accordingly, investigations continue into developing radiation-curable water-based ink compositions that exhibit, when printed, specific and excellent printing properties such as, for example, jetting properties as well as improved adhesion.</p>

      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Before particular embodiments of the present disclosure are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the particular process and materials disclosed herein. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting, as the scope of protection will be defined by the claims and equivalents thereof. In describing and claiming the composition and method, the following terminology will be used: the singular forms âaâ, âanâ, and âtheâ include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âa pigmentâ includes reference to one or more of such materials. Concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For examples, a weight range of about 1 wt % to about 20 wt % should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited concentration limits of 1 wt % to about 20 wt %, but also to include individual concentrations such as 2 wt %, 3 wt %, 4 wt %, and sub-ranges such as 5 wt % to 15 wt %, 10 wt % to 20 wt %, etc. All percent are by weight (wt %) unless otherwise indicated.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">The present disclosure refers to a photo-curable ink composition containing colorant, water, photo-initiator, UV curable polyurethane dispersions, hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers and water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">Also disclosed is a method for forming a printed article with said photo-curable ink composition and an inkjet printing system including said photo-curable ink composition. The present disclosure refers also to a method for preparing a photo-curable ink composition containing colorant, water, photo-initiator, UV curable polyurethane dispersions, hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers and water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The photo-curable ink composition as described herein can be printed in a broad selection of substrates including untreated plastics, flexible as well as rigid, porous substrates such as paper, cardboard, foam board and textile and has a good adhesion on said variety of substrates. The photo-curable ink composition has a good viscosity that enables good printing performances and enables the ability to formulate inks suitable for inkjet application. The photo-curable ink composition of the present disclosure enables thus high printing speed and is very well suited for a use in digital inkjet printing.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">When printed on a substrate and cured, said ink composition has improved adhesion to non-polar surfaces. The composition possesses also good scratch resistance and weatherability. It can support high curing speed and has a viscosity enabling good jetting properties. Therefore, the water-based photo-curable ink composition allows reliable jetting, fast drying and curing, ability to print on various media substrates while having excellent image quality and adhesion.</p>
      <p id="p-00011-en" num="0011">The ink composition is photo-curable (or UV-curable or radiation-curable) ink composition. Said composition is a jettable ink composition meaning thus that the ink can be used with inkjet printing device. The term âcuringâ, in the context of the present disclosure, refers to a process of converting a liquid, such as ink, into a solid by exposure to actinic radiation such as photo-radiation, e.g., ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the uncured state, ink compositions have a low viscosity and are readily jetted. However, upon exposure to suitable source of curing energy, for example ultraviolet (UV) light, electrons beam energy, and/or the like, there is a formation of a cross-linked polymer network. Such ink compositions are commonly referred to as âenergy-curableâ inks to distinguish them from âsolvent-basedâ inks.</p>
      <p id="p-00012-en" num="0012">The ink composition is a water-based photo-curable ink composition, meaning thus that it contains a certain amount of water as solvent. The amount of water in the ink composition is dependent, for example, on the amount of other components of the ink composition. The amount of water in the ink composition includes the amount of water added plus the amount of water in the suspensions and other components of the ink composition. In some examples, the amount of water in the ink composition is in the range of about 10 to about 90 wt % by total weight of the ink composition, in some other example; in the range of about 20 to about 80 wt % by total weight of the ink composition and, in yet some other example, in the range of about 30 to about 70 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00013-en" num="0013">In some examples, the ink composition has a viscosity, at 25Â° C., of not greater than about 70 cps (centipoises); of not greater than about 50 cps, or, of not greater than about 30 cps. In some other examples, the viscosity of the ink composition is ranging from about 2 cps to about 20 cps at a jetting temperature of about 20Â° C. to about 55Â° C. The ink composition can have a static surface tension, at 25Â° C., of not greater than about 40 dynes/cm or ranging from about 20 cps to about 40 dynes/cm.</p>
      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="2">UV Curable Polyurethane Dispersion</heading>
      <p id="p-00014-en" num="0014">The ink composition according to the present disclosure includes UV curable polyurethane dispersion, i.e. UV-PUD. As polyurethane dispersion, it is meant herein polyurethane particles that are dispersed in the liquid vehicle. Without being linked by any theory, it is believed that such UV curable polyurethane dispersions provide improved ink film properties to the media on which the ink is applied. Such films, formed by the drying and cross-linking of UV-PUD, are glossy and hard yet flexible.</p>
      <p id="p-00015-en" num="0015">In some examples, polyurethane dispersions (PUD) are stable dispersions, in water, of polyurethane polymer particles whose size ranges from about 20 to about 200 nm. The polyurethane dispersions can have a Mw in the range of about 1,000 to 100,000 or in the range of about 5,000 to about 50,000. Polyurethane polymer particles can be present in an amount representing from about 1 wt % to about 25 wt %, or from about 5 wt % to about 20 wt % by total weight of the ink composition in some examples.</p>
      <p id="p-00016-en" num="0016">Polyurethane polymer particles can have a core-shell structure with a branched inner core structure, wherein the core includes an amine cross-linker in an amount of about 0.1 wt % to about 1 wt % and wherein the shell includes a polyol cross-linker in an amount of about 0.5 wt % to about 2 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00017-en" num="0017">The branched inner core structure can be provided by a branched diisocyanate which can be a cyclic diisocyanate. The branched inner core structure can also be provided by a branched diol or a cyclic diol. Polyurethane particles may further contain polymerized monomers including a polyol, a branched diisocyanate, and an acid polyol. Polyurethane polymer particles can include a hard segment (including a diisocyanate) and a soft segment and can also include a chain extender. A chain extender can be any compound capable of polymerizing with the diisocyanate such that the chain extender resides in the hard segment of the polyurethane.</p>
      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">Polyurethane polymer particles include various polyols that can be present as a diol polymerized within a hard segment of the polyurethane particle. In some examples, the polyol can be a diol selected from the group of: cyclic diols; 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol; 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol; aliphatic polycarbonate diols; polyether diols; polyethylene glycol; polypropylene glycol; polytetramethylene glycol; poly(ethylene oxide) polymers; poly(propylene oxide) polymers; poly(tetramethylene oxide) polymers; copolymers thereof having terminal hydroxyl groups derived from polyhydric compounds including diols; and combinations thereof. In one aspect, the diol can be cyclic diol. In another aspect, the diol can be an aliphatic cyclic diol. In still another aspect, the diol can be 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol. The diisocyanates can be selected from the group of cycloaliphatic diisocyanates, bis(4-isocyanotocyclohexyl) methane, methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, p-tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate, m-tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate, bitolylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, methylene-bis(4-cyclohexyl)diisocyanate, p-phenylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,5-naphthalene diisocyanate, and mixtures thereof. In one aspect, the diisocyanate can be a cycloaliphatic diisocyanate. The acid polyol can have the structure HOâ(CH<sub>2</sub>)n(CR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)m(CH<sub>2</sub>)pâOH where R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are independently H, hydroxyl, an alkyl group, or an acid group; n ranges from 0 to 20; p ranges from 0 to 20; and m ranges from 1 to 20; wherein at least one of R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>is an acid group.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">The polyurethane polymer particles can have various concentrations of the polyols (both in the hard and soft segments), acid polyols, and diisocyanates. Diisocyanate can be present in the polyurethane particles from about 10 wt % to about 70 wt %. The acid polyol can be present in the polyurethane particles from about 1 wt % to about 40 wt %. In further detail, diols can be present from about 1 wt % to about 3 wt %.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">In some examples, UV-PUD are water-dispersible acrylic functional polyurethane dispersions. In some other examples, UV-PUD are water-dispersible (meth)acrylated polyurethane dispersions. By water-dispersible (meth)acrylated polyurethane is meant herein a polymer that, when mixed with water, can form a two-phase system of small particles dispersed in water.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">Such polyurethane dispersions can be obtained from the reaction of at least one poly-isocyanate compound; optionally, at least one polyol; at least one hydrophilic compound containing, at least, one reactive group capable to react with isocyanate groups and which is capable to render the polyurethane dispersible in aqueous medium either directly or after reaction with a neutralizing agent to provide a salt, and at least one (meth)acrylated compound containing, at least, one reactive group capable to react with isocyanate groups.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Water-dispersible (meth)acrylated polyurethane can be, water-dispersible resins, such as, for examples, compounds commercialized under the name of UcecoatÂ®6558, UcecoatÂ®6559, EbecrylÂ®2002 and EbecrylÂ®2003 available from Cytec. Such water-dispersible resins can form solution in water when mixed in the appropriate solubility ratio with water, such as, for example solution containing up to 10 wt % of water and 90 wt % of polymer.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">In some embodiments, the UV curable polyurethane dispersions (UV-PUD) is an water-dispersible (meth)acrylated polyurethane, sold under the trade name of NeoRadÂ® R441 by NeoResins (Avecia). Other representative but non limiting examples of UV-PUD include UcecoatÂ®7710, UcecoatÂ®7655 (available from Cytec), NeoradÂ®R440, NeoradÂ®R441, NeoradÂ®R447, NeoradÂ®R448 (available from DSM NeoResins), BayhydrolÂ®UV 2317, BayhydrolÂ®UV VP LS 2348 (available from Bayer), LuxÂ®430, LuxÂ®399, LuxÂ®484 (available from Alberdingk Boley), LaromerÂ®LR8949, LaromerÂ®LR8983, LaromerÂ® PE22WN, LaromerÂ®PE55WN, Laromer UA9060 (available from BASF).</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">Hydrophobic Radiation-Curable Monomers</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">The photo-curable ink composition described herein may include one or more hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers. Subject to desired performance standards, any hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers with sufficient hydrolytic stability or combinations thereof may be incorporated into the ink composition described herein. Accordingly, the ink composition is not limited to specific kinds of hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers in various aspects so long as any such performance conditions are satisfied.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">The hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers may be mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- or otherwise multifunctional in terms of radiation-curable moieties. In some examples, the UV curable polyurethane dispersion and the hydrophobic monomers form a non-aqueous phase, in the ink composition, that could represent from about 20 wt % to about 50 wt % by total weigh of the ink composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">The hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers can function as solvents for the photo-initiators, as viscosity modifiers, as binders when cured, and/or as cross-linking agents. The amount of such hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers to be incorporated into the ink can vary within a wide range depending upon the intended use of the resultant composition. The hydrophobic monomer can be present at a level of about 1 to about 15% by weight based on the total weight of the ink composition. In some examples, the hydrophobic monomer is present in an amount representing from about 3 to about 8 wt % based on the total weight of the ink composition. The hydrophobic monomer can be emulsified in the ink composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In some examples, the hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers are hydrophobic monofunctional radiation-curable monomers. In some other examples, the hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers are acrylate monomers or vinyl monomers.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">The monofunctional hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers can be acrylate monomer. The acrylate monomer can be selected from the group consisting of 2-phenoxyethyl acrylate, isophoryl acrylate, isodecyl acrylate, tridecyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, 2-(2-ethoxy-ethoxy)ethyl acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, propoxylated acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, 2-phenoxyethyl methacrylate, isobornyl methacrylate and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">Monofunctional hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers can be vinyl monomers. Vinyl monomer can be selected from the group consisting of vinyl caprolactam, vinyl ether and any combinations thereof. In some examples, hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers used herein are the ones that do not require labeling with Xi or any other danger symbol, like, for example, 2-phenoxy-ethylacrylate, available from Sartomer under the tradename SR339C.</p>

Examples of such higher functional, radiation-curable monomers include hexanediol diacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol A diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tris(2-hydroxyethyl) isocyanurate triacrylate, combinations of these, and the like. In some examples, multifunctional radiation-curable used herein are the ones that do not require labeling with Xi or any other danger symbol, like propoxylated neopentyl glycol diacrylate, available from Sartomer under the tradename SR 9003.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">Water-Soluble or Water-Miscible Radiation Curable Monomers</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">The ink composition, according to the present disclosure, encompasses of one or more water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers. As water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers, it is meant herein any radiation curable monomers that have sufficient water solubility and hydrolytic stability.

      <p id="p-00064-en" num="0064">In some embodiments, the method for forming a printed article includes: providing a photo-curable ink composition containing colorant, UV curable polyurethane dispersions, water, photo-initiator, hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers and water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers; providing a media substrate; projecting (or jetting) of stream of droplets of said photo-curable ink composition onto the media substrate; pinning and drying said ink once applied on the media substrate; and applying photo energy to the ink composition, said photo energy having a frequency and energy level suitable for curing the photo-curable ink composition.</p>
      <p id="p-00065-en" num="0065">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a method for producing printed articles according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. Such as illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the photo-curable ink composition, containing UV curable polyurethane dispersions (UV-PUD), water, photo-initiator, colorant, hydrophobic radiation-curable monomers and water-soluble or water-miscible radiation curable monomers, is applied onto a printable media via a projection of a stream of ink droplets (<b>110</b>). The projection of the stream of droplets of the inkjet compositions, onto the printable media, can be done via inkjet printing technique. The method for forming a printed article according to the present disclosure includes a pinning process (<b>120</b>), a drying process (<b>130</b>) and curing process (<b>140</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00066-en" num="0066">In some examples, the projection of stream of droplets of ink composition (<b>110</b>), onto the media substrate, is done via inkjet printing techniques. The ink composition may be established on the material via any suitable printing techniques, such techniques include thermal, acoustic, continuous and piezoelectric inkjet printing. In inkjet printing devices, liquid ink drops are applied in a controlled fashion to an ink-receiving substrate, or media substrate, by ejecting ink droplets from a plurality of nozzles, or orifices, in a printhead of an inkjet printing device or inkjet printer. In drop-on-demand systems, a droplet of ink is ejected from an orifice directly to a position on the surface of an ink-receiving substrate, or media substrate, by pressure created by, for example, a piezoelectric device, an acoustic device, or a thermal process controlled in accordance digital data signals. For inkjet printing, the ink composition can be heated or chilled to an appropriate dispensation temperature, prior to ejecting the ink composition to the surface of a substrate. In some examples, the projection of stream of droplets of ink composition, onto the media substrate, is done via a piezoelectric printhead.</p>
      <p id="p-00067-en" num="0067">In some examples, the photo-curable ink composition can be applied/jetted to the media substrate at a jetting temperature of about 5Â° C. to about 15Â° C. By controlling the ink temperature, the dependency of the ink working point on the environmental conditions is reduced or eliminated. The system becomes more stable and easier to use. Without being linked by any theory, it is believed that since the ink composition contains large amount of water, by decreasing the ink temperature to 15Â° C. or lower, the ink jetting reliability increases considerably and the ink composition becomes more user friendly. Such ink composition examples described herein may have jetting reliability comparable to other water-based inks working in 25Â° C. while having much faster drying rate on the substrate and allowing minimal addition solvents (VOC).</p>
      <p id="p-00068-en" num="0068">For inkjet printing, the ink composition is heated or chilled to an appropriate dispensation temperature such as, for example, dispensation temperatures mentioned above, prior to ejecting the ink composition to the surface of a substrate. The particular temperature and viscosity of the ink composition is dependent on, for example, the particular method and equipment for conducting the ink jet printing. Considerations regarding temperature and viscosity of the ink composition relate to the effect on droplet size and droplet ejecting rate, for example. In some examples, the temperature is maintained relatively constant, which means that the temperature variation is controlled so that there is no more than a variation of Â±1Â° C., or Â±0.5Â° C., or Â±0.2Â° C., or Â±0.1Â° C., for example. Temperature control is achieved with appropriate temperature sensors, for example.</p>
      <p id="p-00069-en" num="0069">The ink composition, once applied on the media substrate, is then submitted to a pinning process (<b>120</b>) and to a drying process (<b>130</b>).</p>
      <p id="p-00070-en" num="0070">In some embodiment, after being jetted, the ink composition is immobilized (or pinned) to the media surface (<b>120</b>). The pinning process could be performed by applying low photo energy or low energy UV radiation provided, for example, by a LED. In some examples, âlow levelâ Energy refers to energy in the range of about 1 to about 3 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. UV LED can be used as an ink pinning radiation source, in order to pin the ink drop immediately after jetting but still allowing controlled spreading on the substrate. It is believed that, since water is not evaporated yet at this stage the ink does not fully crosslink, the viscosity of the ink droplet increases and the droplet thus is not completely immobilized and further spreading of the droplet is possible</p>
      <p id="p-00071-en" num="0071">The printed or jetted ink composition is dried in a drying process (<b>130</b>) in a predetermined pattern onto the media substrate in view of evaporating the water content of the ink. The drying stage may be conducted, by way of illustration and not limitation, by hot air, electrical heater or light irradiation (e.g., IR lamps), or by a combination of such drying methods. In order to achieve a targeted performance level it is advisable to dry the ink at a maximum temperature allowable by the substrate that enables good image quality without substrate deformation. The temperature used for drying should be selected taking into consideration that fact that various plastic substrate materials tend to bend and deform at elevated temperatures. Consequently, the substrate deformation temperature should not be exceeded while drying. Examples of a temperature during drying include about 40Â° C. to about 150Â° C., or about 40Â° C. to about 70Â° C., for example. The ink composition according to the principles herein enables printing on rigid plastic materials while drying at relatively low temperatures of about 40Â° C. to about 70Â° C., or about 50Â° C. to about 60Â° C., for example, and while achieving fast drying time and good image quality.</p>
      <p id="p-00072-en" num="0072">In the drying process (<b>130</b>), a drying hot air system or IR radiation system lamps or combination of both, may be used with the printed media in order to evaporate the remaining water present in the ink composition. In some examples, such drying stage occurs at temperatures lower than 60Â° C. in order to avoid media deformation when printing on plastic substrates. Higher temperatures may be used to accelerate drying by evaporation according to desired performance and choice of media.</p>
      <p id="p-00073-en" num="0073">In some embodiment, the printed or jetted ink composition is cured (<b>140</b>) by applying photo energy to the ink composition, said photo energy having a frequency and energy level suitable for curing the ink composition. In such curing step, a mercury or similar lamp can be used in order to fully cure and cross link the ink composition to the media substrate. For applying photo energy, the photo-curable ink composition, on the media substrate, may be subjected to suitable light sources for curing the ink compositions in accordance with the principles described herein. Ultraviolet (UV) radiations can be used to cure the ink composition as described above. Curing radiation can be UV radiation radiated by UV lamps, blue lasers, UV lasers, or ultraviolet LEDs, for example. The curing radiation may be provided by a source of ultraviolet radiation operating in a continuous mode. The curing radiation may also be provided by a source of ultraviolet operating in a flash or pulsed mode. In some examples, in the curing process (<b>140</b>), the ink composition is cured by using, for example, a wide arc mercury lamp, in order to fully cure and crosslink the ink.</p>
      <p id="p-00074-en" num="0074">In accordance with the principles described herein, the photo-curable ink compositions find use as inkjet inks for inkjet printers. In some examples, the photo-curable ink compositions may be dispensed to the surface of a broad range of substrates employing inkjet technology and equipment. A suitable inkjet printer, according to the present method, is an apparatus configured to perform the printing, pinning, drying and ink curing processes. The printer may be a single pass inkjet printer or a multi-pass inkjet printer. The printer may include a temperature stabilization module operative to ensure maintenance of the range of ink jetting temperatures</p>
      <p id="p-00075-en" num="0075">In some examples, the photo-curable ink composition is applied on a pre-treated media surface. An ink-receiver layer may be applied to certain substrates in a pretreatment stage prior to jetting the image in order to get the required image quality. The ink-receiving layer may be applied in a pre-treatment stage digitally by applying the ink-receiver layer with piezoelectric printheads, or the ink-receiving layer may be applied in the pre-treatment stage by analog methods such as spray gun or roller coater, for example. The ink receiver layer serves as a fixer for the ink composition dispensed to the surface of a substrate in part preventing movement of ink droplets on the substrate, where the movement may result in negative image quality effects.</p>
      <p id="p-00076-en" num="0076">As mentioned, the photo-curable ink composition is jetted onto a media substrate. The media substrate may be planar, either smooth or rough, or have any other shape that is suitable for the particular purpose for which it is employed. The media substrate can have a thickness in the range of about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm or in the range of about 1 mm to about 5 mm. The media substrate may be porous or non-porous, rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible, for example. Planar media substrates may be in the form, for example, of a film, plate, board, or sheet by way of illustration and not limitation.</p>
      <p id="p-00077-en" num="0077">Examples of media substrate include, but are not limited to, plastic substrates (for example, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and acrylic), paper, paper laminated with plastic (for example, polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene), cardboard, paperboard, foam board, and textiles. The media can also be rigid PVC (polyvinylchloride rigid substrate) or PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified). In some examples, the media substrate is non-porous and has low surface tension. Non-limiting examples include plastics, PVC, banner paper, and polypropylenes, and synthetic paper, such as YupoÂ® synthetic paper. Banner paper is specifically configured for printing banners, has a smooth surface, and is often designed for color printing. The term ânon-porousâ includes surfaces that can have relatively poor water permeability, absorption, and/or adsorption. Vinyl and other plastic sheets or films, metals, coated offset media, glass, and other similar substrates are considered non-porous. In some embodiments, the media substrate can be a plastic substrate. In some other embodiments, the media substrate is a rigid plastic substrate. In some examples, the media substrate is a polypropylene, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC), an acrylic or a polycarbonate substrate. In some other examples, the media substrate is a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a polycarbonate substrate. The media substrates can be non-swellable and/or are non-polar. By non-swellable, it is meant herein that the substrate surface is not swelled by any components of the ink, and no chemical bonds are formed between ink and substrate. By non-polar, it is meant herein that the substrate surface is charge-neutral, therefore adhesion to it is difficult to achieve.</p>

The phrase âsubstantially uniformâ means that there is no visible phase separation and that the ink composition applied by draw down results in a uniform film without visible defects such as de-wetting, clustering, or air bubbles, for example. The ink composition may be filtered to remove large particles that may prohibit reliable jetting. Filtration may be carried out using, by way of illustration and not limitation, one or more of membrane filtration, surface filtration, depth filtration, screen filtration, and filtration aid, for example.</p>

      <p id="p-00083-en" num="0083">Ink formulation I is prepared by mixing two different parts: Part A (hydrophobic phase) and Part B (water-phase). Part A contains N-vinylcaprolactam, IrgacureÂ®819 and OmniradÂ® ITX. Part A is mixed for about 30 minutes with a DispermatÂ® mixer (available from Byk) until a uniform solution is achieved. Part B contains NeoradÂ®R441, SR415Â® and Water. Part A is then mixed into Part B in a DispermatÂ® mixer for about 1 hour until a uniform dispersion is achieved, after which the pigment preparation and surfactants are added into the ink and mixed for additional 15 minutes. The ink is then filtered through a 1.2 micron absolute membrane filter. A HaakeÂ®RS-600 rheometer (Thermo Electron, Newington N.H.) is used to measure the ink viscosity, which is about 4 cps at 20Â° C. Ink surface tension, as measured by a LaudaÂ® tensiometer (LAUDA Brinkmann LP, Delran N.J.), is about 30 dyne/cm at room temperature.</p>
      <p id="p-00084-en" num="0084">Ink formulation II is a comparative ink formula that does not contains any water-soluble monomers. The ink formulation II is prepared in two parts: Part A (hydrophobic phase A and water-phase B). Part A contains N-vinylcaprolactam, IrgacureÂ®819 and OmniradÂ® ITX. Part A is mixed for about 30 minutes by a DispermatÂ® mixer until a uniform solution is obtained. Part B contains NeoradÂ®R441 and Water. Part A is then mixed into Part B, for about 1 hour, until a uniform dispersion is achieved, after which pigments and surfactants are added into the ink and mixed for additional 15 minutes. The ink is then filtered through a 1.2 micron absolute membrane filter. A HaakeÂ®RS-600 rheometer is used to measure ink viscosity, which is about 3.3 cps at 20Â° C.

      <p id="p-00088-en" num="0087">Pinning ability testing method: A porous media substrate (corrugated board) is printed with a solid image at 400 dots per inch printed in 4 passes of 100 dpi each. The media is printed on XY printing test bed using the printing method A or printing method B. The ink composition is jetted via a single HP Scitex X2 Piezo printhead. The pinning step is performed with a low energy light source: 395 nm LED model RX StarfireÂ®75 AC (from Phoseon Tech.). The drying step is performed using a hair dryer, model SilencioÂ®1100W (from Braun). The curing step is performed using a mercury UV lamp (model UV-SK 1.6kW, 160W/cm, from Dr. Honle AG).</p>
      <p id="p-00089-en" num="0088">In method (A), the media substrate is printed with a method containing only the drying and the curing steps. Such method A does not encompass any pinning step. The media substrate is printed, with ink formulation I and ink formulation II, followed by 1 min drying under hot air at a temperature of about 40Â° C. Immediately after drying, the printed image is cured by passing the printed image under a broad range UV lamp once at a print speed of about 0.5 m/s.</p>
      <p id="p-00090-en" num="0089">In method (B), the media substrate is printed with a method containing the pinning, drying and curing steps, with ink formulation I and ink formulation II. The ink is pinned by exposing it to a LED light. The LED intensity varies from 0 to 100%. The LED is positioned straight after the printhead in the printing direction, so that immediately after printing the ink would be exposed to the LED. The printing is made in a unidirectional mode, the LED is turned off when the print head moved back to begin the next pass. During this pinning step, the image is exposed to the LED a total of 4 times corresponding to each of the printed passes. In the second step, the printed image is dried by hot air for 1 min at a temperature of about 40 degrees C. In the third and last step, the printed image is cured by a broad range UV lamp, by passing the image under the lamp once at a speed of about 0.5 m/s.</p>
      <p id="p-00091-en" num="0090">For both methods, A and B, the optical density and the gloss level are evaluated for the resulting printed article. The optical density is measured by means of an X-Rite SpectroEye. The gloss level at 75Â° is measured by a gloss meter from Byk-Gardner. The results are illustrated in the table (c) below.</p>
