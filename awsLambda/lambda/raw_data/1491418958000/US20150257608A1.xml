    <p id="p-a-00001-en" num="0000">A cutting board assembly that includes a tray and a cutting board member. The tray has a reservoir area. The cutting board member is configured to be at least partially positioned inside the reservoir area. The cutting board member has a cutting surface and at least one through-hole. Liquid on the cutting surface flows therefrom through the through-hole(s) and collects in the reservoir area of the tray. The cutting board member may have one or more channels configured to channel the liquid toward the through-hole(s). Each of the one or more channels may be tapered to help direct the liquid. Together the channel(s) and the through-hole(s) may completely surround the cutting surface. The tray may include one or more pouring grooves or spouts through which the liquid in the reservoir area may be poured therefrom.</p>

      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The present invention is directed generally to cutting surfaces and more particularly to cutting boards.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Cutting boards are commonly used in food preparation. A typical cutting board has a substantially planar upper surface upon which food items may be cut with a cutting tool such as a knife or cleaver. Unfortunately, cutting many food items releases liquid that runs over the substantially planar upper surface of the cutting board and onto surrounding structures. This can result in an undesirable mess, which, if not properly attended to, may create an unsanitary working environment. Therefore, a need exists for cutting boards configured to help prevent liquids from escaping from the cutting surface. The present application provides these and other advantages as will be apparent from the following detailed description and accompanying figures.</p>

      <heading id="h-00004-en" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> depicts a knife <b>50</b> cutting a food item <b>60</b> (e.g., a roast chicken) on a first embodiment of a cutting board assembly <b>100</b>. When the food item <b>60</b> was cut, liquid <b>70</b> (such as one or more carving juices) was released from the food item <b>60</b>. The cutting board assembly <b>100</b> includes a cutting board member <b>110</b> configured to nest at least partially inside a tray <b>120</b>. The cutting board member <b>110</b> is configured to channel the liquid <b>70</b> into the tray <b>120</b>, which catches and holds those liquids for later use or disposal.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Referring to <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, the cutting board member <b>110</b> has an outer edge portion <b>111</b> and an upper surface <b>112</b> opposite a lower surface <b>114</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the upper surface <b>112</b> is substantially identical to the lower surface <b>114</b> so that after the upper surface <b>112</b> has been used, the cutting board member <b>110</b> may be turned over and nested with the tray <b>120</b>. In this configuration, the lower surface <b>114</b> may be used instead of the upper surface <b>112</b>. However, this is not a requirement.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Referring to <figref>FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of through-slots or through-holes <b>122</b>A-<b>122</b>D extends between the upper surface <b>112</b> and the lower surface <b>114</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>).

The lower channel sections <b>234</b> are aligned with the plurality of upper channel sections <b>224</b>A-<b>224</b>G and interconnect the through-holes <b>222</b>A-<b>222</b>G together in a series on the lower surface <b>214</b>. Together the through-holes <b>222</b>A-<b>212</b>G and the lower channel sections <b>234</b> form a perimeter that surrounds a lower cutting surface <b>236</b> substantially identical to the upper cutting surface <b>230</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00047-en" num="0047">Referring to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, the tray <b>220</b> is substantially similar to the tray <b>120</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 1-4</figref>, <b>8</b>-<b>10</b>, and <b>12</b>) and provides substantially similar functionality. Referring to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, the tray <b>220</b> has a continuous upwardly extending sidewall <b>240</b> surrounding a base portion <b>241</b>. An upwardly opening reservoir area <b>242</b> is defined by the sidewall <b>240</b> and the base portion <b>241</b>. The sidewall <b>240</b> has an inwardly facing surface <b>243</b> adjacent the reservoir area <b>242</b>. The sidewall <b>240</b> is configured so that the cutting board member <b>210</b> may be positioned or nested at least partially inside the reservoir area <b>242</b>. The sidewall <b>240</b> may taper outwardly away from the base portion <b>241</b> to facilitate receiving the cutting board member <b>210</b> into the reservoir area <b>242</b>. When the cutting board member <b>210</b> is positioned inside the reservoir area <b>242</b>, the cutting board member <b>210</b> may rest upon the sidewall <b>240</b>, which completely surrounds at least a lower portion of the outer edge portion <b>211</b> of the cutting board member <b>210</b>. In this manner, the cutting board member <b>210</b> may be spaced apart from the base portion <b>241</b> so that the liquid (e.g., the liquid <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) may collect in the reservoir area <b>242</b> under the cutting board member <b>210</b>. Any liquid (e.g., the liquid <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) that flows through the through-holes <b>222</b>A-<b>222</b>G flows or drips into the reservoir area <b>242</b> and is retained therein by the sidewall <b>240</b> and the base portion <b>241</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00048-en" num="0048">The base portion <b>241</b> includes one or more baffles <b>250</b> substantially identical to the baffles <b>150</b> (see <figref>FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b>). Each baffle <b>250</b> extends upwardly into the reservoir area <b>242</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the cutting board member <b>210</b> may rest upon the baffle(s) <b>250</b>. In this manner, the cutting board member <b>210</b> may be spaced apart from the base portion <b>241</b> by the baffle(s) <b>250</b> so that liquid (e.g., the liquid <b>70</b> illustrated in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) may collect in the reservoir area <b>242</b> under the cutting board member <b>210</b>. The baffle(s) <b>250</b> may be configured to help channel any liquids collected or retained inside the reservoir area <b>242</b>. Further, the baffle(s) <b>250</b> may be configured to help stiffen the tray <b>220</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00049-en" num="0049">Referring to <figref>FIG. 15</figref>, optionally, one or more pour spouts <b>252</b> may be formed in the sidewall <b>240</b> to facilitate pouring liquids from the reservoir area <b>242</b>. Referring to <figref>FIG. 13</figref>, the baffle(s) <b>250</b> may be configured to direct any liquids collected in the reservoir area <b>242</b> toward the pour spout(s) <b>252</b>. The cutting board member <b>210</b> may remain nested with the tray <b>220</b> when the liquid collected in the reservoir area <b>242</b> is poured from the tray <b>220</b> through the pour spout(s) <b>252</b>. For example, the user may hold the cutting board member <b>210</b> and the tray <b>220</b> together with the user's hands while pouring the liquid from the tray <b>220</b> through the pour spout(s) <b>252</b>. Alternatively, the cutting board member <b>210</b> may be removed from the tray <b>220</b> before the liquid collected in the reservoir area <b>242</b> is poured from the tray <b>220</b> (e.g., through the pour spout(s) <b>252</b> or otherwise).</p>
      <p id="p-00050-en" num="0050">Together the cutting board member <b>210</b> and the tray <b>220</b> may be included in (e.g., packaged into) a kit for constructing the cutting board assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00051-en" num="0051">In the embodiments illustrated, the cutting board assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> each has a generally rectangular outer shape when viewed from above. However, through application of the present teachings, one of ordinary skill in the art may construct embodiments of the cutting board assemblies <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> that have other outer shapes, such as square, round, oval, fanciful, arbitrary, and the like.</p>
      <p id="p-00052-en" num="0052">The foregoing described embodiments depict different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively âassociatedâ such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as âassociated withâ each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being âoperably connected,â or âoperably coupled,â to each other to achieve the desired functionality.</p>
      <p id="p-00053-en" num="0053">While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from this invention and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of this invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is solely defined by the appended claims. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as âopenâ terms (e.g., the term âincludingâ should be interpreted as âincluding but not limited to,â the term âhavingâ should be interpreted as âhaving at least,â the term âincludesâ should be interpreted as âincludes but is not limited to,â etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases âat least oneâ and âone or moreâ to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles âaâ or âanâ limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases âone or moreâ or âat least oneâ and indefinite articles such as âaâ or âanâ (e.g., âaâ and/or âanâ should typically be interpreted to mean âat least oneâ or âone or moreâ); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of âtwo recitations,â without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).</p>
      <p id="p-00054-en" num="0054">Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
