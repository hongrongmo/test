      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">One or more embodiments of the present invention provide hand sanitizers with improved aesthetics and skin-conditioning effects, such that healthcare workers and others subject to high frequency hand hygiene requirements are encouraged to comply with said requirements. One or more embodiments of the present invention provide excellent antimicrobial efficacy and skin conditioning benefits that actually increase with increased frequency of use.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">Hand hygiene is the primary measure to reduce infections. Most hospitals and health-care facilities have established hand hygiene guidelines that require frequent use of hand sanitizers and hand washes. Lack of compliance among health-care providers is problematic worldwide.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">Adherence of health care workers to recommended hand hygiene procedures has been reported as variable. In observational studies conducted in hospitals, health care workers cleaned their hands on average from 5 to as many as 42 times per shift and 1.7 to 15.2 times per hour. In addition, the duration of hand cleansing episodes ranged on average from as short as 6.6 seconds to 30 seconds. A common self-reported factor for poor adherence with hand hygiene is that hand hygiene agents cause irritations and dryness. In fact, some studies have concluded that the primary reason for non-compliance is skin irritation and the deleterious effects of repeated exposure to products and procedures.</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Skin exposure to water and typical cleansers has profound effects on the stratum corneum (SC) structure and function. Effects include disruption of the lipid bilayer architecture to create defects or holes in the barrier. As a result, the barrier becomes more permeable, allowing irritants and microorganisms to penetrate into and through the uppermost layers of the skin. In cases of severe hand irritation, cracks or fissures (with or without bleeding) may develop indicating damage to the dermis. The skin's response to these damaging effects is immediate, but the accelerated efforts to repair the barrier and generate new stratum corneum leads to imperfect architecture, when compared to stratum corneum that is formed during the normal course of SC replacement. The rapidly-produced SC has poor water binding properties, leading to insufficient skin moisture and inadequate desquamation.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">Under normal conditions, there is constant loss of SC cells, as individual units from the surface of the skin, and new cells move from the bottom of the SC to the surface, generally over a period of about 14 days. When skin moisture is too low, the SC cells come off of the skin surface as clumps of cells, observed as dry scales.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">In some studies, up to 85 percent of nurses described histories of skin problems and one-fourth reported symptoms of dermatitis. Over half of inpatient nurses, and 65 percent in intensive care units had observable hand dermatitis.</p>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">A study has been done on the effect of various alcohols on skin under conditions of frequent hand sanitization. Few environments are impacted more by topical product usage than healthcare facilities. As high Hand Hygiene Compliance (HHC) and Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR) together play a significant role in healthcare strategies to reduce the threat of nosocomial infections, Healthcare Workers (HCW) may be subjected to significant increases in the use of ABHR. As handwashing opportunities ranging from less than 20 times per hour (reflecting 58% Compliance) to more than 60 per hour (reflecting 37% Compliance) are being challenged as insufficient to meet recommended guidelines, Hand Hygiene Events (HHE) rates approaching 100 per day may be necessary to achieve 100% HHC.</p>
      <p id="p-00009-en" num="0009">The study compared the effects three different alcohol systems have on skin over two weeks, applied daily at standard and high frequency HHC for HCWs application. Twenty five female panelists representing a typical healthcare worker demographic were recruited for a two week Forearm Control Application Test (FCAT). The study commenced with a one week washout period of the forearms using a commercially available gentle foam cleanser. Visual Redness was scored based upon a scaleââSevere Rednessâ (Scale 0 âNo Rednessâ to 6 âExtreme Rednessâ). Panelists exhibiting Visual Redness or Dryness score at any treatment site greater than 3.0 at baseline were excluded from participation. This was followed by regimen treatments and skin assessments conducted at regular intervals over the two week evaluation. Three ABHR systems containing 70% alcohol (each ethanol, isopropanol, and n-propanol), water, and a minimal humectant (0.2% glycerin) were used. Panelist forearms were marked to receive the randomized regimens: three alcohol systems applied at 20 times per day (standard frequency; SF); three alcohol systems applied at 100 times per day (high frequency HF); and an untreated skin control. In addition to the test regimens, panelist's forearms were washed six times per day at scheduled intervals of a minimal HCW daily routine. Skin redness and dryness (Visual Grading), skin hydration (Corneometer CM825), and skin barrier or trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL/Biox AquaFlux AF200) were measured. Following a total of 200 (SF), and 1000 (HF) individual alcohol system applications and corresponding skin measures, data were tabulated and analyzed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the individual and interactive effects of alcohol type and application rate, and to compare to the untreated skin control. Chi-Square analysis was also used to evaluate the regimen attrition due to skin condition meeting predetermined thresholds. The study confirmed that higher levels of HHC can further compromise the already challenged skin condition of HCW.</p>
      <p id="p-00010-en" num="0010">There is a substantial need for practices and products that disinfect the skin surface without compromising the integrity of the skin barrier. Products and practices are needed that improve or at least maintain skin condition of healthcare workers who use ABHRs many times a day.</p>

The method includes providing a composition according to the present invention to a health care worker who uses the product to sanitize their hands according to the appropriate guidelines of the health care facility, or according to the WHO Guidelines On Hand Hygiene In Health Care shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, over a period of time, and the skin condition of the user remains constant or improves. That is, when the skin condition of the health care worker's hands is measured prior to use of the product, and again after a period of use, the skin condition is at least as good, and in one or more embodiments is improved.</p>
      <p id="p-00143-en" num="0138">A healthcare worker who sanitizes his/her hands according to the appropriate guidelines may be referred to as a compliant worker. In some healthcare settings, a healthcare worker who sanitizes their hands according to the appropriate guidelines, i.e. a compliant worker, may use a sanitizer product to sanitizer his/her hands at least about 50 times during one work shift (8-12 hours), in some embodiments, at least about 80 times per shift, in other embodiments, at least 100 times per shift. In one or more embodiments, assuming that the compliant worker works 3-4 shifts per week, the skin condition on the hands of the compliant worker is maintained over a period of at least 3 days, in other embodiments, over a period of at least 7 days, in other embodiments, over a period of at least 14 days. In these embodiments, the hydration and/or the barrier function of the hand skin is at least as much after the period of use as the hydration and/or barrier function of the same skin prior to use.</p>
      <p id="p-00144-en" num="0139">In one or more embodiments, assuming that the compliant worker works 3-4 shifts per week, the skin condition on the hands of the compliant worker is improved over a period of at least 3 days. In these embodiments, the skin condition of the hand skin is improved after the period of use when compared to the skin condition of the same skin prior to use.</p>
      <p id="p-00145-en" num="0140">In some embodiments, improvement is seen within 7 days. In other embodiments, improvement is seen within 14 days.</p>
      <p id="p-00146-en" num="0141">Similarly, the present invention provides a method for improving skin condition of health care workers within 7 consecutive days, based upon daily use. The method includes providing a composition according to the present invention, applying the composition to the hands of the health care worker at least 50 times during a 24-hour day, and repeating the step of applying the composition to the hands of the health care worker on at least two additional 24-hour days within a total period of 7 consecutive days. In some embodiments, improvement is seen within 7 days. In other embodiments, improvement is seen within 14 days.</p>
      <p id="p-00147-en" num="0142">Embodiments of the present invention further provide a method for improving skin condition of health care workers within 3 days, the method comprising the steps of providing a composition according to any of the preceding claims, providing a health care worker with a need to sanitize their hands at least 50 times during a work shift, applying the composition to the hands of the health care worker at least 50 times during the work shift, wherein the health care worker works at least 3 shifts during 3 consecutive days.</p>
      <p id="p-00148-en" num="0143">Embodiments of the present invention further provide a method for improving skin condition of health care workers within 7 consecutive days, the method comprising the steps of providing a composition as described herein, applying the composition to the hands of the health care worker at least 50 times during a 24-hour day, and repeating the step of applying the composition to the hands of the health care worker on at least two additional 24-hour days within a total period of 7 consecutive days.</p>
      <p id="p-00149-en" num="0144">It has been seen that many persons who use conventional alcohol-based hand sanitizers at least 10 times per day experience a worsening of the skin condition of their hands over a period of 7 days or more. Advantageously, persons who use the alcohol-based hand sanitizers of the present invention at least 10 times per day over a 7 day period experience do not experience the same level of worsening of the skin condition of their hands, when compared to persons who use conventional alcohol-based hand sanitizers. In one or more embodiments, persons who use the alcohol-based hand sanitizers of the present invention at least 10 times per day over a 7 day period experience improvement in the skin condition of the hands.</p>
      <p id="p-00150-en" num="0145">In one or more embodiments, the improved skin condition includes reduced irritancy and/or improved skin moisture. In one or more embodiments, the improved skin condition may be expressed broadly in terms of irritancy and moisture/barrier function, or more specifically as redness, hydration, moisture loss, dryness through visual grading.</p>
      <p id="p-00151-en" num="0146">In one or more embodiments, skin condition may be measured by using a protocol that is sometimes referred to as the forearm controlled application technique (FCAT). The FCAT is described in Ertel, Keith D. et al., âA forearm controlled application technique for estimating the relative mildness of personal cleansing products,â<i>J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem., </i>46, 67-76 (March/April 1995), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The method may be modified to test leave-on type products, such as alcoholic sanitizers that are rubbed in and/or evaporated and do not need to be rinsed off, as follows.</p>
      <p id="p-00152-en" num="0147">FCAT is actually a protocol for applying a product to skinâthe skin can then be tested for various parameters/characteristics including broadly irritancy and moisture/barrier functionâmore specifically redness, hydration, moisture loss, dryness through visual grading,</p>
      <p id="p-00153-en" num="0148">The test sites are washed and marked. One site may remain untreated. A control product may be used on one site Skin measurements may taken before any product is applied in order to establish a baseline. In one or more embodiments, skin hydration is measured using a corneometer and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) is measured by using an Aquafluxâ¢ or VapoMeterâ¢ closed chamber humidity meter.</p>
      <p id="p-00154-en" num="0149">Test product may be applied to one of the prepared sites, and another skin hydration measurement may be taken after a desired period of time. The process of applying product and measuring hydration may be repeated as desired. If desired, a step of washing the site with a handwash may be conducted at various intervals. A more irritating product will lead to a decline in skin hydration, and a less irritating product will not produce any change in skin hydration. A skin-conditioning product will lead to an increase in skin hydration.</p>
      <p id="p-00155-en" num="0150">In one or more embodiments, compositions of the present invention provide increased skin hydration.</p>
      <heading id="h-00017-en" level="1">b. Reduced Abnormal Desquamation</heading>
      <p id="p-00156-en" num="0151">In one or more embodiments, the improved skin condition includes reduced abnormal, or pathologic, desquamation.</p>
      <p id="p-00157-en" num="0152">Advantageously, compositions of the present invention have reduced abnormal, or pathologic, desquamation when used according to current guidelines for hand hygiene for personnel in hospitals and health-care facilities. Embodiments of the present invention have reduced pathologic desquamation when used in combination with typical hand washes. Embodiments of the present invention actually improve skin condition, in terms of pathologic desquamation, when used according to current guidelines for hand hygiene for personnel in hospitals and health-care facilities.</p>
      <p id="p-00158-en" num="0153">In one or more embodiments, desquamation, including pathologic desquamation, may be measured by using D-SquameÂ® skin analysis disks, available from CuDerm Corporation, at baseline, at 2 weeks, and at 4 weeks, and an improvement will be seen when the product is used according to current guidelines for hand hygiene for personnel in hospitals and health-care facilities. In one or more embodiments, a decrease in desquamation is seen when used by a health care worker at the â5 Moments of Hand Hygiene,â over a period of 4 weeks, in other embodiments, over a period of 2 weeks, and in other embodiments, when the product is used daily, at least 50 times per day, over a period of 4 weeks, in other embodiments, over a period of 2 weeks, and in other embodiments, over a period of 1 week.</p>
      <heading id="h-00018-en" level="1">c. Aesthetics</heading>
      <p id="p-00159-en" num="0154">Advantageously, compositions of the present invention have improved aesthetics, when compared to other hand sanitizers or health care personnel handwashes that claim to have skin conditioning properties.</p>
      <p id="p-00160-en" num="0155">Some studies have identified the four categories of sensory attributes for products: Sensory Evaluation; Acceptance Attributes; Performance (non-antimicrobial); and Image. Sub-categories of attributes include the following.</p>
      <p id="p-00161-en" num="0156">Sensory Evaluation includes: Clear; Opaque; Strong Smell; Light Smell; No Smell; Oily Feel; Dry Feel; Soft Feel; Lathers Well.</p>
      <p id="p-00162-en" num="0157">Acceptance Attributes include: Like Appearance; Like Fragrance; Like Texture; Like Feel After Use; Like Overall; Purchase Intent.</p>
      <p id="p-00163-en" num="0158">Performance (non-antimicrobial) includes: Lathers Well; Feels Good On Hands; Does Not Irritate Hands; Conditions Hands; Removes Oil From Hands; Feels Clean.</p>
      <p id="p-00164-en" num="0159">Image includes: effective; Unique; Good For Hands; Won't Ruin Gloves; Won't Irritate Hands; High Quality Product.</p>
      <p id="p-00165-en" num="0160">In one or more embodiments, panel test results indicate that compositions of the present invention provide better overall sensory scores, higher acceptance attributes, improved performance scores, and higher image ratings, when compared to other hand sanitizers or health care personnel handwashes that claim skin-conditioning effects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00019-en" level="1">d. Maintained Efficacy</heading>
      <p id="p-00166-en" num="0161">Advantageously, compositions of the present invention provide skin-conditioning benefits while maintaining antimicrobial efficacy.</p>
      <p id="p-00167-en" num="0162">Thus, the present invention further provides a method for killing or inactivating microbes on a surface comprising applying, to the surface, an effective amount of an antimicrobial composition as described herein. The antimicrobial composition may be employed on a wide variety of surfaces or substrates, including skin, porous, and non-porous surfaces.</p>
      <p id="p-00168-en" num="0163">In one or more embodiments, the antimicrobial composition of the present invention is applied topically to mammalian skin. In one embodiment, the methods of bringing the antimicrobial composition into contact with a microbe on human skin includes applying an amount of the composition to the skin, and allowing the composition to remain in contact with the skin for a suitable amount of time. In other embodiments, the composition may be spread over the surface of the skin, rubbed in, rinsed off, allowed to dry via evaporation, or wiped off.</p>
      <p id="p-00169-en" num="0164">Thus, the present invention provides a method for skin sanitization, the method comprising contacting mammalian skin with an effective amount of an antimicrobial composition comprising at least 30 wt. % alcohol, based upon the total weight of the antimicrobial composition, and an efficacy-enhancing amount of at least one C<sub>6-10 </sub>alkane diol. In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides a method for hand sanitization.</p>
      <p id="p-00170-en" num="0165">Any amount of the antimicrobial composition may be used for each application, so long as it is at least an effective amount to contact substantially the entire target surface and keep it wet for at least 15 to 30 seconds. In one embodiment, an effective amount is at least about 1.5 milliliters (mL), in another embodiment at least about 2 mL, in yet another embodiment, at least about 2.5 mL, in yet another embodiment, at least about 3.0 mL, in yet another embodiment, at least about 4.5 mL, and in yet another embodiment, at least about 5 mL. Advantageously, the effective amount of antimicrobial composition according to the present invention, i.e. the minimum amount necessary to contact substantially the entire target surface, is also an amount that is effective to achieve adequate efficacy. Other products may not achieve adequate efficacy if only an effective amount to contact substantially the entire target surface is used. It will be understood that it is advantageous to achieve adequate efficacy while using a small amount of product. This is true for economic reasons, as well as because the amount of time required for the product to be rubbed into the skin and or evaporated/dried is reduced when less product is used.</p>
      <p id="p-00171-en" num="0166">Advantageously, the antimicrobial composition of the present invention may be used as a healthcare personnel hand wash. In one or more embodiments, the present invention provides an antimicrobial composition that meets the standards of the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash.</p>
      <p id="p-00172-en" num="0167">In the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash and other standard tests, test procedures include multiple wash cycles. In each cycle, a subject surface is contaminated with a test organism and the surface is washed with a test product. After a specified number of wash cycles, the surface is rinsed and the rinsing liquid is tested to determine what log reduction has been achieved by the test product. For example, in the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash, the following protocol is followed for leave on products such as alcoholic compositions. The hands of a test subject are contaminated with a test organism such as <i>Serratia marcescens</i>, and washed using the test product. The hands are then placed into sterile gloves, a bacterial recovery solution is added and hands are massaged by a technician for a preset amount of time to recover viable bacteria from the hands. The recovery solution is plated to determine the log reduction achieved by one wash. The hands of the test subject are again contaminated with the test organism and washed using the test product. For a third time the hands of the test subject are again contaminated with the test organism and washed using the test product. After the third wash the hands are again placed into gloves and viable bacteria are recovered to determine the log reduction after the third wash. The cycle of contamination and wash is repeated until, after the seventh wash, the hands are again placed into gloves and viable bacteria are recovered to determine the log reduction after the seventh wash. The cycle of contamination and wash is repeated until, after the tenth wash, the hands are again placed into gloves and viable bacteria are recovered to determine the log reduction after the tenth wash. According to the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash, healthcare personnel hand wash formulations must reduce the number of bacteria on the hands by 2 log<sub>in </sub>after one wash and reduce the number of bacteria on the hands by 3 log<sub>10 </sub>after ten washes. It should be noted that the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash refers to âwashâ for both rinse-off and leave-on products, and therefore the instant specification may do the same.</p>
      <p id="p-00173-en" num="0168">Many alcoholic products achieve a minimum 3 log reduction after one wash using the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash. However, many alcoholic products fail to achieve a minimum of 3 log reduction after the tenth wash using the FDA TFM test. In fact, a number of alcoholic products exhibit a reduction in log reduction over successive washes.</p>
      <p id="p-00174-en" num="0169">Many products that tout skin-conditioning properties do not provide adequate antimicrobial efficacy in order to meet the requirements of the FDA TFM healthcare personnel hand wash test.</p>
      <p id="p-00175-en" num="0170">Advantageously, the compositions of the present invention do not exhibit a reduction in efficacy over successive washes, when tested according to the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash or similar protocol.</p>
      <p id="p-00176-en" num="0171">In one or more embodiments, the compositions of the present invention meet or exceed the requirement of 2 log<sub>10 </sub>reduction after a first wash, and 3 log<sub>10 </sub>reduction after a tenth wash. In one or more embodiments, compositions according to the present invention provide a log reduction of at least about 3 after one wash, and at least about 3 after ten washes. In certain embodiments, the compositions demonstrate a cumulative effect and surpasses the requirements of the FDA TFM healthcare personnel hand wash test by achieving 3 log<sub>10 </sub>reduction after wash 1 and 4 log<sub>10 </sub>reduction after wash 10.</p>
      <p id="p-00177-en" num="0172">In one or more embodiments, the log<sub>10 </sub>reduction of a test organism achieved by a third wash utilizing the composition of the present invention is at least equal to the log<sub>10 </sub>reduction achieved by a first wash cycle. In one or more embodiments, the log<sub>10 </sub>reduction of a test organism achieved by a tenth wash utilizing the composition of the present invention is at least equal to the log<sub>10 </sub>reduction achieved by a first wash cycle.</p>
      <p id="p-00178-en" num="0173">When evaluated according to tests that require multiple wash cycle protocols, compositions according to the present invention provide a log reduction that is maintained or even improved over multiple wash cycles. Furthermore, the composition unexpectedly provides cumulative activity, i.e. the efficacy of the composition increases with multiple uses.</p>
      <p id="p-00179-en" num="0174">In order to demonstrate the practice of the present invention, the following examples have been prepared and tested. The examples should not, however, be viewed as limiting the scope of the invention. The claims will serve to define the invention.</p>
      <heading id="h-00020-en" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
      <heading id="h-00021-en" level="1">I. Biomarker Testing</heading>
      <p id="p-00180-en" num="0175">The samples were tested for anti-inflammatory and skin barrier effects.</p>
      <heading id="h-00022-en" level="2">Testing Methods</heading>
      <p id="p-00181-en" num="0176">IL-8 ELISA</p>
      <p id="p-00182-en" num="0177">Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a chemokine and proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and other cell types such as epithelial cells. It is secreted from keratinocytes in skin in response to inflammatory stimuli. IL-8 is secreted and is an important mediator of the immune reaction in the innate immune system response. IL-8 overexpressed is a biomarker of skin irritation.</p>
      <p id="p-00183-en" num="0178">For Control A, human dermal keratinocytes are left untreated. No irritation is expected, and therefore Control A provides a baseline. For Control B, IL-8 is induced in human dermal keratinocytes by applying phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). For all other samples, the human dermal keratinocytes are co-treated with PMA and a composition containing the ingredient of interest. Decreased 11-8 expression reflects the ingredient's anti-irritation activity.</p>
      <p id="p-00184-en" num="0179">In order to carry out the test method, an assay kit was employed that was obtained from R&amp;D Systems: Human CXCL8/IL-8 Duoset ELISA Development Kit.</p>
      <p id="p-00185-en" num="0180">The following steps were followed: 1. Coat EIA high binding 96-well plate with IL-8 capture antibody overnight at room temperature. 2. Prepare all reagents, standard dilutions, and samples. 3. Wash the coated plate with 350 Î¼L/well of washing buffer 4 times, then adding 300 Î¼L/well of blocking solution incubating 1 hour at room temperature. 4. Repeat washing step with 350 Î¼L/well of wash buffer (4 times). 5. Add 100 Î¼L, of Standard, control, or sample to each well. Cover with a plate sealer, and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. 6. Aspirate each well and wash, repeating the process 3 times for a total of 4 washes. 7. Add 100 Î¼L, of detection IL-8 antibody to each well. Cover with a new plate sealer, and incubate at room temperature for 2 hours. 8. Aspirate and wash 4 times. 9. Add 100 Î¼L, Biotin-Strepavidin conjugate to each well, incubating 20 minutes at room temperature. 10. Aspirate and wash 4 times. 11. Add 100 Î¼L, substrate Solution to each well. Incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes, making sure to protect the wells from the light. 12. Add 50 Î¼L, of Stop Solution to each well. Data collected-using a colorimeter, absorbance was measured at 450 nanometers (nm) within 30 minutes. Wavelength correction was set to 570 nm.</p>
      <p id="p-00186-en" num="0181">TNF-Î±</p>
      <p id="p-00187-en" num="0182">Samples were tested similarly to the method described above, except that TNF-Î± was used instead of IL-8.</p>
      <p id="p-00188-en" num="0183">MTT Assay</p>
      <p id="p-00189-en" num="0184">The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay for assessing cell viability, cell proliferation, and/or cytotoxicity. NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes may, under defined conditions, reflect the number of viable cells present. These enzymes are capable of reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to insoluble formazan, which has a purple color. MTT assay can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferative to resting status) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials.</p>
      <p id="p-00190-en" num="0185">Controls A and B described above for the IL-8 Assay were also employed in this test. The mitigating effect of the test samples on the effect of Control B on the keratinocytes was measured. More specifically, while Control B has a negative effect on cell viability, cell proliferation, and/or cytotoxicity, this mitigation of this negative effect was determined by measuring the reduction of MTT.</p>
      <p id="p-00191-en" num="0186">The following steps were followed: Once the liquid was removed from the wells for the IL-8 Assay described above, 100 Î¼l/well of 0.5 mg/ml of MTT in phenol red-free DMEM (cell culture medium) was added into each of the 96-well plates. After incubating 1 hour at 37Â° C., all liquid was removed (MTT solution) from the wells of the culture plate. Then 100 Î¼l of DMSO was added to each well to completely dissolve the purple product. Absorption was measured using a plate reader at 550 nm wavelength.</p>
      <p id="p-00192-en" num="0187">Varying amounts of avenanthramide were prepared in cell culture medium.

      <p id="p-00204-en" num="0198">Involucrin is a protein component of human skin. It's a biomarker for keratinocyte differentiation. In binding the protein loricrin, involucrin contributes to the formation of a cell envelope that protects corneocytes in the skin stratum corneum. The higher expression, the better skin barrier function is.</p>
      <p id="p-00205-en" num="0199">ABCA12 is also known as ATP-binding cassette transporter 12. It is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ABCA12 gene. The ABCA12 gene is active in some types of skin cells. The ABCA12 protein appears to be essential for normal development of the skin, which provides a barrier between the body and its surrounding environment. It plays an important role in transporting lipids (free fat acids) in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). Generally, the higher expression, the better skin barrier function is.</p>
      <p id="p-00206-en" num="0200">PPARÎ´ is Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, also known as NR1C2. It is a nuclear receptor that in humans is encoded by the PPARD gene. This protein has been shown to be involved in differentiation, lipid accumulation (ceramides) in keratinocytes. Generally, the higher expression, the better skin barrier function is.</p>

      <p id="p-00207-en" num="0201">Examples 39 and 40 are commercially available hand sanitizers that contain, inter alia, ingredients that are often touted as skin-conditioning ingredients. Unfortunately, these skin-conditioning products were tested according to the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash, and did not pass. In contrast, compositions of the present invention provide skin-conditioning benefits, and also pass the FDA TFM test for healthcare personnel hand wash. Example 41 contains the ingredients listed below. More specifically, the amount of avenanthramide was between 0.001 to about 8 wt. %, the amount of niacinamide was between 0.001 to about 8 wt. %, the amount of PPG-12 SMDI copolymer was between 0.001 to about 8 wt. %, and the total amount of other skin conditioning agents was less than about 2 wt. %, all based upon the total weight of the composition.</p>

      <p id="p-00209-en" num="0202">The following samples were tested for irritancy according to the FCAT technique described above. Each of the examples 42-45 contained the same amount of ethanol, PEG-12 dimethicone, 1,2-octanediol, and the differing amounts of the other ingredients are shown below. The samples were made to 100% using purified water.</p>
      <p id="p-00210-en" num="0203">Corneometry, a technology that is used to measure the hydration of the outer layer of the epidermis (stratum corneum), was employed. As the skin is a dielectric medium, variations in hydration show up through changes in capacity. In order to document the skin's moisture content, a measuring capacitor is pressed against the skin using constant pressure and the readings evaluated. The narrow diameter of the sensor even allows measurements to be taken on less accessible areas of skin. The corneometer is a fully automatic device. The reading indicates the epidermal hydration levelâbefore and after treatment with cosmetic or pharmaceutical products, for instance. The recordings are always carried out within a constant time frame following the use of the respective product. Hydration was measured in a morning session and an afternoon session, and the change of hydration is shown below.</p>
      <p id="p-00211-en" num="0204">Trans-Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) was measured using an AquafluxÂ® instrument, in units of grams of water per square meter per hour (g water/m<sup>2</sup>/hr). The change in TEWL from the morning session to the afternoon session is shown below.</p>
