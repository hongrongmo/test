      <p id="p-00002-en" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
      <p id="p-00003-en" num="0003">The invention relates to bait boards.</p>
      <p id="p-00004-en" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
      <p id="p-00005-en" num="0005">Bait boards are multipurpose work surfaces that are used in fishing, for example, to prepare bait and lures. The typical bait board is fixedly mounted on a fishing boat in a convenient location so that it can be used while fishing. While several different mounts are available, one common mount that may be used is a pole mounted on the transom of the boat. Other, more complex, mounts may allow the bait board to be tilted in use.</p>
      <p id="p-00006-en" num="0006">The board itself is generally made of a material that is impermeable to blood and fluids and is easy to wash clean, such as a plastic. Some boards include built-in, fixed accessory racks for holding gear and lures, and some boards include or are associated with other structures, like holders for fishing rods.</p>
      <p id="p-00007-en" num="0007">Although there are many different models of bait board on the market, and many of those do offer helpful features, conventional bait boards are fixed in their configurations, and do not provide the user with much choice or adaptability in how to arrange his or her tools and gear while working.</p>
      <heading id="h-00003-en" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
      <p id="p-00008-en" num="0008">One aspect of the invention relates to a modular, configurable bait board system. The bait board system comprises a bait board and work surface with a number of part attachment points. The system also includes a number of parts that are adapted to attach to the attachment points. The parts may include can holders, scent boards, knife holders, and leader dispensers, to name a few. In some embodiments, the attachment points may comprise compartments that are designed to receive engaging portions of the parts. The engagement between the compartments and the parts may be by means of a tight, frictional fit or by using fasteners. The compartments may be sized such that even if one of the parts is mounted in a compartment, at least a portion of the compartment can also be used for storage. The bait board and parts may be made of a material that is easily cleaned and is generally impervious to blood and fluids. In some embodiments, the material may be a food-grade plastic. In some embodiments, the bait board and parts may be attachable in a storage configuration that minimizes the profile or space consumed by the system.</p>

      <p id="p-00018-en" num="0018">
        <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a modular, reconfigurable bait board system, generally indicated at <b>10</b>, according to one embodiment of the invention. The bait board system <b>10</b> includes a bait board <b>12</b> and a number of parts that are configured to be attachable to the bait board <b>12</b> at the user's discretion and in a way determined by the user. Thus, in operation, the bait board <b>12</b> may have a number of different parts attached, and may have any number of configurations while in use.</p>
      <p id="p-00019-en" num="0019">To facilitate the modularity and configurability of the bait board system <b>10</b>, the bait board <b>12</b> has a number of attachment points. In the illustrated embodiments, these attachment points comprise the rear, raised wall <b>14</b> of the bait board <b>12</b> and the sidewalls and interior volumes of a number of compartments <b>16</b> that are provided along the sides of the bait board <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the bait board <b>12</b> has six compartments <b>16</b>, three compartments <b>16</b> on each side of the bait board <b>12</b>, although more or fewer compartments <b>16</b> may be present in other embodiments. These compartments <b>16</b> span the entire depth of the bait board, terminating in the rear contiguous with the rear wall <b>14</b> and in the front with the front edge <b>18</b> of the bait board <b>12</b>. Of course, the dimensions and proportions of the compartments <b>16</b> may be different in different embodiments.</p>
      <p id="p-00020-en" num="0020">Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the compartments <b>16</b> and rear wall <b>14</b> serve as attachment points. For that reason, the compartments <b>16</b> have uniform wall thickness and dimensions, such that parts may be interchangeably placed in any of the compartments <b>16</b>. The wall heights may differ from embodiment to embodiment, but a wall height of about 1.75 inches has been found to be suitable in at least some embodiments. As will be described below in more detail, the parts fit over the walls of the bait board <b>12</b> and compartments <b>16</b>, as well as in the compartments <b>16</b> themselves. Once placed, the parts remain on the bait board <b>12</b> because of tight and precisely-dimensioned fits between the parts and the compartments <b>16</b>, rear wall <b>14</b>, and various sidewalls. However, in other embodiments, other forms of securement may be used, including thumb screws, clips, and other conventional forms of attachment hardware.</p>
      <p id="p-00021-en" num="0021">In the view of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>, the bait board <b>12</b> is configured with a first scent board <b>20</b>. The first scent board <b>20</b> is attached to one side of the bait board <b>12</b> and includes four round compartments <b>22</b> sized to hold bottles of scent and a set of four slots sized to hold pliers and other tools. A second, identical scent board <b>20</b> is attached along the rear wall <b>14</b> of the bait board <b>12</b>. A depending set of flanges <b>26</b> allows the scent boards <b>20</b> to attach along the edges of the bait board <b>12</b>. The set of flanges <b>26</b> is discontinuous, allowing the individual flanges <b>26</b> to fit in the compartments <b>16</b> or to fit over the rear wall <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00022-en" num="0022">Another part shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref> is a knife sheath <b>28</b>, which is fitted over the rear wall <b>14</b> in the view of <figref>FIG. 1</figref>. The knife sheath <b>28</b> has two slits <b>30</b> in its top surface, each sized to accommodate a knife blade, such as a fillet knife blade. However, the sheath <b>28</b> does not have fully internal structure for housing a knife blade. Instead, the sheath essentially comprises the top surface that defines the slit <b>30</b> and a depending flange (not shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>) that allows it to attach to the wall <b>14</b>. When a knife blade is inserted into the slit <b>30</b>, the knife blade is wedged between the outer sidewall of the bait board <b>12</b> and the depending flange of the knife sheath <b>28</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00023-en" num="0023">Two other parts are shown in <figref>FIG. 1</figref>: a can holder <b>32</b>, and a leader dispenser <b>34</b>. The leader dispenser <b>34</b> comprises a rod <b>36</b>, which may be covered with rubber non-slip material, that is mounted for rotation on two h-shaped brackets <b>38</b> that fit over and are secured to the walls of the compartments <b>16</b> such that the leader dispenser <b>34</b> extends substantially the entire depth of the bait board <b>12</b>. Other leader dispensers may be different in length and other features, as will be described below in more detail.</p>
      <p id="p-00024-en" num="0024">
        <figref>FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the bait board system <b>10</b> in an alternate configuration and without gear or tools installed. In the view of <figref>FIG. 2</figref>, two scent boards <b>20</b>, two knife sheathes <b>28</b>, and a can holder <b>32</b> are installed on the bait board <b>12</b>. The two scent boards <b>20</b> are installed symmetrically on both sides of the board <b>12</b>, while the knife sheathes <b>28</b> and can holder <b>32</b> are installed along the rear wall <b>14</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00025-en" num="0025">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the bait board <b>12</b> in isolation, illustrating the compartments <b>16</b> and other features. As shown, between the sets of compartments <b>16</b>, the surface of the bait board <b>12</b> is generally flat in order to provide a work surface. In addition to the compartments <b>16</b> and the work surface that it provides, the bait board <b>12</b> may include any number of other built-in features. For example, as can be seen in <figref>FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the forward edge <b>18</b> of the bait board <b>12</b> includes a number of openings <b>40</b> that can be used to hang lures.</p>
      <p id="p-00026-en" num="0026">
        <figref>FIG. 3</figref> and the perspective view of <figref>FIG. 4</figref> also illustrate a number of parts in isolation, including a scent board <b>20</b>, a knife sheath <b>28</b>, one of the h-shaped brackets <b>38</b>, and two can holders <b>32</b>. <figref>FIG. 4</figref> also shows an alternative bracket <b>42</b> for a leader dispenser. The bracket <b>42</b> has a first vertical slot <b>44</b> at the top to accept one rod, and a second angled slot <b>46</b> extending inward from an edge. Thus, with the bracket <b>42</b>, a leader dispenser with two rotating rods may be installed on the bait board <b>20</b>. As shown, each of the parts <b>20</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> has a depending flange, like the flange <b>26</b> of the scent board <b>20</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00027-en" num="0027">
        <figref>FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> are perspective views illustrating the bait board system <b>10</b> in different configurations. In the view of <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, two can holders <b>32</b> are installed symmetrically, outboard, on either side of the bait board <b>12</b>. Additionally, a leader dispenser with two rotating rods <b>48</b> supported by a pair of brackets <b>42</b> spans the work surface of the bait board <b>12</b> and is attached to the rearward-most compartment <b>16</b> on each side. A knife sheath <b>28</b> is installed outboard in the rearward-most compartment <b>16</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00028-en" num="0028">In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, two knife sheathes <b>28</b> are installed along the rear wall <b>14</b>, a scent board <b>20</b> is installed on one side in two compartments <b>16</b> so that a portion of it extends behind the bait board <b>12</b>. A can holder <b>32</b> and leader dispenser <b>34</b> are installed on the other side. The positioning of the scent board <b>20</b> in <figref>FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a particular point of installing and arranging parts in the system <b>10</b>: the parts need not coincide perfectly with the board <b>12</b> and may extend beyond it in various directions in at least some embodiments. Additionally, the configurations shown in at least <figref>FIGS. 5-6</figref> illustrate another point: in some cases, a compartment <b>16</b> may simultaneously serve as an attachment point for more than one part. In <figref>FIG. 5</figref>, one compartment <b>16</b> serves as an attachment point for the leader dispenser bracket <b>42</b> and for the knife sheath <b>28</b>. In <figref>FIG. 6</figref>, one compartment <b>16</b> serves as an attachment point for a bracket <b>38</b> and a can holder <b>32</b>.</p>
      <p id="p-00029-en" num="0029">As can be appreciated from <figref>FIGS. 1-6</figref>, the bait board system <b>10</b> may be arranged in virtually any configuration that a user desires, using any parts that a user desires. In some embodiments, the bait board <b>12</b> may be sold in a kit with a defined set of parts. In other embodiments, the bait board <b>12</b> may be sold alone and the parts sold separately. In either case, additional parts may be sold separately.</p>
      <p id="p-00030-en" num="0030">In addition to operational configurations, the bait board system <b>10</b> may have non-operational configurations that can be used to store the components together. <figref>FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective view of the bait board system <b>10</b> in a non-operational storage configuration. In <figref>FIG. 7</figref>, two can holders <b>32</b>, a scent board <b>20</b>, a knife sheath <b>28</b> and the components of a leader dispenser <b>34</b> are present, but these components are arranged to fit within the area of the bait board <b>12</b>. That is, where certain components, like the can holders <b>32</b>, would normally be positioned outboard of the bait board <b>12</b>, they are instead positioned to extend inwardly.</p>
      <p id="p-00031-en" num="0031">Bait boards <b>12</b> themselves may be made to various dimensions, although it is advantageous if the compartments <b>16</b> or other features used as attachment points are made to standardized dimensions, so that parts will fit interchangeably on bait boards of different dimensions. As one example, a bait board may be made about 12 inches in depth and about 22, 24, 26, or 28 inches in length. While any dimensions may be used, it may be useful to keep one dimension the same so as to facilitate installation in a variety of boats and other settings.</p>
      <p id="p-00032-en" num="0032">The bait board system <b>10</b> is preferably made of a material that is easily cleaned and is resistant to weather and corrosion, although different parts may be made of different materials. In the illustrated embodiments, the bait board <b>12</b> and its parts are made of a food-grade high density polyethylene (HDPE). When made of a plastic, the parts of the bait board system <b>10</b> may be either molded or machined and assembled. In the illustrated embodiment, the components of the bait board system <b>10</b> are machined and assembled from sheet stock material with marine-grade stainless steel hardware, such as 316SS screws, used to reduce the possibility of corrosion.</p>
      <p id="p-00033-en" num="0033">The bait board system <b>10</b> may use any kind of mounting system to secure it to an appropriate location. In some cases, different versions of the bait board <b>12</b> may be made with different mounting hardware. In other cases, appropriate mounting hardware may simply be made attachable to the board.</p>
      <p id="p-00034-en" num="0034">While the invention has been described with respect to certain embodiments, the embodiments are intended to be illuminating, rather than limiting. Modifications and changes may be made within the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.</p>
